The best book I 've read this year is The Show That Smells by Derek McCormack .
Here 's an LA Times review
It 's published in the good old US of A by Little House on the Bowery , but personally , I think the Canadian edition is much nicer , if you 're into books as objects , too .
The cover is crazier , with those letters being a very bright , very appealing shiny pink .
It is printed by Coach House , so the paper 's thicker and nicer , and there 's great weird typographic stuff , where letters are sometimes red because they have blood on them .
Vampires and carnivals and sawdust and baby blood cotton candy .
How is your Monday going ?
The Congressionally - appointed panel overseeing the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) recommends running again the stress tests on US banks , as economic conditions have worsened , its chair , Harvard University professor Elizabeth Warren , told CNBC Tuesday .
" We actually make recommendations to do it all over again right now , " Warren told " Squawk Box . "
" We 've already blown past the worst - case scenario on unemployment , " she added .
Under the tests , whose results were released in May , the Obama administration asked federal regulators to examine how financial institutions would hold up under two different economic scenarios as well as how much new capital they would need to raise to shore up their balance sheets .

The tests concluded that ten banks — including some of the biggest , such as Citigroup , Bank of America and Wells Fargo — would need to raise almost $ 75 billion in capital ; the firms were also required to present plans on how to do so by June 8 .
The government is prepared to loan money to those companies that are unable to raise capital from private sources .
The SwissMiniGun is officially the smallest gun in the world .
Look at the picture on the right and it appears to be just a regular revolver , apart from the “ oversized ” trigger sticking out the bottom .
One glance at the picture on the left , though , shows that it could easily be used as a key fob .
But do n’t go hooking this up to your keys , at least not while it ’s loaded : Somebody is bound to grab it and squeeze the trigger .
If that happens , you ’ll be picking 2.34 mm caliber bullets out of your body for weeks .
The tiny gun is , of course , made in Switzerland and measures just 5.5 cm ( 2.2 inches ) long .
The bullets , which are rim firing , are so small that they really wo n’t do too much damage .
In fact , the makers want to be very clear about this :
We would like to take this opportunity to inform journalists who are interested in writing articles about our product that the power of most airguns or BB guns , which are in many countries freely on sale , can exceed over 10 times the power of our ammunition .
We do not wish to find on the web the same kind of nonsense article we have found lately .
Still , it would certainly sting , and could probably take your eye out .
The gun costs a rather hefty 6,500 Swiss Francs , or just shy of $ 6,000 .
There is also a gold edition which can go for up to $ 50,000 , but you ’ll have to travel to Switzerland to buy one :
While it is exported to some markets , the gun is actually too small for the US , and “ does not meet with the minimum size prerequisites ” .

A supernova occurs when a massive star more than 50 times the mass of the Sun dies in a powerful bright explosion
Two dying stars at the edge of the universe and further away than any detected to date have been discovered using a new imaging technique .
Light from the exploding stars , or supernovae , began its journey to Earth 11 billion years ago , not long after the “ Big Bang ” that created the cosmos .
The next furthest large supernova known is six billion light years away .
A supernova occurs when a massive star more than 50 times the mass of the Sun dies in a powerful bright explosion .
Normally scientists find supernovae by comparing pictures taken at different times of the same patch of sky and looking for changes .
A new light could indicate one of the explosions .
The new technique involves blending together pictures taken over the course of a year , and comparing them with image compilations from other years .
Dr Jeff Cooke , from the University of California at Irvine , said : “ If you stack all of those images into one big pile , then you can reach deeper and see fainter objects .
It ’s like in photography when you open the shutter for a long time .
You ’ll collect more light with a longer exposure . ”
Dr Cook found four supernovae , including the two distant objects , after analysing images from the Canada - France - Hawaii Telescope in Hawaii .
He said : “ The universe is about 13.7 billion years old , so really we are seeing some of the first stars ever formed . ”
Dr Cook and other scientists last year discovered an early - stage cluster of galaxies 11.4 billion light years away , the most distant ever detected .
The new research is reported in the journal Nature .

I 've been remiss in posting this here - the Strawberry Perl beta has been updated for about 4 days now - but it's time to announce that the last beta for Strawberry Perl is now available .
I 've gotten permission from Adam Kennedy to move the download page onto the Strawberry Perl site at http://strawberryperl.com/beta/ , so July 2009 Beta 3 can be downloaded there .
Support information is still at my personal site
In addition to the improvements described on the download and support pages , I also changed the images used in the installer to higher - color images , so that people with better monitors and graphics cards are n't restricted to what I could put into 256 colors .
Along with that , I 've updated Perl : : Dist : : Padre to use the same build process as the Strawberry betas ( I 'll put a dev release of the module on CPAN soon ) , and released a first beta of a Windows Installer version of Padre Standalone .
This distribution includes the modules updated from July 2009 Beta 3 , the modules the Padre editor relies on , and the Padre editor itself .
It does not include any plugins at the moment , but those should be easy to install , as it is based on Strawberry Perl , and has the same capability to use CPAN and CPANPLUS .
It still looks like Strawberry ( in fact , it installs in c:\strawberry , so please do NOT install this on top of Strawberry at the moment , or the other way around ) and it does not have any additional links for Padre at the moment .
It is at http://perlide.org/download/binary/padre-standalone-5.10.0.1-beta-1.msi
Support for the DISTRIBUTION is under the same rules as the Strawberry Perl betas .
Support for Padre is through the normal channels for the editor .
Please recognize that scanning and OCRing and conversion to HTML is an imperfect art , and differences from the original must be considered to be present .
CYCLE BABBAGE
TIMING SETTING LOCK POSITION and LEVER FUNCTIONS FIRST 0 From front of Engine lift small lever at cam stack to disengage drive to sector bars .
Also lift the two larger levers ( sector lift levers ) to lift the sectors out of mesh from the figure wheels .
All setting locks should be disengaged .
.
10 Engage ODD setting locks .
Odd axels at zero .
35 Engage EVEN setting 1ocks .
Even axels at zero SECOND 20 Disengage ODD setting locks .
Set required numbers on to ODD figure wheel columns .
Re-engage ODD setting locks .
.
45 Disengage EVEN setting locks .
Set required numbers on to EVEN figure wheel columns .
Re-engage EVEN setting locks . .
0 Release sector lift levers and re-engage the sector drive .
Disengage all setting locks .
The Engine is now set up to calculate .
Note :
All axels must ???
zero at the completion of the first cycle - if not the Engine will jam during the second cycle .
The Engine is now ready to perform a calculation .
The numbers to be set on the figure wheels are the coefficients of the differences of the polynomial equation to be calculated .
Viewing the Engine from the front , all eight columns of figure wheels are displayed .
From left to right the axes are EVEN , ODD , EVEN , ODD , etc .
The result is read on the first column from the left each time the chapter disc is at zero .
The result is to thirty ( 30 ) significant figures , reading units , tens , hundreds , etc as you read up the axis .
The number of axes used to calculate the results are one more than the level of the equation , eg x4 requires five axes , the first being the left column .
The second from the left is the first difference , the third is the second difference and so on .
To set the numbers on the figure wheels during the setting procedure , you turn each wheel by hand in either direction , setting the number required under the arrow .
At the setting , to set odd or to set even , the warning axes are rotated away from the figure wheels .
When the wheel is turned by hand through 9 to 0 no warning is set up .
When calculations are being carried out on the Engine , each turn of the chapter disc past zero is the completion of one calculation .
The next turn Increments the value of x
In the equation being solved .
If the Operator stopped turning the handle when the chapter disc reached zero , he could come to the front of the Engine and read the result on the first column .
Babbage intended the Operator not to stop turning the handle but to continue turning until a successsion of calculations had been completed .
The results , in theory , should be automatically printed out in table form and only when a page of tables is completed should the Operator stop .
The Engine will automatically cut out the drive to the handle when the end of a page is reached .
The Operator can then change the printing tray and re-set the drive to continue with the calculations .
The carry levers can be set in the inoperative position if not required .
This is done at two different parts of the cycle .
At zero on the Chapter disc , the even carry levers can be set to their inoperative position .
At 25 on the Chapter disc the odd carry levers can be set .
To move the carry levers at these settings , use a large screwdriver and slacken the three ?
fixing ?
screws that fix the detect reset st ??? to the figure wheel supports ( of axels to be adjusted ) , Do not remove the screws .
These fixing ??? in slots .
Lever up the detect reset stops so that the screw fitings now sit at the bottom end of the slots .
The carry lever can now be rotated to the inoperative position so that the detect locates into the fourth notch .
When all habe been set into inoperative position the detent reset stops can then be lowered , carefully checking that all carry levers are behind the stops .
Once the detent ???
stops have been fully lowered , the three fixing screws can then be secured .
When the Engine is next cycled , those carry levers in the inoperative position will not function even if a figure wheel passes from 9 to 0 .
The lever on the back of the carry lever is now clear of the rib ?a?
the figure wheel .
Once the carry levers have been returned back to their operational position , the engine must be cycled one revolution of the Chapter disc before setting [ text ran off the Xeroxed sheet ]
4. Speed of Operation Steady turning of the handle is required at a speed of approximately 8 to 10 calculations per minute ( or 30 to 40 revolutions of the handle per minute ) .
Slower or faster speeds will result in the Engine jamming .
The twin tooth drive at the rear of the phasing gear strikes the impact tooth at the rear of the register pinion , before the phasing gear meshes with the register pinion .
The twin tooth and impact tooth are made of high grade steel ( EN 16 ) .
This engagement is to absorb the shock load of engagement that takes place as the gear and pinion are of cast iron .
If the speed of operation is increased to more than 10 calculations per minute , the register pinion overruns and the teeth mesh jams during the next cycle .
With slower or erratic turning of the handle , the sectors fail to mesh with the figure wheels correctly , due to insufficient momentum for engagement .
The sector wheel teeth sit on top of the figure wheel teeth ( See Trouble Shooting for how to clear jams ) .
5 . Lubrication of Engine The Engine should be oiled and greased on a regular basis .
If the Engine is being demonstrated on a daily basis , lt should be oiled and greased at least once a week .
If no demonstrations are taking place , then the Engine should be oiled and greased on a monthly basis , but the handle should be turned at least twice a week to cycle the mechanisms .
Grease : " Alvania " grease or it 's equivalent should be used .
Grease all vertical motion cam profiles only and their levers .
all bevel gears above and below the cam stack .
all bevel gears on the carry axes and those on the carry drive shaft .
the phasing gear , register pinion , " Impact tooth and the tw - in tooth drive .
the pawl wheel and crank pinion .
Oil : " Nevis 7 " oil or it 's equivalent should be used .
This is a non-staining oil .
Oil top of shaft positions on figure wheels , sectors , warnings and carries .
Fill counterbores on all eight axes .
middle shaft positions on figure wheels , sectors , warnings and carries .
Fill counterbores on all eight axes .
top lock and zero stop slide positions on all eight axes .
middle zero stop slide positions on all eight axes .
bottom lock slide positions
In frame on all eight axes .
yoke positions on zero stops , top and bottom , on all eight axes .
all the bottom sets of levers , at oil holes , joints connections to lever bars and at yoke connections to axes shafts .
bottom bearing bars at shaft entry at eight positions .
link joints at bottom of each figure wheel lock .
vertical motion bars in bearing slide plates .
counterbalance springs and mechanisms for figure wheel locks .
cam lever engagements into lever bars at bottom of cam stack .
circular motion cam followers on cam stack .
print shaft bearings in four positions .

top cam bevel at screw position .
top bearing mounts on top of cam stack .
cross shaft on top of cam stack , one screw position .
carry axis drive shaft bearing blocks , two positions .
sector engage / disengage handle spindles at front of Engine .
all rack slides for all axes , including four oil holes in top warning casting .
all con rod pivot pin joints .
teeth mesh between sectors and figure wheel on all eight axes .
the wipe faces of the carry levers and their detents on all seven axes .
Empty drip trays as and when required .
To empty drip trays remove the end sections of the wooden plinth .
Unclip the strip which holds the two trays together .
Slide each tray out , empty and then return .
Re-clip the trays and replace the wooden end sections .
6 . Trouble Shooting a ) Engine Jamming b) Calculation Errors c ) Removal of Axes a ) Engine Jamming 1 ) Jamming of the phasing gear to the register pinion on the carry drive .
This is due to erratic turning of the handle or turning the handle too fast , giving rise to an over - run of the register pinion .
This prevents the phasing gear from meshing at the next commencement of the intermittent drive cycle .
To clear the jam a large screwdriver is required to rotate the register pinion anti-clockwise , thus releasing the jam .
The Engine will continue with no loss of calculation numbers or error induction .
Jamming due to the figure wheel locks striking the tops of the figure wheel teeth
OR the sectors failing to mesh with the figure wheels
This is due to erratic turning of the handle or turning the handle too slowly .
Either the lock jams by striking the figure wheel teeth which has failed to fully rotate or the sectors have rested on the top of the figure wheel teeth due to one or the other failing to fully rotate .
The error in rotation is only one to two degrees and is generally due to the lack of momentum to complete the rotation and engage .
To clear the Jam establish which reason has caused the problem .
To check the figure wheel locks , try lifting them at the bottom link .
If they are free there will be a small amount of movement .
If one has jammed it will feel solid .
To clear the jam , remove the shoulder screw and washer at the bottom of the lock and lift the lock up .
Check the columns of figure wheels to see which one has been slightly displaced .
Turn the displaced wheel to align the number to the arrow .
Do not over - rotate the wheel otherwise the wrong number will be set up and an error created in the calculation .
Lower the lock and check that it now engages into the figure wheel teeth .
Re-connect the shoulder screw and washer .
Re-check all the figure wheel locks again before attempting to turn the handle .
To check the sector / figure wheel mesh , try pulling down each column of sectors .
If they are free there will be some movement .
If one has jammed it will be solid .
To clear the jam , move each sector on the column until you find ' the one that is solid due to resting on the figure wheel .
Using a large screwdriver , lever up the column of sectors enough to take the load and free the sector / wheel mesh .
Release the column of sectors and pull down on the top to check there is now movement .
Repeat the procedure if still solid , as there may be more than one sector involved .
Re-check all the other sector columns .
With care the jam can be cleared without interrupting the calculation cycle and the calculation continued without errors .
Jamming due to sectors catching the sector zero stop Carry out the same procedure as ( 11 ) except you are now looking at the sector / zero stop relationship .
If this jam can not be cleared you may have to remove the sector zero stop to free the jam and then return the stop back to it 's original position .
To remove the sector zero stop , remove the two screws on the top bearing plate and the two screws in the bottom bearing plate that holds the stop .
Again there should be no interruption of the calculation cycle .
b)
Calculation Errors Errors
In calculation are either due to the Operator setting the wrong coefficients on to the figure wheels ( see Section 3 ) or a carry lever that has failed to operate correctly .
When the Engine is moved to a new site it is suggested that the calculation of y = x ' from x = - 80 to x = +80 be carried out to check the accuracy of operation .
If the Engine is being used on a regular basis this check should be carried out at the start of every week .
If there is an error in the calculation then the Engine should be set up to carry out two sets of calculations simultaneously .
Calculate y = x from x = - 80 to +80 as before .
With x = - 80 or +80 the result has only fourteen significant figures .
Therefore the two calculations can be set one above the other , y = x ' across the axes using wheels 1 to 14 , y = x using wheels 15 to 28 and setting the counter on wheels 29 to 31 .
The results can be compared and checked to see if they are correct after each calculation .
If one answer is wrong , then the coefficients at that setting can be compared with those of the other equation .
By this means you can identify which carry has failed to function .
That carry lever can then be adjusted using the tool provided and the operation repeated .
This procedure is repeated until the full set of calculations has been carried out without error .
( N.B . Care must be taken not to overstress the carry levers when adjusting otherwise the solder joint of the lever will break . )
c)
Removal of Axes
It may be necessary , from time to time , to remove an axis so that adjustments can be made or damaged parts replaced .
The initial procedure is common to all four axes , warning , figure wheel , sector and carry .
Ladders , small and large screwdrivers , alien key , rule , file , hammer and a small pin punch will be required .
Protect the wooden plinth with board before placing ladders on it 's surface .
Set the Engine at " 0 " for even axes and " 25 " for odd axes .
Remove the three top collars of the axes of the difference being attended to .
Remove springs and cups .
Undo and remove all the fixing screws for the bearing plate , large screws which fix it to the main frame , medium screws which hold the figure wheel supports , small screws which hold sector zero stop and the figure wheel lock slide block .
The phosphor bronze components can remain attached to the bearing plate .
Lift and remove the bearing plate .
Carry Axes :
To remove the carry axis , unscrew the bottom bevel screw and lift the axis out from the middle bearing plate .
In removing the axis , the bottom bevel , key and spacer will be released .
To repair any carry arms , they can be removed from either end of the axis .
Release the top or bottom collar by removing the taper pin and then slide off the carry arm until the one that requires attention is removed .
The carry arms must be returned in exactly the reverse order and the carry axis returned to the Engine in exactly the same position .
Check the pitch position by comparing it with the other axes .
Warning Axes :
To remove the warning axis you must first remove the carry axis .
Remove the carry reset arm .
Move all the carry levers into the fourth notch position , ie the inoperative position .
Release the bottom bobbin and release the bottom carry lock .
The axis can now be lifted up unitil it is clear of the middle bearing plate .
In removing the axis , the bobbin , two sleeves and the quadrant will be released .
Leave these in position .
Remove the top two collars on the main axis and secondary spindle .
Rotate the top carry lever until
It is free to lift off .
Remove carry lever .
Remove spring housing , spring and detent lever .
Remove detent support arm .
Keep all in one set .
This procedure should be repeated for each carry lever until the faulty one has been reached .
Return all the carry lever assemblies by the reverse procedure .
Return the axis back to the Engine , ensuring that the quadrant is correctly meshed with it 's rack .
Return the carry axis , bearing plate , etc .
Each carry lever must then be checked in turn against the operation of It 's four nibs .
Any removal of the warning axis must result " in the re-checking of all carry levers on that axis .
Two people are required to carry out this test .
Disconnect the figure wheel lock and raise it on to packers .
The figure wheels are now clear of the lock .
One person on the front of the Engine will rotate the figure wheel from 9 to 0 four times , thus checking all four nibs .
The second person at the rear of the Engine will check that the carry lever warns for each nib , resetting between each operation .
Any that fail to warn correctly should be adjusted using the tool provided .
Once the axis is correct , a calculation check should be carried out .
Figure Wheel Axes :
The shaft on the figure wheel axis does not have to be removed .
To gain access to the figure wheels one must first remove the carry and warning axes as described in the previous paragraphs .
Remove the sector zero stop and rotate all sectors 180 degrees .
Remove the figure wheel lock by releasing the bottom shoulder screw and lifting the lock out of the Engine .
Remove one screw top and bottom of each figure wheel support and twist the figure wheel support until all the figure wheels have been released .
Remove the top collar on the figure wheel shaft .
Remove the figure wheel zero arm and then the figure wheel .
Continue this process until you reach the required figure wheel .
Keep all the zero arms and wheels in their pairs .
Once the required maintenance is completed re-assemble the axis .
Return all other axes , figure wheel lock , zero stop , etc .
Once the Engine has been fully assembled , the carry levers must be re-checked as described under warning axes , to ensure that each carry is activated by it 's nibs .
Sector Axes :
As before , the top bearing plate has to be removed .
Remove the figure wheel lock .
Similar to the figure wheel axis the shaft does not have to be removed , neither does the figure wheel axis , warning axis or carry axis .
Remove the sector zero stop .
Remove the top collar on the sector shaft and then remove the sector zero arms and sectors , similar to the process adopted for the figure wheels .
Keep all the zero arms and sectors in pairs .
Once the required maintenance is completed , re-assemble the axis .
Return all the other components to the Engine .
Once fully assembled acalculation should be carried out on the Engine to ensure correct working .
Follow the procedures for checking carries if the calculation results are incorrect .
It is not necessary to check the carries in the first instant as these have not been disturbed .
7 . Spares A number of components should be held as spares to replace parts that have broken , worn or lost when arrangements are dismantled from the Engine .
Detailed below is a suggested list of parts , time will determine if other parts should be added to the list .

The philosopher Thomas Kuhn once described science as " a series of peaceful interludes punctuated by intellectually violent revolutions . "
To Kuhn , scientific progress was never a gradual accumulation of knowledge , but an endlessly repeating battle between established theories , such as Newtonian gravity , and younger upstarts , such as Einstein ’s general relativity .
Kuhn ’s influence has been profound — and it ’s left some wondering whether physicists will ever find the much sought after , or whether every theory we create will inevitably be overthrown by a deeper more fundamental theory .
Now , Caslav Brukner at the University of Vienna in Austria is asking precisely this question about quantum mechanics .
The theory stands as our most accurate description of nature and is fundamental to our understanding of chemistry , the development of modern technology , and our insight into the origins of our universe .
Given its enormous success , have we already found our ultimate theory , without realizing ?
The germ of Brukner ’s obsession with quantum theory goes back to his childhood .
Born in Novi Sad , Serbia , in 1967 , the young Brukner was always more interested in asking " why ? " rather than " how ? " .
He recalls being more excited about pondering the nature of time and what makes a watch tick , rather than taking it apart and putting it back together again .
When his brother gave him a copy ofby Vladimir Paar for his thirteenth birthday , there was no turning back .
" Over the years , I have learned that quantum physics is weird and eludes every attempt to be understood within a classical picture , " says Brukner .
" It is this weirdness that keeps my curiosity alive — like that of a child — and searching for answers to nature ’s puzzles .
" Brukner is now searching for those answers with the help of a $ 69,600 grant from the Foundational Questions Institute .
At the heart of his research is the question of whether quantum physics provides the ultimate description of reality or whether there are other more fundamental theories lying in wait .
Although quantum physics is extremely successful , some are troubled by its inherent randomness , which prevents us from predicting the behavior of quantum objects with certainty .
According to standard interpretations , quantum objects do not have well - defined properties , until those properties are measured by an observer .
Prior to observation , the particle exists in aof many mutually exclusive states .
Some physicists find this quantum weirdness hard to stomach and hope to retrieve a classical concept of realism in which properties of the world about us exist regardless of whether or not we observe them .
Einstein famously believed that particles contain extra properties , or hidden variables , that serve as blueprints , determining the particles ’ behavior completely .
If we knew what these hidden variables were , we could predict the fate of particles with certainty .
But , asks Brukner , just how plausible is this concept of realism ?
Brukner began to examine the features of quantum mechanics when he moved to Austria to pursue a Ph.D. at the Vienna University of Technology with Anton Zeilinger .
Together , they realized that many weird quantum features could be explained by thinking about the information contained in a quantum system , just as computer scientists look at how information is encoded , stored , and transferred in bits .
According to their approach to quantum mechanics , the most elementary quantum system , the qubit , carries one bit of information .
Information theory , says Brukner , is the key to showing how plausible ( or indeed implausible ) it is that a deeper classical reality underlies quantum mechanics .
It reveals that even within the simplest quantum system — an electron spin— classical realism is extremely resource demanding .
That ’s because it would take infinitely many hidden variables to encode all the instructions needed to explain the results of all possible measurements of the electron ’s spin .
Brukner argues that the total information that can be carried by an electron spin is finite .
That means , by necessity , the system ’s answers to some questions will contain an element of randomness .
Thus , Brukner and Zeilinger realized that the observed quantum behavior could be explained by nothing more mysterious than a lack of storage space for sufficient information .
Information theory can also be easily extended to naturally explain quantum entanglement — or " spooky action at a distance , " as it was dubbed by Einstein .
Entangled particles are inextricably intertwined , so that measuring one of them immediately changes the state of the other .
This strange phenomenon has been confirmed many times in the lab , in quantum optics experiments ( pictured above , right ) .
Brukner and Zeilinger have analyzed how information can be stored in an entangled system .
For example , it would take two bits of information to jointly encode entanglement into two particle spins , so that they are parallel to each other .
Once those two bits have been exhausted , there is no more storage space to encode extra spin information into either of the two entangled particles individually , says Brukner .
As a result of this lack of extra encoded information , measuring the spin of one of the pair must yield a random value , while the spin of its partner will be immediately fixed , regardless of distance .
Brukner ’s work suggests that weird quantum properties such as superposition and randomness are here to stay — any theory that tries to get rid of them will fail to overcome this information limit .
So , does that mean that quantum theory is the final theory ?
Should we now stop hunting for anything deeper ?
Not necessarily .
" One of the most exciting questions for physicists is : what is our next theory ? " says Brukner .
" The entire history of science has taught us accepted scientific theories are superseded by new ones , of which the old are special cases .
It is therefore hard to believe that quantum theory is our final theory .
" Although most proposed alternatives to standard quantum mechanics have steadily fallen by the wayside , Brukner believes that this is because they all tried — mathematically and conceptually — to save some part of the pre-quantum concepts of classical physics .
Brukner , however , wants to study alternatives that preserve the seemingly bizarre properties of quantum mechanics .
" I want to investigate those theories , which , like quantum theory , are intrinsically probabilistic , allow superposition and entanglement , but may still differ

The coach praised his side after they came back from the dead to lift the Confederations Cup for a third time .
Carlos Dunga , the coach of Brazil , believes the attitude of his players was the main reason why they came from two goals down in the first half to defeat the United States 3 - 2 in the final of the Confederations Cup .
" First of all , we have a very determined side .
The players have heaps of quality .
They are great players .
For 29 days they have n't seen their families .
Today it was tough , because we could have played even better .
But we have total confidence in this group , " said Dunga .
The 1994 World Cup winner believes one of the reasons why Brazil started slowly against the United States was because his players were worn out , not only because of the demands of the tournament and the World Cup qualifiers , but also because of long European seasons , for most part of the players .
" Like all finals , it was tough .
To get a result after going behind 2 - 0 , shows the kind of players we count with .
" Brazil were two goals down going into the half time interval , but two goals from Luis Fabiano and another from captain Lucio gave them a dramatic victory .
" We changed the positioning .
We made the team push more forward to pressure our opponents .
We scored an early goal and then we had more speed with the substitutions we made , " explained Dunga , who brought on Elano and Daniel Alves for Ramires and Andre Santos .

Sania Mirza is ranked 85 in world women 's tennis
A young Indian man turned up at the home of tennis star Sania Mirza and threatened to kill himself if the tennis player did not marry him .
Mohammad Ashraf told Imran Mirza , Sania 's father , that the tennis star could not marry anyone else as she " was born for me " .
He also demanded that her engagement with family friend Sohrab Mirza , scheduled for Friday , be cancelled .
An alarmed Imran Mirza called the police who have taken him into custody .
He has been produced in court and remanded for a fortnight .
Mirza , 22 , is one of the top ranking players .
She ranks 85 in the world .
' Threatening '
In his complaint to the police , Mr Mirza says Mr Ashraf claims to have been in love with the tennis star ever since he saw her playing a match in Bangalore two years ago .
Mr Mirza has also complained that the youth had been sending text messages and making threatening calls to his daughter for some time .
Mr Ashraf arrived at Ms Mirza 's home in Hyderabad city 's upmarket home in Banjara Hills area on Tuesday evening accompanied by his friend Devadeesh Mohanty .
Mr Ashraf is a civil engineer from Bangalore
" How can you engage Sania to another person when she was born for me ? "
Mr Ashraf is reported to have asked the tennis player 's father .
" He was threatening to commit suicide if Sania did not marry him , " Mr Mirza told the police .
The two men have been arrested and have been charged with trespass and creating a nuisance .
Mr Ashraf has been identified as a civil engineer from Bangalore .
Hyderabad police say they have contacted their counterparts in Bangalore to find out whether Mr Ashraf is mentally sound .
It is the second time in less than a month that Mirza has hit the headlines for the wrong reason .
Last month , the Andhra Pradesh state government found that a man had secured a white ration card showing Sania Mirza as his wife .
The ration card carried photos of the tennis star .
White ration cards are meant for people living below the poverty line .
After nearly twenty years in Washington I thought I 've seen every trick ever conceived , but the White House claims of " jobs saved " attributed to the stimulus bill is unrivaled .
What causes the jaw to drop is not just the breathtaking deception of the claim , but the gullibility of the Washington press corps to continue reporting it .
News stories from President Obama 's event last week hailing the 100 - day mark since the stimulus was passed typically repeated the assertion that the stimulus has already " created or saved 150,00 jobs . "
( " And that 's just the beginning , " the President crowed . )
Here 's an important note to my friends in the news media : the White House has absolutely no earthly clue how many job losses have been prevented because of the stimulus bill .
None .
Not Christina Romer .
Not Jared Bernstein .
Not Austen Goolsbee .
Each of these distinguished economists would have failed Statistics 101 for making such a laughable claim .
But we see them now repeating these assertions to reporters who have seemingly abandoned all skepticism .
Forget that only a trickle of stimulus spending has yet made its way into the real economy .
Set aside your views on whether or not the stimulus has any job - saving or - creating impact .
And leave for another day the White House 's failing to account for changing macroeconomic conditions and seasonal adjustments .
There is only one necessary data point to make the " jobs - saved " claim : an accurate measure of expected employment levels in the future .
That baseline data is critical to measure what the employment level would be in the absence of the stimulus .
Unfortunately for the White House , they cannot possibly know that measurement within any degree of confidence -- and they know it .
To understand just how unknowable this data point is , it 's not necessary to be an economist , a mathematician or a statistician .
You only need to know this : the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) - thousands of the most professional and rigorous counters and analyzers of labor data in the history of mankind - makes TWO revisions of employment data for their ESTIMATE of the PREVIOUS month !
And even then the reports are mere estimates - an annual benchmark survey is required to reset the nation 's payroll baseline .
That is , the best employment statisticians the world has ever known , people whose lives are dedicated to employment data , conducting labor surveys and research , constantly refining their complex models , have a difficult time telling you how many jobs were created in the PAST !
In fact , monthly BLS revisions of past job creation estimates are routinely off by tens of thousands of jobs , and on occasion by more than a hundred thousand jobs .
The annual benchmark surveys always reset employment levels by hundreds of thousands of jobs .
And we 're supposed to believe that the Council of Economic advisors have acquired the clairvoyant ability to estimate payrolls in the future ?
Please .
Romer , Goolsbee and Bernstein are smart people , and yet they have n't learned from even their recent misadventures with payroll data projections -- having already experienced the folly of attempting to project the range of possible jobs levels if the stimulus were passed .
Projecting job creation with any degree of accuracy was always inherantly impossible , and should never have been taken seriously .
If I -- or even my predecessors in the Clinton Administration -- had tried to pull off this ridiculous gimmick we would have been run out of town .
I do n't even believe it 's possible to look back and accurately measure the " job - saving " impact of Bush or Clinton Administration policies , let alone to measure in real time , or project into the future .
On Friday the BLS will release its estimate of May job losses .
They will also report their revisions for March and April .
And White House officials will once again gear up the spin machine on how many jobs have been " saved " .
A self - respecting press corps would vigorously question the White House on their claims .
We 'll see if we have one .

CBO Scores Confirms Deficit Neutrality of Health Reform Bill
Washington , D.C. --
The Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) released estimates this evening confirming for the first time that H.R. 3200 , America ’s Affordable Health Choices Act , is deficit neutral over the 10 - year budget window – and even produces a $ 6 billion surplus .
CBO estimated more than $ 550 billion in gross Medicare and Medicaid savings .
More importantly , the bill includes a comprehensive array of delivery reforms to set the stage for lowering the future growth in health care costs .
Net Medicare and Medicaid savings of $ 465 billion , coupled with the $ 583 billion revenue package reported today by the House Committee on Ways and Means , fully finance the previously estimated $ 1.042 trillion cost of reform , which will provide affordable health care coverage for 97 % of Americans .
" This fulfills the strong commitment of the President and House leadership to enact health reform on a deficit - neutral basis , " said Chairman Henry A. Waxman , Chairman Charles B. Rangel , and Chairman George Miller .
" The reforms included in this legislation will help control health care costs and expand access to quality , affordable coverage to all Americans in a fiscally - responsible manner . "
The estimates also cover important reinvestments in Medicare and Medicaid , including phasing in the closing of the " donut " hole in the Medicare drug benefit .
The bill ’s long - term reform of Medicare ’s physician fee schedule to eliminate the potential 21 percent cut in fees , and put payments on a sustainable basis for the future , will cost about $ 245 billion .
Those costs , however , are not included in the net calculations above , as they will be absorbed under the upcoming statutory " pay go " legislation that is pending in the House .

We don ‚Äôt need to declare the year of the Linux desktop anymore .
This week alone was pretty darn good .
Having spent the week at Computex , the place where you see all the things that people are going to find in Bestbuy and Amazon 6 months from now , it is clear that Linux has a critical role in client computing .
Here is a shortlist of this weeks developments .
Moblin Breaks Out
Acer announced it will support Moblin across all its product lines .
Asus showed some new prototypes at the Moblin executive summit .
Canonical , Linpus , Novell , Red Flag , and Xandros all announced they will deliver Moblin versions of their distributions .
We even saw several Android applications installed on a netbook running Moblin 2.0 in a speech from Intel on Thursday making it clear that it isn
‚Äôt necessarily and either or game between the two platforms .
Smartbook or Netbook ; Common Denominator is Linux
Qualcom has dubbed the term ‚ ÄúSmartbook ‚Äù which is defined as combining features of a smartphone and a netbook .
It is unclear if this category will stick but there is one thing that both netbooks and smartbooks have in common ; Linux .
Moblin , Android , and desktop Linux were in all of the preview devices on display behind the scenes and on the show floor at Computex .
‚ ÄúInstant on ‚Äùruns on Linux
As I predicted last year , Linux is shipping with a huge number of the PC ‚ Äôs at Computex thanks to a flurry of activity in the ‚ Äúfast boot ‚Äù segment .
On display this year were Fastboot from bios giant Phoenix , Splashtop from DeviceVM , and Presto from Xandros .
Clearly consumers are sick of waiting for Windows to boot and with sub five second boot times from each of these vendors using Linux you can access your e-mail or web browser in seconds .
Dell Introduces a Full Linux Notebook for $ 299.00
Dell introduced the Inspiron N notebook computer this week for $ 299.00 .
This is a full fledged notebook computer with a 15 inch screen , a dvd burner , 160 gig hard drive and more for $ 299.00 .
This is breakthrough pricing in a market that can ‚Äôt be re categorized by Microsoft as a ‚ Äúlow - cost small notebook PC‚Ä ù
It is hard to see how Microsoft can maintain their usual margins which would represent 1/3 of the cost of this PC .
Linux ‚Äôs fundamental pricing advantage here could not be more compelling .
Better Audio and Video Support
RealNetworks
Inc announced it is licensing its RealPlayer for Linux on x86 and ARM - based netbooks , as well as the three ‚ Äúinstant - on ‚ Äù products mentioned above .
Real is joining Fluendo who is already partnering with Ubuntu to offer multimedia support for Linux on Dell products .
Palm ‚ ÄúPre‚Äù makes a spash with a Linux based Smartphone
Palm started selling its ambitious new smartphone product this week to strong reviews .
Palm has bet the company on the Pre and it shows .
The device has tremendous potential with slick industrial design and a solid Linux based software platform .
Intel Buys Wind River
Finally , Intel surprised everyone this week by purchasing Linux and embedded systems giant Wind River .
If anyone questioned Intel ‚ Äôs commitment to Linux and to expanding in the embedded and mobile market this certainly made it clear that Intel is going all in .
This acquisition , which is Intel ‚Äôs first major M&A activity since 2001 , is certain to help all of their efforts in this arena from the Moblin project they are working on with us here at the Linux Foundation to better software enablement of future products in this space .
After this week I think the term ‚ Äúyear of the desktop ‚Äù is becoming obsolete .
Heck , after this week of the Linux desktop if there wasn
‚
Äôt so much going on I might even take next week off .
COLUMBIA , South Carolina ( CNN ) -- South Carolina Republican Party Chairwoman Karen Floyd seemed to suggest Wednesday that the time had come for GOP Gov. Mark Sanford to consider resigning from office .
Gov. Mark Sanford has said it 's better for him to keep his governorship to " learn lessons . "
" For the past two days , I have been speaking with Republican leaders across South Carolina , " she said in a statement .
" There is clearly a growing view that the time may have come for Governor Sanford to remove himself and his family from the limelight , so that he can devote his efforts full - time to repairing the damage in his personal life . "
The statement comes on the same day as a growing number of GOP state senators called for Sanford to step down .
CNN has learned that GOP Sens .
Daniel Verdin , Shane Martin , Ronnie Cromer and Wes Hayes joined the anti-Sanford chorus Wednesday morning , bringing the total number of Republican senators calling for the governor 's resignation to 13 .
There are 27 Republicans in the state Senate .
Another state senator stopped just short of calling for Sanford to step down Wednesday .
Glenn McConnell , Senate president pro tempore , did n't explicitly ask Sanford to resign , but he did ask him " to do the right thing for himself , his family and our state . "
Sanford and his staff have said repeatedly this week that he will not resign .
He wrote in a message to his political action committee e-mail list Monday that while he considered resigning , " I would ultimately be a better person and of more service in whatever doors
God opened next in life if I stuck around to learn lessons rather than running and hiding down at the farm . "
After returning last week from a secret trip to Argentina that his staff and wife did n't know about , Sanford admitted to an extramarital affair with a woman identified as Maria Belen Chapur .
Sanford also told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he's " crossed lines " with other women , although Chapur was the only one he had sex with .
Watch a report on Sanford 's situation »
Sanford 's support among legislators and grassroots leaders in the state eroded considerably Tuesday after Sanford told The Associated Press he had met with his mistress more times than he had previously disclosed .
He also admitted to dalliances with other women .
At least four county GOP chairmen have also called for Sanford to go .
Glenn McCall , the York County Republican Party chairman who has been leading a grassroots effort against the governor , said Wednesday that he and other conservative activists are postponing a rally at the State House next week because legislators are starting to come out strongly against Sanford .
The rally had been scheduled to pressure Senate and House leaders to call for Sanford 's resignation and start an investigation into his activities .
But now that officials are publicly coming out against the governor and Attorney General Henry McMaster has begun investigating Sanford 's travel records , McCall said the rally may not be necessary .
" We are hoping that legislators can quietly , in private talks with the governor , ask him if he would please step down , " McCall said .
A top South Carolina Democrat also called for Sanford 's resignation Wednesday .
" While I believe an investigation should still be done to determine the full extent of Mark Sanford 's abuse of power , [ through ] his long stream of confessions he has already revealed enough immoral and reprehensible behavior to justify asking him to step [ down ] , " state Democratic Party Chairwoman Carol Fowler said in a statement .
" State officials seem unable to do anything except worry and talk about Governor Sanford 's extramarital affair , which we learn more about every few hours .
" ... South Carolina can't afford to be at a standstill for the next 18 months with a governor who ignores his job responsibilities while pursuing personal interests , " the statement said .
" Any other worker in South Carolina would be fired for not showing up at work with no notice . "
Late Tuesday , seven GOP senators , including Majority Leader Harvey Peeler , jointly issued a letter demanding that the governor step down because he has lost the trust of South Carolinians .
" The bottom line is that the Governor 's private matters should remain private , but his deception and negligence make it impossible for us to trust him , and for him to govern in the future , " they wrote .
Peeler told CNN that Sanford " has lost his ability to lead , and I 'm afraid he has lost his ability to function as a man . "
" He is sitting all alone in that big governor 's mansion , totally alone , " Peeler said .
" It 's about leadership and moving forward and it 's time for him to resign . "
Peeler issued the statement along with Sens. Hugh Leatherman , Paul Campbell , Thomas Alexander , Jake Knotts , Larry Martin and William O'Dell .
Earlier Tuesday , two of Sanford 's top conservative allies in the senate -- Larry Grooms and Kevin Bryant -- also said Sanford must go .
The Greenville News , one of the largest papers in South Carolina , also issued a sharply worded editorial Wednesday telling Sanford to go .
It wrote that Sanford has " acted like a heart - sick school boy , and he 's revealed facts that clearly demonstrate he is capable of exceptional deception , arrogance and narcissism . "
The State , of Columbia , South Carolina 's largest paper , editorialized earlier that he should remain in office .
Watch a reporter from The State comment on the situation »
The attorney general of South Carolina asked the State Law Enforcement Division to review Sanford 's travel records after the governor admitted Tuesday to more visits with his mistress than previously disclosed .
The review by law enforcement officials would be the first formal investigation into whether Sanford abused his power while carrying on his affair .
State Law Enforcement Division Chief Reggie Lloyd said he would not characterize the review as a criminal investigation .
He told reporters on a conference call that law enforcement officials are reviewing documents from the governor 's office going back to 2003 , when Sanford came to power .
He said the review should be concluded by the end of the week .
Attorney General Henry McMaster , a Republican , had been reluctant to move forward with calls for an investigation into Sanford , saying he is wary of mixing legal matters with political score - settling from longtime Sanford opponents .
However , an aide to McMaster told CNN on Tuesday that " that all changed this morning when the governor disclosed additional trips that were not disclosed last week . "
Sanford said in a statement Tuesday that he's " pleased that [ the State Law Enforcement Division ] will look into this matter . "
" There 's been a lot of speculation and innuendo on whether or not public moneys were used to advance my admitted unfaithfulness .
To be very clear : no public money was ever used in connection with this . "

Bernhard Kohl has continued to reveal details of his own doping practices carried out during his six - year professional career .
A doping cyclist “ leads a double life , ” according to Kohl .
“ How should an athlete respond as other to always say that he is clean , and to vehemently deny anything else .
Although he knows : I am not clean . ”
Interviewed in the Swiss newspaper nzz.ch , the Austrian said that not 100 percent of the peloton doped .
“ There are a few riders who are clean , that may well be – but it 's not very many . ”
“ You have your good friends in the field , and you know what they do – and they have friends , too .
There is a fairly large circle of riders that you know about . ”
Kohl tested positive for CERA during the 2008 Tour de France , where he finished third and won the King of the Mountains ranking .
He was given a two - years suspension , and has provided a full confession .
Kohl subsequently announced his retirement from the sport and is currently cooperating with various law enforcement and anti-doping agencies .
It is also clear to the riders during a race , who has taken what , according to the former Gerolsteiner rider .
“ You know the riders long enough to know what their style is , when they are doing well or poorly , ” Kohl said .
“ You look at each other and know , okay , you are doing the same thing as I am . “
Kohl also admitted that during his professional career , there was only one period where he did not engage in doping practices ; from 2003 to 2004 , while riding for the Rabobank Continental Team .
“ Doping played no role there , as far as I could tell .
That was my cleanest time .
I was shown that it was possible without doping . ”
Kohl said that he was not worried about testing positive .
Many substances are still undetectable , he noted .
“ And when you have a product in your body that can still be found after eight or nine hours , you close the door , turn off your mobile phone , turn out the lights .
And if the doorbell rings , you do n't open the door . ”
The 27 - year - old said that he still considers himself the third - place finisher of the 2008 Tour de France “ I know how hard I worked for that success and how I got that success in comparison to the others . ”
He still has the third - place trophy and King of the Mountain jersey , and wo n't give them back .
“ They are well hidden . ”
While they may look like over - sized guinea pigs , hyraxes are actually more closely related to elephants and manatees and in prehistoric times reached the size of a small horse !

At the very least there are 28,063 citizens of the European Union who will be dismayed at the revelation by Glenys Kinnock that the British government is championing Tony Blair as the first long - term president of the European council .
That is the number of people who have signed an online petition , run in recent weeks to protest against the idea that Blair would be a suitable person to preside over the affairs of the EU .
In practice , opposition to Blair 's appointment goes far wider and deeper than is reflected in the poll .
However , Lady Kinnock is quoted as saying :
Blair is seen by many as someone who has the strength of character , the stature .
People know who he is , and he would be someone who would have this role and step into it with a lot of respect and I think would be generally welcomed .
It 's tempting to say in response that everything in those two sentences is wrong – even the punctuation .
It is true that when Blair was elected prime minister in 1997 he was regarded in the European Union as worthy of great hope and expectation .
Much of this had to do with the sheer relief of seeing the back of an obsessively narrow - minded , anti-European Tory government .
He also talked a good talk when it came to proclaiming his pro-European credentials .
However , at first slowly and then very rapidly Blair 's standing throughout the EU went into decline as it emerged that under his government Britain remained as negative , carping and footdragging as his Tory predecessors .
Even right - of - centre EU governments viewed his government 's attempts to block progressive legislation on workers ' rights and other innovative social policies with disbelief .
What finally shattered the European love affair with Blair was , of course , the Iraq war .
Even mainstream EU political leaders , not given to public criticism of United States policy were appalled at the subservience of Blair and his government to the George Bush strategy on combating the " axis of evil " .
It is no exaggeration to say that in most of the European chancelleries there are deep - seated convictions that Blair gave his commitment to back Bush in launching war in Iraq long before troops were dispatched and after it emerged there were no weapons of mass destruction .
Blair 's record since then has failed to win him more European admirers – perhaps the sole remaining example being his friend and Iraq war ally , the Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi .
In addition , Blair 's prestigious - sounding role in seeking to broker a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians seems to have produced little in the way of concrete results .
There has been little or no talk about who should be the president / chair of the European council since the initial Irish " No " to the Lisbon treaty .
But it now appears that there will be an Irish " Yes " to the treaty in October following " clarification " of the impact ( or rather " non-impact " ) of the treaty on Irish concerns about abortion , taxation and other issues .
So the issue has become hot again .
Even if New Labour attaches its flag to the Blair cause , it is most unlikely to succeed .
Apart from Berlusconi , all Blair 's other pro-Iraq war allies have been kicked out of office .
It is true that the French president initially appeared to support Blair 's candidacy .
But the volatile Sarkozy now appears to have had a change of heart .
Meanwhile even among new EU member states in central and eastern Europe , Blair 's standing has diminished , following the arrogant fashion in which the UK EU presidency of 2006 dealt with their need for budget support .
So who might be appointed in his place ?
Two names are in circulation – both social democrats but from different parts of Europe : the former Finnish prime minister Paavo Lipponen and Felipe Gonzales , the former Spanish premier .
Their candidacies have to be seen in the context of the likely reappointment of the present lacklustre Portuguese conservative Jose Manuel Barroso as president of the commission .
This leaves the important post of EU " foreign minister " to be filled – maybe by a French candidate .
So why , against these odds , would the Brown government go public in backing a candidate who is far from being the bookies ' favourite ?
Perhaps it is a bargaining chip to get a Brit appointed to a serious post in the new commission , possibly being in charge of the single market , or competition policy .
Still , it will leave Blair with more time for his lucrative career as an after - dinner speaker .

The real complexity of any computer system resides in the processor , but do you know how it works ?
I mean how it really works ?
How does the code that you write turn into something that does something ?
When you know how , it 's not magic - just a matter of " fetch " and " execute " .
What Programmers Know
Contents
* Recently revised
So far we have looked at the overall workings of a computer and specifically the memory principle .
Memories are devices that when given one input automatically produce an associated output - reading or will automatically store the output if it is also presented .
The memory principle and memory mechanisms are fascinating but we need more we need something that can execute instructions making use of the memory - we need a processor .
The processor is quite another level of difficulty .
The processor is the computer
There really is no question of the validity of this assertion .
If you do n’t believe me try running a program written for a PC on a Mac .
The point is that computers with different processors are different – computers with the same processor are just faster or slower .
The details of memory management and caching my be impressive but the real complexity of any computer system resides in the processor and it is time to look more closely at how it does what it does .
Even if you think you already know you still might find the explanation interesting .
The reason is that many books and courses do n’t really tell you the whole story .
They stop short and leave you with a sense that the processor is somehow magic even though you know the rough outline of how it all should work .
Notice that this is n't magic .
There is n't a little humanoid that goes and finds a particular memory location by address and then retrieves the contents for the CPU .
The action is as automatic as a key in a lock .
The CPU puts the address on the address bus and this selects and activates a particular memory location .
The read / write line sets the memory location 's behavior and it either places its content on the data bus or it " latches " or stores the contents of the data bus .
All automatic .
Program Counter
This might well be the major operating principle of a computer but it leaves out what the processor actually “ does ” with the data .
After all it is called a “ processor ” so presumably it does n’t just store and retrieve bit patterns .
We already know how binary patterns can be used to represent numbers and we know how Boolean logic can be used to manipulate them – with addition and subtraction .
But this is only part of what goes on .
When you first start to consider the workings of the processor it is usually arithmetic that the focus falls on .
The reason is that we often , mistakenly , think of computers as “ computers ” but for the vast majority of the time a computer is actually doing something other than arithmetic .
Once you start looking a little more closely the magic seems to be more to do with how this lump of silicon , or whatever it is made from , can obey the commands in a program .
How on earth does it look at the next instruction in a program , work out what it means and then arrange the immutable hardware to do it ?
Software may be soft but hardware is hard and it does n't change depending on what the instruction wants it to do .
Once again there is a tendency to think of a little humanoid sitting where the processor is waiting for the next instruction to appear and then doing whatever it commands .
This is , of course not how it happens and it is all just as automatic as the memory storage and retrieval .
The “ trick ” that the processor performs seems very complex but it is all based on building the complex from the simple and the very regular – but is n’t this always the principle when it comes to computers ?
The first thing a processor needs is some way of keeping track of where it has reached in the program .
This is using a single internal memory location , usually called the “ Program Counter ” or PC – and it does n't count programs !
All internal memory locations within the processor are called “ registers ” for historical reasons and to indicate that they are generally just a little more than simple memory locations .
For example , the PC register has two operations that it can perform .
It can be initialized to a set value and it can be incremented , i.e. it can add one to the value stored in it .
In what might be the most dastardly and / or brilliant criminal scheme ever undertaken , thieves made off with two beer trucks loaded with $ 70,000 worth of suds or 37,260 pilfered beers .

The theft was discovered in the early hours of the morning at Tampa Bay area trucking company K&N Trucking , where two semi trucks loaded with beer were found to be missing .
The two trucks were loaded with 2,250 six -packs of Corona Extra and 990 cases of Modelo Especial worth approximately $ 70,000 .
So far police have only been able to recover the semi tractors with no leads on the whereabouts of the trailers and their ice - cold occupants .
Somewhere in Tampa , it 's not beer - thirty .

Ansuman Biswas has spent 10 days and nights in a cardboard box
He might not look like the stereotypical hermit , but Ansuman Biswas is well prepared for isolation in a Gothic tower .
The Calcutta - born artist has been picked to spend 40 days and 40 nights in a tiny room at the top of Manchester Museum , looking over the city .
Surrounding him will be 4.5 million artefacts , treasures the museum has collected over time .
The 43 - year - old will contemplate things " lost " and the impact of extinction .
Currently living in London , Mr Biswas will uproot his life to exist in the ivory tower from 27 June until 5 August .
His only communication with the outside world will be through his internet blog as he details what life is like in seclusion .
I will be in isolation but I see myself performing a social function that is a historically important part of society
Ansuman Biswas
The feat will not be a big challenge for him , having spent 10 days and nights without food in a cardboard box for an exhibition in London .
He has also been blindfolded and left in a place unknown to him for two days .
Mr Biswas said : " Well in a way the one thing that is missing from the museum is life - a real live human being .
" Being at top of the this gothic tower is much the same way the brain is at the top of a spinal chord .
" The nature of loss , the cultural memory , I want to question what is important to us and how do we show that we value it ?
" I will be in isolation but I see myself performing a social function that is a historically important part of society . "
A museum spokeswoman said : " By documenting his existence in isolation through blogging and webcam we hope that he will become the museum 's ultimate exhibit . "

By guest reporter SWSonic Team boss and international grumpy person Yuji Naka has been the first high - level Sega executive to speak out against the studio mergers at Sega Sammy Holdings , complaining of the constant bong - smoking of new stablemates , the UGA team .
“ When in the morning , a person must smoke hashish , it becomes a problem , ” stated Naka .
“ Marijuana is one thing , but this ingestion method , the ‘ shotgun bowl - bong ’ is not helping the development process here .
” Naka made his comments following the unveiling of the team ’s first co-operative work with UGA , I Would Die For You for the Nintendo DS .
“ It ’s an embarrassment to us and makes us look like the American hippies of the 1970s .
I have always said one thing about games ; they should be cute and go really fast .
But the hashish makes everything swirly and slow – the opposite of this !
” Contacted for comment today , Amusement Vision head Toshihiro Nagoshi was eager to play down the herbal rift developing at Sega HQ .
“ Naka - san just has low blood sugar and probably needs some bitter - tasting soy biscuits or something .
I have shared my daily allowance of a huge bottle of whisky with him for several years now without any problems , but when he mixes it with the chillums and Silver Leaf pipes in his office , it ’s bound to be a disaster .
” Indeed , Naka has been pictured with a very white face of late , stumbling towards the toilet , followed by several smirking UGA staffers chanting “ Hey Naka !
You calling Satomi on the big porcelain telephone again ? ”
It thought that the constant baiting has been the principal cause of the ever - widening rift at the new studio .
One unnamed source told UK:R , “ The tricks UGA get up to are astonishing .
They stop at nothing to make Sonic Team sick with cannabis .
I have seen them loading joints really heavily at the end , and making Sonic Team light them , putting hydroponicly - grown skunk into Sonic Team bongs , but only smoking Jamaican brick weed in their own , the list is endless .
” It is believed that this is only the first stage in the corruption of Sonic Team by UGA , though rumours detailing Mexican mushroom binges , LSD and PCP have yet to be confirmed .
Psalm 18:2 - The LORD is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ; my God , my strength , in whom I will trust ; my buckler , and the horn of my salvation , and my high tower .
Psalm 23 : 1 - 6
The LORD [ is ] my shepherd ; I shall not want .
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures : he leadeth me beside the still waters .
He restoreth my soul : he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name 's sake .
Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil : for thou [ art ] with me ; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me .
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies : thou anointest my head with oil ; my cup runneth over .
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life : and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever .
Psalm 91 : 1-16 -
He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty .
I will say of the LORD , [ He is ] my refuge and my fortress : my God ; in him will I trust .
Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler , [ and ] from the noisome pestilence .
He shall cover thee with his feathers , and under his wings shalt thou trust : his truth [ shall be thy ] shield and buckler .
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night ; [ nor ] for the arrow [ that ] flieth by day ;
[ Nor ] for the pestilence [ that ] walketh in darkness ; [ nor ] for the destruction [ that ] wasteth at noonday .
A thousand shall fall at thy side , and ten thousand at thy right hand ; [ but ] it shall not come nigh thee .
Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked .
Because thou hast made the LORD , [ which is ] my refuge , [ even ] the most High , thy habitation ;
There shall no evil befall thee , neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling .
For he shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee in all thy ways .
They shall bear thee up in [ their ] hands , lest thou dash thy foot against a stone .
Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder : the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet .
Because he hath set his love upon me , therefore will I deliver him : I will set him on high , because he hath known my name .
He shall call upon me , and I will answer him : I [ will be ] with him in trouble ; I will deliver him , and honour him .
With long life will I satisfy him , and shew him my salvation .
Police departments issue their officers Kevlar vests to stop bullets , and thick helmets and even shields to protect them from bottles and bricks .
But there is nothing in the equipment room to give an officer thicker skin .
That tool  as vital to an officer ’s safety and the public ’s as anything clipped to his belt  is developed in training , and its strength differs from one officer to the next .
The issue of tolerance , in fact , lies at the heart of the dispute surrounding the arrest of the Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. in Cambridge , Mass .
The police say Professor Gates was arrested and briefly charged with disorderly conduct after he ignored warnings to stop haranguing an officer who had asked him for identification inside his home .
Ethanol bears some of the blame for last year 's rising food prices , but oil and electricity bear more , according to a new congressional study of the food - versus - fuel debate .
The ethanol industry and its critics have been locked in a fierce argument over whether the alternative fuel , typically made from corn , pushes up food prices .
Thursday 's report from the Congressional Budget Office gives some ammunition to each side .
Researchers found that ethanol production was responsible for 10 to 15 percent of the increase in food prices between April 2007 and April 2008 .
As new ethanol biorefineries opened across the country , corn prices rose , causing a wave of price increases for everything from corn-syrup sweeteners to meat from animals fed with corn .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
But ethanol production was n't the only culprit .
Between 22 and 36 percent of the overall increase in food prices can be traced to the rising cost of traditional energy sources such as gasoline , diesel and electricity , according to the report .
Virtually every step of food production - from planting to transportation to processing - consumes fuel or electricity .
The period covered by the report also saw record - breaking oil and gasoline prices .
Both sides of the ethanol debate claimed vindication Thursday .
" The report released by the Congressional Budget Office confirms what we 've known for some time - the impact of ethanol production on food prices is minimal , and that energy was the main driver in the rise of food prices , " said Tom Buis , chief executive of Growth Energy , an ethanol - industry association .
" Today 's Congressional Budget Office numbers once again remind us of the unintended negative consequences associated with our nation 's current policies which promote and mandate the conversion of massive amounts of corn and other food crops for biofuels production , " read a joint statement from the Grocery Manufacturers Association , the American Meat Institute , the National Turkey Federation and the National Council of Chain Restaurants .
Slap a generous scoop of ice cream between two cookies , tidy up the edges and pop the whole thing in the freezer until it firms up .
How difficult can it really be to make a great ice cream sandwich ?
The ice cream is easy .
You can really let your imagination go , as far as flavors are concerned , though you ’ll be better off choosing premium brands -- they tend to freeze more solidly than less expensive types , which often contain stabilizers .
It ’s when you start rummaging through your cookie recipes that things can get tricky .
Should they be thick or thin , soft or crispy , rolled or more free - form drop in style ?
Once you understand the basics , spotting a sandwich - worthy cookie recipe that you can tweak to your taste is almost as simple as , well , making the sandwich itself .
First of all , the ideal cookies for an ice cream sandwich should be noticeably less sweet than those you want to nibble straight from the oven , because you ’re going to be adding a lot of ice cream .
The cookies should also be crispy enough to contrast with the silkiness of ice cream ( a super - soft cookie and you ’ve got ice cream all over your hands ) .
A little chewiness in the center is also great for contrast as you munch your way through the cookie .
And think about the thickness of the cookie ; you ’re making a sandwich , not a hoagie .
Those are the broad outlines .
When you get to specifics , there are a few more things to consider .
The kind of sugar you use in the cookie also makes a difference .
You want a recipe that calls for at least part brown sugar , molasses , honey or maple syrup .
A couple tablespoons of these will add a rich caramelized flavor to your cookies .
Just a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar added to a standard chocolate sugar cookie transforms it into a perfect sandwich layer .
The brown sugar adds extra moisture and makes the cookie chewier , which is a good thing .
And dough that ’s been rolled into balls , rather than dropped directly onto the baking sheet , bakes into more uniformly shaped cookies -- especially handy when you ’re matching up perfect sandwiching partners .
You can play even more variations on that simple chocolate cookie if you want .
Fold in a handful of chopped nuts , minced dried fruit or use a quarter - teaspoon of almond extract rather than vanilla .
Carmela ’s , an ice cream stand at several Southern California farmers markets , sprinkles sea salt on its chocolate sandwich cookies prior to baking .
You can also change the texture of the dough by adding oatmeal or coconut .
It ’ll make cookies more crumbly tender than chewy , but just as moist .
With the addition of coconut , a butter cookie morphs into an almost macaroon - like disc that manages to taste light even when piled with gobs of vanilla or coconut ice cream .
Grinding the coconut in the food processor will give the cookies a more uniform texture .
A teaspoon of lemon or orange zest is also a tasty addition to the dough , particularly with summery citrus ice creams or tangy sorbets .
With this and other very moist doughs , you need to chill the dough well so the cookies keep a uniform shape while baking .
Flattening the sugar - rolled balls with the bottom of a drinking glass dipped in sugar also helps ensure that the tops will fit the bottoms and bake into a thinner sandwiching cookie .
Spice cookie
For the ultimate ice cream sandwich , use a variation on a molasses spice cookie that Suzanne Goin uses at Lucques restaurant in West Hollywood .
It ’s loaded with cloves , ginger and cinnamon and rolled thin so it ’s not heavy but still keeps a fantastic chewy center from the molasses .
It is a stiff dough , which helps the cookies retain a perfectly round shape , so you ’ll need to chill the dough and roll it between parchment or plastic wrap to make it easier to work with .
This flour - free rolling technique also keeps the cookies moist in the center and helps you transfer the delicate rounds to the baking sheet .
You can peel them right off the parchment or plastic .
After baking , cool thin cookies such as these directly on the baking sheet rather than on a rack .
It will steam them enough to slightly soften them .
Now the crispy edges wo n’t crumble when you slather them with ice cream ( the filled cookies will soften up even more after a few hours in the freezer ) .
And about the ice cream .
That ’s the easy part .
It ’s worth it to look for premium brands .
They tend to freeze more solidly than less expensive types , which often contain stabilizers .
Do n’t be afraid to play with flavors .
Goin uses the gingerbread cookies to make sandwiches with pumpkin or maple ice creams during the fall , or lighter stone fruit sorbets or vanilla ice creams in the summer .
Tropical flair
The coconut cookies are a natural for tropical flavors such as pineapple , mango or even coconut ice cream .
I also like everyday vanilla ice cream with the sides of the sandwich rolled in flaked coconut ( do this just after you fill the cookies so the ice cream is still soft enough for the flakes to adhere ) .
Make enough chocolate sea salt sandwich cookies so that you can fill them with a mix of pecan praline , chocolate almond or one of those crazy everything - but - the - kitchen - sink ice creams , and you ’ve got a virtual ice cream truck permanently parked in your kitchen , without the endlessly looped “ Pop Goes the Weasel ” soundtrack .

Police : Witness shoots , kills carjacker Police : Man who shot carjacker had permit
An alleged carjacker was shot and killed in north Houston Saturday morning , police said .
At about 6:15 a.m. , witnesses pulled Darryl Milton Franklin Jr. , 37 , out of a car that he was reportedly breaking into in the 1100 block of Langwick Drive .
As they waited for police to arrive , witnesses saw him attempt to break into other vehicles and even try to commit a carjacking , authorities said .
Franklin attacked a man who approached him .
The man , who was carrying a permitted concealed weapon , shot Franklin , said Houston Police spokesman Victor Senties .
The shooting is being investigated by the District Attorney ’s Office and will likely be referred to a grand jury , Senties said .
Jack Lang , deux fois ministre de la culture de François Mitterrand , en 1981 et en 1988 , réagit à la décision du Conseil constitutionnel , le 10 juin , d'invalider le volet sanctions du projet de loi Création et Internet , visant à lutter contre le piratage des films et musiques .
Quelle est votre réaction après la censure du Conseil constitutionnel de la loi Hadopi ?
La déception , car c'est un coup rude pour le monde artistique .
J'entends : " C'est un revers pour Sarkozy . "
Mais ceux qui en prennent plein la figure , ce sont surtout les créateurs dont les droits d'auteur sont bafoués .
J'ai de la peine , aussi , parce que je me retrouve , sur cette question , contre ma famille de gauche .
Et puis je suis surpris .
J'ai connu le Conseil constitutionnel , disons , plus prudent face à des textes qui posent de graves problèmes pour les libertés , par exemple la loi audiovisuelle qui donne un droit de nomination de l'exécutif dans les chaînes publiques .
Que seul un juge puisse sanctionner un internaute et non un organisme administratif , c'est une surprise pour vous ?
Je suis professeur de droit , et franchement , oui .
Les sages nous ont habitués à trouver un équilibre entre deux droits contradictoires .
Or cette décision rompt l'équilibre entre la liberté de l'internaute , qui devient un droit fondamental , et le droit moral et matériel du créateur , qui était tout autant un droit fondamental .
Il y a même deux poids , deux mesures .
Il existe par exemple une bonne dizaine d'autorités administratives qui ont le pouvoir de prendre des sanctions .
Il y a même une machine , qui s'appelle le radar , qui peut sanctionner un automobiliste qui va trop vite sur la route .
Mais je dois constater hélas que le Conseil constitutionnel n'est pas coupé du climat actuel , dominé par le consumérisme .
Selon une conviction diffuse , le monde culturel s'en mettrait plein les poches , il n'aurait pas besoin de droits d'auteur , il pourrait vivre d'amour et d'eau fraîche , et l'art devrait être gratuit .
Jouissons de la culture sans entraves et sans frontières ...
Ce climat a gagné les socialistes .
Sous Mitterrand , les droits des créateurs étaient intouchables .
Personne n'aurait pu les brader .
On ne doit pas sacrifier ses convictions à la mode du moment , au dernier chien qui passe .
Mon idée de la culture est exigeante , elle s'oppose à la consommation immédiate .
J'entends dire : " Nous entrons dans une ère nouvelle , post - Malraux et Lang . "
Pourquoi pas .
Attendons que les 1 000 fleurs surgissent ...
Etes -vous d'accord avec le gouvernement qui a décidé d'avancer coûte que coûte ?
Oui , il faut aller vite , finir avant l'été .
C'est bien de promulguer la partie non censurée de la loi , sur la prévention , car je pense que les avertissements envoyés par mail auront un effet .
Au gouvernement , maintenant , d'imaginer des sanctions qui tiennent compte de la décision du Conseil .
Mais beaucoup disent qu'une sanction judiciaire ne sera pas applicable : les juges ne sont pas préparés , ils seront asphyxiés par les milliers de demandes , et la sanction pénale est trop lourde , inadaptée aux cas .
Il est possible d'inventer une incrimination adaptée à cette question , un droit pénal particulier , avec une palette de mesures ( suspension de l'abonnement , amende ... ) en fonction de la gravité de l'infraction .
On peut mettre en place des juges spécialisés .
Ça coûte cher .
C'est une question de volonté .
Au gouvernement de répondre aux écueils dans un texte court .
Vous souvenez - vous d'avoir mené un combat similaire ?
Je pense au prix unique du livre , qui visait à défendre les auteurs , éditeurs et libraires .
La loi a été combattue par les grandes surfaces , par la Commission de Bruxelles , et par le public , au nom de la libre circulation des biens et de la défense du consommateur .
S'il avait été saisi , le Conseil constitutionnel aurait étrillé ma loi .
Il est logique qu'un texte d'un nouveau type soit un chemin de croix .
Pourquoi ne pas chercher un autre système de rémunération des artistes ?
J'aurais aimé que la loi s'accompagne d'un plan d'aide à la création , et d'une taxe visant les fournisseurs d'accès à Internet afin de faire baisser le prix de l'offre légale sur Internet .
Mais sinon , je ne vois pas d'alternative à cette loi .
Certains prônent une licence globale : l'internaute paie un forfait reversé aux auteurs .
Mais cette licence compenserait de façon dérisoire le pillage !
Et notre système culturel s'écroulerait .
C'est pourtant ce système qui fait de la France un des rares pays au monde à avoir encore une riche production de films .

Is n't it ironic ?
Do n't you think ?
Good thing for these Republican voters that the bleeding heart liberals are in charge now , huh .
Today 's losers losing their homes are Republican districts .
At least according to the Center for Responsible Lending , who has just issued a new report that shows nine of the top ten districts with the most foreclosures are Republican and most likely to receive the bulk of any homeowner bailout , and thus , at least according to one On Air editor of a major cable network , fit the definition of " losers " .
Things look a little better further down the list .
However , only six of the 22 districts with more than 10,000 foreclosures projected are represented by Democrats , and only two of those have served a full term .
So 20 of the 22 have been in Republican hands until very recently .
In other words , " Since the Rick Santelli's of the world have been complaining about how the people who would be helped by this bill are so ' irresponsible ' and are really just a bunch of ' losers .

Recently , I made a parenting mistake .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
I showed my kids the best video on the internet : Lemon Demon ’s great song , “ Ultimate Showdown , ” describing an epic battle .
I was focused mostly on the great beat and all of the references to superheroes and cultural icons — many of whom the boys already knew — and completely neglected the graphic cartoon violence that ends poorly for everyone .
After a while , I saw a tweet from my wife that illustrated its impact : “ OH : It ’s a bit gory , and Mr. Rogers covered in blood was a little much , but it ’s got a catchy tune . ”
Bad Dad .
The experience forced me to think more deeply about how to bring the boys up to speed on Internet culture without spawning years of therapy .
Inspired by Piaget , my two sons and I poured through about four dozen videos representing important memes over the years .
At an average of 3 - 5 minutes per video , that ’s a lot of opportunity to test the patience of children .
I tried to filter out the raunch to protect their naive view of the world — which unfortunately , now includes the image of Mister Rogers as a berserker — and focus on the best candidates for kids to enjoy … and what to avoid .

Some popular memes are verboten because of their content , where vulgar , sexually explicit , foul and disturbing are often intermixed .
There is no appropriate age for “ Two Girls , One Cup , ” but there ’s a lot of middle ground between that and Dramatic Chipmunk .
Kids respond to different content in unusual ways .
There are several memes you can probably skip :
RickRoll
On the one hand , the ingredients are there for unending hours of enjoyment .
Tell someone you have a cool link to show them , and instead send them an ’80s music video of Rick Astley .
Hilarious .
Two problems on the parenting front , however .
First , they wo n’t “ get ” the video ( “ Why is the bartender running up walls ? ” ) .
Second , they will get the joke .
Arming your Internet - savvy youngster with this prank will all but guarantee you will be RickRolled until graduation .
Not a good idea .
Miss South Carolina
Watching Caitlin Upton garble an answer in a beauty pageant may provide parents an opportunity to talk with youngsters about stereotypes , gender inequalities , and the anxieties of public speaking .
For the under - ten set , watching some grown - up make no sense is B - O - R - I - N - G .
Hello , My Future Girlfriend
Completely lost on my kids is how amazing it was that an 11 - year - old could make a web site a decade ago , when only around 3 million U.S. children were online .
Kids are smart enough to recognize ridicule when when sense it .
( See also : Star Wars Kid )
Long Stuff
Despite liking both chocolate and rain , the boys had enough after a few seconds of Tay Zonday singing into a condenser microphone .
Similarly , “ Boom goes the dynamite ” may be a hip thing to say , but the boys could n’t survive the boredom of Brian Collins ’ sportscast to get to the Internet catch phrase .
My eldest did enjoy watching Noah ’s hair flicker for a while , but six years is a long time to see the same face .
Stuff in Foreign Languages
The fictitious laughing interviewer ( played by Flemish comedian Tom Van Dyck ) was mistaken for real by many .
“ Erik Hartman ” ca n’t control his laughter when one of his two guests speaks in a high voice .
In the a longer version , Hartman looks back on the incident that caused him to be fired .
The humor is n’t in the words , but the words are n’t in a language familiar to my boys .
They tuned out quickly .
Scary Stuff
In 2006 , my friend Apurva gleefully had me crank up the volume and lean into YouTube — my first experience with the site — to look for a ghost in car commercial .
It ’s not something I ’d do to my kids , even on nights when they are already screaming .
Kid-tested , Mother - approved
Based on my sons ’ reactions , attention span , and later reflection , this is their Top Ten of Internet Memes :
1. Diet Coke and Mentos
The boys were first introduced to these junk food geysers through Mythbusters , so perhaps they were a bit predisposed to loving the video of two men in lab coats and goggles recreating the fountain in front of the Bellagio hotel .
They are now more than a little obsessed with getting me to fall for a related prank .
2. Will It Blend ?
If kids were the target market for kitchen appliances , Blendtec would have two more customers .
The viral marketing campaign uses Blendtec ’s product in interesting ways .
There is something satisfying about seeing an iPhone become smoke and powder , but the kids most loved watching a wiimote get the same treatment .
3. Cup Stacking World Record
Did you know stacking cups quickly was a sport ?
It ’s also an iPhone app .
Jaws dropped while watching Emily
Fox set a record placing cups in stacks ( since broken ) .
I am clinging to the hope that this feat becomes tied to general cleaning , prompting the boys to go for a world record of their own .
4. Here It Goes Again
I do n’t know if the pop song by OK
Go owes it success to the Internet , but this music video of the band ’s creative use of treadmills is a hit with the kiddies .
That ’s without showing them the LEGO version .
5. Animals
Whether it is a ninja cat , a skateboarding bulldog , or a primate hating on David Letterman , nothing says kid-friendly entertainment like a critter doing something wacky .
Dramatic Chipmunk gets additional points because it is only 5 seconds long .
6. Charlie Bit Me
Take two adorable brothers , throw in a British accent and a set of young teeth , and you get a YouTube sensation to which all siblings can relate .
Harry , now 6 , wo n’t re-do the clip , but Charlie may be willing to assume the big brother role : Jasper turns 1 this month .
7. Babies
New humans are very versatile , sporting evil looks and mastering Kung Fu .
Some are only virtual but can still land a featured role in a network dramas .
8. Matrix Ping Pong
My kids have never seen The Matrix , nor have they played ping pong .
Put the two together on a Japanese game show , however , and they are delighted .
9. Ask a Ninja
Ninjas are everywhere , fighting the good fight against pirates .
I include the Ninja because of how much the boys howled when he described how to kill a ninja .
( Psst , it involves John Cougar Mellencamp . )
10 . Mind-numbing Songs
Inane songs do n’t discriminate .
They can be about anything , including food , mammals , reptiles , or a gummy bear .
Repetitious lyrics and a relentless beat are a hypnotic combination for children of all ages .
The Jury is Out
Even if they did n’t quite make the cut with my kids , here are some other memes yours may appreciate :

After taking your kids on a tour of Internet history , they may be ready to appreciate Weezer ’s homage video , Pork and Beans .
If the next generation can spot at least 5 memes on sight , you ’ll know they have been properly assimilated .
Never - Ending Government Lies About Markets
The purpose of government is for those who run it to plunder those who do not .
Throughout history , governments have used violence , intimidation , coercion , and mass murder to enforce this system .
But governments ’ first line of “ defense ” is always a blizzard of lies – about its own alleged benevolence , altruism , heroism , and greatness , along with equally big lies about the “ evils ” of the civil society , especially the free market .
The current economic crisis , which was instigated by the government ’s central bank and its boom - and - bust monetary policies , among other interventions , has once again been blamed on “ too little regulation ” and too much freedom .
Will Americans ever catch on to this biggest of all of government ’s Big Lies ?
When the Pilgrims came to America , they nearly starved to death because they adopted communal agriculture .
When William Bradford , leader of the Mayflower expedition , figured this out he reorganized the Massachusetts pilgrims in a regime of private property in land .
The incentives created by private property promptly created a dramatic economic turnaround and the rest is history .
Most history books ignore this reality , however , and blame the starvation crisis of the Pilgrims on corporate greed on the part of the Mayflower company .
After the American Revolution , it was imperative to build roads and canals so that commerce could expand and the economy thrive .
George Washington ’s Treasury secretary , Alexander Hamilton , declared in his famous Report on Manufactures that private road and canal building would never succeed without government subsidies .
President Thomas Jefferson ’s Treasury secretary , Albert Gallatin , concurred .
Meanwhile , private capital markets and the private “ turnpike ” industry were busy financing thousands of miles of private roads without any governmental assistance .
When government did intervene in early - American road building , it was a financial catastrophe almost everywhere , so much so that by 1860 only Missouri and Massachusetts had not amended their state constitutions to prohibit the use of tax dollars for “ internal improvements . ”
Americans have been taught by their government - run schools that the post - 1865 Industrial Revolution was bad for the working class , which made government regulation of work and wages , and the creation and prospering of labor unions necessary .
In reality , people left the farms for factories because the latter offered far better wages and working conditions .
Between 1860 and 1890 , real wages increased by 50 percent in America , as myriad new products were invented , and made available to the common working person thanks to low - cost , mass production .
It was capital investment that dramatically increased the productivity of labor , allowing hours worked to decline from an average of 61 hours per week in 1870 to 48 hours by 1929 .
Higher worker productivity , fueled mostly by capital investment by entrepreneurs and private investors , also made it less necessary for families to force their children to work .
Child labor was on the wane for decades before government got around to regulating or outlawing it .
And when it did so it was to protect unionized labor from competition , not to protect children from harsh working conditions .
The “ robber barons ” of the late 19th century robbed no one .
Most of them made their money by providing valuable – if not revolutionary – goods and services to the masses at lower and lower prices for decades at a time .
John D. Rockefeller , for example , caused the price of refined petroleum to drop from 30 cents per gallon in 1869 to 8 cents in 1885 , and continued to drop his prices for many years thereafter .
James J. Hill built the most efficient and profitable transcontinental railroad without a dime ’s worth of government subsidy .
In return for their remarkable free - market success the government prosecuted both of these men , kangaroo court style , under the protectionist “ antitrust ” laws .
The real “ robbers ” were politically connected businessmen like Leland Stanford , a former California governor and senator , who succeeded in getting laws passed that granted his company a monopoly in the California railroad business .
The federal antitrust laws were passed beginning with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 because the government informed Americans that industry was becoming “ rampantly cartelized ” or monopolized .
In reality , prices everywhere were plummeting as new products and services were being invented everywhere .
The entire period from 1865 to 1900 was a period of price deflation .
As I show in How Capitalism Saved America , all of the industries accused of being monopolies by Congress in 1889 - 890 had been dropping their prices for at least a decade thanks to vigorous competition .
And it was not a result of the idiotic theory of “ predatory pricing . ”
No sane businessperson would intentionally lose money for decades by pricing below cost with the hope that he would somehow frighten away all competition forevermore .
Everyone “ knows ” that President Herbert Hoover was a staunch advocate of laissez - faire economics , and it was his lack of interventionism that caused the Great Depression .
This is the biggest governmental lie in the history of America .
Hoover was a “ progressive ” ( as today ’s socialists , also known as “ Democrats , ” have taken to calling themselves ) .
Hoover strong - armed corporate executives into raising wages at a time when wages needed to adjust downward in the free market in order to minimize unemployment .
He devoted 13 % of the federal budget to a failed “ stimulus ” program of pork - barrel spending and imposed some of the biggest tax increases in history to fund it all .
He was a protectionist who signed the notorious Smoot - Hawley Tariff Act , which increased the average tariff rate to nearly 60 percent and spawned a worldwide trade war that shrunk world trade by two - thirds in three years .
He cartelized the agricultural industry with “ farm boards ” that began the insane practice of paying farmers for not growing crops or raising livestock .
He pioneered the politicization of capital markets by creating the Reconstruction Finance Corporation .
And he ranted and raved against “ greedy capitalists ” while launching numerous government “ investigations ” of investors and the stock market .
FDR ’s top domestic advisor , Rexford Tugwell , said that his fellow New Dealers “ owed much to Hoover , ” who began many of the policies that they simply extended .
Every time the price of gasoline goes up significantly , Congress convenes a Nuremburg Trial–style inquisition of oil - company executives .
This practice began in the 1970s when the government ’s own foolish price controls on petroleum products caused massive shortages , and it needed someone to blame .
Oil company executives are never praised when gasoline prices fall , as they have in the past year from over $ 4 / gallon to under $ 2 / gallon in many parts of the United States .
Most recently , the current economic crisis is said to be caused by the “ excesses ” of economic freedom and “ too little regulation ” of the economy , especially financial markets .
This is said by the president and numerous other politicians , with straight faces , despite the facts that there are a dozen executive - branch cabinet departments , over 100 federal agencies , more than 85,000 pages in the Federal Register , and dozens of state and local government agencies that regulate , regiment , tax , and control every aspect of every business in America , and have been doing so for decades .
Laissez - faire run amok in financial markets is said to be a cause of the current crisis .
But the Fed alone – a secret government organization that is accountable to no one and which has never been audited – performs hundreds of regulatory functions , in addition to recklessly manipulating the money supply .
And it is just one of numerous financial regulatory agencies ( the SEC , Comptroller of the Currency , Office of Thrift Supervision , FDIC , and numerous state regulators also exist ) .
In a Fed publication entitled “ The Federal Reserve System : Purposes and Functions , ” it is explained that “ The Federal Reserve has supervisory and regulatory authority over a wide range of financial institutions and activities . ”
That ’s the understatement of the century .
Among the Fed ’s functions are the regulation of
Bank holding companies
State - chartered banks
Foreign branches of member banks
Edge and agreement corporations
US state - licensed branches , agencies , and representative offices of foreign banks
Nonbanking activities of foreign banks
National banks ( with the Comptroller of the Currency )
Savings banks ( with the Office of Thrift Supervision )
Nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies
Thrift holding companies
Financial reporting
Accounting policies of banks
Business “ continuity ” in case of an economic emergency
Consumer - protection laws
Securities dealings of banks
Information technology used by banks
Foreign investments of banks
Foreign lending by banks
Branch banking
Bank mergers and acquisitions
Who may own a bank
Capital “ adequacy standards ”
Extensions of credit for the purchase of securities
Equal - opportunity lending
Mortgage disclosure information
Reserve requirements
Electronic - funds transfers
Interbank liabilities
Community Reinvestment
Act subprime lending requirements
All international banking operations
Consumer leasing
Privacy of consumer financial information
Payments on demand deposits
“ Fair credit ” reporting
Transactions between member banks and their affiliates
Truth in lending
Truth in savings
That ’s a pretty comprehensive list , the result of 96 years of bureaucratic empire building by Fed bureaucrats .
It gives the lie to the notion that there has been “ too little regulation ” of financial markets .
Anyone who makes such an argument is either ignorant of the truth or is lying .

McCain Campaign Investigated , Dismissed Obama Citizenship Rumors
Created : July 24 , 2009 08:38 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) during his presidential campaign ( WDCpix )
In the final months of the 2008 presidential race , Sen. John McCain ’s ( R - Ariz . ) campaign learned of a lawsuit filed in Pennsylvania that asked the state to strip Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) of the Democratic nomination on suspicion that he was not an American citizen .
The complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief was filed by Phil Berg , a former deputy state attorney general who left government in 1990 for a series of gadfly political campaigns .
His last round of notoriety had come when he filed RICO complaints against George W. Bush , Saddam Hussein and multiple members of the Bush administration for “ accountability ” for the 9/11 attacks .
Still , Berg ’s complaint had gotten glancing local media attention , and the Democratic National Committee ’s counsel had filed a motion to dismiss it .
One lawyer who was doing some work for the campaign was tasked with reading Berg ’s lawsuit and gauging its chances of success .
Image by : Matt Mahurin
“ The conversation was along the lines of ‘ this is idiotic , but explain to me why , ’ ” said the lawyer , who spoke under condition of anonymity to TWI .
“ I looked at whether the lawsuit was going to be dismissed .
I said yes . ”
Berg ’s main problem was the one that has bedeviled the small , but growing , number of lawyers and amateur attorneys who have filed frivolous lawsuits against President Obama on the “ question ” of his American citizenship .
He and they have run up against the doctrine of standing , which requires plaintiffs to prove that they have been or will be harmed by the law that they ’re challenging .
Like the people who challenged McCain ’s citizenship in 2008 and 2000 , or the people who challenged Dick Cheney ’s right to run for vice president because he , like George W. Bush , resided in Texas , “ birther ” plaintiffs have failed again and again to get their cases heard because they lack standing .
“ We monitored the progress of these lawsuits against the Obama campaign , ” said Trevor Potter , ** a ** Washington attorney who served as general counsel to the 2008 and 2000 McCain presidential campaigns .
“ The McCain campaign faced a series of lawsuits like this , too , alleging that he could not be president because he was born in the Panama Canal Zone .
Both campaigns took the position that these plaintiffs lacked standing . ”
But the flawed conception of the many “ birther ” lawsuits , coupled with the inexperience and foul - ups of “ birther ” lawyers , have only fed the frenzy over Obama ’s legitimacy to serve as president of the United States .
A survey of the lawsuits filed against Obama reveals a reliance on widely debunked rumors , bogus stories sourced back to web sites , affidavits from “ experts ” who refuse to provide credentials or even their real names , and frequent and blatant misunderstandings of basic constitutional law .
The dismissal of “ birther ” lawsuits has allowed conspiracy theorists to believe that the information in those suits is accurate–a belief that manifests itself in the emails , phone calls , and town hall meeting rants that have pushed the theories into the mainstream media and the halls of Congress .
While they ruled out any chance of the “ birther ” lawsuits holding up in court , lawyers for the McCain campaign did check into the rumors about Obama ’s birth and the assertions made by Berg and others .
“ To the extent that we could , we looked into the substantive side of these allegations , ” said Potter .
“ We never saw any evidence that then - Senator Obama had been born outside of the United States .
We saw rumors , but nothing that could be sourced to evidence .
There were no statements and no documents that suggested he was born somewhere else .
On the other side , there was proof that he was born in Hawaii .
There was a certificate issued by the state ’s Department of Health , and the responsible official in the state saying that he had personally seen the original certificate .
There was a birth announcement in the Honolulu Advertiser , which would be very difficult to invent or plant 47 years in advance . ”
“ Birther ” lawyers and bloggers , who gained an unexpected prominence in the mainstream media , have consistently denied Hawaii ’s own records of Obama ’s birth .
They have also built up a corpus of information which , they argue , would invalidate Obama ’s claim on the White House even if he was born in the United States .
These rumors , and the inability of “ birther ” lawyers to test them in court , have proven pervasive enough to fuel the conspiracy theories .
After the DNC requested a dismissal of Berg ’s lawsuit , he responded in a Sept. 29 , 2008 filing that cited numerous Internet rumors and incorrect citations of American and international law .
Berg cited “ Wikipedia Italian version ” and “ Rainbow Edition News Letter ” as evidence that Obama had not been clear about which hospital he was born in ; he alleged that Obama must have been adopted by Lolo Soetoro , the Indonesian man who married Obama ’s mother when the future president was five years old , because he attended elementary school in that country .
Because a contemporary school record referred to Obama as “ Barry Soetoro ” and listed his nationality as “ Indonesian , ” Berg argued that there was “ absolutely no way Obama could have ever regained ‘ natural born ’ status . ”
“ That ’s just completely wrong , ” said Mitzi Torri , an Arizona - based immigration lawyer .
Torri pointed to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 , which sets a high bar for renunciation of American citizenship .
According to the INA , an American can only forfeit his citizenship if he commits treason , if he makes a “ , ” or if he becomes a citizen of another country “
“ Berg wants to say , ” said Torri , “ that this document from a school in Indonesia , which has no signature , which has no standing whatsoever , is more important than Obama ’s birth certificate or our immigration law . ”
Berg ’s filings made other claims that have shown up in anti-Obama lawsuits and in the proliferation of “ birther ” Website .
One relies on an audio tape of Obama ’s step - grandmother Sarah Obama , who lives in Kenya , being goaded into saying ( through a translator ) that the future president was born in Kenya before quickly correcting herself .
( A doctored version of this tape , which cuts off before the retraction , is posted on YouTube . )
Another claim : Obama traveled to Pakistan in 1981 , when it was illegal for an American to do so , suggesting that he used a non-American passport .
The problem is that there never was any such ban .
“ We have no record of any travel ban between America and Pakistan during that period or since , ” said Noel Clay , a spokesman for the State Department .
“ We got that from someplace , ” Berg told TWI on Thursday .
In an email , he added his paralegal was “ reviewing ” his files on Pakistan .
Yet the false claim appears in Orly Taitz ’s lawsuit on behalf of perennial presidential candidate Alan Keyes , which argues that Obama visited Pakistan “ when entrance to Pakistan was banned to Americans , Christians and Jews , ” proof that he gave up his American citizenship .
In October 2008 , when * Berg v. Obama et al * was dismissed for lack of standing , the attorney told sympathetic reporters that the DNC had “ admitted ” the truth about Obama ’s citizenship by not rebutting his claims .
Joseph Sandler , who filed motions to dismiss Berg ’s case and other Obama citizenship lawsuits as general counsel , explained why claims like these are never debunked by lawyers for the president .
“ When you file a motion to dismiss , to try to get the case thrown out before any factual inquiry is made , the facts that the plaintiffs put into their complaint are assumed to be true , ” said Sandler .
“ You have to show that even if the facts were true , they do n’t have a case . ”
As a result of that , extremely questionable theories and “ facts ” have become linchpins of ‘ birther ’ theories .
‘ Birthers ’ who refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of Obama ’s Certificate of Live Birth often cite the expertise of “ Dr. Ron Polarik , ” a self - described “ expert in computer graphics ” who maintains a blog at Townhall.com and has recorded a video , in which his face and voice are blurred , explaining how the image was “ forged ” with Adobe Photoshop .
“ Polarik ” submitted an affidavit in support of Orly Taitz ’s Keyes case that is signed “ XXXXXXXXXXX , ” making it inadmissible .
“ If it ever comes down to it , ” explained Gary Kreep , another lawyer for Keyes , “ we ’ll use his real name . ”
Some anti-Obama claims take the issue entirely out of the hands of the president or Hawaii officials .
Carl Swensson , a conservative activist from Georgia , has organized “ Citizens ’ Grand Juries ” that have indicted the president for treason .
Mario Apuzzo , a New Jersey attorney , has sued Obama on the grounds that he never was , and never could be , a “ natural born ” citizen .
Both men pass over precedent for “ The Law of Nations , ” the 1758 treatise by the 18th century French scholar Emerich de Vattel .
In one translation , de Vattel writes that “ the natives , or natural - born citizens , are those born in the country , of parents who are citizens . ”
That ’s enough for some Obama ‘ birthers ’ to say that Obama might be a citizen of Kenya–as one constituent of Rep. Mike Castle ( R - Del . ) put it –but he cannot be a natural born citizen of the United States .
“ It ’s what the founding fathers used , ” explained Swensson .
Constitutional scholars consider this a dubious argument at best .
“ The framers of the 14th Amendment thought about this , ” explained Elizabeth Wydra , chief counsel for the Constitutional Accountability Center .
“ They wanted to make sure that the children of slaves who were brought here illegally , slaves who were brought into this country after the end of the slave trade , would be citizens . ”
Apuzzo is not convinced .
He argued that the founders wrote the phrase “ natural born citizen ” for a reason ; to make sure that no one with “ blood ties ” to another country could become president .
He speculated what might happen if Gov. Bobby Jindal ( R - La. ) , whose parents were Indian , became president .
“ India is a nuclear power .
Here comes the president , who says we have to go in and attack Pakistan .
Are we doing that because we are defending India ’s interests ?
You just do n’t know .
You ca n’t have Constitutional rule if you allow this . ”
Because of the dismissal tactics used by lawyers for the president , John McCain , and both political parties , believers in these various theories and readings of the Constitution argue that they have never been proven wrong .
Although Rep. John Campbell ( R - Calif . ) explained his support of a House bill that would require copies of birth certificates from presidential candidates by saying it would “

WHY PROGRAMMING IS A GOOD MEDIUM FOR EXPRESSING POORLY UNDERSTOOD AND SLOPPILY­FORMULATED IDEAS
Marvin Minsky
MIT
This is a slightly revised version of a chapter published in Design and Planning II -- Computers in Design and Communication , ( Martin Krampen and Peter Seitz , eds. ) , Visual Committee Books , Hastings House Publishers , New York , 1967 .
There is a popular , widespread belief that computers can do only what they are programmed to do .
This false belief is based on a confusion between form and content .
A rigid grammar need not make for precision in describing processes .
The programmer must be very precise in following the computer grammar , but the content he wants to be expressed remains free .
The grammar is rigid because of the programmer who uses it , not because of the computer .
The programmer does not even have to be exact in his own ideas‑he may have a range of acceptable computer answers in mind and may be content if the computer 's answers do not step out of this range .
The programmer does not have to fixate the computer with particular processes .
In a range of uncertainty he may ask the computer to generate new procedures , or he may recommend rules of selection and give the computer advice about which choices to make .
Thus , computers do not have to be programmed with extremely clear and precise formulations of what is to be executed , or how to do it .
=====
The argument presented here is not specifically about " design , " but about the general question of what we can get computers to help us do .
For a number of reasons , it is customary to underestimate the possibilities .
To begin , I want to warn against the pitfall of accepting the apparently " moderate " positions taken by many people who believe they understand the situation .
Science‑fiction writers , scientists of all descriptions , economic forecasters , psychologists , and even logicians tell us often , and make it a convincing tale , that computers will never really think .
" We must not fall into anthropomorphic ways of thinking about machines ; they do only what their programs say ; they can't be original or creative . "
We have all heard these views , and most of us accept them .
It is easy to understand why a humanist will want to rhapsodize about the obscurity of thought processes , for there is an easy non sequitur between that obscurity and the desired an anthropomorphic uniqueness .
But this is n't the non sequitur important here .
The fallacy under discussion is the widespread superstition that we can't write a computer program to do something unless one has an extremely clear , precise formulation of what is to be done , and exactly how to do it .
This superstition is propagated at least as much by scientists — and even by " computer scientists " — as by humanists .
What we are told , about the limitations of computers , usually takes this general form : " A computer can not create .
It can do only exactly what it is told .
Unless a process is formulated with perfect precision , you cannot make a computer do it . "
Now this is perfectly true in one sense , and it is absolutely false in another .
Before explaining why , it is interesting to note that ‑ long before computers ‑ the same was said of the Devil : he could only appear to be creative .
In the September 1966 issue of Scientific American , I discussed three programs : one is the checkers program of Samuel , which plays at the master level .
Another is the ANALOGY program of Evans , which does rather well on certain intelligence ‑test problems of recognizing analogous relations between geometric figures .
The third is the program " STUDENT " of Bobrow , which takes high school algebra " story " problems given in English :
Mary is twice as old as Ann was when Mary was as old as Ann is now .
If Mary is 24 years old , how old is Ann ?
and solves some , but not all of them .
In that article I was concerned with problems of going further , to extend such work in the direction of more versatile general intelligence .
But for my purpose here , they can serve as adequate examples even in their present state , for while limited in what they can handle , they already do enough to confound the old comfortable superstitions .
The old view is that a program is " nothing but " a set of rigid rules for exactly what to do in each situation .
This is indeed a useful point of view for reassuring beginners at programming , or for analyzing the programs written by beginners .
However , for more advanced processes , while " perfectly " true in one sense , it would be as correct to say that " houses are nothing but arrangements of construction materials " or " books are merely long strings of words . "
Indeed , a review of my Scientific American article ( in Computer Reviews 8 , 1 , Jan. 1967 ) asserts that these programs are made of " dictionary lookup routines , sequences of search and comparison functions , and sort - merge type operations . "
LOGIC AND CONSISTENCY
Let me begin by discussing one of the skeptical attitudes that is derived from some statements of good logicians and bad philosophers .
We are told that certain theorems about proving the self ‑consistency of logical systems have the consequence : " It is impossible to mechanize completely the process of discovery and therefore humans will always have the advantage over machines . "
I am sure almost every reader has heard of Godel 's theorem , and most have heard of this alleged consequence .
But this is not a logical consequence , for it is based on a careless technical oversight .
If applicable at all to the problem ‑solving question , Godel 's theorem applies strictly only to perfectly self ‑consistent logical systems .
People are not this consistent , and there is no reason whatever why we should feel constrained to build our machines along such lines .
Instead we can , and already do , build machines that can tolerate contradictory factual assertions .
To do this , we have to add selection rules for resolving contradictions , priority hierarchies for choosing between incompatible statements , and the like .
A simple example of such a scheme is described in Bertram Raphael 's 1964 MIT PhD dissertation .
Here is an example of a dialog with that program :
à EVERY BOY IS A PERSON
( I UNDERSTAND )
à A FINGER IS PART OF A HAND
( I UNDERSTAND )
à EACH PERSON HAS TWO HANDS
THE ABOVE SENTENCE IS AMBIGUOUS •• PLEASE REPHRASE IT )
à THERE ARE TWO HANDS ON EACH PERSON
( I UNDERSTAND )
à HOW MANY FINGERS DOES JOHN HAVE ?
( I DON'T KNOW WHETHER FINGER IS PART OF JOHN )
à JOHN IS A BOY
( I UNDERSTAND )
à HOW MANY FINGERS DOES JOHN HAVE ?
( HOW MANY FINGERS PER HAND ? )
à EVERY HAND HAS 5 FINGERS )
( I UNDERSTAND )
à HOW MANY FINGERS DOES JOHN HAVE ?
( THE ANSWER IS 10 )
à HOW MANY AUTOMOBILES DOES JOHN HAVE ?
THE ABOVE SENTENCE IS AMBIGUOUS .
PLEASE RE - PHRASE IT )
à WHO IS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ? )
( STATEMENT FORM NOT RECOGNIZED )
à THE B0Y IS JUST TO THE LEFT OF THE TABLE
( G02840 IS A TABLE )
( I UNDERSTAND )
à THE LAMP IS JUST TO THE LEFT OF THE TABLE
( G02841 IS A LAMP )
( THE ABOVE STATEMENT IS IMPOSSIBLE )
à THE TABLE IS TO THE RIGHT OF THE CHAIR
( G02842 IS A CHAIR )
( I UNDERSTAND )
à WHAT IS THE RELATIVE POSITION OF A PERSON ?
( THE LEFT -TO - RIGHT ORDER IS AS FOLLOWS )
( CHAIR BOY TABLE ) )
Raphael 's knowledge ‑collecting , question ‑answering system shows how it gives higher priority to particular facts when they conflict with general principles .
This " Exception Principle " is , of course , a rather simple ‑minded way to resolve contradictions , and it can be only used when there is a clear difference in level of generality between the statements .
When they are on the same level , the program simply rejects the later statement , as seen here :
à THERE ARE 5 FINGERS ON EVERY HAND )
( I UNDERSTAND )
à THERE ARE TWO HANDS ON A PERSON
( I UNDERSTAND )
à A BOY IS A PERSON
( I UNDERSTAND )
à TOM IS A BOY
( I UNDERSTAND )
à DICK IS A BOY
( I UNDERSTAND )
à HARRY IS A BOY
( I UNDERSTAND )
à TOM HAS NINE FINGERS
( THE ABOVE SENTENCE IS AMBIGUOUS •• BUT I ASSUME ( HAS ) MEANS ( HAS AS PARTS ) )
( I UNDERSTAND )
à DICK HAS ONE HAND
( THE ABOVE SENTENCE IS AMBIGUOUS •• BUT I ASSUME ( HAS ) MEANS ( HAS AS PARTS ) )
( I UNDERSTAND )
à HOW MANY FINGERS DOES TOM HAVE ?
( THE ANSWER IS 9 )
à HON MANY FINGERS DOES DICK HAVE ?
( THE ANSWER IS 5 )
à HOW MANY FINGERS DOES HARRY HAVE ?
( THE ANSWER IS 10 )
à HOW MANY FINGERS DOES JOE HAVE ?
( I DON ’T KNOW WHETHER FINGER IS PART OF JOE )
But of course Raphael could have written some other priority rule .
Incidentally , the program 's statement , " The above sentence is ambiguous ... " concerns the possibility that the word " has " might mean either " has as a part " or " owns . " Raphael 's program usually guesses correctly by a study of whether the entities in question are already known to own things , or to be parts of things , etc .
I will describe this later in more detail .
Raphael 's demonstration that such " contextual " decisions can be programmed , illustrates a more general point , or rather , shows a different and healthier attitude toward programs than the " nothing but " approach .
We will therefore try to explain some of these better ways to think about programs .
(1) A PROGRAM AS A SEQUENCE OF INSTRUCTIONS TO BE OBEYED .
The most common and simple ‑minded view is that a computer program is a sequence of clear - cut operations to be performed on some data .
Let 's take a simple example of a program : suppose that X is a number given as input :
START : SET R = 1
LOOP : SET S = X /
R
SET T=R+S
SET R = T/
2
SET U = R x R
SET V = X - U
IF |V| > .001 , GO TO LOOP
ELSE PRINT V
This program ( attributed to Isaac Newton ) will compute an approximation to the square root of X .
At each line in the program it is perfectly clear what is the current status of things , and what is to be done next .
Of course , it requires a mathematical analysis , to show that the sequence of situations so developed will eventually lead to an acceptable value of R , and terminate the computation . '
So there is no great harm in thinking of these statements as a sequence of steps .
The " GO TO " instruction might be considered to be a super‑abbreviation for several more copies of the " main loop . "
Of course , until the analysis is made , one should think of the program as an expression of a useful but poorly understood idea .
(2) A PROGRAM AS A COURT OF LAW
In Raphael 's program , it has to be decided whether " has " means " owns " or " has as parts " when a statement of the form " x has y " is encountered :
à JOHN IS A PERSON )
( I UNDERSTAND )
à DICK IS A PERSON )
( I UNDERSTAND )
à A CHAIN IS PART OF A BICYCLE
( I UNDERSTAND )
à THE POWER - SAW HAS A CHAIN
( THE ABOVE SENTENCE IS AMBIGUOUS •• BUT I ASSUME ( HAS ) MEANS ( HAS AS PARTS ) )
( I UNDERSTAND )
à JOHN OWNS A CHAIN
( I UNDERSTAND )
à DICK HAS A CHAIR
( THE ABOVE SENTENCE IS AMBIGUOUS •• BUT I ASSUME ( HAS ) MEANS ( HAS AS PARTS ) )
à THE CUCKOO - CLOCK HAS A CHAIN
( THE ABOVE SENTENCE IS AMBIGUOUS •• PLEASE REPHRASE IT )
The problem , when recognized , is transmitted to a part of the program that is able to review all that has happened before .
This sub‑program makes its decision on the following basis :
(1) Is y already known to be part of some other thing ?
Or is y a member of some set whose members are known to be parts of something ?
(2) Is y known to be owned by something , or is it a member of some set whose members are known to be owned by something ?
(3) If exactly one of ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) is true , make the choice in the corresponding direction .
If neither holds , give up and ask for more information .
If both are true , then consider the further possibilities at ( 4 ) below .
( Thus the program uses evidence about how previously acquired information has been incorporated into its " model " of the world . )
(4) If we get to this point , then y is known already to be involved in being part of something and in being owned and we need a finer test .
Let U1 and U2 be the " something " or the " some set " that we know exists , respectively , in the answers to questions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .
These depend on‑ y .
We now ask : is x a member of , or a subject of U1 or U2 ?
If neither , we give up .
If one , we choose the corresponding result ‑" part of " or " owns . "
If both , we again give up and ask for more information .
As Raphael says :
" These criteria are simple , yet they are sufficient to enable the program to make quite reasonable decisions about the intended purpose in various sentences of the ambiguous word " has . "
Of course , the program can be fooled into making mistakes , e.g. , in case the sentence , " Dick has a chain , " had been presented before the sentence , " John owns a chain , " in the above dialogue .
However , a human being exposed to a new word in a similar situation would make a similar error .
The point here is that it is feasible to automatically resolve ambiguities in sentence meaning by referring to the descriptions of the words in the sentence ‑descriptions which can automatically be created through proper prior exposure to unambiguous sentences . "
Thus , the program is instructed to attempt to search though its collection of prior knowledge , to find whether x and y are related , if at all , more closely in one or the other way .
This " part " of the program is best conceived of as a little trial court , or as an evidence ‑collecting and evidence - weighing procedure .
It is not good to think of it as a procedure directly within a pre‑specified sequence of problem solving , but rather as an appeal court to consult when the program encounters an inconsistency or ambiguity .
Now when we write a large program , with many such courts , each capable if necessary of calling upon others for help , it becomes meaningless to think of the program as a " sequence . "
Even though the programmer himself has stated the " legal " principles which permit such " appeals , " he may have only a very incomplete understanding of when and where in the course of the program 's operation these procedures will call on each other .
And for a particular " court , " he has only a sketchy idea of only some of the circumstances that will cause it to be called upon .
In short , once past the beginner level , programmers do not simply write ' sequences of instructions ' .
Instead , they write for the individuals of little societies or processes .
For try as we may , we rarely can fully envision , in advance , all the details of their interactions .
For that , after all , is why we need computers .
(3) A PROGRAM AS A COLLECTION OF STATEMENTS OF ADVICE
The great illusion shared not only by all terrified humanists but also by most computer " experts , " that programming is an inherently precise and rigid medium of expression , is based on an elementary confusion between form and content .
If poets were required to write in units of fourteen lines , it would n't make them more precise ; if composers had to use all twelve tones , it would n't constrain the overall forms ; if designers had to use only fourth order surfaces no ‑one would notice it much !
It is humorous , then , to find such unanimity about how the rather stiff grammar of ( the older ) programming language makes for precision in describing processes .
It 's perfectly true that you have to be very precise in your computer grammar ( syntax ) to get your program to run at all .
No spelling or punctuation errors are allowed !
But it 's perfectly false that this makes you have a precise idea of what your program will do .
In FORTRAN , if you want your program to call upon some already written procedure , you have to use one of the fixed forms like " GO TO . "
You ca n't say " USE , " or " PROCEED ON TO , " etc. , so the syntax is stiff .
But , you can " GO TO " almost anything , so the content is free .
A worse fallacy is to assume that such stiffness is because of the computer !
It 's because of the programmers who specified the language !
In Bobrow 's STUDENT program , you could type once and for all , if you wish , " USE ALWAYS MEANS GO TO " and in simple situations it would then allow you to use " USE " instead of " GO T0 . "
This is , of course , a trivial example of flexibility , but it is a point that most people do n't appreciate : FORTRAN 's stiffness is , if anything , derived from the stiffness superstition , not an instance of some stiffness fact !
For an example of a modern system with more flexibility , a programming language called PILOT , developed by Warren Teitelman ( Ph.D. dissertation , MIT , 1966 ) , allows the programmer to make modifications both in his programs and in the language itself , by external statements in the ( current version of ) the language .
We can often think of these as " advice " rather than as " program , " because they are written at odd times , and are usually conditionally applied in default situations , or as a consequence of previous advice .
An example is the following typed in while developing a program to solve problems like the well ‑known " missionaries and cannibals " dilemma ‑ the one with the boat that holds only two people , etc :
Tell progress , if m is a member of side ‑1 and m is a member of side ‑2 and ( countq side ‑ 1 m ) is not equal to ( countq side ‑ 1 c ) , then quit .
( An earlier collection of advice statements to the input system has been used to produce the reasonably humanoid input syntax . )
The program is a heuristic search that tries various arrangements and moves , and prefers those that make " progress " toward getting the people across the river .
Teitelman writes the basic program first .
But the missionaries get eaten , and the above " advice " says to " modify the progress ‑measuring part of the program to reject moves that leave unequal numbers of missionaries and cannibals on the sides of the river . "
As Teitelman says :
This gives the eating conditions to PROGRESS .
It is not sufficient to simply count and compare , because when all of the cannibals are on one side with no missionaries , they do outnumber the missionaries 3 to 0 .
However , nobody gets eaten .
The point , however , is not in the relaxation of syntax restrictions , but in the advice ‑like character of the modification just made in the program .
The " tell progress " statement can be made without knowing very much about how " progress " works already or where it lies in the " program . "
It may already be affected by other advice , and one might not have a clear idea of when the new advice will be used and when it will be ignored .
Some other function may have been modified so that , in certain situations , " progress " wo n't get to evaluate the situation at all , and someone might get eaten anyway .
If that happened , the outsider would try to guess why .
He would have the options ( 1 ) of thoroughly understanding the existing program and " really fixing " the trouble , or ( 2 ) of entering anew advice statement describing what he imagines to be the defective situation and telling the program not to move the missionary into the position of being eaten .
When a program grows in power by an evolution of partially ‑understood patches and fixes , the programmer begins to lose track of internal details and can no longer predict what will happen — and begins to hope instead of know , watching the program as though it were an individual of unpredictable behavior .
This is already true in some big programs , but as we enter the era of multiple ‑console computers , it will soon be much more acute .
With time ‑sharing , large heuristic programs will be developed and modified by several programmers , each testing them on different examples from different consoles and inserting advice independently .
The program will grow in effectiveness , but no one of the programmers will understand it all .
( Of course , this wo n't always be successful ‑the interactions might make it get worse , and no one might be able to fix it again ! )
Now we see the real trouble with statements like " it only does what its programmer told it to do . "
There is n't any one programmer .
LATITUDE OF EXPRESSION AND SPECIFICITY OF IDEAS
Finally we come to the question of what to do when we want to write a program but our idea of what is to be done , or how to do it , is incompletely specified .
The non sequitur that put everyone off about this problem is very simple :
Major Premise :
If I write a program it will do something particular , for every program does something definite .
Minor Premise : My idea is vague .
I do n't have any particular result in mind .
Conclusion : Ergo , the program wo n't do what I want .
So , everyone thinks , programs are n't expressive of vague ideas .
There are really two fallacies .
First , it is n't enough to say that one does n't have a particular result in mind .
Instead , one has an ( ill - defined ) range of acceptable performances , and would be delighted if the machine 's performance lies in the range .
The wider the range , then , the wider is one 's latitude in specifying the program .
This is n't necessarily nullified , even when one writes down particular words or instructions , for one is still free to regard that program as an instance .
In this sense , one could consider a particular written - down story as an instance of the concept that still may remain indefinite in the author 's mind .
This may sound like an evasion , and in part it is .
The second fallacy turns around the assertion that I have to write down a particular process .
In each domain of uncertainty 1 am at liberty to specify ( instead of particular procedures ) procedure ‑generators , selection rules , courts of advice concerning choices , etc .
So the behavior can have wide ranges ‑it need never twice follow the same lines , it can be made to cover roughly the same latitude of tolerance that lies in the author 's mind .
At this point there might be a final objection : does it lie exactly over this range ?
Remember , I 'm not saying that programming is an easy way to express poorly defined ideas !
To take advantage of the unsurpassed flexibility of this medium requires tremendous skill ‑technical , intellectual , and esthetic .
To constrain the behavior of a program precisely to a range may be very hard , just as a writer will need some skill to express just a certain degree of ambiguity .
A computer is like a violin .
You can imagine a novice trying first a phonograph and then a violin .
The latter , he says , sounds terrible .
That is the argument we have heard from our humanists and most of our computer scientists .
Computer programs are good , they say , for particular purposes , but they are n't flexible .
Neither is a violin , or a typewriter , until you learn how to use it .

Members of the UHI research team studying schizophrenia and diabetes Researchers believe gluten - rich foods could help trigger schizophrenia in people with a genetic predisposition to the mental condition .
The protein is found in cereal grains which are used to make bread and pasta .
Scientists at Inverness - based UHI have been studying the role of gluten in schizophrenia and diabetes and also links between the two illnesses .
The researchers said sufferers ' bodies were unable to handle gluten resulting in damage to healthy tissue .
Two projects investigating the links between schizophrenia and diabetes and the part played by gluten were being run at UHI , the prospective University of the Highlands and Islands .
A simple change in diet might prevent these diseases developing in some individuals
Prof Ian Megson
It has been supported by a £ 300,000 funding grant from the Schizophrenia Association of Great Britain ( SAGB ) Prof Ian Megson , head of the UHI department of diabetes and cardiovascular science , said : " This research is at an early stage , but if the theory is correct and those at risk are identified very early in life , a simple change in diet might prevent these diseases developing in some individuals . "
Dr Jun Wei , a senior researcher and reader in genetics , said an individual 's inherited genes , together with factors from the environment in which they have lived , were now considered to be central to development of both schizophrenia and diabetes .
He added : " Gluten is one such environmental factor .
" More than 30 % of schizophrenia sufferers have high levels of antibodies against wheat gluten in their body so a gluten - free diet might help to reduce the symptoms of this mental condition .
" We are also investigating if gluten acts as a trigger for schizophrenia in people who have a genetic predisposition to it . "
Last year , researchers at UHI and other institutions began trying to better understand how eating porridge , oatcakes and muesli could help people with type 2 diabetes .
Sixty volunteers were sought to eat an oat - rich diet in trials .
Scientists based in Inverness and Aberdeen believed the cereal could help control the side effects of type 2 .
These side effects can lead to killer illnesses including heart disease .

( updated File Details Version : The Conquerors 1.0c Number of scenarios : 6 THE STORY
In this campaign you will step into a dead man 's shoes .
You will be part of a mad hermit 's tale .
A tale of hatred and vendetta , of schemes and noble motives ... and of guilt .
Not only will your battle skills be challenged .
You will be challenged to follow Ulio on his way into his downfall , and to only leave him behind at the very end .
You 'll be the actor , you 'll be the spectator .
And you 'll be the judge .
No radiant victory waits at the end ... only clarity about Ulio 's fate .
THE GAME
Important : Sound files are a must for this campaign , unless you want to miss a lot of the experience .
They are divided into zips of roughly 1,3 MB each , so that each of them fits on one floppy disk .
You can get the music files here :
Sound File 1
Sound File 2
Sound File 3
Sound File 4
Sound File 5
Ulio 3.0 also has new sound files for the 3rd person narrator .
Those files are optional :
UlioNarrator1.zip
UlioNarrator2.zip
The other sound files ( 1 - 5 ) have not changed .
If you already downloaded them earlier , you do n't need to download them again .
If you wonder whether to download the voice files or not , the Ulio 3.0 zip contains one voice sample , which plays after the first battle in the Foundling .
The campaign also plays the Attack on Murron soundfile that comes along with Mark Stoker 's classic " Tamerlane , Prince of Destruction " campaign .
If you have n't got that campaign yet , I can heartily recommend it .
Thanks to Mark for allowing me to use that file !
The campaign contains two cutscene scenarios and four playable scenarios .
Style : " Storyteller campaign " .
A mix of Cutscene / Fixed Force / Role Playing .
B&D elements are minimal , you wo n't build a single building - only train units at existing ones .
The playable scenarios are difficulty - level - dynamic .
You should have at least some gaming experience even if you play on Standard .
If you are quite familiar with the game and experienced at battle tactics and micromanagement , Moderate will offer you a good challenge .
If you like to test your gaming skills to the maximum , check out the Hard level .
INSTALLING THE FILES
Unzip the campaign file and all soundfiles into your Age of Empires II folder .
They should go into the right directories .
CHANGES IN ULIO 3.0
- Sound files for narrator are included as extra zips ( see above ) .
- New soundfiles for the dream in the Lion & Cat scenario are in the Ulio 3.0 zip file .
- Some typos have been fixed .
- Foundling : The " Barracks with Child inside " gets renamed again after the battle .
- Lion & Cat : Punishment for Ulio if he walks away from the village ( - 10 hp ) .
- Triangle : Fast players who went North could still end up with the general circling in the arena .
Fixed .
- Epilogue : Younger and elder traveler got mixed up at the beginning .
Fixed .
MISCELLANEOUS
Here are some things which were new to me when I made them :
Probably the first movie - like scrolling text on the screen ; a developed version of the Pyromaniac 's rain trick ; thunder & lightning and other effects with light and shadow ; a well ; some slightly altered town centers ; a touchy general ; armies moving , stopping and moving again in formations ; an armed villager ( static ) ; impaled people ; sneaking up upon a guard ; a stampede ; sea gates and sea towers on solid ground ; alert watchtowers with fast - footed watchmen ; a slippery hill ; a nightmare sequence with burning ghosts and lost souls ; entering an enemy castle , and a couple more .
This campaign has been tested by many people , so most bugs should have been found and fixed .
However , if you do encounter any more bugs , please email me at van-thiel@web.de , so that I can look into them .
Thanks again to everyone who playtested the campaign for me !
The names of the playtesters are listed in the Aftermath message of the Epilogue scenario .

Ulio has all the necessary components : good characters enlightening us to the mystery of the campaign , puzzles , a complex story that unfolds over the course of the game , and no standard way for the character to be brought to light .
( There are many ways to loose the game not just by being killed ) .
Ulio tells the story of , a young man who is faced with a great many of troubles well wandering the country side .
As well as Ingo ’s campaign giving an interesting story he does a good job of giving his puzzles real context and giving you real motivation to solve them -- if you do n't , you will never be able to get clarity .
The story starts with a short well engineered cut scene .
With no extensive opening sequence this makes it all not overly dramatic .
Ingo deserves credit for taking such a cinematic approach and succeeding , no problems mar the storytelling .
The cut scene direction in the story look ’s great .
The scenes themselves do n’t suffer from being overly lengthy to the point of tedium .
It has fine - tuned , well - balanced game play , it 's got a quick pace , it 's got some new game play twists that should surprise even the most hard - core Ager ’s , and it 's simply a lot of fun .
The candy in the campaign is wonderful , and adds to the game as it is well designed you wo n’t be grumbling about it .
Ingo has assured us that everything is exactly where he wants it .
The campaign is not a resource hog and it is very easy to get into .
I found it very addicting to say the least I could not stop until I had completed all of the scenarios .
Ingo ’s creativity flourishes with new ideas on every turn including a very well done marching army .
If you like this sort of campaign point your mouse over to the download button ( Now ) .
After all it is free :-) .

PLAYABLILITY :
The playability was nearly perfect !
I did n't find any bugs whatsoever and everything flowed smoothly from start to finish , begining with a short intro .
The only gripe I have is that its often hard to make it load the right scenario and takes four or five times through clicking and quitting out before it works .
It 's a bug in the game and there 's nothing to be done about it .
BALANCE :
This campaign was very hard , but still beatable .
I honestly never made it past the battle in The Lion and the Cat on moderate difficlulty , but I standard I had no trouble .
Many fights are also nearly impossible to win with brute force .
For example , in the last scenario , there is a slippery hill .
You can spike your boots and then lure your enemies to fall down the hill .
I once managed to win that fight with no caualties until I had to deal with the siege weapon and tower .
CREATIVITY :
You will see all kinds of creative elements in this campaign such as sneaking up on a guard , a horse stampeede , a joust , a nightmare , a slippery hill which people break their necks on if they fall down , a new way of doing enterable buildings without having to change the view , an army that moves in formation , and various other things ( play it and see for yourself , I 'm not spoiling the fun ) .
MAP DEGISN :
The map degisn in this campaign is ashtonishinly good .
The snow terrains are ok , but the temperate areas are very pleasing to the eye , though not too complicated and cluttered , like many campaigns .
STORY / INSTRUCTIONS :
This campaign has one of the best stories I 've ever seen in AOK .
Unlike most , there is no glory waiting for you at the end , when you discover the truth about everyhting .
The instructions were detailed , but still left some things for you to figure out yourelf .
+ Points :
~ Great Maps
~ Detailed Story
~ Perfect Balance
~ Many new creative elements
- Points :
~ Ummm ... I did n't find any of these ! :-)
OVERALL :
This is a must download for those who like RPGs and FFs , with a few small B&D elements .
Nevermind , this is a must download no matter what .
Even if you do n't like playing , ( I do n't see how that 's possible , though ) you can learn a lot of new and creative ideas just from looking at the scearios , or even extracting them and examiing the triggers .
I will end with one final comment :
Get downloading and do n't forget the sound packs !

Some people think it might be .
Twitter users started using hashtags - a # followed by a unique bit of text - to help them follow conversations .
Through some eerie demonstration of the hive mind , Twitter users usually come to a consensus on the tag or tags for an event or topic .
As with email and blog trackbacks , anything that becomes successful on the web ultimately becomes the target of spammers .
Users began to notice a few months ago that tweets on popular hashtags often contained marketing messages or links to porn .
Upscale furniture maker Habitat was caught out last month when marketers working for the company used hashtags , even ones related to the disputed Iranian election , to promote its " totally desirable Spring collection " .
Twitter users cried foul , and Habitat apologised .
That has n't stopped less scrupulous companies from continuing to use hashtags for spam .
Hashtags around the death of Michael Jackson often have unrelated commercial messages .
Beyond spam , the internet pranksters of 4 Chan recently " attacked " Twitter ( in the words of some web watchers ) by creating multiple accounts and pushing the hashtag # gorillapenis into the trending topics .
This has led many to ask if the hashtag system is too prone to abuse .
Twitter 's openness has been praised as one of the key reasons behind its meteoric growth .
But is it that openness also an achilles heel ?
Social media blog Mashable wrote : " Trending topics are a great way to find out what 's hot in the Twitterverse , but they 're also a haven for malicious hackers and spammers . "
Of course , not everything slightly off - colour is spam .
Last week the hashtag # MrsSlocombesPussy trended ( at the urging of Jonathan Ross ) after the death of actress Mollie Sugden .
British Twitter users and American fans of Are You Being Served ?
spotted it at once as a tribute to the actor ; others , such as TechCrunch and Mashable thought it was just more pornographic spam , until set straight by their readers .
Some accused Twitter of censoring the hashtag , but Twitter co-founder Biz Stone told appscout.com : " We do n't filter out offensive content from search .
There 's a bug involving hashtagged words with more than 16 characters . "
( MrsSlocombesPussy has 17 . )
But some companies think that Twitter should capitalise on their eagerness to use the sevice to promote their businesses .
Moonfruit , a website building service , has been giving away MacBook Pro laptops in return for tweets with its hashtag .
It trended - but then disappeared .
The company wondered whether Twitter was suppressing it , but was unable to get any confirmation .
Moonfruit's Wendy Tan
White thinks that Twitter is missing a trick .
" This is probably a commercial channel for Twitter in the future . "

There may not be any one answer , but the 800 - pound gorillas in the room are : short - term managerial focus on profits , uncompetitive quality in terms of durability and cost of ownership , and the union 's reluctance to adapt to changing circumstances .
I find it hard to believe that the near - complete meltdown of the U.S. - owned auto industry has elicited such little commentary or reflection .
Even though I expect blatant propaganda from our government and mass media , I am still surprised by the massive spin and general complacency over what is clearly a watershed collapse and a host of new precedents with unforseen consequences .
It 's as if America watches its U.S. - owned auto industry fall and then yawns , changing channels to something more " upbeat . "
The news is both Orwellian and Kafkaesque , coarsely propagandistic and twisted at the same time .
Chrysler , we are told by our president , will emerge stronger , better , more wonderful than ever , etc. Really ?
Based on what ?
Sadly , the company has almost no new models in the works , and has partnered up with another failed auto company in Europe which is essentially propped up by another government ( Italy ) keen on saving a relative handful of high - profile unionized industrial jobs .
Fiat has not sold many cars in the U.S. for the simple reason they are not competitive in price or value .
That a Chrysler / Fiat marriage will quickly create and build vehicles which will compete on price , value and durability with those made in Ohio , Kentucky , Tennesee and elsewhere in the U.S. by Japanese - based manufacturers is a bit of a stretch .
We are also reminded almost gleefully ( or is it desperately ? ) that Ford is still standing , due to raising billions of dollars back when that was still possible , and it 's still selling lots of cars in North America .
That it " only " lost $ 1.4 billion in the last quarter was cause for massive celebration and a tripling of its stock .
Yes , that is good news , but should n't we also be looking at what the collapse of GM and Chrysler means for the entire U.S. - owned industry and the nation as a whole ?
The fact that Ford sold 136,000 vehicles instead of collapsing is good news , but what is the company 's long - term viability ?
And is the survival of one of the Big Three and the reduction of the other two to shadows of their former selves really cause for a sort of weirdly complacent celebration ?
It seems to me that such catastrophic events should be cause for reflection and analysis , not yet another PR - propaganda blitz about how happy - happy it all is .
Here are some observations which may or may not be telling .
I am not an industry insider ; these are only the observations of a one - time resident of Detroit ( summer of ' 68 ) and a tight - fisted / marginalized consumer who has never bought a new car but who has kept in touch with U.S. nameplate vehicles via rentals and family - owned cars .
1 . Much is said about poor management in the Big Three , but less is said about the short - term focus on quarterly profits that characterized their corporate culture .
As I recall , the U.S. automakers paid out bonuses of several thousand dollars each to its unionized workforce when profits were in the billions , so perhaps we should note that the focus on short - term profits might not have been limited to the executive suite and major shareholders .
Maybe we should examine whether the short - term focus on quarterly profits that was certainly part of the Big Three 's demise is itself bankrupt .
Maybe this corporate philosophy is leading American industry to the junkheap because it creates all the wrong incentives and disincentives : an obsession with profits rather than quality , a dearth of long - term planning , a pressure to pay out bonuses and dividends rather than pay down debt and all the rest .
Maybe the collapse of the Big Three is not just an indictment of the Big Three but of Corporate America in general .
The endless propaganda spewed by the financial press never tires of glorifying Corporate America with stories about " the top 100 companies , " the top 50 innovators , the best companies to work for , etc. etc. etc .
Maybe it 's as simple as : those companies with long - term planning and an abhorrence of debt will prosper and all those which focus on short - term profits and acquiring debt will wither .
2 . Most of the profits generated by the Big Three in North America came not from manufacturing vehicles but from financing the sale of those vehicles .
In other words , the auto industry securitized its way to " prosperity " just like the investment banking and housing industries .
When you no longer can make a profit manufacturing a product , then you focus on the profits and fees generated by selling debt to consumers to buy the product .
Is this anyone 's conception of a healthy robust sustainable capitalism ?
3 . The durability of Big Three - manufactured cars was simply not competitive .
The Big Three chose to tout the J.D. Powers reports on the number of defects found per new vehicle as the proper metric for their improved quality ; as a low - income marginalized consumer my metric was more demanding : can this car run for 12 + years with almost no maintenance or repair bills ?
Unfortunately , I do not personally know of any Big Three - manufactured vehicle which lasted past five or six years without incurring major maintenance or repair bills - - often in the thousands of dollars .
The Big Three trucks have a pretty good record of lasting 10 + years with low costs of ownership , but the rest of the fleets have poor records of long - term durability and ownership costs .
This lack of durability of the Big Three vehicles receives almost no visibility .
The fact that a car made by American workers with largely American - made parts in Tennesee lasts a decade or more with virtually no repairs or maintenance required while the 10 - year old Big Three vehicle is either junked or a problem - riddled " beater " is the 800 - pound gorilla in the room few have cared to discuss .
My Dad surrendered his devotion to Ford 's Lincoln Continental only after the company broke his decades - long loyalty by refusing to repair a transmission which failed a few months after the warranty expired .
How can a transmission in the company 's luxury car fail ?
How could the company not see the wisdom of repairing their topline vehicle for a customer who bought and owned their cars for decades ?
In my view , this incident sums up why the Big Three are collapsing : poor quality , poor customer service , and a high cost of ownership .
It 's simply too expensive to buy and own a Big Three car unless you sell it at a hugely depreciated price within the warranty period -- at which point you 've already lost thousands of dollars .
So the last car my Dad bought ( new ) was a Chrysler 300 , that company 's topline vehicle .
Now six years later it is riddled with electrical problems which have cost thousands of dollars to fix .
This is also not unusual .
Meanwhile , the car I bought used that was made by American workers with mostly American parts ( a 1998 Honda Civic ) is in its 11th year of service with virtually no repairs except a faulty sensor we replaced in a few minutes with a tool borrowed from a Kragen Auto Supply .
My experience of European - made cars is also poor when measured in durability and the cost of ownership over 12 years ( 10,000 miles a year for 12 years , as any modern vehicle should be able to last 120,000 miles without costly repairs . )
My Dad's one foray into the Mercedes line ended like all other Mercedes I know of personally : with a $ 4,000 repair bill around year 8 - 10 .
If you walk around any large parking lot in California and tally up the brands of the vehicles , you would find the vast majority are Japanese brands made in the U.S. American trucks are in evidence but there are very few Big Three sedans or even minivans .
The reason is not disloyalty , it 's simple economics : the depreciation of value and long - term ownership costs of Big Three and European brand vehicles are so much higher than the Japanese - brand vehicles that few can afford the Big Three or European brands .
The transmission in my brother 's topline Alfa Romeo just failed after four years , requiring $ 6,000 in repair bills .
Atypical ?
Let 's put it this way : how many times have you personally known a transmission in a U.S. - made Toyota or Honda to fail , ever ?
I drove my 1985 Honda Accord to the wrecking yard after 20 years of service because it no longer passed California 's strict smog tests .
Someone could have pulled the tranny and probably gotten another 20 years out of it .
That trannies in Lincolns and Alfas fail after a few years is incomprehensible .
And do n't even ask about electrical systems .
4 . There are three basic explanations for this decline in durability .
One is that the Big Three relentlessly squeezed their parts suppliers to lower costs , and since that 's all that mattered then the quality of those parts declined -- you get what you pay for .
Meanwhile , the Japanese management philosophy is quite different ; they seek to establish a consortium of parts suppliers which they will work with for years if not decades .
Yes , price matters but quality matters above all else .
The suppliers eventually learn they can make a profit by supplying high - quality parts in quantity to Honda , Toyota , et al .
Poor parts lead to parts failures and durability vanishes .
The second possibility is that the Big three consciously pursued Planned Obsolescence as a guiding strategy , based on the 1950s - 60s - era habit of prosperous U.S. housholds buying a new car every three years .
After all , real income and wealth when measured in constant dollars was rising from 1946 through about 1969 , so the typical American household could afford a new car payment and thus a new car .
Detroit pumped out exciting new models every year , fueling the desire for the " new hot look . "
The release of new models was a national event .
Now , most cars look blandly alike : yet another gorilla in the room few mention as a proximate cause for Detroit 's decline .
The best Big
Three vehicle I 've driven in the past 10 years was a PT Cruiser ; it had good visibility , a clean interior and a decent ride .
And it did n't look like a 1993 econobox dressed up with a rounded rear end like most other cars .
Unfortunately for Detroit , real ( inflation - adjusted ) U.S. household income began slipping in 1970 and has continued sliding ever since .
As interest rates climbed in the 70s and the quality of Detroit 's vehicles visibly slipped , people turned to the Japanese cars partly because they could no longer afford to buy an American car every three years or maintain one that fell apart in a few years .
A " gentleman 's agreement " with the Japanese automakers to limit their imports drove the Japanese companies to build massive capacity in North America .
The third possibility is that the Big Three 's supposed obsession with quality was largely short - term when compared to the Japanese .
Thus the focus turned to reducing defects in new vehicles , not to making those vehicles so they lasted for a decade or longer with little maintenance .
Please read this excerpt from How Detroit Drove Into a Ditch ( Wall Street Journal , Oct. 25 , 2008 ) In Detroit , amid worker alienation and the " blue - collar blues , " Chevies , Fords and Plymouths rattled , rusted and rolled over -- and those were the good ones .
The Ford Pinto's gas tank was prone to explode into flames when the car was hit from the rear , making the Pinto the poster product for corporate callousness .
In 1978 , after three Indiana girls burned to death when their Pinto got rear - ended , Ford became the first company to be indicted for reckless homicide .
The company later was acquitted , but public opinion judged the Pinto guilty .
For all the Pinto 's infamy , perhaps no car better captured America 's decade - long haplessness than the pug-ugly AMC Gremlin , which debuted in 1970 and died -- mercifully -- in 1980 .
The Gremlin 's shape , fittingly , was first sketched out by an American Motors designer on the back of a Northwest Airlines air - sickness bag .
On Aug. 20 , 1979 , 18 - year - old Brad Alty , fresh out of high school in Mechanicsburg , Ohio , was driving his Gremlin to work when the car broke down .
He was two - and - a - half hours late to his first day on the job at a new motorcycle factory that Honda Motor was opening in central Ohio .
For the next few weeks , Mr. Alty and his 63 co-workers did little but sweep floors and paint them with yellow lines .
Then they started building three to five motorcycles a day .
And at the end of each day they would disassemble each bike , piece by piece , to evaluate the workmanship .
Mr. Alty hated it , and he kept getting grief from his older brother for working for a Japanese company .
" I thought I had made a mistake by going to work there , " he recalled recently .
" It was like , ' What the heck am I doing here ? ' " But Mr. Alty stuck with it , and Honda stuck with him .
Honda 's real goal was to build cars in America , but the motorcycle plant allowed it to test the mettle of American workers for a modest investment .
The workers passed the test .
Honda started building Accords in Ohio in November 1982 .
Ironically , some U.S. Honda dealers actually protested that they wanted to sell only Accords made in Japan .
But the quality of the Ohio - made cars was soon confirmed .
If any of the Big Three pursued equivalent efforts to make quality more than a buzzword or marketing pitch , I have yet to read about it .
5 . The UAW continued to act as if the Big Three still held the same quasi- monopoly they 'd enjoyed in the 1950s and 60s .
Exhibit One is the Ford - UAW agreement pictured below .
Is this the agreement of a union fearing the dissolution of the industry and companies which support it ?
Is this the agreement of a union obsessed with lowering costs to enable the companies it depends on to survive and prosper against intense global competition ?
Clearly it is not .
In the context of a quasi - monopoly , perhaps it made sense to demand shorter work weeks and ever - higher pay , benefits and bonuses .
But it seems likely that the UAW failed to consider the long - term consequences of Detroit 's decline in quality when compared to its global competitors , the consequences of American household 's decline in real wages and the consequences of skyrocketing healthcare costs to its three employers .
I 'm not trying to bash the union or its members here ; all I 'm saying is that the union is also an enterprise , and as such it has to adapt to changing realities if it is to survive .

Team Radio Shack apparently new Armstrong , Bruyneel team
Ever since the Giro d'Italia in May , there have been rumors about a new U.S. based team , apparently to feature and be owned by Lance Armstrong and to be run by Johann Bruyneel .
In June , Joe Lindsey ran a story on Bicycling .com detailing contingency plans he said were in place for an Astana financial meltdown , which was narrowly avoided when Kazakh and US sponsors came up with $ 6 million to guarantee support through the end of this season .
Lindsey said the team would have been called the “ Livestrong - Nike ” team .
Just before the Tour , Alexandre Vinokourov had a press conference , where he reminded everyone that Astana was a team built around him , and that he intended to return to the team when his suspension ended July 24th ( tomorrow ) .
Tuesday , Bruyneel announced he would not return to Astana after this season , and Armstrong tweeted about an upcoming announcement of a new sponsor “ for 2010 and beyond . ”
Speculation immediately returned to “ Livestrong - Nike , ” but reporters who had talked to Armstrong 's management team said that would n't be it , apparently with the knowledge that the new sponsor is to be a Ft. Worth , TX - based company .
This morning , Bonnie D. Ford of ESPN tweeted that someone in Capital Sports and Entertainment registered “ teamradioshack.com " this week .
CSE is Armstrong 's management team , overseen by Bill Stapleton and Bart Knaggs , and ran the Discovery Channel team .
I 've verified the domain registration to CSE Cycling , LLC , and that it was set up on Monday .
Currently , www.teamradioshack.com brings up only a default Apache web server page .
The official announcement is reportedly set for noon Eastern .
Update
The team website , Twitter ID ( @teamradioshack ) , and Facebook page are up .
Livestrong.com has a video by Armstrong announcing the team , while Radio Shack offers a standard press release .
Note that no other riders have been officially announced for the team , nor has Bruyneel been officially named the DS .

I think with the summer movie season more than halfway done , we can all agree that the best film of the summer was The Dark Knight .
I mean , Heath Ledger just knocks it out of the- oh wait , that was last year .
This year we got Chris Pine and the rest of that ridiculously attractive Star Trek cast .
In any event , that does n’t stop The Dark Knight merchandise train from chugging along !
Have you ever wanted to dress like Batman ?
Do you feel the need to traverse rooftops at night growling and snarling at your enemies ?
Or do you just want to go to a Halloween party and look absolutely badass ?
If you answered no to any of these questions , you ’re lying to yourself .
Everybody wanted to be Batman , even Aquaman .
Unfortunately , not everyone is an expert with a needle and thread , or in this case Kevlar , so leave it to the folks at Universal Designs to replicate the batsuit from The Dark Knight .
Says the press release , “ An Officially Licensed Replica Like No Other is Coming . ” :
– Strong Cordura Mesh Base with Heavy - duty 4 way stretch Spandex inserts .
– Removable CE Approved Body Armor in both Jacket and Pants
– Highly detailed , removable lightweight interior lining .
– Form Molded Leather and Kevlar Armor Sectons .
– Made from Quality Tanned Cow Hides
I ’m not going to lie .
When I read the quote above , I heard Morgan Freeman ’s voice .
The set comes with a the jacket , pants , gloves , and boots .
In theory , that would mean the cape and cowl are the only pieces you would have to come up with on your own .
Although I ’d bet there ’s a helmet / cowl coming soon .
There ’s no release date for this outfit yet , so I ’d suggest checking the site every once in a while for updates .
Also check out some of the other replicas they have done .
Amazing craftsmanship over there .
Start saving those pennies kids !
By the way , if you see a man running on rooftops in Batman gear , it ’s not me .
I swear .
It ’s not Eric either because he ’s Iron Man .
Image and Information via Universal Designs
The left image , taken with the Hubble Space Telescope , shows the body of M82 in blue and hydrogen gas breaking out from the central starburst in red .
The VLA image ( top left ) clearly shows the supernova ( SN 2008iz ) , taken in May 2008 .
The high - resolution VLBI images ( lower right ) shows an expanding shell at the scale of a few light days and proves the transient source as the result of a supernova explosion in M82 .
An elusive supernovaexplosion , detectable only in radio wavelengths , was discovered last month inthe nearby galaxy M82 .
The object , dubbed SN 2008iz , is the closest supernova discovered by scientists in the pastfive years .
It would have been visible even to amateur telescopes , were it notfor the dense gas and dust surrounding the exploding star , which left itinvisible in every part of the spectrum except the radio wavelengths .
Thesupernova's home galaxy , M82 , is an irregular galaxy in a nearbygalaxy group located 12 million light - years from Earth .
Despitebeing smaller than the Milky Way , it harbors a vigorous central starburst inthe inner few hundred light - years .
In this stellar factory more stars arepresently born than in the entire Milky Way .
M82 isoften called an " exploding galaxy , " because it looks as if being tornapart in optical and infrared images as the result of numerous supernovaexplosions from massive stars .
Many remnants from previous supernovas areseen in radio images of M82 , and a new supernova explosion was long overdue .
Astronomershave been waiting to catch the next big blast for more than 25 years and hadstarted to wonder why the galaxy has been so silent in recent years .
In theend , it took a little digging and looking in the right wavelengths .
The newdiscovery was first made when Andreas Brunthaler of the Max - Planck - Institut furRadioastronomie in Bonn , Germany , examined data from April 8 with the VeryLarge Array ( VLA ) of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory , aninterferometer of 27 identical 25 - meter telescopes in New Mexico .
" Ithen looked back into older data we had from March and May last year , and thereit was as well , outshining the entire galaxy ! "
Brunthaler said .
Radioemission can be detected only from core collapse supernovas , where the core ofa massive star collapses and produces a black hole or a neutron star .
It isproduced when the shock wave of the explosion propagates into dense materialsurrounding the star , usually material that was shed from the massiveprogenitor star before it exploded .
Butobservations of M82 taken last year with optical telescopes to search for newsupernovas showed no signs of this explosion .
The supernova is also hidden onultraviolet and X - ray images .
Thesupernova exploded close to the center of the galaxy in a very denseinterstellar environment , which could explain why M82 has been silent for solong : many of these events may actually be something like " undergroundexplosions , " where the bright flash of light is covered under huge cloudsof gas and dust and only radio waves can penetrate this dense material .
" Thiscosmic catastrophe shows that using our radio telescopes we have a front - rowseat to observe the otherwise hidden universe , " said Heino Falcke of the University of Nijmegen / ASTRON .
Bycombining data from the 10 telescopes of the Very Long Baseline Array ( VLBA ) , the VLA , the Green Bank Telescope in the USA , and the Effelsberg 100 - metertelescope in Germany , using the technique of Very Long Baseline Interferometry ( VLBI ) , the team was able to produce images that show a ring - like structureexpanding at more than 40 million km/h or 4 percent of the speed of light , typical for supernovae .
The teamestimates that the supernova exploded in late January or early February 2008 .
Only three months after the explosion , the ring was already 650 times largerthan Earth ?s orbit around the sun .
Thediscovery will be detailed an upcoming issue of the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters .
Politicians are now talking about cuts .
So gallingly obvious is the need for restraint that even Peter Mandelson last week admitted state spending will be reined - in .
But all the main parties – in cahoots with their banking friends – insist such actions are for the future .
So , for now , the UK 's fiscal and monetary policy remains wildly expansionary – with the wealthy few gaining from that largesse while the general public shoulders the costs in terms of higher taxes and high future inflation .
If such a
state - facilitated wealth transfer took place in a country with hotter weather , we 'd purse our lips and call it kleptocracy .

Scientists discover why we never forget how to ride a bicycle
You never forget how to ride a bicycle – and now a University of Aberdeen led team of neuroscientists has discovered why .
Their research , published this month in Nature Neuroscience , has identified a key nerve cell in the brain that controls the formation of memories for motor skills such as riding a bicycle , skiing or eating with chop sticks .
When one acquires a new skill like riding a bicycle , the cerebellum is the part of the brain needed to learn the co-ordinated movement .
The research team , which includes scientists from the Universities of Aberdeen , Rotterdam , London , Turin and New York , has been working to understand the connections between nerve cells in the cerebellum that enable learning .
They discovered that one particular type of nerve cell – the so called molecular layer interneuron - acts as a " gatekeeper " , controlling the electrical signals that leave the cerebellum .
Molecular layer interneurons transform the electrical signals into a language that can be laid down as a memory in other parts of the brain .
Dr Peer Wulff , who led the research in Aberdeen together with Prof.
Bill Wisden at the University 's Institute of Medical Sciences , said : " What we were interested in was finding out how memories are encoded in the brain .
We found that there is a cell which structures the signal output from the cerebellum into a particular code that is engraved as memory for a newly learned motor skill . "
It could pave the way for advancements in prosthetic devices to mimic normal brain functions , which could benefit those who have suffered brain disorders , such as a stroke or multiple sclerosis .
Dr Wulff said : " To understand the way that the normal brain works and processes information helps the development of brain - computer interfaces as prosthetic devices to carry out the natural brain functions missing in patients who have suffered a stroke or have multiple sclerosis .
" Our results are very important for people interested in how the brain processes information and produces and stores memories .
One day these findings could be applied to the building of prosthetic devices by other research teams . "
This research was funded by the Medical Research Council .

Our health care system is engineered , deliberately or not , to resist change .
The people who pay for it  you and I  often do n’t realize that they ’re paying for it .
Money comes out of our paychecks , in withheld taxes and insurance premiums , before we ever see it .
It then flows to doctors , hospitals and drug makers without our realizing that it was our money to begin with .
The doctors , hospitals and drug makers use the money to treat us , and we of course do see those treatments .
If anything , we want more of them .
They are supposed to make us healthy , and they appear to be free .
What ’s not to like ?
The immediate task facing Mr. Obama  in his news conference on Wednesday night and beyond  is to explain that the health care system does n’t really work the way it seems to .
He wo n’t be able to put it in such blunt terms .
But he will need to explain how a typical household , one that has insurance and thinks it always will , is being harmed .
The United States now devotes one - sixth of its economy to medicine .
Divvy that up , and health care will cost the typical household roughly $ 15,000 this year , including the often - invisible contributions by employers .
That is almost twice as much as two decades ago ( adjusting for inflation ) .
It ’s about $ 6,500 more than in other rich countries , on average .
We may not be aware of this stealth $ 6,500 health care tax , but if you take a moment to think , it makes sense .
Over the last 20 years , health costs have soared , and incomes have grown painfully slowly .
The two trends are directly connected : employers had to spend more money on benefits , leaving less for raises .
It is still unknown why about 40,000 UK women a year give birth prematurely A simple saliva test could help spot which expectant women are likely to go into premature labour , experts believe .
Early identification would enable these mothers to be given steroids which help in the development of the baby 's lungs , preventing disability and death .
UK researchers found women going into labour very early , before 34 weeks gestation , had abnormally low progesterone levels in their saliva .
Their study appears in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology .
Each year in the UK more than 50,000 babies are born prematurely , before 37 weeks gestation , and the condition is still not well understood .
It would be wonderful if in the future we only had to ask a pregnant woman to produce a small sample of saliva to know whether or not she was at risk
Lead researcher Professor Lucilla Poston Experts suspect that the hormone progesterone plays some part and studies are underway to test whether giving women more of this hormone during pregnancy cuts the risk of a preterm birth .
The latest work by researchers at University College London and King 's College London , suggests monitoring progesterone levels in saliva could provide a cheap and convenient early marker for the condition .
When they studied 92 women deemed to be at increased risk of having a preterm birth , they found the women who delivered spontaneously before 34 weeks had much lower salivary levels of progesterone than those giving birth at term , after 37 weeks .
This measurable difference in progesterone was apparent at all gestational ages from 24 weeks onwards .
Simple check
It is not clear how the hormone influences the timing of labour , but experts do know progesterone has anti-inflammatory properties , suggesting low levels of the hormone in the maternal body might contribute to bacterial infection - a recognised cause of preterm birth .
Lead author Professor Lucilla Poston , from the Maternal and Foetal Research Unit at King 's College London , said they were now planning a much larger study to validate these preliminary findings .
" Saliva is easy to collect , there is no need for a needle or a blood sample and it would be wonderful if in the future we only had to ask a pregnant woman to produce a small sample of saliva to know whether or not she was at risk of very early premature birth , " she said .
Jane Brewin of Tommy's , the charity backing the research , said : " We are delighted with the results of this initial study .
Backed by further research , we hope these findings will also have an impact on the development of preventative measures for preterm births . "
Andy Cole of Bliss , the premature baby charity , said : " The development of a reliable test for premature birth is vital in ensuring our most vulnerable babies have the best possible outcomes . "
Dr Yolande Harley from the charity Action Medical Research said : " We welcome any increase in our understanding of what causes premature birth that may ultimately help save babies ' lives . "

I 've been thinking about what kind of souvenir should I give my guest on my wedding .
I remember then , whenever I attend a wedding I often take home souvenirs made of glass figurine , native stuff of pictures of me that I should pay after the reception .
But these souvenirs do n't last for long and often taken for granted .
These days there 's a variety of souvenirs we can choose from for our guest to enjoy .
Since I 've been attending bridal fairs I 've seen a lot of photo booths where in you can have your pictures developed in just a snap .
pictures serves as your souvenir where in guest can take it home with paper frame and printed name or pictures of the couples .
There 's also some photo booths with props that your guest can use for more enjoyable picture taking .
Everybody can enjoy these souvenirs and it's unlimited and free .
But it 's kinda pricey , depending on the number of hours you wish to rent it , luckily my ever gorgeous Tita Bheng will provide us this souvenir as her gift to us , Thanks Tita Bheng love yha !
Here are some of our free photo booths pictures form the bridal fairs that we attended :
( Together with May and Chris our support group )
We really enjoyed it and I 'm sure our guest will definitely have fun with it on our wedding day .
One of the more troubling things to come out of the Siegel / Warners / DC lawsuit decision this week was the feeling that everyone involved in creating Superman stories has already decided that the character is broken .
Is Superman 's failure a self - fulfilling prophecy ?
Advertisement
Perhaps the most damning part of the decision document was the revelation that executives at Warners shared fans ' cynicism about Superman 's potential ( Remember , Warners and DC were the defendants in this case ) :
Defendants ' film industry expert witness , Mr. [ John ]
Gumpert , termed Superman as " damaged goods , " a character so " uncool " as to be considered passe , an opinion echoed by Warner Bros.
business affairs executive , Steven Spira ...
Indeed , Mr. [ Alan ] Horn [ Warner Bros. President ] admitted to being " daunted " by the fact that the 1987 theatrical release of Superman IV had generated around $ 15 million domestic box office , raising the specter of the " franchise [ having ] played out . "
Advertisement
Almost as surreally , DC and Warners apparently argued to the court that
Superman was equivalent [ in terms of public recognition and financial value ] to a low - tier comic book character that appeared mostly on radio during the 1930s and 1940s and that has not been seen since a brief television show in the mid-1960s ( the Green Hornet ) ; an early 20th century series of books ( Tarzan ) or a 1930s series of pulp stories ( Conan ) later intermittently made into comic books and films ; or a television , radio , and comic book character from the 1940s and 1950s , much beloved by my father , that long ago rode off into the proverbial sunset with little - to - no exploitation in film or television for decades ( The Lone Ranger ) .
And these are the people in charge of the character ?!?
There was , of course , legal value in downplaying Superman 's status for WB and DC .
But it 's hard to shake the sense that even the character 's owners do n't understand the value and potential of Clark Kent 's alter ego , or who ( and what ) he is and could be .
But should we really be surprised , considering that these are the same people behind the pedestrian Smallville and almost - there - but - what - the - hell - is - with - the - stalker - thing Superman Returns ?
Advertisement
Superman should , by rights , be up there with Batman .
Certainly , he has the longevity and the high - concept , if not the moral ambiguity - and maybe that 's one of the problems , that Superman 's " goodness , " his moral character and status as a reminder of our own potential , puts people off - to match Gotham 's broodiest citizen .
But what he lacks , and not necessarily for want of trying , is the pop cultural impact that Batman has had ; it 's not that Batman is necessarily a better character , but he 's definitely one who has , at four specific points in the last decades ( and , for the most part , in different ways ) , perfectly synched with the cultural zeitgeist to gain a weird standing as some kind of cultural avatar with a cape .
( Those points , for me , in case you 're wondering : The 1960s TV show , which was less to do with Batman as a character as comic books as a medium , taking the " low art " trappings of the character and milking them for all their worth as pop art was doing the same .
1986 's The Dark Knight Returns and 2008's
The Dark Knight , which both used the character to embody and express paranoia and fear about politics and society in the real world , and 1989's Batman movie , which showed the power of branding , making the movie and the character foremost in everyone 's minds by sheer force of making sure that no - one could turn anywhere without seeing a reminder of it . )
Advertisement
Superman , by comparison , is almost never allowed that level of contemporaneous value by the people telling his ( mass media ) stories , instead finding himself portrayed as either an anachronism due to his values or a naive outsider who does n't fully understand the darker side of human nature ( I have to separate comics from this ; many comic creators such as Geoff Johns , Kurt Busiek and Grant Morrison have tried to demonstrate how Superman can and should work in modern , cynical society ) ; I do n't know whether it's that those making the stories think that that 's how everyone else views Superman and that they should match that , or whether they see the character as someone out of step with modern times , but simply by taking that approach , they limit the impact Superman can have , and prevent him from becoming the success he should be .
( There 's also a third route , as Bryan Singer 's Superman Returns demonstrated : Superman as Jesus .
But the problem with that is that , in order for the story to work as a superhero story , he has to stop turning the other cheek at some point .
If you dropped a couple of " I am floating outside your window " scenes and added some more scenes of derring - do , Returns would 've been a much better movie . )
Advertisement
Here 's the thing : I firmly believe that now should be Superman 's time .
As The Dark Knight took all of our Bush - era worries and concerns and made them into an action movie , so should Superman be around right now to embody Obama 's ( still - resonant , even a year after campaigning ) message of hope and positive change and being the best we can be .
Instead of using Superman 's inherent positivity against him , or thinking that it pushes him out of step with today 's world , focus on the way in which he personifies that which we want to believe in , and the people that we want to be .
If we elected a president because we believed in the ideals of Yes We Can and Hope and Change and all those buzzwords , I refuse to believe that we would n't want to see a movie that sold us the same message but with added punching , flying and action .
Advertisement
( I 've said it before , and I 'll say it again ; Star Trek 's success comes as much from it being positive and colorful and optimistic escapism as it being a good movie , this time around .
Superman has those qualities in spades . )
Is Superman damaged goods ?
To an extent , yes , but he should n't be ; there 's nothing wrong with the character , or the concept , when done right , and I think that the audience is more ready for what he 's selling now than they have been in years .
What damages him most , perhaps , is the attitude from his owners that he 's a problem that they do n't know how to solve .
The first step to stopping him being damaged goods is to stop treating him that way .

Your Daily Isaak : Silence of the Lambs
This was n’t his VERY first part in a movie , but it ’s the first one that people will talk about .
in 1991 , Silence of the Lambs was HUGE when it came out .
Everything about it was groundbreaking .
The imagery , and script became part of the culture so fast , we did n’t know what hit us .
I watch it now , and realize I had forgotten just how intense and just plain , ick ! , this movie really was !!!
So over the top in every way .
I guess it ’s still shocking ?
Story has it , Chris got the part from the director calling HIM and offering it to him .
What ?!?!
Nicely done .
To see Chris Isaak ’s part in the movie ( SWAT Commander ) go here !

Have you been missing out the Illustrator Effects ?
Did you know it is a powerful tool for creating symmetrical shapes or adding texture to vector paths ?
For example , with just one simple effect , you can turn a polygon path into a flower shape .
You can also make paths look sketchy with the Scribble effect .
Read this tutorial to learn how to save time by using Illustrator Effects and work more efficient .
Arrowheads
Let ’s start with a basic effect , the Add Arrowheads .
Use the Pen Tool or Line Segment Tool to draw a straight line .
Go to Effects > Stylize >
Add Arrowheads and choose a style .
Appearance
The great thing about using Illustrator Effect is the ease of changing its appearance .
In the Appearance palette , click on the Add Arrowheads layer , now you can easily change the result by selecting different arrow style .
This effect is very useful for drawing diagrams .
Without The Effect ?
Without the effect , the arrow shape will get distorted when the line is stretched .
With the effect , I can easily adjust the length of the arrow without distorting it .
Round Corners
Draw a rectangle shape , go to Effects > Stylize > Round Corners and enter a radius value .
Without The Round Corners Effect ?
Round Corners is one of my favorite effects .
It is my essential tool for designing icons .
Not only it can prevent the round corners to be distorted when I stretch the object , it also saves me a lot of time .
Could you imagine how long it will take to draw these perfect round corners without the effect ?
Zig Zag Effect
Draw a straight line , go to Effects > Distort & Transform > Zig Zag and enter a value for Size and Ridge Per Segment .
Wavy Line
Draw a straight line , apply the Zig Zag effect , select Smooth Points , and you will get a symmetric wavy line .
Badges
Draw a circle and apply the Zig Zag effect with the setting as shown and you will get a badge shape .
Play around with the Zig Zag options and you may get these shapes :
Pucker & Bloat Effect
Draw a circle , go to Effects > Distort & Transform >
Pucker & Bloat , enter - 55 % ( Pucker ) , and you will get a diamond shape .
Draw a polygon shape , apply the pucker effect , and you will get this shape :
With the same object , change the Pucker & Bloat option to 70 % , and you will get a flower shape .
Transform Effect
The example below shows how I can duplicate 12 copies of the object ( in increment of 30 degree angle ) with the Transform effect .
Play around with the shape and Transform setting , you may get the following :
Roughen Effect
With the Roughen Effect , I can make the trees look more realistic .
Scribble Effect
The example below shows how you can create a sketchy effect combining the Scribble and the Roughen effect .
First apply the Scribble effect ( Effects > Stylize > Scribble ) and then apply the Roughen effect as shown .
Sketchy Icons
If you are constantly using the same effect , it is wiser to use the Graphic Styles to save time and maintain consistency .
After you ’ve done the inital sketchy style , drag the object to the Graphic Styles palette to create a new Graphic Style .
Now , select the object (s ) where you want to apply the styles .
Then , click on the Graphic Style that you ’ve just created .
Change the fill and stroke color if you want .
Do n’t forget you can also apply it to text , which remain editable .
Conclusion ( There Are More … )
I ’ve only showed the basic Illustrator effects .
There are actually more cool and useful effects .
Do n’t be afraid to explore the effect menu and experiment with the other effects such as the Warp and 3D .

Atlantic Yards is really through with Frank Gehry .
An award - winning architect , Mr. Gehry will not be designing any of the 17 buildings planned for the 22 - acre development in Brooklyn on which he has labored for the past six years , a spokesman for the architect confirmed Wednesday .
Last week , the Atlantic Yards developer Bruce C. Ratner revealed that Mr. Gehry had been replaced by the firm Ellerbe Becket as the architect for the project ’s linchpin : a basketball arena for the Nets at the intersection of Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues .
Now comes official word that he will not be the architect for any of the residential or other commercial buildings either .
His designs just cost too much , the developer said .

Marilyn sez , " The East Hampton Library on Long Island wants to add a children 's room , but the East Hampton Village Zoning Board has blocked it for a year , even though the money for the expansion ( $ 4 mil ) has been already been raised by private donations .
What 's their objection to a children 's room at the library ? "
Library Director Dennis Fabiszak has said that the East Hampton Village Board of Zoning Appeals has expressed concern that an expanded children 's collection would lead to more library usage by those who live in the less affluent areas of Springs and Wainscott …
The proposed 6,800 - square - foot addition to a community that includes Martha Stewart , Rudolph Giuliani , and Katie Couric as summer residents would enable the library to add 10,000 additional children 's books to the library 's collection .
Last year , the Long Island library ranked last for books available per child …
The library serves not only the Village of East Hampton but also the less affluent communities of Springs and Wainscott .
During Sony ’s E3 press conference , they confirmed that 50 PS1 classics will be released on the PSN Storewithin the near future .
Among the notables , the long awaited Final Fantasy VII will be released , today .

We tend to hold inventors in high esteem , but often their discoveries were the result of an accident or twist of fate .
This is true of many everyday items , including the following surprise inventions .
1. Play - Doh
One smell most people remember from childhood is the odor of Play - Doh , the brightly - colored , nontoxic modeling clay .
Play - Doh was accidentally invented in 1955 by Joseph and Noah McVicker while trying to make a wallpaper cleaner .
It was marketed a year later by toy manufacturer Rainbow Crafts .
More than 700 million pounds of Play - Doh have sold since then , but the recipe remains a secret .
2. Fireworks
Fireworks originated in China some 2,000 years ago , and legend has it that they were accidentally invented by a cook who mixed together charcoal , sulfur , and saltpeter -- all items commonly found in kitchens in those days .
The mixture burned and when compressed in a bamboo tube , it exploded .
There 's no record of whether it was the cook 's last day on the job .
3. Potato Chips
If you can't eat just one potato chip , blame it on chef George Crum .
He reportedly created the salty snack in 1853 at Moon 's Lake House near Saratoga Springs , New York .
Fed up with a customer who continuously sent his fried potatoes back , complaining that they were soggy and not crunchy enough , Crum sliced the potatoes as thin as possible , fried them in hot grease , then doused them with salt .
The customer loved them and " Saratoga Chips " quickly became a popular item at the lodge and throughout New England .
Eventually , the chips were mass - produced for home consumption , but since they were stored in barrels or tins , they quickly went stale .
Then , in the 1920s , Laura Scudder invented the airtight bag by ironing together two pieces of waxed paper , thus keeping the chips fresh longer .
Today , chips are packaged in plastic or foil bags or cardboard containers and come in a variety of flavors , including sour cream and onion , barbecue , and salt and vinegar .
4. Slinky
In 1943 , naval engineer Richard James was trying to develop a spring that would support and stabilize sensitive equipment on ships .
When one of the springs accidentally fell off a shelf , it continued moving , and James got the idea for a toy .
His wife Betty came up with the name , and when the Slinky made its debut in late 1945 , James sold 400 of the bouncy toys in 90 minutes .
Today , more than 250 million Slinkys have been sold worldwide .
5. Saccharin
Saccharin , the oldest artificial sweetener , was accidentally discovered in 1879 by researcher Constantine Fahlberg , who was working at Johns Hopkins University in the laboratory of professor Ira Remsen .
Fahlberg 's discovery came after he forgot to wash his hands before lunch .
He had spilled a chemical on his hands and it , in turn , caused the bread he ate to taste unusually sweet .
In 1880 , the two scientists jointly published the discovery , but in 1884 , Fahlberg obtained a patent and began mass - producing saccharin without Remsen .
The use of saccharin did not become widespread until sugar was rationed during World War I , and its popularity increased during the 1960s and 1970s with the manufacture of Sweet 'N Low and diet soft drinks .
6. Post - it Notes
A Post - it note is a small piece of paper with a strip of low - tack adhesive on the back that allows it to be temporarily attached to documents , walls , computer monitors , and just about anything else .
The idea for the Post - it note was conceived in 1974 by Arthur Fry as a way of holding bookmarks in his hymnal while singing in the church choir .
He was aware of an adhesive accidentally developed in 1968 by fellow 3 M employee Spencer Silver .
No application for the lightly sticky stuff was apparent until Fry 's idea .
The 3 M company was initially skeptical about the product 's profitability , but in 1980 , the product was introduced around the world .
Today , Post - it notes are sold in more than 100 countries .
7. Silly Putty
It bounces , it stretches , it breaks -- it 's Silly Putty , the silicone - based plastic clay marketed as a children 's toy by Binney & Smith , Inc. During World War II , while attempting to create a synthetic rubber substitute , James Wright dropped boric acid into silicone oil .
The result was a polymerized substance that bounced , but it took several years to find a use for the product .
Finally , in 1950 , marketing expert Peter Hodgson saw its potential as a toy , renamed it Silly Putty , and a classic toy was born !
Not only is it fun , Silly Putty also has practical uses -- it picks up dirt , lint , and pet hair ; can stabilize wobbly furniture ; and is useful in stress reduction , physical therapy , and in medical and scientific simulations .
It was even used by the crew of Apollo 8 to secure tools in zero gravity .
8. Microwave Ovens
The microwave oven is now a standard appliance in most American households , but it has only been around since the late 1940s .
In 1945 , Percy Spencer was experimenting with a new vacuum tube called a magnetron while doing research for the Raytheon Corporation .
He was intrigued when the candy bar in his pocket began to melt , so he tried another experiment with popcorn .
When it began to pop , Spencer immediately saw the potential in this revolutionary process .
In 1947 , Raytheon built the first microwave oven , the Radarange , which weighed 750 pounds , was 51/2 feet tall , and cost about $ 5,000 .
When the Radarange first became available for home use in the early 1950s , its bulky size and expensive price tag made it unpopular with consumers .
But in 1967 , a much more popular 100 - volt , countertop version was introduced at a price of $ 495 .
9. Corn Flakes
In 1894 , Dr. John Harvey Kellogg was the superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan .
He and his brother Will Keith Kellogg were Seventh Day Adventists , and they were searching for wholesome foods to feed patients that also complied with the Adventists ' strict vegetarian diet .
When Will accidentally left some boiled wheat sitting out , it went stale by the time he returned .
Rather than throw it away , the brothers sent it through rollers , hoping to make long sheets of dough , but they got flakes instead .
They toasted the flakes , which were a big hit with patients , and patented them under the name Granose .
The brothers experimented with other grains , including corn , and in 1906 , Will created the Kellogg 's company to sell the corn flakes .
On principle , John refused to join the company because Will lowered the health benefits of the cereal by adding sugar .

Microsoft appears set to offer a discount for families wanting to run Windows 7 on multiple machines .
The deal has not yet been officially unannounced , but has left some users wondering if they 've jumped the gun by already placing their orders for individual copies .
Blogger Kristian Kenney noticed a clause in the licensing agreement for the latest leaked version of Windows 7 's Home Premium edition .
It reads : " b. Family Pack .
If you are a ' Qualified Family Pack User ' , you may install one copy of the software marked as " Family Pack " on three computers in your household for use by people who reside there .
Those computers are the ' licensed computers ' and are subject to these license terms . "
( Source : kristankenney.com )
More Offers Likely to Follow
The license notes that details of who qualifies are available at a Microsoft webpage , though at the moment this defaults to the company 's home page .
Microsoft is n't commenting on the story but says more Windows 7 offers will likely follow both before and after its official release date .
Microsoft did run a Family Pack scheme with Vista , though it worked on a different basis and may not give much insight into the Windows 7 scheme .
For Vista , anyone buying the retail version of Vista Ultimate ( rather than having it pre-installed on a computer ) was eligible to install the Home Premium edition on up to two extra machines for a fee of $ 49.99 per machine .
Price And Availability A Mystery
The two big questions with the Windows 7 scheme are how much it costs , and what people need to do to qualify .
As the scheme is not referred to in licensing agreements for any other editions , it appears to be exclusive to the Home Premium edition which is likely the most popular choice for families .
Ed Bott of ZDNet predicts the pricing will be all - inclusive and cost at or just below the $ 199 Apple charges for its own family pack deals .
( Source : zdnet.com )
If the deal is indeed all - inclusive , the wording of the agreement suggests users would be getting three copies of Windows 7 for a single fee .
One person commenting on Kenney 's blog complains that he 's already pre-ordered three copies , having been unaware of the deal .
If Bott 's prediction is correct , the commenter ( who will have paid $ 150 at the reduced rate for pre-orders ) will still come out ahead .
But whatever the true situation , the confusing range of Windows 7 editions and the lack of clarity over pricing deals are continuing to leave buyers worried they might pay over the odds .
Chris Anderson on the Economics of ' Free ' ' Maybe Media Will Be a Hobby Rather than a Job '
In a SPIEGEL interview , Chris Anderson , the editor in chief of US technology and culture magazine Wired discusses the Internet 's challenge to the traditional press , new business models on the Web and why he would rather read Twitter than a daily newspaper .
( Boston ) - Researchers from Boston University School of Medicine ( BUSM ) and collaborators have discovered and analyzed several new compounds , collectively called the ' ' EUK - 400 series , '' which could someday be used to prevent radiation - induced injuries to kidneys , lungs , skin , intestinal tract and brains of radiological terrorism victims .
The findings , which appear in the June issue of the Journal of Biological Inorganic Chemistry , describe new agents which can be given orally in pill form , which would more expedient in an emergency situation .
These agents are novel synthetic " antioxidants " that protect tissues against the kind of damage caused by agents such as " free radicals . "
Free radicals , and similar toxic byproducts formed in the body , are implicated in many different types of tissue injury , including those caused by radiation exposure .
Often , this kind of injury occurs months to years after radiation exposure .
The BUSM researchers and their colleagues are developing agents that prevent injury even when given after the radiation exposure .
This paper describes a newer class of compounds , the ' ' EUK - 400 series , '' that are designed to be given as a pill .
According to the researchers , experiments described in their paper prove that these agents are orally active .
They also show that the new agents have several desirable " antioxidant " activities , and protect cells in a " cell death " model .
These same BUSM researchers and collaborators had previously discovered novel synthetic antioxidants that effectively mitigate radiation injuries , but had to be given by injection .
" We have developed some of these agents and have studied them for over 15 years beginning with our work at the local biotechnology company Eukarion , " said senior author Susan Doctrow , PhD , a research associate professor of medicine at BUSM's Pulmonary Center .
" These injectible antioxidants are very effective , but there has also been a desire to have agents that can be given orally .
A pill would be more feasible than an injection to treat large numbers of people in an emergency scenario , " she adds .
Future studies will focus on the EUK - 400 compounds ' effects in various experimental models for radiation injury .
Data showing their benefits in models for radiation injury in blood vessel cells have been presented at two major scientific conferences and will be the topic of future publication .
More broadly , beyond the potential for treating victims of radiological terrorism , these compounds could also be useful drugs against a variety of diseases where an effective antioxidant has potential benefits , for example , various neurological , pulmonary , cardiovascular , and autoimmune disorders .
Previously , Doctrow 's lab and others have published studies showing that the injectible versions of these compounds are beneficial in models for several such diseases .
###
Funding for this study was provided by the U.S. Centers for Medical Countermeasures Against Radiation ( CMCR ) program , administered by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .
The study was initiated with CMCR " Pilot Grant " funding awarded to Dr. Rosalind Rosenthal , first author of the paper and currently a research associate at BUSM .
Doctrow 's laboratory at BUSM is a member of a five - institution CMCR program , based at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee .
This is just pathetic :
Lower the medicaid coverage rate from 150 % to 100 % of the fFderal poverty line , 133 % for kids and pregnant women ( once you have the baby , too bad for you )
Subsidies stop at 300 % of the poverty line ( was 400 % )
No Public Option mentioned
Insurance exchanges at the State level
Must buy insurance unless it costs more than 15 % of your income
A fine if you do n't buy insurance unless you 're below the Federal poverty line
For the most part , as Walker discusses , this is about the same as or worse than the plan put forward by America 's Health Insurance Plans ( AHIP ) .
Yes , worse than the insurance industry 's plan .
Remarkable .
Baucus is really earning his campaign donations these days .
Of course , this is only one proposal , and in principle others from the House and other Senate committees could be better , and the better ones could be enacted .
Obama has said he wants a public option , and he may whip for it .
But , if something like this is what comes out as the eventual " reform " it is worse than nothing .
Being forced to buy bad insurance , with huge co-pays without a public option to keep prices in check has as its primary value that it is a subsidy for the insurance companies and that it reduces catastrophic healthcare costs for hospitals , because due to forced purchases of bad plans , some of the folks who used to come in at the last minute , after having not gotten care , and then costing the hospital hundreds of thousands of dollars in emergency care , will be partially paid for .
They 'll still come in last minute and not have been properly cared for since the deductibles will mean they did n't get help , but 70 % or 80 % of their final death - rattle costs will be paid for .
The problem with this plan is that it wo n't control costs .
Without a public option , the insurance companies will have no check on their prices , let alone pressure to actually reduce them .
Because people will be forced to buy bad insurance , they 'll hate the plan , and because " reform " has been passed , we 'll have to wait another 10 or 12 years for another shot .
Obama desperately wants to pass health care " reform " .
The fear is that he may take the easy road , and pass any bill that is " better than nothing " , and that progressives will once again accept the logic that it 's better to get something rather than fight for an actual good bill .
But because Obama does desperately want to pass something , if progressives stand firm in the House or the Senate , and refuse as a bloc to pass anything without a good public option , nothing can pass unless Republicans cross the aisle , which is rather unlikely .
So the answer is to stop being taken for granted .
Stand up for and demand a public option , and refuse to accept a bill which does less .
Do n't let Obama have a cheap victory ; a cheap " medicare reform " .
If he wants it , make him whip for a real bill , a good bill , with a public option .
He whipped for money to bail out banks in Eastern Europe .
He whipped for TARP .
He can whip for a good healthcare bill .
And it wo n't even cost 700 billion .

Hey guys - I have a huge MatLab project to finish today .
So , sorry , but probably no update till tomorrow afternoon .
If I make better headway than I thought , there might be one tonight .
We shall see ...
Thought this was interesting .
I wonder if they 've considered the possibility that Einstein would 've just played Counterstrike all day .
#1 : Know where to look
Not at her boobs ( see Step 3 ) .
Meetings of local or campus atheist groups .
Certain college classes : Political science , Geology , Biology , Philosophy , etc . ( Classes involving small group discussions are a plus . )
Sci -fi conventions
Coffee Shops
Used bookstores
Atheist message boards .
Facebook —
It ’s possible to do a direct search in your network for atheists , agnostics , humanists , and Pastafarians ( seriously ) .
Twitter —
You can search for the term “ atheist ” or connect with friends of known atheists .
YouTube —
If you search for “ atheist , ” you ’ll find that several awesome ladies post videos on there .
Does one live near you ?
Profess your love .
Know that every other person is doing the same thing and you may be rejected or ignored .
The blogosphere —
To the women who blog , we all salute you .
Catholic high schools ( If you ’re over 18 , please ignore this one ) .
# 2 : Try the dating websites
Salon / Nerve / Onion = Great for atheists .
Those sites are all part of the same network .
OKCupid = Good for atheists .
And free !
( How could you not love a site that has a section called “ stalkers ” ? )
Match = Decent for atheists .
e Harmony =
Not so good for atheists .
The founder is a conservative Christian and that does n’t help us .
Plus , those commercials are so damn annoying …
Craigslist =
Would you like some gonorrhea to go with that herpes ?
( Actually , Craigslist is fine … but your best bet is to post your own ad — saying a little bit about yourself and the type of person you ’re looking for — and then learn to weed out the crazies . )
# 3 : Be social .
But do n’t pounce
When you go to atheist gatherings , definitely talk to the ladies .
Try to be smooth .
The problem is n’t that no one talks to the women ; the problem is that way too many people talk to the women … all at once … the moment they step into the room .
And most of the guys are creepy .
Do n’t be one of them .
Look presentable .
Put your glasses on straight .
Suck in the gut .
Shower .
Floss .
Cologne is good when measured in drops .
Do n’t bring up your collection of Star Trek memorabilia .
Save that for the second date .
( Or never … unless she ’s into them , too . )
Do n’t stare at her boobs .
Save that for the third date .
( Or just be subtle . )
# 4 : Looking like this scores you bonus points
Or this :
If you need surgery to make the transformation happen , go for it .
# 5 : Have something to talk about other than atheism
Believe it or not , there are plenty of other topics worth discussing .
We all love meeting someone else who feels the same way about God and astrology and Tom Cruise .
But once that ’s understood , it ’s time to move on .
It ’s also not pleasant to hear someone trashing religious people all night .
Read books , be up - to - date on current events , know how to tell a good story , know something about sports ( better yet , play one ) , listen to music that is n’t on the radio , watch movies that play in only a handful of theaters .
If the Flying Spaghetti Monster comes up in conversation , do n’t attempt a joke about what you do with your noodly appendage .
It will fail .
Bringing up This American Life or Mythbusters scores you bonus points .
# 6 : When not at an atheist gathering , it helps to carry around a New Atheist book
If you ’re sitting in an airport or a coffee shop , just break out that copy of The God Delusion .
You do n’t have to be reading it .
Just look like you ’re reading it .
The atheist ladies will flock to you .
That book is like a Bat signal for the godless .
It also helps to just be public about your atheism .
How will the ladies find you if you ’re closeted ?
Fact :
If you have a Darwin Fish on your car , or a Scarlet A sticker on your computer / manpurse ( murse ? ) , atheist ladies will chase after you .
# 7 : It may be useful to accurately gauge the woman ’s degree of atheism
If it turns out you and she are similarly secular , you are one step ahead of the game .
How do you find that out ?
Begin by tossing around words like “ secular ” and “ agnostic ” and check out her reaction .
If she ’s already freaked out , run away .
If she seems responsive , this is good news .
Then try throwing out a “ Pastafarian ” or “ Humanist . ”
If she stares at you blankly , run away .
If she laughs or nods approvingly , you ’re on the right track .
Then mention “ PZ Myers . ”
If her reaction is like this …
or this …
… she may be the one for you .
Either one works .
Because it ’s all about name recognition and there is no in - between with PZ 🙂
#8 : Just because she is an atheist , do not assume you know what she thinks about everything else
Not all atheist women are swingers .
Some of them may be looking for a long - term relationship .
Some may not want to ever get married .
Some may not be pro-choice or vote Democrat .
Some may actually like certain aspects of religion .
Some may want to have babies for non-digesting purposes .
You ’ll have to discover all these things on your own .
# 9 : Do not automatically discount a non-atheist
It is very possibly that you meet someone you like who is a very religious person .
Or just moderately theistic .
Or Jewish .
If you have fun and get along , maybe religion is a barrier you can overlook at first .
Maybe she ’s an atheist who has n’t realized it yet .
Maybe she ’s someone who has never questioned her faith before but is interested in what you have to say .
And , yes , maybe it ’ll be a barrier you ca n’t overcome .
You never know .
Moral of the story :
You do n’t automatically have to set your dating website search filters on “ atheist ” only .
# 10 : Be ready to have a duel with the atheist who is already dating her .
If you meet the woman of your dreams , you ’ll find out quickly that she ’s already seeing somebody .
In this case , you must be prepared to do battle .
I suggest becoming a fencing or jousting expert .
The Eagle Nebula is a dazzling stellar nursery located 7000 light - years away near the constellation of Serpens - the Snake .
In the Eagle Nebula , a region of gas and dust where young stars are currently being formed , a cluster of massive , hot stars named NGC 6611 has just been born .
The powerful light and strong winds from these massive new arrivals are shaping light - year long pillars , seen in the image partly silhouetted against the bright background of the nebula .
The nebula itself has a shape vaguely reminiscent of an eagle , with the central pillars being the " talons " .
The Eagle Nebula was discovered by the Swiss astronomer , Jean Philippe Loys de Chéseaux , in 1745 �nd found again twenty years later by the French comet hunter , Charles Messier , who included it as number 16 in his famous catalogue , and remarked that the stars were surrounded by a faint glow .
The Eagle Nebula achieved iconic status in 1995 , when its central pillars were depicted in the famous image below obtained with the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope .
The Pillars of Creation .
These eerie , dark pillar - like structures are actually columns of cool interstellar hydrogen gas and dust that are also incubators for new stars .
The pillars protrude from the interior wall of a dark molecular cloud like stalagmites from the floor of a cavern .
Credit : Jeff Hester and Paul Scowen ( Arizona State University ) , and NASA / ESAIn 2001 , ESO 's Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) captured another breathtaking image of the nebula , in the near - infrared , giving astronomers a penetrating view through the obscuring dust , and clearly showing stars being formed in the pillars .
An enlarged view of the head of the largest of the three main pillars , Column 1 .
The head is almost transparent around the edges at near - infrared wavelengths , but there is still a substantial opaque core which even these near - infrared VLT observations cannot penetrate .
The complex blueish nebulosity bisected by a dark lane near the tip is being lit up by the bright yellow star just below it , which appears to be very young and rather massive .
Several of the much fainter stars to the right of and below this source are found to be associated with EGGs seen in the Hubble image , and these all have much lower masses .
Finally , there is a faint streak of blue light emanating from from the tip of EGG 23 , one of the darkest parts of Column 1 , ending in a blue blob further north .
An equal distance to the south of the EGG and off the head , there is another curving blue nebulosity .
These features are also seen in the Hubble image , and may be part of a Herbig - Haro jet coming from a young star buried deeply in EGG 23 and invisible in this image .
Credit ESOA newly released image , obtained with the Wide - Field Imager camera attached to the MPG / ESO 2.2 - metre telescope at La Silla , Chile , covers an area on the sky as large as the full Moon , and is about 15 times more extensive than the previous VLT image , and more than 200 times more extensive than the iconic Hubble visible - light image .
The whole region around the pillars can now be seen in exquisite detail .
Credit : NASA , ESA , and The Hubble Heritage Team STScI / AURA ) Appearing like a winged fairy - tale creature poised on a pedestal , the soaring tower is 9.5 light - years or about 90 trillion kilometres high , about twice the distance from our Sun to the next nearest star .
Stars in the Eagle Nebula are born in clouds of cold hydrogen gas that reside in chaotic neighbourhoods , where energy from young stars sculpts fantasy - like landscapes in the gas .
The tower may be a giant incubator for those newborn stars .
A torrent of ultraviolet light from a band of massive , hot , young stars [ off the top of the image ] is eroding the pillar .
The starlight also is responsible for illuminating the tower 's rough surface .
Ghostly streamers of gas can be seen boiling off this surface , creating the haze around the structure and highlighting its three - dimensional shape .
The column is silhouetted against the background glow of more distant gas .
The edge of the dark hydrogen cloud at the top of the tower is resisting erosion , in a manner similar to that of brush among a field of prairie grass that is being swept up by fire .
The fire quickly burns the grass but slows down when it encounters the dense brush .
In this celestial case , thick clouds of hydrogen gas and dust have survived longer than their surroundings in the face of a blast of ultraviolet light from the hot , young stars .
Inside the gaseous tower , stars may be forming .
Some of those stars may have been created by dense gas collapsing under gravity .
Other stars may be forming due to pressure from gas that has been heated by the neighbouring hot stars .
The first wave of stars may have started forming before the massive star cluster began venting its scorching light .
The star birth may have begun when denser regions of cold gas within the tower started collapsing under their own weight to make stars .
The bumps and fingers of material in the centre of the tower are examples of these stellar birthing areas .
These regions may look small but they are roughly the size of our solar system .
The fledgling stars continued to grow as they fed off the surrounding gas cloud .
They abruptly stopped growing when light from the star cluster uncovered their gaseous cradles , separating them from their gas supply .
Ironically , the young cluster 's intense starlight may be inducing star formation in some regions of the tower .
Examples can be seen in the large , glowing clumps and finger - shaped protrusions at the top of the structure .
The stars may be heating the gas at the top of the tower and creating a shock front , as seen by the bright rim of material tracing the edge of the nebula at top , left .
As the heated gas expands , it acts like a battering ram , pushing against the darker cold gas .
The intense pressure compresses the gas , making it easier for stars to form .
This scenario may continue as the shock front moves slowly down the tower .
The dominant colours in the image were produced by gas energized by the star cluster 's powerful ultraviolet light .
The blue colour at the top is from glowing oxygen .
The red colon in the lower region is from glowing hydrogen .
The Eagle Nebula image was taken in November 2004 with the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope .
Three - colour composite mosaic image of the Eagle Nebula ( Messier 16 ) , based on images obtained with the Wide - Field Imager camera on the MPG / ESO 2.2 - metre telescope at the La Silla Observatory .
At the centre , the so - called “ Pillars of Creation ” can be seen .
This wide - field infrared image shows not only the central pillars , but also several others in the same star - forming region , as well as a huge number of stars in front of , in , or behind the Eagle Nebula .
The cluster of bright stars to the upper right is NGC 6611 , home to the massive and hot stars that illuminate the pillars .
The “ Spire ” — another large pillar — is in the middle left of the image .
Credit : ESOThe " Pillars of Creation " are in the middle of the image , with the cluster of young stars , NGC 6611 , lying above and to the right .
The " Spire " — another pillar captured by Hubble — is at the centre left of the image .
Finger - like features protrude from the vast cloud wall of cold gas and dust , not unlike stalagmites rising from the floor of a cave .
Inside the pillars , the gas is dense enough to collapse under its own weight , forming young stars .
These light - year long columns of gas and dust are being simultaneously sculpted , illuminated and destroyed by the intense ultraviolet light from massive stars in NGC 6611 , the adjacent young stellar cluster .
Within a few million years — a mere blink of the universal eye — they will be gone forever .

As a designer , maker , and artist , Tim Elverston 's earliest memories , and most powerful interests , have always revolved around our atmosphere and flight .
What started as intense bird envy has become an enduring , and infinitely versatile passion .
While diverse , Tim 's work is now highly refined .
In 2001 , he started a handmade technologies company called WindFire Designs .
Tim is strongly influenced by his collected knowledge of the natural world and the material sciences .
His ideas for the future are driven by a mix of desire , experimental data , and cumulative intuition .

The WindFire Cursor Kite A magic trick in essence , this highly controlable kite brings the operating system back into the natural world .
2004
Very little is known about the WindFire Cursor Kite .
It seems to be bringing the desktop of your computer outdoors — pfff , finally .
Precise control , silk sail , nearly invisible hand - formed stainless fittings , and opposed - bow tension system make this flying cursor look edited right into the sky .
But it is n't .
A work of art , both as a concept and a performance — it is a flying sculpture and a social commentary .
The visual simplicity comes from considerable technological development .
We are very interested in using the obvious potential of this in many ways .
If you are reading this and you 're having ideas , please consider inviting us to perform in front of your cameras and / or at your event .
Carefully designed by Tim Elverston , this high - end addition to the WindFire collection marks the beginning of the WindFire OS Series .
Stay tuned and yes , we 've got all the logical extensions in the works .

The Air - YO™ 2002
The Original Air - YO™ was carefully designed by three crazy kite builders named Tim Elverston , Curtiss Mitchell , and Ruth Whiting .
The Air - YO is a toy , but it has its roots in kites .
During more than twenty years of flying kites and over ten years of building kites professionally , we 've seen kites do some pretty amazing things .
One day , many ideas about stuff that flies became clear in our heads and the very first Air - YOtm was put together .
When the Air - YO obeyed us for the first time , it was like magic jumped out of the air and was transmitted through the string directly to our waiting fingertips .
We had invented something very special — an object that would give the people who touch it a brand new perspective on what it means to control something that is in flight .
The Air - YO is a tethered - omnidirectional - planing - flying object .
It is also the first flying ring toy that does n't need to spin as it flies .
The Air - YO is a training toy for those who want great things , it is a toy to hone your hand - eye coordination , or to make a timid arm nimble again .
The Air - YO is a toy to help you see the invisible .
It is a family toy to confuse a dog with .
It is a toy for when you are peacfully alone .
Yet it can draw people together with magnetic force .
The truth is that the Air - YO can be more than just a toy , because when people tell you that there are limits in life you can say : " How can that be ? … I can Air - YO " and you can mean it !
In my last post about FreeNX future , I had mentioned the efforts on a freenx - redesign branch , which seemed to have stalled .
Well , trust the guys at Google that worked on this redesign , they did not give up , and in fact publicly announced the first public release of neatx , the result of the redesign work .
While still missing some of the features available in FreeNX , it does already have some original ones , like the drop - down menu for session control in rootless sessions ( which is something I use a LOT when running pidgin remotely from home 🙂 ) .
I ’ll make sure to prepare an ebuild ( in your favourite NX overlay first as usual ) when they tag a new version ( first released one has some bugs that were quickly found ) .
Now , you may be lost between the multiple servers ( including the dead ones ) , considering I never blogged about tacix , a remote server using NX , but with a different approach from the ‘ official ’
NoMachine way ( with the specifix ‘ nx ’ user , … ) , making heavy use of dbus , and with its own client .
For now , it ’s still in the early versions , but it has potential !
So which server will you install on your ( Gentoo , but other work of course ) system ?
Here are the ‘ active ’ ones :
Official NX server ( net- misc / nxserver - freeedition in portage ) , closed - source , limited to 2 concurrent sessions , but has all the features .
If you want to quickly try NX !
FreeNX ( net- misc / nxserver - freenx in portage ) , oldest and most complete open - source version , but its development stalled .
The last ebuilds in tree use the branch from the Ubuntu folks , which fixes a few bugs compared to the last upstream source .
If you want a stable open - source version
X2GO ( net - misc / x2 goserver and x2goclient in portage , some extended parts are still in the NX overlay ) .
Maturing fast , and worth a try .
This one is brought to you thanks to Joachim Langenbach , who does most of the work on the x2 go * ebuilds 🙂
And in the future :
The commission was directed by the Howard government in 2007 to use its special powers — given to the agency in 2003 to fight organised crime such as drug trafficking and money laundering — to investigate child abuse in the territory .
Among the crime commission 's powers is the ability to force people to answer questions in secret coercive hearings or risk being sent to prison .
" One of the early questions that was being asked ( at the beginning of the intervention ) was : ' Was there organised pedophilia targeting indigenous communities and children ? ' " Mr Lawler said .
" One of the things that the ( crime commission ) report has been able to find and report on is that that does not seem to be the case , " he said , while stressing that his investigators had found serious criminal offences , including cases of child sexual abuse .
The commission also found poor information sharing and reporting on violence and child abuse and abuses of power by senior community figures .
Questions about the appropriateness of sending an elite organised crime - fighting body , rather than local police and specialised agencies , to investigate sexual abuse and violence in indigenous communities have now shifted to the Rudd Government .
Despite reservations held by senior Labor figures , including the chairman of the commission 's parliamentary committee , Steve Hutchins , and former home affairs minister Bob Debus , Mr Rudd extended the life of the commission taskforce this year .
The Sunday Age can also reveal that most crime commission board members , who include all state and territory police commissioners , also have serious reservations about whether the commission should have an NT indigenous intelligence taskforce .
" Most of the board were against it , " said a senior police source .
Mr Rudd overturned a decision by Mr Debus to cut funding to the taskforce in March .
An additional $ 5.5 million to extend the taskforce by a year was announced shortly after criticism from prominent indigenous figures , including academic Marcia Langton , who accused Mr Rudd of putting a " price tag " on Aboriginal children .
Labor senator Steve Hutchins said the finding of no organised pedophilia showed the taskforce funding should not have been extended , saying the decision came after political pressure .
" The mix of social and economic problems that create crime and disadvantage in the Northern Territory should be dealt with by appropriate bodies , not an agency that deals with serious organised crime , " Senator Hutchins said .
" You do n't see the Government sending the crime commission into Catholic churches where there has been organised pedophilia .
Now we know there is no organised pedophilia in indigenous communities .
" Even if there were , the crime commission would be the wrong body to investigate . "
The commission has struggled to get enough funding to battle crime bosses and the illegal drug trade , and will have lost a further 35 staff this year to meet budget demands .
In March , the Police Federation attacked the decision to renew funding for the taskforce , claiming it was " not producing anything that the NT police would not have the capacity to do if they were properly resourced " .
The Northern Land Council , which represents Aboriginal groups in northern Australia , has also criticised the decision .
Last week , the Productivity Commission reported that substantiated child abuse cases in indigenous communities increased from 16 per 1000 children nine years ago to 35 per 1000 children in 2007 - 08 .
This compares with an increase of abuse cases in non-indigenous children of five per 1000 to six per 1000 in the same period , suggesting that indigenous children are six times more likely to be abused .
When Laura Ingraham filled in for Bill O'Reilly on Friday 's night 's O'Reilly Factor , she ran a segment on abortion that was ostensibly an " investigation " into Planned Parenthood .
It featured a logo that placed a red set of crosshairs -- the kind you find on a rifle scope -- over PP 's logo .
I 'd just like to ask one question :
What the hell were these people thinking ?
Now , presumably , Ingraham herself did not order up this graphic , or if she did , it at least went through the hands of the show 's regular producers and overseers .
These are the same people who just went through a well - deserved round of approbation for their role -- in the form of those 28 references to Dr. George Tiller as a " baby killer " -- in the murder of Tiller by an anti-abortion fanatic .
And now they 're running a graphic suggestive of what Ann Coulter calls " a procedure with a rifle " -- something , in fact , that Coulter has actually encouraged on The O'Reilly Factor .
Really , I 'm serious .
What are these people thinking ?
Of course , we know all too well that O'Reilly and Co. did their best to disavow any culpability in the matter whatsoever -- somewhat less than convincingly .
So maybe the continuing demonization of abortion providers on this program is part and parcel of that defiance .
And the same sort of anecdotal demonization that characterized O'Reilly 's attacks on Tiller were similarly at play in this segment on Planned Parenthood .
It essentially involved an ambush team using a youngish - seeming woman posing as a 14 - year - old entering a variety of Planned Parenthood clinics and recording the responses -- most of which , as described by the fake teen here , actually fit the standard response of most properly run clinics in trying to make sure that younger patients feel at ease .
The overriding message , once again , is that these abortion providers are a pack of morally depraved sickos who deserve to be in the crosshairs .
Lovely .
I can think of three possibilities here :
1. Someone just thought putting an organization in the crosshairs was the best way to represent that they were under investigation , and the other implications of such a graphic just did n't cross anybody 's radar .
2 . They thought about it , recognized that it might not be appropriate , but did it anyway , either out of defiance or simply not caring .
3 . They did it with full intent , understanding full well that the suggestion of violence against Planned Parenthood was present , and in fact designing the graphic with that in mind .
Of the three , I think the second is the most plausible .
But it 's only slightly less appalling , for different reasons , than the other two .
Look , despite what the O'Reillys and Glenn Becks and Laura Ingrahams like to claim , no one is trying to " silence " them for expressing their opinions .
This is about being responsible with that big media megaphone they hold .
Promoting a violent mindset toward abortion providers , as we have already seen , is profoundly irresponsible .
It 's long past time that it stop .

Internet users in Hull risk having their connection cut if they illegally share files , under a controversial " three strikes and out policy " operated by the only internet service provider in the area .
Karoo , the north - eastern city 's only ISP , serving 90,000 customers , has in recent years , with little national publicity , been cutting users ' internet connection immediately and without warning if they were found to be in breach of copyright .
It was forced to relax its stance after growing criticism from digital rights groups and customers .
Karoo will now provide customers with three written warnings before temporarily suspending the internet connections of illegal filesharers , after the company admitted it was " exceeding the expectations of copyright owners " .
The policy remains controversial and significantly harsher than other UK ISP providers , which have been reluctant to crack down on illegal filesharers and only recently agreed to send warning letters to persistent filesharers .
The recent Digital Britain report suggested other actions against illegal filesharers , such as having their internet connection slowed , but stopped a long way short of threatening to disconnect online illegal filesharers .
Yesterday the company said it had always taken a firm line on the " alleged abuse " of its internet connections and had a duty to act if it was informed by record labels , or the police about infringing copyright .
Nick Thompson , director of consumer and publishing services at Karoo , said it would in future issue three written warning before cutting its customers internet connection .
" It is evident that we have been exceeding the expectations of copyright owners , the media and internet users , " he said .
" So , we have changed our policy to move in more line with the industry standard approach , whilst still taking the issues of copyright infringement and illegal internet activity seriously . "
Previously , for a number of years customers were sent a letter requiring them to accept culpability and to promise not to share files again .
The first reconnection was free , but if users continued to fileshare they had to pay £ 30 for each subsequent reinstallation .
Karoo 's policy caused uproar among its clients , who complained that they could not vote with their feet by choosing another internet service provider .
Steve Thornhill , from west Hull , said he had been wrongfully cut off for " illegally downloading " because his computer had been infected by a virus .
" I am absolutely furious about this ...
There is no warning , they just sever your connection , which is unacceptable in my view , " he wrote on the This is Hull and East Riding website .
Other comments suggest that cutting people 's internet connections may not prevent more tech - savvy users from illegally downloading .
One anonymous user wrote : " I got cut off last year twice or downloading films , games and music through bit - torrents , what did I do ?
Switched to rapidshare !
Come on kar - roo , try harder , I like a challenge . "
Digital rights campaign organisation , The Open Rights Group , criticised the company 's decision to continue disconnecting its customers .
Executive director Jim Killock said : " Karoo 's policy still has major concerns around presuming guilt , allowing innocent people to clear their name , and allowing due process to take place .
They are still threatening to cut users from the internet without testing the evidence .
This is especially concerning given their monopoly position . "
He added : " Even prisoners get to use the internet .
For many people , web access is not optional in the modern world . "
California ’s huge government pension fund is expected to report today a whopping annual loss of an estimated $ 56.8 billion , almost a quarter of its investment portfolio .
The loss at the California Public Employees ’ Retirement System for the fiscal year ended June 30 is the second in a row for the country ’s largest fund .
A year ago , CalPERS reported an $ 8.5 - billion loss , as the severe recession began to take hold .
The tremendous drop in value is expected to have a direct effect on the amount of money that the state and about 2,000 local governments and school districts must contribute in coming years to pay for pensions and healthcare for 1.6 million government workers , retirees and their families .
As income from the pension investments fall , the governments would have to make up the difference to meet the state ’s pension and healthcare obligations .

In the fiscal year that ended a year earlier , CalPERS ’ holdings in stocks , private equity , real estate and commodities positions were worth $ 239.2 billion .
They fell to $ 182.4 billion on June 30 , down 23.7 % , according to daily postings on the fund ’s Internet site .
CalPERS hit a record - high balance of $ 247.7 billion on June 30 , 2007 , and it earned double - digit returns for the five fiscal years from 2002 - 03 to 2006 - 07 .
Without those kinds of flush years , CalPERS could have a difficult time getting the average annual return of 7.75 % that its actuaries say it needs to meet obligations to retirees without drastically raising employer contributions .
To ease the damage on already cash - strapped cities and counties , CalPERS ’ board has approved a plan that would spread the last fiscal year ’s deep losses over the next 30 years , beginning in mid-2011 .

Also today , the country ’s second - largest public pension fund , the California State Teachers ’ Retirement System , will release its results for the 2008 - 09 fiscal year .

It 's no secret that the growth of Twitter and other social media sites has made URL shortening services a welcomed fact of life for many users .
Unfortunately , it seems spammers have now taken notice , and are working shortened URLs into their schemes .
According to Symantec , there has been a significant increase in the amount of spam using links concealed with URL shortening services .
During the past three days , the amount of spam containing short URLs has gone up from virtually nothing to 2.23 percent of all spam .
Though that figure sounds small , based on Symantec 's statistics on global spam volume it could equal more than 3.5 billion spam messages per day .
" We 've been monitoring the use of short URLs in regular e-mail spam for the past few months and noticed that it had been used in small spam campaigns , " said Matt Sergeant , senior anti-spam technologist at MessageLabs , now a part of Symantec .
" However , in the middle of last week , we saw it increase exponentially ... to over 2 percent of total spam today . "
Security researchers have warned users to be extra-skeptical of shortened URLs because they mask the true URL and there is generally no way to see the destination the URL points to .
One solution to the problem is the Firefox add - on called LongURL , which users can utilize to see where short URLs actually go .
URL shortening services have become particularly popular among users of Twitter and social networking sites such as Facebook .
One of them , Cligs , was hit with an attack in June that redirected some 2.2 million URLs to a blog post .
While in that case the impact of the attack was minimal , users could just as easily have been led to a malicious site .
In fact , Sophos reported a phishing attack on Twitter that did exactly that , redirecting victims to a phishing site that asked them for their name and password .
According to Sergeant , the spike in spammers abusing URL shortening services is tied to the Donbot botnet , and indicates that the botnet operator has found a way to automate the creation of short URL links either within the botnet code or in the templates being sent out .
Since URL shortening services do n't require the creation of an account - something that would force spammers to crack a CAPTCHA - it 's easier to automate the process , he said .
" [ Donbot ] is not one of the biggest botnets out there , but it sends a high volume of malicious content and is responsible for about 5 million spam e-mails , " Sergeant said .
" The nodes or infected computers are placed all over the globe , so despite being fairly small , it sends a large volume .
It 's an efficient botnet for sending spam and is used for the typical type of spam we see every day from weight loss to male enhancement . "
Though URL shortening services typically have filters in place , the filters are normally retroactive , making the problem difficult to manage , Sergeant said .
" There 's really not much they can do other than take down the link once they 've determined it to be spam , " he said .
" Users need to be wary of what they click on and only trust e-mails with links that you are expecting to receive . "
Wanting to learn from the best , aspiring boxer Maggie Fitzgerald ( Hilary Swank ) wants Frankie Dunn ( Clint Eastwood ) to train her .
At the outset , he flatly refuses saying he has no interest in training a girl .
Frankie leads a lonely existence , alienated from his only daughter and having few friends .
Maggie 's rough around the edges , but shows a lot of grit in the ring and he eventually relents .
Maggie not only proves to be the boxer he always dreamed of having under his wing , but a friend who fills the great void he 's had in his life .
Maggie 's career skyrockets , but an accident in the ring leads her to ask Frankie for one last favor .

All internet and phone traffic should be recorded to help the fight against terrorism , according to one of the UK 's former spy chiefs .
Civil rights campaigners have criticised ministers ' plans to log details of such contact as " Orwellian " .
But Sir David Pepper , who ran the GCHQ listening centre for five years , told the BBC lives would be at risk if the state could not track communication .
Agencies faced " enormous pressure " to keep up with technology , he said .
" It 's a constant arms race , if you like .
As more technology , different technology becomes available , the balance will shift constantly . "
The work of GCHQ , which provides intelligence on foreign and domestic threats , is so secretive that until the 1980s the government refused to discuss its existence .
The thing you worry about most is the attack that you have n't seen coming
Sir David Pepper
Send us your comments
In his first interview since departing as its director in 2008 , Sir David told BBC2 programme Who 's Watching
You that the agency had " very sophisticated targets " .
" There are plenty of people who will do all they can to make themselves difficult to find .
" It puts enormous pressure on you .
Everybody in the agency is acutely aware that if they do n't do their job properly one of the consequences may be another terrorist outrage .
" The thing you worry about most is the attack that you have n't seen coming . "
Last year , then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced plans for a database to record details of the times and dates of messages and phone calls but said the content of conversations would not be kept .
She said such data was used as " important evidence in 95 % of serious crime cases " and in almost all security service operations .
' Pervasive ' Details of the times , dates , duration and locations of mobile phone calls , numbers called , website visited and addresses e-mailed are already stored by telecoms companies for 12 months under a voluntary agreement .
However , the Liberal Democrats said the government 's plans were " incompatible with a free country and a free people " .
In February , the Lords constitution committee said electronic surveillance and collection of personal data had become " pervasive " in British society .
Its members said the situation threatened to undermine democracy .
However , Sir David said he was speaking out to help people understand that agencies were there to protect them .

How to : Travel to Iraq without getting killed
Feature photo by jamesdale10
Travel is a powerful force for peace .
An engaged , open - minded traveler can be an ambassador of empathy and an antidote to terror .
The day American and Iraqi travelers can travel freely in each others country will be a great day .
On that day , we will know for certain that war has at long last given way to peace .
Is it reasonable for you to consider traveling to Iraq now ?
I do n’t know .
It depends on who you are and when you read this .
If you do go to Iraq , however , keep these tips in mind – and tell us about your travels when you come home !
Do your research

You ca n’t book a trip to Iraq in the same way you might book a Caribbean cruise .
Do not even consider visiting Iraq until you have thoroughly researched the country , including recent political events .
Stay abreast of current news for months before your trip and while you are in Iraq .
The best source of quality English - language journalism in Iraq is probably the Baghdad Bureau of the New York Times .
Other excellent sources of Iraq news include the BBC News Iraq Page and Al Jazeera English .
Stick to safe zones
Last year , an Italian tourist named Luca Marchio was found wandering around Falluja .
“ I am a tourist .
I want to see the most important cities in the country .
That is the reason why I am here now , ” he was quoted as saying .
“ I want to see and understand the reality because I have never been here before , and I think every country in the world must be seen . ”
As admirable as Luca ’s sentiment might have been , he was lucky to get out of Falluja alive .
The truth is that some regions of Iraq are much safer than others .
I would have no qualms about visiting much of Iraqi Kurdistan , for example , which Lonely Planet founder Tony Wheeler explored way back in 2006 .
Generally speaking , southern Iraq is safer than the Sunni Triangle , and a traveler must be particularly careful in Baghdad , where the line between relatively safe and highly dangerous neighborhoods is sometimes unclear .

Do n’t go gonzo
Iraq is the sort of destination that can attract adrenaline seekers with a talent for getting into trouble .
Especially in the heady days of early occupation , Iraq was a green playground for dangerously naive foreigners drawn by money and war .
Most of these Quiet Americans are either jaded or gone .
Some of them are dead .
You are advised to be extraordinarily cautious , respectful , and unobtrusive while in Iraq .
The idea of going gonzo in a slow - burning war - zone might be exhilarating , but it can get very real very fast in this part of the world .

Consider a guided tour
A handful of specialty tour companies offer itineraries in Iraq .
Hinterland Travel is a well regarded company with regularly scheduled tours in Iraqi Kurdistan .
A pioneering 17 - day Hinterland of Baghdad , Babylon , and Basra was recently written up in the New York Times under the headline “ Travelers , Your Tour Bus For Basra Is Boarding . ”
Go through Amman , Jordan
Amman is a safe , modern , vibrant city only 500 miles from Baghdad and linked by frequent buses and flights .
Many Iraqi refugees live in Amman or travel there for health care .
Amman is a good place to cool your heels for a few days while absorbing all the latest information about current events in Iraq .
There are hundreds of Couchsurfers in Amman who can host you , in addition to all sorts of guesthouses and hotels .
Try to blend in

There are basically two ways to stay safe in Iraq .
The American Way , brought to you by Blackwater and Halliburton , is to drive fast , surrounded by soldiers and bodyguards .
If you are n’t traveling on the taxpayer ’s dime , a better strategy is to blend in as much as possible .
Women should dress in local fashion and men should grow out their facial hair .
Learning a bit of Arabic before you go could n’t hurt .
Join the Army ?
Many of the American soldiers in Iraq are trying hard to build peace , and joining up with this effort can be a noble decision .

Practically speaking , the army pays fairly well , offering good benefits and a route out of poverty for some Americans .
However , life as a soldier can be difficult and risky , and there are moral questions inherent in being part of a violent occupation .

Talk to someone who has been to Iraq
Iraq might seem as distant as another planet , but chances are you know someone who has been there recently .
A trickle of Iraqi refugees are starting to settle in the states , and thousands of soldiers are coming home from deployment .
Reach out to these people .
Invite them in and listen to their stories .
COMMUNITY CONNECTION :
Matador members who have been to Iraq include :
Canoe :
Dustin is a native Texan who loves his canoe and his camera .
Dustin studied at Texas State University and graduated with a BS in digital imaging .
He also served 4 years in the US Army and is currently deployed to Iraq with the National Guard in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom .
Slinky :
I have always enjoyed traveling around the U.S. but now have a job and money to travel internationally .
I plan to use this to explore the world .
I have dabbled in a lot of different sports , but plan to get back into para - gliding , kiting , dirt - biking , four - wheeling , and fun when I return from Iraq .

Geothermal Frustration , Part II
Yesterday in Part I , I discussed how the publicly traded geothermal companies are not delivering what we hoped for as returns .
I described how geothermal power is the beneficiary of a lot of government benefits , from renewable - energy mandates to tax breaks .
Thus , the geothermal companies ( including five companies in the ESI portfolio ) should be doing better in the stock market .
But that ’s not the case , even though the deck is stacked in favor of green power , especially geothermal .
Where ’s the return ?
The Geothermal Business Model
Let ’s ask a question of almost all of the current geothermal players .
Is SOMETHING WRONG with much of the current geothermal business model ?
Actually , WHAT IS THE BUSINESS MODEL for the typical geothermal energy pure - play company ?
Let me summarize in a general fashion .
The typical geothermal pure - play starts with one or a very few visionary people , often engineers .
These guys ( almost always guys ) have an idea .
They do some prospecting and find a couple of sites with steam vents or mud volcanoes .
Very often , the site is something that other players looked at or even drilled back in the 1970s .
The sites are usually out in the middle of nowhere , like some gulch in Nevada or similar jurisdiction
Then the players acquire relatively small acreage positions — a few thousand aces here and there — often from the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) or private parties .
They try not to pay big money for big acreage .
Indeed , many of the current geothermal guys have a $ 3 per acre mentality .
For overseas projects , they usually obtain a concession from the government in a developing country .
Not uncommonly in the developing country , the politicians studied Marxism in their university days
Then the companies promote their geothermal site at conferences .
They give their site a name like “ Hell ’s Hot Springs ” to make it sound like the devil bathes there in the superheated steam .
They show their slides , pound the podium and raise funds from private players .
Eventually , they write a fire - and - brimstone prospectus and issue stock in the Canadian junior marketplace
Then comes a years - long cycle of burning the cash .
In the U.S. or Canada , they start a long process of obtaining federal , state and local government permits to do everything .
They need permits to drive trucks over wilderness roads , to remove water , to blow exhaust into the air , to drill wells , to erect towers .
Every geothermal site in the U.S. or Canada involves at least 700 permits and constant renewals .
No wonder they need the tax credits on the back end
Then they identify enough funds to drill a primary steam well , and a confirmation well or two .
These wells are expensive — much more so than a comparable gas well , that ’s for sure .
In fact , there are only a handful of drilling rigs in the U.S. and Canada that routinely drill geothermal wells .
Sometimes a rig breaks down or gets stuck at one site .
That impacts the drilling schedule for other customers for many months onward .
Often , the geothermal companies pay for drilling wells by issuing new stock and diluting the previous investors
Then they hire a consultant .
It ’s almost always GeothermEx Inc. , of Richmond , Calif .
GeothermEx is not just small , it ’s TINY !
There are eight upper - middle - aged guys who do all the work .
GeothermEx does good work despite having virtually NO competition .
But it goes to show how small and clubby the geothermal world is
Once in bed with its pals at GeothermEx ( whoops , I mean “ once it ’s retained GeothermEx ” ) , the geothermal company tests the wells for “ the report . ”
Then the GeothermEx consultants write up “ the GeothermEx report ” on the heat and energy potential of the site .
The key point of “ the report ” is how many megawatts ( Mw ) the project ought to yield over how many years
Then the geothermal company shops the GeothermEx report around to the local or regional power companies to get a power purchase agreement ( PPA ) .
The PPA is a promise that IF the geothermal company ever produces electricity , the power utility will buy it at some price .
( The utility companies like PPAs because they can impress the state utility regulators and get them off their back .
“ See ?
We ’re working that green energy RPS mandate . ” )
Then the geothermal company uses the PPA to borrow money from a bank or other source of funds .
If a utility company will pay for future power supplies , that ’s bankable .
“ Energy bankers , ” as they fancy themselves , have been trained to kowtow to PPAs based on GeothermEx reports .
“ GeothermEx reports are the gold standard in this business , ” is the common expression
Then the geothermal guys use the borrowed money to pay debts and bills and to drill more wells for steam production and water injection .
At the same time , the small team of geothermal players — which could hold their corporate luncheon in the back of a McDonald ’s restaurant — designs and builds a generating plant .
This requires large upfront costs for construction and equipment
Sometimes , the geothermal guys farm out the power plant as a turnkey project to a publicly traded company named Ormat .
“ Ormat is the go - to company in this business , ” is the common expression
Meanwhile , Ormat is tightly run by a family of bright , but very quirky , upper - middle - aged people .
The company growth plan gets a C - and its succession plan gets a D , in my view .
( Another story . )
Then while the geothermal people are designing and building their generating plant , they have to worry about how to get the power from the plant to the main transmission wires .
This often involves permitting and building out a new set of power lines from nowhere ( out in Nevada or the like ) to somewhere else ( such as where the electric load is , in California or the like )
Then , about four or five years down the road from the original lease sale , the geothermal company tests its steam wells and generating plant .
If the dynamos spin true , the geothermal company now has electrons moving down the wires .
That is , the geothermal company is in the power - generating biz
Finally , with electrons in the wires , based on the PPA , the utility company starts sending a check every month to the geothermal company .
It ’s usually the first real cash flow that the geothermal company has seen in many years .
Let ’s Think This Through
Most of the foregoing applies to most of the companies ( public and private ) in the geothermal space .
This is how it works .
This is the current geothermal business model , controlling things from prospect to power line .
Of course , not everything applies to everybody .
But you get the idea .
Let ’s think this through .
If you ’re a small company with a handful of employees , how can you possibly accomplish and manage all of this … and make money for your investors ?
You ’ve got a cadre of people who do it all .
They prospect for acreage , lease it , obtain permits , raise funds , drill - drill - drill , test the wells and other systems , design and engineer a power plant , procure material and equipment , build out a generating system , erect power lines , spin electrons and deal with a regulated utility .
Does it sound like there ’s a lot going on ?
There are lots of moving parts , with lots of things that can go wrong .
And it ’s all going on for a long time , on borrowed money or invested funds .
So it takes a lot of time and cumulative risk to see any monetization .
No wonder the geothermal stock prices are in the dumps .
There ’s Got to Be a Better Way
Indeed , it seems like this business model was put together by Rube Goldberg .
And remember that I ’m only focusing on the “ big picture ” aspects of running this show .
When you look closer , there are more “ little pictures ” in this effort .
How many ?
Well , more than hang in the National Gallery .
That is , there are countless items that are much smaller , but which add up to time , money and managerial competency ( or incompetency ) .
Sure , running a geothermal project takes talent .
You ’ve got to be a jack - of - all - trades .
I guess that ’s why the guys at the top get the big bucks , eh ?
But c’mon .
There ’s got to be a better way .
Yet it seems like everybody does it this way — or they did in the late - departed era of easy credit .
But we do n’t live in that era any more .
There ’s no more easy , patient money .
In the past five years or so , the geothermal industry has raised and spent a couple billion dollars using this business model .
Can it raise another few billion in the years ahead ?
On this business model ?
News flash to the geothermal players :
Aside from insiders and a few other people who ’ve been able to trade in and out of the stocks ( mostly lucky , not good ) , nobody has made any decent return from geothermal .
It ’s always “ next year , next year , next year . ”
And the business model , based on shoestring budgeting and lack of monetary return for years at a time , helps to explain why .
Stay Tuned …
Do n’t get me wrong .
I still like geothermal and I ’ll continue to monitor our geothermal stock positions closely .
The geothermal business is small .
It ’s not something that many investors know about .
If just one or two of the companies in the ESI portfolio can make it out of the woods , that ’ll hand us enough profit to make up for any others that lag behind .
For now , I want to hold all of the geothermal companies in the portfolio .
I ’ll keep a close eye on the business environment , and get more information for you .
I ’ll check in with several of the geothermal companies in the ESI portfolio .
I ’ll find out exactly where they are on their project timelines .
Along the way , I ’m going to see another private geothermal project .
I ’ll talk with other people who are working in the geothermal space .
There are other business ideas out there — how to monetize the projects at earlier stages — and we need to know what they are .
That ’s all for now .
Thanks for reading .
Until we meet again ,

Chad Gibson remains in intensive care after head injuries received during the raid of the Rainbow Lounge , a gay night club in Fort Worth Texas .
Local officials have called for an investigation into the raid which occurred on the 40th anniversary of the Stonewall riots .
Fort Worth Police Chief Jeff Halstead defended his officers and their conduct during the raid .
“ You ’re touched and advanced in certain ways by people inside the bar , that ’s offensive , ” he said .
“ I ’m happy with the restraint used when they were contacted like that . ”
Dan Savage in his column at thestrange.com equates the police cheif ’s statement with the “ Gay Panic Defense . ”
Allow me to translate the chief ’s comments : “ Them faggots in that thar bar touched mah officers and now they ’re complainin ’ about some rough stuff and one little ol ’ faggot with a brain injury ?
Those perverts should be grateful they ’realive . ”
This is a classic example of the Gay Panic Defense .
In the very recent past all a straight man who brutally murdered a gay man had to say was , “ He made a pass at me ! ” , and the jury would ignore the evidence and let the murderer off .
The Gay Panic Defense does n’t fly in many courts of law these days but it still has currency in the court of public opinion .
And the chief of police in Forth Worth , a major U.S. city , is attempting to use the Gay Panic Defense to convince the citizens of Fort Worth to ignore the evidence — to ignore photographic evidence and credible eyewitness accounts — and let his officers off .
And you ’ll never guess who the police are accusing of being the groper : Chad Gibson , the one man arrested at the Rainbow Lounge who ca n’t defend himself and may never be able to give his side of the story .
A candle light vigil is planned tonight in honor of Chad Gibson at the Rainbow lounge at 8:30 pm .
To show your support join the Rainbow Lounge Riot Facebook group .

The truth about the Jamaican Honey Bee Squirrel
Hi readers ,
I hope you enjoy the new episode .
As of late , I 've gotten a lot of
questions about the JBS , and I hope I can answer some below .
Is there really such a thing as the Jamaican Honey Bee Squirrel ?
Yes , he does exist .
Descended from a great white choc-o - dile , he
mates by entering the hatchery with a stolen keycard .
He is
supposedly able to blind his enemies by wish alone .
His belly is made
of grass .
A notorious lazybones , he watches tv but does not know it
is not real .
Can I order one ?
No , I 'm afraid they 're protected by my insecure love .
Can I find one in the wild ?
Chances are slim .
In 1986 , a JBS crashed his corvette into a
supermarket in northern California .
Subsequently , he was recovered
from the curb weeping in to his pack of cigarettes , but soon slipped
the bread ties EMS jury - rigged as crude restraints , and made his way
to a rope of gauze , ultimately escaping on the back of a pigeon .
What is the JBS 's sexual orientation ?
The JBSs host communal " love-ins " or " hippie - style " inversion
throw - back jamfests , in which it 's been rumored , anything goes .
How does the JBS taste ?
They taste delicious .
Liquidity risk is the risk that you wo n't be able to sell an asset , or more generally unwind a trade , for an amount of cash close to its expected value at any given moment .
So which assets carry the most liquidity risk ?
As a general rule , the greatest liquidity risk comes from assets in thinly traded markets .
That is , the fewer times an asset is traded on any given day , the greater the liquidity risk .
For example , stock in Coca Cola carries much less liquidity risk than a Victorian mansion for the simple reason that Coca Cola stock is heavily traded every business day all over the world .
As a result , Coca Cola stock trades can be executed quickly through intermediaries who are willing to buy it from or sell it to you , since these intermediaries know that at some point in the near future , someone else will show up at their door asking to buy or sell some more .
So these market - makers must be the greatest people on the Earth , willing to devote their time to make markets liquid , all for the greater good of humanity , right ?
No .
You bought your lunch , even if you do n't remember paying for it .
In exchange for providing liquidity , market - makers get to pocket the difference between the prices at which they buy and sell .
A swap is a very common type of OTC derivative , which includes that destroyer of economies , the credit default swap ( CDS ) .
While industry folk commonly speak of a buy - side and a sell - side to the swap market , you can't really buy or sell a swap in the classic sense , since a swap is an instrument in which both sides have obligations to perform in the future .
That is , if the underlying rate moves against either party , that party will have to pay up , much like a future or forward contract .
This is in contrast to an option from the perspective of its holder .
An option grants the right , not the obligation , to the option holder to buy a particular asset ; and creates an obligation on the part of the option writer to sell that asset .
You can sell a right and assume an obligation .
You can not sell an obligation .
Well , there are probably a few bozos out there .
But in any case , both parties to a swap could end up having an obligation to pay at some point in the future .
The Sell - Side
Swap dealers are market - makers for swaps : the sell - side of the market .
But how do they create markets when you can't really buy or sell a swap ?
At all times except execution , swaps have positive value to one of the parties to the swap and negative value to the other .
At execution , the market value of the swap to each side of the swap is zero .
This is because the price of the swap will be based upon the value of some rate at execution .
One party will be long on the rate ( benefiting if the rate goes up ) and the other will be short on the rate ( benefiting if the rate goes down ) .
After execution , that rate will move , up or down , which will create value to one of the parties .
What swap dealers do to net their positions is offset their long positions with short positions ; and offset their short positions with long positions .
In reality , this process is not so simple .
The face value of each trade , known as the notional amount , is not likely to match up so perfectly with the other trades , despite being executed by masters of the universe .
As a result , they have to work pretty hard to make all of their trades match up .
With the continuing escalation by North Korea 's Kim Jong - Il , we can now add the following to the dustbin of history : the Bush Doctrine and Cheney 's 1 Percent Doctrine .
Neither of these self - defense policies was followed after North Korea exploded its first nuclear device .
Bush and Cheney bent over backward and sideways to justify a preemptive war with Iraq , but there was not even a whisper from the White House when Kim acted to become a nuclear power .
Here is just another catastrophic failure of the Bush administration that President Obama has to deal with .
Corporate MSM minimize , serious journalist bloggers offer appropriate coverage , condemnation
Plus : YOU can take action ...
Brad Friedman Byon 7/13/2009 , 7:04 pm PT
Following up on Saturday 's NEWSWEEK scoop that Attorney General Holder " may be on the verge of " appointing a prosecutor to investigate Bush / Cheney - era torture , Digby notes how the chuckling dinosaurs of ABC News '
This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday snickered their way through a discussion of prosecution for torture by the Bush / Cheney regime ( in our name ! ) as if they were wise - cracking about any old political brouhaha from inside the Beltway .
( Video / transcript here , courtesy of C&L. )
Note to Stephanopoulos :
How about featuring some actual journalists and bloggers who 've actually been covering this issue for months ( years ? ) before you eventually come to wonder why your show has gone the way of all the dead trees in the newspaper publishing business .
Greenwald , Scahill , Wheeler , Horton all come to mind .
It might bring your show up to date ... or at least , up to 2006 or so .
The serious folks out there , several mentioned above , took a look at Saturday 's NEWSWEEK report with the grim sobriety and analytical acumen that it deserves , while in largely shabby followups Washington Post , New York Times , and Rupert Murdoch 's Wall Street Journal all seem to float anonymously sourced trial balloons , averring the notion that only low - level rogue interrogators who exceeded the boundaries of the DoJ 's illegal torture justification memos would be targeted by such an investigation .
On that point , while Glenn Greenwald charges such an approach would be arguably " worse than doing nothing , " as it would " actually further subvert the rule of law rather than strengthen it , " he also notes :
It 's worth emphasizing here that all of these reports are preliminary and from anonymous DOJ sources , so it 's a bit premature to get too worked up over a prosecution approach which Holder has n't even announced yet .
Still , given how many DOJ sources went to multiple newspapers at the same time to disclose Holder 's plans , it seems clear that this was a coordinated , approved effort to disseminate Holder 's intentions as a " trial balloon " to gauge public reaction .
Scott Horton 's reporting counters the indications from anonymous sources in the increasingly obsolete WaPo , Times , and WSJ coverage which suggests focus on only low - level agents and contractors , rather than policy makers , by reporting that his sources at DoJ indicate just the opposite [ emphasis ours ] ...
[ T] wo sources in the Justice Department confirm to me that Holder is preparing to appoint a special prosecutor to conduct a comprehensive investigation and , if necessary , bring charges .
Horton 's report is in stark contrast to Stephanopoulos ' " overnight reporting " , and that from the three newspapers , all of which seemed to indicate their sources said only " rogue " " rotten - apples " would be targetted .
Horton also takes pains to note , however , that " no final decision has been taken " on any of it .
And , as in the original NEWSWEEK report , the White House powers that be ( reportedly Emmanuel and Axlerod ) said to oppose such an investigation --- because they put politics over things like actual policy , and the Rule of Law --- have a strong hand in hoping to dissuade Holder from doing what is right , what is his job .
Jeremy Scahill quotes two leading anti-torture attorneys extensively , both of whom echo Greenwald to say that such a limited investigation / prosecution would be an absolute mockery .
Too bad Stephanopoulos did n't see fit to have them on his roundtable , rather than living dead tree Bob Woodward and chums .
Certainly the MSM reports and responses are all trial balloons to guage public interest , outrage , outcry .
With the mainstream corporate media 's ability to flip the switch any way they like ( most likely towards " the public does n't care " meme , as supported by the ABC yucksters ) , it 's important that you take some action to try to counter what will most certainly be the mainstream dissuasion against appropriate action here .
I should note that I began writing this follow - up to Saturday 's report early Sunday morning , and the Times , WaPo , WSJ , and ABC coverage was exactly what I had predicted was likely to occur in the graf above ( largely drafted prior to that predictable MSM coverage . )
So , if you wish to try to somewhat balance the power of the MSM , might I recommend contacting the DoJ with your opinion ( 202-514-2001 or AskDOJ@usdoj.gov ) .
Ask others to do the same .
Also , if you have n't already , please remember to sign on to Velvet Revolution 's DisbarTortureLawyers.com campaign .
If nothing else , those Bush attorneys who violated all professional standards to " legalize " the illegal acts of the regime need to be held accountable , if only by the slap on the wrist of disbarment .

UPDATE 7/15/09 : MSNBC offers another egregious example of corporate media failure --- in this case , again , " inside the beltway " corporate media failure --- in their " coverage " of Holder 's floated torture probe .
Glenn Greenwald is , as usual a must read here , beginning this way today :
NBC 's Chuck Todd --- who , remember , is billed as a reporter covering the White House , not a pundit expressing opinions --- was on MSNBC's Morning Joe on Tuesday discussing reports that Eric Holder is likely to appoint a prosecutor to investigate Bush torture crimes .
Needless to say , everyone agreed without question that investigations were a ridiculous distraction from what really matters and would be terribly unfair .
Distance education and its importance for the future of education with reviews on eleap software .
The education distance learning ( ODL ) is a teaching method that aims to offer a complete learning process , dynamic and efficient through technological resources .
Here , I can say that distance education works from a virtual integration between a student and a distance learning tutor , separated by time and space , but can relate to each other efficiently .
This means that in the distance education modality both involved in the process are not in the same physical environment , but still relate from an LMS platform to such that , of course , provides this kind of contact and relationship .
It is also possible to affirm , in this sense , that the growth of distance education has been configured in a more assertive , direct and structured way from the technological advancement and its accessibility to people , especially from the advent and popularization of broadband Internet .
In this context , it is important to make an association between the technological evolution that I mentioned here with the change in behavioral patterns and consumption habits of people of the most varied economic , demographic and psychographic profiles .
People , in this sense , began to change the way they relate to other people and this was considered a great evolution , or even a great revolution , in the most diverse formats of communication and process of exchanging diverse information between people .
Added to this fact , people began to become increasingly dynamic and especially interactive where everything was now easy to find and the distance between people began to narrow dramatically from social networks and smartphone messaging apps .
Access to information , in turn , became much easier with the advent of the Internet , and people began to look for new products , services , varied content and even new forms of knowledge .
This has led more and more people to start using digital resources to consume new content , develop professionally and acquire new skills and abilities as varied as possible and existing , by reading the reviews on eleap software online i can conclude that it is the best tool for distance learning programs in organization or educational institute .
In fact , the reviews on eleap software prove that people now have access to everything they need and demand in the palm of their hands via a smartphone , computer or tablet , both with Internet access .
In parallel with this paradigm shift , where even ordinary people begin to produce their own content for the sake of improving performance and teaching others , or even as a business opportunity , distance education is growing faster and faster .
with more specific and relevant features and functionality to make the learning process increasingly intuitive , complete and efficient .

Importance of Distance Education with eLeaP software
Far beyond being a new modality of education , distance education , once widely criticized and even sometimes trivialized , today has an extremely important role for education .
The distance brings a possibility of learning ever seen at other times .
The world is digital and connected .
Let ’s not close our eyes to this fact .
We are living in a new era and online education is part of it . ”
In this context , distance education works today as a great catalyst , creator and multiplier of knowledge , where people who are unable to access information in physical environments can simply , quickly and dynamically consume increasingly personalized and efficient content through distance education from an e-learning platform .
Therefore , we can say that distance education plays a fundamental role for education as a whole in our country and in all others that have easy access to broadband Internet for such .
With the reviews on eleap software we can conclude that online learning is gaining more space from the need to update the population as a whole , whether for personal or professional reasons , which seeks to ease of access to materials , interactivity and affordable values .
In other words , we can say that distance education provides a new paradigm in regular education .
This is no longer a trend , but a reality that benefits you thousands of people in every corner of our country .
New possibilities are being discovered every day with the evolution of ODL platforms in general and more and more new forms of consumption of diverse content are available , resulting in an increasingly complete , efficient and increasingly popular teaching modality in the world .
Distance education as a business opportunity
In view of the information quoted here by me about the strong growth trend of the distance education modality , in addition to the fact that people are increasingly looking for new ways of learning , as well as the improvement of personal and professional skills and competences , as well as more .
dynamic and interactive , I can say with certainty that starting an online course business today is one of the greatest business opportunities available .
That ’s because , as I said earlier , the demand for online courses in a wide range of segments is growing alarmingly fast from the benefits of this practice , as well as the advancement of distance learning solutions that exist today in the distance education market .
In addition , we can say that starting a distance education business , or even including an online course in your product and service portfolio ( even to build your authority on your business ) , is a great opportunity to see that the investment for this is considered low compared to other existing investments .
So here you have the opportunity to get into a business where demand grows rapidly , investment is relatively low , and you can take advantage of an LMS platform that integrates everything you need in one place without the need with this , external expenses with hosting , IT staff , among others .
To learn more about the costs the reviews on eleap software prove that you will eliminate when hiring a distance education platforms .
In this sense , it is important to say that as the demand for distance education courses grows a lot , and the tendency is to grow even more , many people and educational institutions are already starting to structure and plan their online courses to increase their revenues with an innovative form of business .
However , even with the increase in the offer of online courses , the demand is still much higher throughout the country and , therefore , there are still several opportunities in several distinct segments that have not been explored , making it an excellent opportunity to join the course .
distance education .
To do so , it is nice for you to know how to efficiently create an online course to succeed on your journey .
Therefore , it is essential that you plan for it , know the ODL market you are going to be in , your competitors , your potential students , structure and plan your content production , set goals and think about the outreach to sell courses online .
In short , I can say that the distance education modality is an excellent business opportunity .
So start your planning in a structured and assertive way that I ’m sure you will be very successful in your ODL project .
Anyway , I hope I could help you to know a little more about how the distance education modality works , as well as its importance for the future of education in the world .
As I said , the demand for online courses has been growing a lot and supply has not kept up with this strong trend of rapid growth .
With this , the opportunity today to develop an online course business is real and must be taken into account .
By the reviews on eleap software it is observed that today we have a complete , intuitive and 100 % customizable LMS platform for online courses , being the best on the market today .

30 Inviting Church Pictures
A photographer always goes to church .
The unique architecture and peaceful atmosphere are just inviting you to try your hand at a few photos , no matter how big or small the church may be .
Two short films , ' The Defenders ' , and ' The License ' have been created in response to the Supreme Court of California upholding proposition 8 which allowed the majority to take away rights from a minority segment of the population .
The films are by Keith Hartman and are a clever , funny , yet scary and accurate assessment of how dangerous proposition 8 is to the civil liberties of all Americans .
The films question how far society will go to enforce " traditional marriage " and how much hypocrisy exists .
French politicians seem ready once again to make a political issue out of Muslim women ’s clothes .
A group of 58 legislators has called for a parliamentary enquiry into what they said was a growing number of women wearing “ the burqa and the niqab on the national territory . “
Their initiative comes five years after France banned the Muslim headscarf from French state schools .
President Nicolas Sarkozy has n’t tipped his hand yet , but his government ’s spokesman , Luc Chatel , said on Friday that Paris could opt for a law “ if , after this enquiry , we see that burqa wearing was forced , which is to say it was contrary to our republican principles . ”
“ There are people in this country who are walking around in portable prisons , ” said André Gerin , a Communist legislator who was behind the initiative .
More than 40 legislators from Sarkozy ’s ruling centre - right party were also signatories .
“ We have to be able to open a loyal and frank dialogue with all Muslims about the question of the place of Islam in this country … taking into account the slide towards fundamentalism ( of some Muslims ) , ” Gerin told France Info radio .
The politicians ’ appeal argued that burqas and niqabs violated the principle of gender equality : “ If the Islamic headscarf amounted to a distinctive sign of belonging to a religion , here we have the extreme stage of this practice .
It is no longer just an ostentatious show of religion , but an attack on women ’s freedom and the affirmation of femininity .
Clothed in a burqa or niqab , she is in a situation of reclusion , exclusion and inadmissible humiliation .
Her very existence is negated . ”
Mohammed Moussaoui , head of the French Council of the Muslim faith ( CFCM ) , said he was shocked by the proposal and asked why politicians wanted to focus on what he called a marginal phenomenon when they had bigger economic problems to deal with .
“ Bringing up the subject in this way , through the creation of a parliamentary commission , amounts to a stigmatisation of Islam and the Muslims of France , ” he said .
No estimates exist for the total number of women wearing the all - encompassing garments in France and whether their number has been on the rise .
Gerin said the commission would try to establish these facts .
There are reasons to question just how widespread the practice really is .
In previous public debates in France about Muslim headscarves or Muslim demands for hospitals to respect Islamic traditions ( no men doctors to examine women , etc ) , some politicians and media seemed to assume the word “ anecdote ” was the singular of “ data ” and present a few stories as proof of a worrying trend .
Reactions have been mixed within Sarkozy ’s government .
State secretary for urban affairs Fadela Amara , one of three cabinet members of Muslim background , has advocated a law against burqas and niqabs while Immigration Minister Eric Besson says France should oppose this clothing “ but it has to do it by education , by teaching , by dialogue .
A law would be ineffective and would create tensions we do n’t need right now . ”
Sociologist Jean Bauberot , one of the leading specialists on France ’s system of laïcité , or separation of church and state , told Libération this debate was similar to the headscarf controversy of 2003 - 2004 in that both showed a French tendency to think the state can know what ’s best for its citizens .
But there was an important difference in that facial veils could pose “ practical problems for recognising the identity of the person standing in front of you . ”
We ’ve discussed a similar argument in Canada on this blog .
“ Of course , one may regret that women wear a burqa , but one cannot liberate people despite themselves , ” he remarked .
Do you think there ’s a difference between women covering their hair and covering their faces ?
Are both religious traditions that western countries should respect ?
Or do the practical problem Bauberot mentions mean a country could say yes to hijabs but no to niqabs ?
The bodies of more than 165,000 Commonwealth soldiers killed on the Western Front during the First World War are still missing , according to the CWGC .
Some of their remains have been found as land was ploughed or cleared for development , but there has never before been a discovery on this scale .
European elections
French New Anti-Capitalist Party promotes Keynesian reformism
By Antoine Lerougetel and Alex Lantier
6 June 2009
The European Union parliamentary election campaign of France ’s New Anti-Capitalist Party ( Nouveau Parti Anti-capialiste — NPA ) along reformist lines confirms the assessment which the World Socialist Web Site made of the NPA at the time of the organization ’s February 2009 founding congress .
Launched at the instigation of the Ligue Communiste Révolutionnaire ( LCR ) , which dissolved itself into the NPA , the NPA initiative represented the LCR ’s attempt to repudiate any reference to Marxism and integrate itself into the French political establishment .
Even before the NPA founding congress , Jean - Luc Mélenchon , a long - serving member of the Socialist Party ( PS ) and former minister in the 1997 - 2002 Plural Left government of Socialist Party Prime Minister Lionel Jospin , broke away to form the Left Party in November 2008 .
He proposed that the NPA join the Left Front alongside the French Communist Party ( PCF ) and other “ left ” parties to contest the European elections .
An active minority faction within the NPA , led by LCR veteran Christian Picquet , urged an open alliance with the Left Party and the PCF ’s Left Front .
These proposals placed the NPA , which recruits its membership based on protest politics and the media image of LCR presidential candidate Olivier Besancenot , in a difficult situation .
Joining the Left Front would publicly associate the NPA with Mélenchon ’s and the PCF ’s record of support for austerity policies .
On the other hand , refusing to join the Left Front would lead to charges , from Picquet and the broader membership , of breaking solidarity with Mélenchon and the PCF .
The NPA leadership ultimately decided to stay separate from the Left Front , but to maneuver to place responsibility for the divide on the Left Front instead of on the NPA .
Criticizing the PS for “ social - liberal ” austerity policies , it demanded that the Left Front organize a campaign separate from the PS not only for this year ’s European elections , but also for the 2010 French regional elections .
It made this request knowing that the PCF survives financially only thanks to its national alliance with the PS .
The PS divides up legislative seats so as to enable the PCF to maintain a small group in the National Assembly and retain the resulting financial subsidy .
The NPA met with Left Party and PCF leaders March 2 to discuss an electoral alliance for the European elections .
Predictably , these parties refused to commit to presenting lists separate from the PS .
On March 8 , Christian Picquet announced that his group , the Unitary Left , had joined the Left Front for the European Union election , while retaining his membership in the NPA .
Besancenot stressed that he had “ no enemies ” in the Left Front and was always prepared to extend a “ fraternal hand ” to it , but in order to maintain its pose of independence from the PS , the NPA announced March 9 that it would run separately from the Left Front .
It gave as an explanation “ the refusal of the Left Front to exclude a definitive alliance with the PS in coming elections , and especially the regional elections . ”
On May 18 , a Convergences and Alternatives faction constituted inside the NPA national leadership , advocating a “ unitary struggle ” together with Left Front parties .
The group ’s spokesman , trade unionist Yann Cochin , told Agence France - Presse : “ We are for a unitary front in the struggles and in the elections . ”
He added that there was already a “ convergence of demands ” between the NPA and the Left Front .
Cochin claimed his group represents roughly 10 percent of the NPA membership .
Thanks to large - scale media coverage of the NPA Congress and particularly of Besancenot , the NPA started its campaign polling at roughly 9 percent of the vote .
In line with the establishment left ’s generally poor performance in the European campaign , this has fallen somewhat to 6 - 7 percent of the vote in most polls .
The Left Front has increased its projected vote , reportedly to some extent by winning over NPA voters , raising its poll numbers from 4.5 to 6 percent .
The mainstay of the NPA ’s campaign meetings has been calls for more protests and strikes , aiming to benefit from the upsurge in workers ’ struggles due to the economic crisis , particularly in the automobile and auto - supply sectors .
The problem facing the working class in France is not , however , lack of militant activity .
It is principally the need to form an organization to coordinate workers ’ struggles and arm them with an independent and genuinely socialist political perspective , in opposition to France ’s trade unions .
The NPA uncritically supported the three one - day strike and protest actions organised this year — January 29 , March 19 and May 1 — by France ’s eight main trade union confederations ( known as the G8 ) .
The NPA did not make the obvious political point that Sarkozy has nothing to fear from these occasional one - day strikes .
Since 2007 , President Nicolas Sarkozy has obtained passage , in close concert with the unions , of all his pension cuts and labor “ reforms . ”
The unions ’ days of action were held for the purpose of defusing popular opposition and providing political cover for their collaboration with Sarkozy .
Rather than exposing this treachery , the NPA signed joint appeals of support for the unions with the PS , the PCF , the Left Party and other “ left ” groups .
The NPA carefully cultivates the fetish of trade union and “ left ” unity in protests against the social crisis created by the world economic crisis and the government ’s austerity policies .
While occasionally criticising the trade union confederations — whose main components are the PCF - aligned CGT ( General Confederation of Labour ) and the SP - aligned CFDT ( French Democratic Confederation of Labour ) — for their lack of militant initiatives , the NPA never denounces their integration into the French state and collaboration in preparing Sarkozy ’s attacks on living standards , working conditions and democratic rights .
The NPA ’s answer to the complicity of the unions with the state is not for workers to build a revolutionary party that will lead the working class in the struggle for power .
Instead , Besancenot has repeatedly called for a “ new May 1968 , ” referring to the student protests and general strike that were sold out by the PCF and the CGT in exchange for wage concessions .
This call for a new 1968 is perhaps more revealing than Besancenot himself realizes .
Calling for a new 1968 begs the question :
What were the results of the experience of 1968 ?
While the ten-million - strong 1968 strike demonstrated the enormous power of the working class , French history since then has principally demonstrated the crushing effects of the strike ’s lack of political perspective .
The ultimate defeat of the strike and the incorporation of ex-student radicals and the PCF into the French establishment ushered in four decades of political stagnation and defeats for the working class .
Entire industries — notably textiles and steel — have collapsed , devastating large sections of the country .
Job-cutting and privatizations have gutted the public service sector .
With the help of the PS and PCF , the establishment has succeeded in marginalising Marxism as a force exercising any significant political influence in France .
Whether Besancenot fully realizes it or not , his protest politics objectively form part of the French establishment ’s efforts to prevent the emergence of conscious working class politics in France and ensure similar defeats for the workers in the future .
This is why the bourgeoisie is so eager to put him on television .
A pro-capitalist perspective
There was no clearer indication of this pro-capitalist orientation than the political statement published by François Sabado , a leading NPA member , in the May 2009 issue of Contretemps — a magazine devoted to the writings of long - time LCR members and the NPA ’s newer libertarian recruits among petty - bourgeois intellectuals .
Despite its title —
“ An anti-capitalist alternative in Europe ” — Sabado ’s article proposes that the NPA serve as an instrument to pressure the bourgeoisie into bailing out European capitalism .
He writes : “ Europe could constitute the functional setting for a Keynesian bailout .
However , the politics of the European Union clearly illustrate the incapacity of the ruling classes to carry out such a turn . ”
He laments that the ruling classes “ do not intend to impose new financial and accounting standards that could effectively control the availability of credit to restart economic activity . ”
Sabado implies that working class action is needed to push the bourgeoisie towards a Keynesian program .
He writes : “ The Keynesian option was not the socio- economic mode of construction chosen by the ideological debate inside the dominant classes .
It was imposed by relations of power , a rising tide of workers ’ struggles . ”
These lines constitute yet another public repudiation by Sabado and the NPA of revolutionary politics .
Keynesian policies refer to deficit spending by the bourgeois state , boosting overall demand in the market to counterbalance the destruction of workers ’ purchasing power by the economic crisis .
Such nationally - oriented policies have been carried out by many capitalist governments .
They have been revived by the major powers on an ad hoc basis in response to the financial collapse of 2008 .
In the 1930s , they took such forms as massive military spending by Nazi Germany and Franklin Roosevelt ’s New Deal in the US .
Keynesian policies seek not to overthrow capitalism , but to save it under conditions where the unfettered operation of the free market threatens economic collapse and the eruption of social revolution .
Proponents of Keynesian policies , including those , like Sabado , who seek to channel workers ’ struggles behind a Keynesian program , are not “ anti-capitalists ” but apologists for and defenders of capitalism .
Sabado complains that the stimulus packages adopted by the major powers are too small to prevent a major fall in economic activity .
“ According to Nobel prize - winning economist Paul Krugman , ” he writes , “ the Obama stimulus package , which amounts to over 5 percent of GDP in 2009 , will succeed only in reducing by half the likely magnitude of the recession .
What should we say of European stimulus plans ?
They are at best undersized : 1.3 percent of GDP in the UK , 1 percent in France , 0.8 percent in Germany , 0.1 percent in Italy . ”
Sabado knows that central banks that oppose price inflation , such as the European Central Bank , are hostile to bailout packages that the bourgeois state often funds by printing money .
He writes : “ We must finish with the independence of the European Central Bank , which must become a public bank subject to the political institutions that the peoples of Europe will establish for themselves . ”
In an aside , Sabado notes that the Keynesian policies of the 1930s , based as they were on individual capitalist states , “ were essentially deployed on the basis of armaments economies . ”
Despite implicitly acknowledging the role Keynesian policies played in preparing the foundations of World War II , Sabado does not reconsider his advocacy of them .
In tandem with his assertion of the viability of capitalist reform , Sabado evinces complete demoralization towards the activity of the working class .
His document mentions none of the strikes that are shaking the public sector , the universities and significant parts of the private sector ( such as auto ) which had not seen strikes in years .
Even bourgeois politicians like PS leader Ségolène Royal and Gaullist leader Dominique de Villepin warn of a “ revolutionary risk ” in France .
But Sabado can only opine , “ There is no mechanical relation between economic crisis and the class struggle . ”
As growing sections of the working class enter into struggle and the volume of world trade and industrial production collapse , Sabado is left to repeat the LCR ’s old phrases about “ a social and ecological emergency plan , ” which would include asking the state to outlaw sackings .
His document has only this merit : it shows that these pseudo - radical phrases , long repeated in LCR documents , are consistent with a Keynesian , pro-capitalist orientation .
They have nothing socialist , revolutionary or genuinely anti-capitalist about them .
Without any political proposals to offer to the growing layers of the working class entering into struggle , Sabado vents his fear that the NPA will lose influence to the neo-fascists .
He writes : “ The difference between historical periods [ the 1930s and the present ] are clear .
A race is nonetheless taking place between workers , the social movements , the workers ’ movement , and the populist , authoritarian and xenophobic right . ”
Sabado concludes with a discussion of the NPA ’s perspective for political action , addressing , in particular , the question of why the NPA is not building an open electoral alliance with sections of the PS or the PCF .
This question , which substantial sections of the NPA membership ask themselves , is particularly relevant because Sabado has proposed a Keynesian policy — that is to say , one that can be carried out only with the collaboration of top echelons of the state bureaucracy .
Such a policy requires support , therefore , from the established parties of the bourgeois left .
Sabado writes :
“ In all the countries where the radical left has participated in government with the social democracy or the center - left , it became a political satellite of the free - market left . ”
As examples , he cites the PCF , whose popularity plummeted as it participated in PS governments that imposed social austerity policies and , in the early 1990s , joined the Gulf war against Iraq , and Romano Prodi ’s 2006 - 2008 Unione government in Italy , in which Rifondazione Comunista participated , and which pushed through pension cuts and participation in the US - led occupation of Afghanistan .
As the NPA ’s campaign and Sabado ’s perspective document show , the NPA is likewise a political satellite of the ruling parties , differing from the PCF and Rifondazione only in the eccentricity of its orbit .
If Sabado refrains from openly consummating the alliance with the PS and the PCF that is implied by his political perspective , it is because he fears it will lead to a collapse in popular support for the NPA along the lines of what befell the PCF and Rifondazione .
The conclusion that Sabado draws in relation to them applies equally well to the NPA : “ The attractive force of bourgeois institutions has been stronger than all the anti-free market proclamations . ”

The EISCAT Svalbard Radar is a fixed 42 m dish and a fully steerable 32 m dish used for research into the Suns interaction with the magnetosphere .
JMaCS , the Java API derived from experimental software developed for the monitoring and controlling of these dishes , has recently been rewritten in Scala .
In this paper , soon to be presented at the forthcoming 14th International EISCAT Workshop , it is explained how , with the help of Scala 's type members and the ' type- safe singleton ' pattern , the new API allows a range of ' programmable device ' components to be written more concisely , and in a type - safe manner .
Comparisons are made with the original Java implementation .
This move to Scala was motivated by the better support provided for writing components , such as Programmable Devices ( PDs ) , with traits , a more concise syntax , type inferencing and Actors .
However , type - safety , language extensibility via libraries , functional programming and scripting proved to be invaluable .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - California farmer Tom Willey was first attracted to organic farming 21 years ago after noticing how many chemicals he was using in conventional farming .

As a certified organic farmer selling everything from artichokes to zucchinis from his 75 - acre farm in the San Joaquin Valley in California , Willey has become a respected pioneer in the organic farming community .
But now with the deep recession in the United States , farmers such as Willey are worried about the future of organic farming that grew sharply during the boom times .
The industry , which prides itself on delivering wholesome and safe products , also is worried and even a little angry about new food safety rules emanating from Washington .
“ There is a lot of transparency in the organic food system and we ’ve had it in place for several decades and we do so willingly , ” said Willey .
“ The lack of that is what characterizes industrial producers . ”
The global market for organic food has grown sharply over the past decade , with the United States accounting for about 45 percent of the global share .
Sales of organic food have soared from $ 1 billion in 1990 to an estimated $ 20 billion in 2007 and by 2006 became the fastest growing sector in the industry , according to the Organic Trade Association .
But now growth is coming to a halt as Americans tighten their purse strings and opt for cheaper alternatives .
“ Millions of people who were occasionally buying organic products have cut back to save money and we ’re seeing the real decrease in growth in the last nine months , ” said Ronnie Cummins , the national director of the Organic Consumers Association .
Whole Foods Market Inc , a chain that sells organic and luxury grocery items , reported in May that quarterly sales fell nearly 5 percent from its stores opened at least one year .
Profits also fell but the company said it avoided going into the red by cutting prices to keep consumers coming back .
Neil Currie , an UBS analyst said consumers are seeking lower prices and staying clear from luxury food products .
“ Organic food comes at a premium price and Whole Foods sales have been quite negative , ” said Currie .
Growth in the organic sector dwindled to 12.5 percent last year compared to the 20 percent it used to enjoy .
“ We might not see that kind of growth again , ” said Cummins .
An added worry for organic farmers is a new food safety legislation that passed last month in the Energy and Commerce committee of the U.S. House of Representatives that would be the most sweeping reform of the food safety system in close to 50 years .
The U.S. food supply system has been battered by a series of food recalls -- covering a range of products including lettuce , spinach , peanuts and most recently , cookie dough -- since 2006 that have eroded consumer confidence .
Under the new legislation , the industry would have to pay a $ 500 registration fee per facility to pay for more plant inspections .
Farms , restaurants and retail food establishments that sell their products directly to consumers , not businesses , are exempt from this fee .
There would be a $ 175,000 cap on such fees .
Organic farmers still say the definition of a facility is unclear in the legislation and they worry about additional costs that might be incurred on small businesses .
Inspections will be more frequent , taking place every six to 12 months at high - risk facilities and between 18 months and three years for lower - risk locations .
As part of a broader food safety overhaul , the Obama administration recently announced the creation of a new post of deputy commissioner for foods at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
The position would oversee all food safety activities within the agency .
Most organic farmers believe food safety reforms are necessary , but they worry small and medium organic farmers will be unfairly targeted .
“ Based on the escalating cost that would be involved in conforming to this legislation -- administrative fees , record keeping and internal labor requirements -- we can force out of business some of the highest quality practitioners , ” said Mark Kastel , an analyst at the Cornucopia Institute in Wisconsin .
Kastel said organic farmers are tempering their enthusiasm for food safety reform with some skepticism .
“ The same players who helped create the problems that exist today are enthusiastically embracing what they say is the answer , ” he said .
“ It ’s unsettling when grocery associations and major processed food producers get together and agree with the government that they ’re going to do this without any regard to the high quality organic practitioners . ”

The all singing , door - slamming female white - handed gibbon A female gibbon has been observed enhancing her territorial song with a percussive noise .
Each time her song reached its natural climax , the gibbon slammed shut the door of her enclosure , using the loud noise it made to accentuate her call .
The gibbon used the door to create a single beat rather than a rhythm .
But her behaviour is yet another example of how smaller ape species are also capable of novel tool use , says the primatologist who witnessed it .
Thomas Geissmann is a leading expert on the conservation and behaviour of small apes , which comprise four genera of gibbon and siamang .
Yet while great apes , the gorillas , chimps and orang utans , are frequently observed to use tools both in captivity and in the wild , gibbons are rarely seen to do the same .
That was until Geissman observed a female white - handed gibbon ( Hylobates lar ) living with a male at Zoo Seeteufel in Studen , Switzerland .
In many gibbon species , the males call out using a series of short distinct noises that gradually become more complex .
At regular intervals , females join in , singing long phrases known as ' great calls ' .
The gibbons are thought to produce these sounds to defend their territory , and they can be heard from up to 2 km away in natural forest .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
No other gibbons lived at the zoo with the white - handed pair , but a group of siamangs did live in an enclosure nearby .
But despite the absence of other gibbons , the pair sang regularly .
However , Geissmann soon noticed that the female would exhibit a rather unique behaviour every other time she made her great call .
Just a few seconds before she started her great call , Geissmann reports in the 5th edition of the Gibbon Journal , the female would retreat into her sleeping box , singing as she went .
She then half shut the sliding door to the wooden box .
At the climax to her call , she would then slam the sliding door shut , and after it bounced back open again , she would jump out of the box , thrashing her arms and legs in a display .
" She would go into her little sleeping box made of wood , and always at the same point of her duet song she would jump out and smash shut the sliding door , which made a bang , " says Geissman , who is based at the University of Zurich in Switzerland .
Gibbons are so different to other apes that it is possible that they will surprise us in completely different areas of cognition
Primatologist Thomas Geissmann " I realised what I had seen was tool use . "
The noise of the door slamming can be heard to coincide exactly with the climax of her great call .
More often than not when singing , the gibbon would enhance her song in this way , and she almost never slammed the door at other times .
In all his years studying gibbons in the wild and in captivity , Geissmann has never seen or heard anything like it .
He believes that the gibbon consciously made an effort to enhance her song with the door slam , which can be considered a novel example of tool use .
It also bears a striking resemblance to one other example of primate behaviour recorded back in the 1960s at the Gombe study site in Tanzania .
Then chimpanzee expert Jane Goodall recorded a wild male chimp , which she called Mike , using four empty gasoline drums to make a loud noise .
Mike was a low - ranking male , and would loudly bang on the drums to enhance his threat displays to other males .
It seemed to work , as Mike rose to the top of his troop without fighting any other males .
A male hangs out of the wooden sleeping box while the female sits inside Wild orang utans have also been recorded calling through folded up leaves , which increase the intensity and frequency range of their calls , while wild capuchin monkeys have also been seen bashing stones in threat displays to rivals .
" People tend to expect great things of the great apes , because they are known to be related to humans , " says Geissman .
Great apes also tend to be intensively studied compared to small apes , he says , which means many more aspects of their lives and abilities are revealed .
" But I 'm sure we will find many interesting things if we continue to look at gibbons .
Gibbons are so different to other apes that it is possible that they will surprise us in completely different areas of cognition . "

I 'm not going to change Camden in one year here .
But you just have to make small victories . "
Home to nearly 88,000 people , more than a third of them below 18 years old , Camden is New Jersey 's sixth largest city and its poorest .
Statewide and nationally , it ranks at or near the bottom in virtually every economic and social category the government measures .
Half of Camden 's residents receive welfare , and its percentage of children living in poverty , 65 , is the highest of any major United States city .
The teen - age death rate is 354 percent of the state average , infant mortality 185 percent and low birth weight 167 percent .
In an article that still rankles city leaders , Time magazine described it in January as a city where " only people with no other choice " live .
Within view of Philadelphia 's gleaming skyline , Molina Elementary School sits in a north Camden neighborhood that residents and outsiders alike agree is the worst section of the city .
Open drug deals on street corners , youth gangs and drive - by shootings have given the name Danger Zone to the five - square - block area of dilapidated or gutted houses .
My brother is very hard to buy gifts for .
I try every year to buy him something that will make an impression and that he will like .
Each year I get him something that he thinks is ok , but I am never right on target .
This year I wanted to find him a birthday present that he would actually like .
I went to dozens of stores and searched on the Internet looking for something that said it was the right thing for him .
After much looking I finally found something that I knew he would love , it was the Three Wolves One Moon T - Shirt .
The moment I saw it I knew that I had to get it .
I know how much my brother loves wolves , so I knew the minute that I saw this shirt that it was perfect fro him .
I have bought him shirts before in the past that he did n't like .
But , the problem with those shirts was that he did n't like the material of the shirts or they had collars and he does n't like collars on his shirts , he prefers T - Shirts .
That 's what made this so extra special , it was a nice durable T - Shirt that depicted three gorgeous wolves on it that were howling up at the moon .
It also had just enough fog and stars in the background to really make the T - Shirt pop .
When I gave my brother the Three Wolves One Moon T- Shirt he really liked it .
I knew that he would , but I was still glad to see the huge smile on his face when he saw it come out of the bag .
Since I gave him the shirt I have seen him wear it at least three separate times .
The shirt still looks like brand new even though he has washed it several times .
If you are looking for a great gift for a wolf lover that you know , or you love wolves yourself then you will want to make sure that you purchase the Three Wolves One Moon T - Shirt .

Canadians are particularly upset over their cellphone rates .
( ( istockphoto ) )
Class - action lawsuits against telecommunications providers are flying like text messages from a teenager .
Websites and Facebook groups protesting cellphone rates are popping up faster than spam in your inbox .
People are even rallying on Parliament Hill to oppose the purposeful slowing down of internet connections .
There is a new disconnect happening — one that politicians in the upcoming election need to take note of .
Normally placid Canadians are speaking up .
Consumers have never been angrier with their telecommunications service providers and they are letting the companies know it .
A selection of comments on CBC stories over the past few months tells the story :
" Crooks ...
When are we gonna stand up for ourselves and take down these criminals ? " wrote spacholka .
" I can't believe how ridiculous cell phone service is getting in Canada .
When I find myself watching an American channel on TV , all I see are ads trying to lure customers with cheap plans , " said CrystalP .
" While up here in Canada , all I keep hearing about is how prices are going up , and new charges are being added .
It 's time for change , we need to allow more competition into the cell phone market in Canada . "
" Bell has been a blight on technological innovation for decades in Canada , " wrote George Keith Young .
" Anyone who complains about American corporations and monopolies , etc. , just think ' Rogers ' .
They top them all , " said MatthewBaker .
Consumer rights groups , which have long fielded complaints from cable and phone customers , say they have never seen anything like what has unfolded over the past year .
" The forces are getting to be perfect - storm like , " says John Lawford , counsel for the Public Interest Advocacy Centre .
" There 's a tipping point .
People are fed up . "
A plethora of lawsuits
The discontent has mainly manifested itself in a slew of lawsuits .
Last August , Montreal resident Fernand Savoie — aided by Quebec 's consumer watchdog , L'Union des consommateurs — filed a class - action against Vidéotron Ltée. for introducing download limits to his high - speed internet service .
Vidéotron , the lawsuit said , had broken its contractual agreement by materially changing the unlimited download service for which Savoie had signed up .
In its defence , the company said it was it within its rights because it gave Savoie and other customers two months notice of the change .
Similarly , Montreal resident Myrna Raphael filed a class- action lawsuit against Bell Canada Inc. in June over the company 's throttling of internet speeds , also with help from the Quebec consumer watchdog .
Raphael is seeking the return of 80 per cent of her monthly subscription fee , which she says is about equal to the diminished speed , plus damages for false advertising .
Bell had promised " always - on , constant high - speed , " she said in her lawsuit , yet the company was purposely degrading the quality of her connection .
The consumers union in July expanded the lawsuit to include Ontario residents .
Hundreds of customers who lined up for iPhones in July were disappointed by low stocks at Rogers stores .
( ( Peter Nowak / CBC ) )
A pair of class - action suits were also launched in July in Quebec against Bell and Telus Corp. , who announced earlier in the month that they would begin charging cellphone customers for incoming messages unless they were signed up to a texting plan .
Saint - Pierre Grenier Avocats Inc. , the Montreal law firm behind both lawsuits , is using the same reasoning as the Vidéotron case — that Bell and Telus have illegally changed the terms of their contracts through introducing the new fees .
Clauses in the contracts that allow the companies to change their fees with 30 days notice is " abusive , " the lawyers say .
Another class - action against Bell in Ontario was given the green light by courts in February .
Peter De Wolf , from Braeside , Ont. , launched the suit in 2005 against the company for charging him a $ 19 administration fee after failing to pay his ExpressVu satellite television bill on time .
Combined with interest , Bell was demanding more than 60 per cent interest on his bill , a rate he says is illegal under the Criminal Code .
The biggest class - action of them all , however , is Regina - based lawyer Tony Merchant 's lawsuit over the system access fee paid by the large majority of cellphone users in Canada since 1986 .
Merchant started the lawsuit in 2004 and a Saskatchewan court gave it the go ahead last September .
Merchant says Canada 's cellphone companies have been misrepresenting their system access fees as government charges , and he is seeking a repayment of nearly $ 20 billion .
Merchant says he will soon be launching another new suit over the 911 emergency fee charged by cellphone carriers .
The respective companies have denied any wrongdoing in each case and all of the lawsuits are still before the courts .
Quebec a hotbed of discontent
A disproportionate number of the cases have originated in Quebec because the province , along with Manitoba and Saskatchewan , has stringent limits on the costs that can be recouped by a defendant if the class - action is defeated , or if it fails to get court certification .
Plaintiffs are limited to paying costs similar to those found in small - claims courts if they are not successful , which means they are immune to hefty penalties for waging an unsuccessful case .
Quebec has additional incentive for class actions in that the first party that starts a lawsuit gets full rights to any damages awarded whereas other provinces allow additional claimants to join later in the process , which can result in law firms fighting over the spoils .
The rules have allowed Quebec residents to take the national lead in fighting back against telecommunications providers , says Anthony Hemond , telecommunications analyst for L'union des consommateurs .
A protester holds up his sign at the rally for net neutrality in Ottawa in May .
( ( Peter Nowak / CBC ) )
" They are measures designed to help people get justice , " he says .
Besides lawsuits , consumer anger has also found prodigious expression in a medium that has become notorious for the venting of displeasure — the internet .
Last December , tens of thousands of people poured into a group on Facebook , the social - networking site , to protest the imminent introduction of a restrictive copyright reform bill by the government .
The backlash was enough to persuade Industry Minister Jim Prentice to hold off on the legislation for a few months .
The online protest 's efficacy set a precedent and inspired tens of thousands of potential buyers to launch a similar offensive in July in response to Rogers Communications Inc. 's rate plans for Apple Inc . 's long - awaited iPhone .
With 60,000 petitioners drawing a good deal of negative media attention for Rogers , the company decided to temporarily drop its rates two days ahead of the iPhone 's launch .
Fans of the iPhone scored a big victory as a contrite Rogers backpedalled , but the damage had been done .
Ruinediphone.com proved to have a life beyond Apple 's device , says Graham Fair , who became the spokesman for the site when its founder wished to remain anonymous .
Even after Rogers lowered its rates and ameliorated many of the complaints , the site still served as a focal point for frustration with the company and the cellphone industry in general .
" People are generally questioning whether they 're getting value for their money , " he says .
( Online protests and their efficacy are looked at in depth in a Tuesday story as part of this special report . )
Throttling most emotional issue
The issue that has perhaps drawn the most intense vitriol , however , is the slowing down or " throttling " of connection speeds by internet service providers such as Bell and Rogers .
The moves to throttle usage of peer - to - peer software such as BitTorrent , which the providers say is necessary to prevent congestion on their networks , have drawn howls of protest about ISP interference with the internet .
Slowing the speeds of a select online application is the thin edge of the wedge that will eventually expand into ISPs picking and choosing which internet services get priority , a violation of net neutrality principles , the angry customers say .
" When did Bell deign to say what 's good and what 's bad ? " one angry customer told CBCNews.ca in May .
" Who gave them that right ? "
Bell and Rogers have over the past few months become a dartboard for net neutrality advocates .
NDP and Liberal MPs Charlie Angus and David McGuinty , respectively , filed private member 's bills over the summer looking for stricter rules governing the conduct of telecommunications providers .
The Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic filed two separate complaints with the Privacy Commissioner .
The Canadian Association of Internet Providers ( CAIP ) , a group of Bell 's wholesale customers , filed a complaint with the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission that attracted support from internet giants Google Inc. and Skype .
The CRTC is expected to rule on the CAIP dispute in October .
Worst of all for the companies , their own customers descended on Parliament Hill for an anti-throttling rally in May .
About 300 protesters showed up to say " Hands off our internet " to Bell and Rogers .

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and top Democrats opened an all - fronts charge Tuesday to pass a $ 1 trillion , 10 - year health care overhaul by August , unveiling legislation that would tax the wealthy to pay for universal coverage , create a public insurance plan and require individuals to carry insurance and businesses to offer it .
The bill would also begin wide - ranging experiments to change the way doctors and hospitals are paid in an effort to slow decades of relentless cost increases .
The legislation arrived after a strong shove from President Obama at a White House meeting Monday , when he ordered Democratic House and Senate leaders to begin moving bills that have languished for months as opponents have gathered force and polls show public skepticism on the rise .
Pelosi , D - San Francisco , and three key committee chairmen she has dubbed the " three tenors " - Democratic Reps. George Miller of Martinez , Henry Waxman of Los Angeles and Charles Rangel of New York - vowed to make history by achieving universal coverage , a dream of Democrats since President Harry Truman .
" Inaction is not an option , " Pelosi said .
The Democrats described a crisis among individuals , businesses and governments at all levels facing cost increases that are driving all of them toward financial ruin .
" You will never again be one treatment away from bankruptcy , " Miller promised .
The bill would levy a surtax starting at 1 percent on individuals earning more than $ 280,000 , rising to 5.4 percent for those earning $ 1 million a year .
Businesses would have to pay a tax of 8 percent of their payroll if they do not offer coverage , with an exemption for businesses with payrolls less than $ 250,000 .
Business groups immediately slammed the idea , saying it would impose an enormous tax on small businesses and kill jobs .
" If there 's one sure way to kill the goose that lays the golden egg , this is it , " said U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Tom Donohue .
Obama and Democrats see health care reform as central to their election victory last year and are determined to succeed for fear they will not have another chance .
But conservative " Blue Dog " Democrats threatened a revolt over mandates on small businesses .
The House , Senate and administration are at odds over which taxes to raise .
Two Senate committees are clashing with each other and the House .
In an effort to hold Democrats together , Pelosi has begun sounding like a Blue Dog herself , emphasizing " savings , savings , savings " and " squeezing " excess costs out of the system .
" We are committed to fiscal soundness , " she said .
" Lowering costs is essential to this . "
Rep . Pete Stark , D - Fremont , chair of the Ways and Means health panel and one of the House negotiators , predicted a close vote when the bill comes to the floor , with all but unanimous Republican opposition .
Health care is a giant , complex industry , representing more than one - sixth of the U.S. economy , an estimated $ 2.5 trillion or $ 8,160 per resident .
Changing that system , however unpopular or dysfunctional in its individual parts , is an immense political and technical challenge .
While the health reform clashes are starting to look reminiscent of the failed effort by former President Bill Clinton , Pelosi has vowed not to let that happen .
Rangel 's Ways and Means Committee and Miller 's Education and Labor Committee scheduled action on the legislation this week .
Rep. Mike Thompson , D - St. Helena and a member of the Ways and Means Committee , did not join the Blue Dog revolt last week , saying he favors a government - provided insurance option .
He said his constituents are nearly split among three positions :
" About a third of the folks I hear from want single - payer , " or one , government - provided system , Thompson said .
" About a third of the people I hear from say that health care reform of any type is socialism , and the third group wants an improvement in health care , and they want access to quality health care , they do n't want to continue to pay the prices they 've been paying . "
But nobody wants to pay for fixing the system , he said .
" I suspect everybody has concerns about having to pay more , or how it 's going to be paid for , " Thompson said .
" The truth is , without fixing health care they 're going to be paying more , and that 's the problem . "

It ’s no secret that the fossil - fuel industry produces many of the talking points Republicans use to scare voters about energy legislation .
Usually , though , dirty energy execs do n’t literally sign on as authors .
House Republicans are circulating a PowerPoint document that purports to show the regional breakdown of costs for energy consumers under the Waxman - Markey climate and energy bill ( ACES ) .
The header : “ Most States Lose Under the Pending Climate Bill . ”
The catch ?
It appears to have been authored by the coal giant Peabody Energy .
[ Note :
It was actually authored by the National Mining Assocation ; see updates below . ]
The document was discussed on a conference call held by the “ Rural America Solutions Group ” within the GOP caucus on Thursday , hosted by group co-chairs Frank Lucas ( R - Okla . ) , Sam Graves ( R - Mo. ) , and Doc Hastings ( R - Wash . ) .
According to a press release , the call was meant to “ highlight how the Democrats ’ National Energy
Tax will make it more expensive for rural Americans to fertilize the crops , put fuel in the tractor and food on the table . ”
The document ’s map ( see below ) shows most of the country losing out under the climate bill and facing higher energy costs , while just a handful of states on the West Coast and in the Northeast would benefit .
Texans , for example , would lose $ 1.16 billion in 2012 , while Californians would gain $ 385.6 million .
A line at the bottom of the document reads , “ Based on Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) and Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) data ” — but there ’s no indication of the particular studies used .
( The CBO numbers likely come from a report that the CBO itself says is not about Waxman - Markey and almost certainly overstates costs , since it only quantified costs , not benefits . )
Dig a little deeper by looking at the “ properties ” of the PowerPoint document and you learn that it was produced by Peabody Energy — with CEO Greg Boyce listed as the “ author ” and communications services manager Chris Taylor listed as the “ manager . ”
Yes , the world ’s biggest coal producer is literally writing Republican talking points .
Oops !
Here ’s the map :
UPDATE : Roll Call ran a story ( $ ub req ’d ) on June 18 on Democratic infighting over the ACES bill , noting that one Democrat has been touting a map that sounds a whole lot like this one :
Rep. Marcy Kaptur ( D - Ohio ) has been passing out maps contending that most states would lose out under the cap - and - trade bill crafted by Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) and Energy and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Ed Markey ( D - Mass . ) .
Multiple requests to her office for confirmation of whether it is the same map were ignored , but Roll Call reporter Steven T. Dennis says it is .
So it appears Republicans are n’t the only ones circulating Peabody ’s talking points .
UPDATE TO THE UPDATE : Kaptur ’s spokesperson , Steve Fought , says this is a “ case of mistaken maps . ”
The representative has been handing out two different maps dealing with jurisdictional boundaries of power - marketing authorities , but not this map , Fought says .
UPDATE 2 : Closer inspection of the PowerPoint document indicates that Boyce created it originally on September 29 , 1998 , and it was updated in July 2004 for a “ 2004 Investor & Analyst Forum . ”
But it was last edited by an Amelie Hereford on June 17 , 2009 , and an email address is listed for her at Arch Coal , another coal industry giant .
Hereford is a legislative assistant at Arch Coal , according to her Linked In profile .
Grist called Arch Coal ’s corporate offices to confirm , but a receptionist said she did not recognize the name .
We ’ve dropped her an email requesting comment .
Stay tuned .
UPDATE TO THE UPDATE : Hereford told Grist she had nothing to do with this map .
“ Neither Arch Coal , Inc. nor I was involved in the development of the map , ” she wrote in an email .
UPDATE 3 : Tamara Hinton , spokesperson for the Republicans on the Agriculture Committee , says that the PowerPoint document they are circulating came from the National Mining Association .
The association is currently touting the document on the front page of its website , so it ’s no big secret who ’s distributing these data points .
Hinton does n’t see a problem with circulating the industry ’s data .
“ If the coal industry wants to provide information to show how it will impact people , we ’re just letting people know that that information exists , ” said Hinton .
“ There is no conflict of interest . ”
More interesting , however , may be the fine print at the bottom of the National Mining Association ’s version of the PowerPoint document , which includes an extra page of data .
At the bottom of that page is a note that says the document does not accurately reflect the Waxman - Markey legislation as it currently stands .
The footnote :
These rough calculations DO NOT represent a precise indicator of the actual allocation of allowances to electricity distribution companies under sections 782 and 783 of the ACES legislation ( 5-29-2009 version ) .
First , power can and does move across state lines , so the share electricity - related of carbon dioxide emissions associated with power generation within a state may differ from the share of carbon dioxide emissions associated with power sales within that state — it is the latter that is used in the ACES formula as we understand it , but the former that is calculated here .
Second , the distribution under ACES is done on a utility - by - utility basis rather than a state - by - state basis , and there can be significant differences across utilities within a given state .
Third , these calculations are made based on data for 2006 through 2008 ( 2008 data is unpublished preliminary data ) , while the ACES legislation allows the affected electricity sellers the option of choosing a different period within a specified range of dates .
Finally , the calculations do not cover many of the detailed legislative provisions dealing with allocation .
UPDATE 4 : Luke Popovich , vice president of external communications for the National Mining Association , confirms that the PowerPoint presentation was put together by his organization .
He explained that the document appears to come from Peabody because NMA used a template the company created in 2004 .
But the map and the data it ’s based on were produced entirely by NMA staff , he said .
Peabody Energy and Arch Coal are both members of NMA , so in a sense they are indirectly involved .
“ Did Peabody , the big coal company , have a role in it ?
Yeah .
So did every other coal company that paid us dues , ” said Popovich .
“ But it ’s NMA ’s math .
What it displays are NMA ’s calculations .
Peabody had nothing to do with those . ”
Popovich could n’t explain why Arch Coal ’s name would appear in the document ’s history .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The worst seems to be over , President Obama 's budget director said Sunday .
But he also warned against taking signs of economic recovery as a reason to celebrate or delay changes in health care policy .
Peter Orszag said the nation 's economy appears to have bottomed out , even as the White House prepared to revise its budget projections to reflect higher - than - expected unemployment .
He said an improving economy and changes to how the United States provides health care would help narrow federal deficits .
" I think what happened is the free - fall in the economy seems to have stopped and we 're — I guess the analogy ( is ) there are some glimmers of sun shining through the trees , but we 're not out of the woods yet , " said Orszag , the director of the Office of Management and Budget .
" We do have more work ahead . "
Work , Orszag said on CNN's " State of the Union , " that would include passing this year Obama 's health care plans despite the economic crisis .
" Let 's be very clear .
We 've always said health care reform has to be deficit neutral over a five - or 10 - year window and much better than that over the long term , " said Orszag , whose knowledge of health policy has strengthened his Cabinet - level position .
" So we are committed to making sure health care reform is self - financing and also brings down costs over time , both for families and for the federal government . "
The administration , however , faces serious challenges .
Some 1.3 million jobs have been lost since February and the auto and financial industries are in precarious positions .
Obama 's Democratic allies have been reluctant to endorse the White House 's health proposals while Republicans have vowed to stop them ; Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele told NBC 's " Meet the Press " that he does n't think health care will pass this year .
Meanwhile , Orszag said the administration would update its budget numbers in the coming months .
" You have to remember the deficit is very sensitive to the state of the economy , " said Orszag , noting that officials always planned to revise those figures .
" As the economy starts to recover the deficit comes down quickly . "

Blind man sees wife for first time after having a TOOTH implanted into his eye
Seeing clearly : Martin Jones opens his newly - sighted eye fitted with a tooth
When Martin Jones met his wife four years ago , he never imagined that one day he would get to see what she looked like .
The 42 - year - old builder was left blind after an accident at work more than a decade ago .
But a remarkable operation - which implants part of his tooth in his eye - has now pierced his world of darkness .
The procedure , performed fewer than 50 times before in Britain , uses the segment of tooth as a holder for a new lens grafted from his skin .
' The doctors took the bandages off and it was like looking through water and then I saw this figure and it was her , ' he said today .
' She 's wonderful and lovely .
It was unbelievable to see her for the first time . '
He added : ' When I found out there was a chance I would get my sight back , the first person I wanted to see was her . '
Mr Jones , from Rotherham , South Yorkshire , married his wife Gill , 50 , four years ago .
By that time he had already spent eight years without his sight after a tub of white hot aluminium exploded in his face at work in a scrapyard .
He suffered 37 per cent burns and had to wear a special body stocking for 23 hours a day .
He also had his left eye removed .
But surgeons were able to save the right eye , even though he was unable to see through it .
At first specialists in Nottingham tried to save his sight using stem cells from a donor but the attempt failed .
It was only when a revolutionary new operation was pioneered at the Sussex Eye Clinic in Brighton that he was given a chance to have his sight back .
Surgeon Christopher
Liu used a living tooth to carry a new lens because Mr Jones ' eye could reject a plastic implant
During the procedure , a minute section of a patient 's tooth is removed , reshaped and chiselled through to grip the man -made lens which is then placed in its core .
It is implanted under an eyelid where it becomes covered in tissue .
The process requires a living tooth as an implant because doctors suggest there are chances the eye would reject a plastic equivalent .
So a canine - which is the best option due to its shape and size - was taken out of Mr Jones ' mouth .
A patch of skin is then taken from the inside of the cheek and placed in the eye for two months , where it gradually acquires its own blood supply .
The tooth segment is finally transplanted into the eye socket .
The flap of grafted skin is then partially lifted from the eye and placed over its new sturdy base .
Finally , surgeons cut a hole in the grafted cornea to let light through .
' I feel fantastic getting my sight back , ' he said .
' I can't really describe it - it 's beyond words .
I was blind for 12 years and when my sight came back everything had changed .
' The first car I saw when my sight was restored was a Smart car and I could n't stop laughing - I 'd never seen one before and I thought it had been chopped in half .
' Getting my sight back has changed my life .
It is such a precious gift and you do n't really appreciate it until it is taken away .
' The doctors took the bandages off and it was like looking through water and then I saw this figure and it was her .
She 's wonderful and lovely .
It was unbelievable to see her for the first time . '
' I have been so fortunate that my sight has been returned .
I find it such a simple pleasure being able to see what is going on in the world . '
The eight - hour operation , pioneered by surgeon Christopher Liu , is designed to help patients who have corneal blindness but who are not suitable for traditional corneal transplants .
' When I first heard about the technique I could n't believe it .
I do n't think many people can , ' said Mr Jones .
' My friends just do n't believe me .
They think I 'm pulling their leg or have just made it up .
' But when I take my glasses off they say ' oh my God ' because my eye looks like something out of a sci- fi movie .
They 're just amazed at it . '
Mr Liu is a corneal specialist and Consultant Ophthalmic Surgeon based at Sussex Eye Hospital , Brighton ..
He is also President of the British Society for Refractive Surgery .

I wish I knew for certain that today ’s tip actually does help you get better gas mileage , but even if it does n’t , you ’ll have the nicest looking car in the neighborhood .
Regularly wash and wax your vehicle .
If this idea actually works , I wish I could take credit for it ( if it turns out to be a scam , you did n’t get the idea from me ) .
While searching other gas saving sites , I came across a tip that claims if you wash and wax your car , you can improve your gas mileage by up to 7 % , which based on today ’s prices would be about $.27 per gallon .
Not too shabby .
The basic idea behind it is , after washing and waxing your car , the surface of the vehicle is much more likely to be nice and smooth , therefore , it should be more aerodynamic than when you have lots of bug guts smeared all over .
It looks like a sound theory , but I do n’t know if simply cleaning your car will increase your fuel economy that drastically .
However , it ’s worth a shot because at the very least , your car ’s going to look nice .
Especially if you ’re NOT kicking sweet rims .
ISTANBUL ( Reuters ) -
What happens when you put a Muslim imam , a Christian priest , a rabbi and a Buddhist monk in a room with 10 atheists ?
Turkish television station Kanal T hopes the answer is a ratings success as it prepares to launch a gameshow where spiritual guides from the four faiths will seek to convert a group of non-believers .
The prize for converts will be a pilgrimage to a holy site of their chosen religion -- Mecca for Muslims , the Vatican for Christians , Jerusalem for Jews and Tibet for Buddhists .
But religious authorities in Muslim but secular Turkey are not amused by the twist on the popular reality game show format and the Religious Affairs Directorate is refusing to provide an imam for the show .
“ Doing something like this for the sake of ratings is disrespectful to all religions .
Religion should not be a subject for entertainment programs , ” High Board of Religious Affairs Chairman Hamza Aktan told state news agency Anatolian after news of the planned program emerged .
The makers of “ Penitents Compete ” are unrepentant and reject claims that the show , scheduled to begin broadcasting in September , will cheapen religion .
“ We are giving the biggest prize in the world , the gift of belief in God , ” Kanal T chief executive Seyhan Soylu told Reuters .
“ We do n’t approve of anyone being an atheist .
God is great and it does n’t matter which religion you believe in .
The important thing is to believe , ” Soylu said .
The project focuses attention on the issue of religious identity in European Union - candidate Turkey , where rights groups have raised concerns over freedom of religion for non-Muslim minorities .
Detractors of the ruling AK Party government , which is rooted in political Islam but officially secular , accuse it of having a hidden Islamist agenda , a charge it denies .
Some 200 people have so far applied to take part in the show and the 10 contestants will be chosen next month .
A team of theologians will ensure that the atheists are truly non-believers and are not just seeking fame or a free holiday .

Schwarzenegger orders 2,000 more state jobs cut California 's fiscal crisis
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger presented his latest revised versions of the California State Budget Thursday May 14 , 2009 during a press conference at the State Capital in Sacramento .

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has ordered department heads to eliminate 2,000 jobs on top of the 5,000 positions he wants to cut as part of his budget solution , his officials said Tuesday .
Although Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders remain far apart in how to close the state 's $ 26.3 billion shortfall , the governor 's latest job - slashing order is aimed at helping prepare for inevitable cuts in state services , said Lynelle Jolley , a spokeswoman for the state Department of Personnel Administration .
Schwarzenegger ordered the initial 5,000 job cuts in May as part of his budget proposal to close the state 's huge deficit in its general fund .
There are about 230,000 state employees .
Jolley said 4,600 layoff notices have been sent .
The other 400 positions were vacant and will be eliminated .
Laid - off workers will be able to apply for other state jobs funded by special fees .
For example , vehicle registration fees fund DMV services .
By Monday , the chiefs of every department must report on their number of vacant positions .
Those jobs will also be eliminated before any layoff notices are sent .
Jolley said she did not know how much money the cuts would save .
Starting this month , state workers are being forced to take three unpaid days off a month , or about a 14 percent pay cut .
They had been taking two furlough days a month since February .
The governor has proposed an additional 5 percent pay cut , which would require legislative approval .
A representative for the largest state worker union criticized the governor 's proposed job cuts .
The threat is a " bargaining ploy to get a budget agreement that he likes , " said Jim Zamora , a spokesman for the 90,000 - member Service Employees International Union Local 1000 .
Budget negotiations resumed Tuesday afternoon between Schwarzenegger and the state 's top four lawmakers after taking a day off to give budget experts time to crunch more numbers .
The biggest item on Tuesday 's agenda was how to fund K - 12 schools and community colleges .
The leaders met until just before midnight Tuesday and planned to resume their talks Wednesday afternoon .
Saudi Arabia saw a number of high - profile attacks between 2003 and 2006 Amnesty International has strongly criticised Saudi Arabia over abuses allegedly committed as part of its counter - terrorism operations .
In a report , the human rights group says since 2001 thousands of Saudi suspects have been detained for years without charge or trial .
The 69 - page report describes Saudi Arabia 's human rights record as " shocking " and " dire " .
It says the international community has been far too quiet about the abuse .
In the report , entitled " Saudi Arabia : assaulting human rights in the name of counter - terrorism " , the UK - based organisation accuses the oil - rich conservative kingdom of massive and widespread abuse .
It says that two years ago , the Saudi interior minister said the country had detained 9,000 security suspects since 2001 , and 3,106 were still being held .
AMNESTY REPORT ALLEGATIONS
Thousands of people detained arbitrarily
Some of those held are prisoners of conscience Abuses include beatings , suspension from ceiling , electric shocks But , says Amnesty International , no information - not even their names and the charges - were forthcoming and unofficial sources put the numbers far higher .
Over the last two years , it says , " new waves of arrests " have been reported .
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the Saudi authorities have been widely credited with defeating al - Qaeda in their country .
And , he says , Amnesty International concedes that most of the thousands detained without trial are suspected of links to groups which have committed attacks , on westerners and other targets .
But it says their cases are shrouded in secrecy and , quoting numerous examples , it doubts that even basic human rights standards are being met .

The director of Amnesty 's UK office , Kate Allen , said that , except for the re-education programme for ex-jihadists , and the carefully co-ordinated mass trials , Saudi Arabia 's habitual cloak of secrecy was wrapped even more tightly than ever in " security " cases .
" It is true " , she said , " that Saudi Arabia faces a challenge in dealing with terrorism , but its response has been shocking - something the international community has been far too muted about .
" We are calling for a fundamental change of policy by the Saudi authorities . "
Serious violations
This is not the first time Saudi Arabia has been criticised for alleged human rights abuses .
In February , the US - based organisation Human Rights Watch listed what it called " ongoing serious violations of rights " in the kingdom .
They included restrictions on speech , association , assembly and religion ; an arbitrary criminal justice system , discrimination against women ; and serious abuses against migrant workers in the country .
And in 2008 , it published a 144 - page report criticising Saudi Arabia 's criminal justice system .
It said that it had " found systematic and multiple violations of defendants ' rights " .

L’AQUILA , Italy ( Reuters ) - Africa takes center stage at the Group of Eight summit on Friday , with wealthy nations eager to reassure critics they will honor past aid pledges and approve a new $ 15 billion agriculture program .
After two days of talks focused on the economic crisis , trade and global warming , the final day of the G8 gathering in Italy will concentrate on the problems facing the world ’s poorest nations .
Development of Africa has become an important item on G8 agendas following promises by world leaders at Gleneagles in 2005 to increase annual aid levels by $ 50 billion by 2010 , half of which was meant to go to African countries .
However , aid organizations say some capitals have gone back on their word , especially this year ’s G8 host Italy , and African heads of state said they would voice their concerns .
“ The key message for us is to ask the G8 to live up to their commitments , ” Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi told Reuters this week before flying to Italy for the half - day meeting .
The l’Aquila summit has produced chequered results , making only limited progress in crucial climate talks following the refusal by major developing nations to sign up to the goal of halving world greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
“ There is a bit of frustration because one would like to convince everyone about everything and obtain all the results straight way , but things are progressing , ” French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters on Thursday night .
FARM AID , CODE OF ETHICS
Besides Meles , the leaders of Algeria , Angola , Egypt , Libya , Nigeria , Senegal and South Africa will discuss food security and farming with their G8 counterparts on Friday , and push their demand for compensation for the ravages of climate change .
Slideshow ( 26 images )
Rich nations are expected to use the meeting to announce spending of $ 15 billion over three years to boost agricultural investment in poorer countries , according to a draft statement seen by Reuters on Thursday .
The text did not make clear whether it was all new funds , nor did it give details of individual countries ’ contributions , although the United States , Japan and the European Union are expected to step in with around $ 3 billion each .
Slideshow ( 26 images )
The focus on agricultural investments reflects a U.S. - led shift away from emergency aid assistance toward longer - term strategies to try to make communities more self - sufficient .
But the $ 15 billion fund over three years compares unfavorably with $ 13.4 billion which the G8 says it disbursed between January 2008 and July 2009 for global food security .
British charity ActionAid warned in a report last week that one billion people went hungry in the world , saying decisions at the G8 gathering could “ literally make the difference between life and death for millions in the developing world . ”
Japan and the European Union will also champion a code of conduct to promote responsible international investments in agriculture in the face of growing farmland acquisition or “ land grabs ” in emerging nations .
The summit wraps up at lunch time and will be followed by a flurry of bilateral meetings that stretch long into the day .
U.S. President Barack Obama will return to Rome for a meeting with Pope Benedict , who earlier this week called for a re-think of the way the world economy was run .

The members of the independent fact finding mission , set up by the UN Human Rights Council , are holding public hearings in Gaza and Geneva starting today .
It is part of the UN investigations into human rights violation committed during the conflict in the Gaza strip .
It will allow those affected to tell their stories to the world .
The four members team , headed by Justice Richard Goldstone will listen to victims ’ testimonies , witnesses & experts from all sides of the conflict .
The first part is taking place today and tomorrow in Gaza City , at the headquarter of the UN relief program .
Public hearings will also be held later , in Geneva , on July 6 & July 7 .
It is part of the conflict investigations , the war in Gaza from December 2008 to January 2009 killed 1,400 people and left 5,000 others injured .
“ The purpose of the public hearings in Gaza & Geneva is to show the faces & broadcast the voices of the victims - All of the victims . ”
Said Goldstone .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon & UN Human Rights Chief Navi Pillay have called on Israel to “ cooperate with the investigation . ”
Happy birthday , Nikola Tesla - although you are n't alive today , having died in poverty on 7 January 1943 ( having been born on 10 July 1856 ) .
Perhaps you 're spinning in your grave - which might be possible if some of the inventions inspired by your work on electromagnetism and forces are being used .
Many children are familiar with the Tesla coil - used at science demonstrations and lectures to demonstrate what happens when you discharge a high voltage ( but low current : it 's current that kills , not voltage ) over a small space .
Films of Frankenstein often show , somewhat anachronistically , Tesla coils discharging lightning - like bolts like billy -o .
Tesla , an ethnic Serb from Smiljan , then part of the Austro - Hungarian empire , started out his engineering life working for a telephone company in Budapest in 1881 , aged 24 .
He 'd already studied physics and maths ;
While there - while walking in a park , in fact - he had an inspiration and solved the equations relating to a revolving magnetic field .
Which he then drew in the ground with a stick and explained to a friend .
Quite a patient friend , one suspects .
Not much to you , perhaps , but those equations govern the induction motor , which is now the most common form of electric motor : put three coils around an outside former , and put a rotating element inside .
If you run a current through the outside coils , and get the timing just right , then you create a current ( and hence magnetic force ) in the coils in the inside .
So the inside rotor turns , but it does n't have to touch the outer part : less friction means less energy used .
( Compare that method to the carbon brushes needed in standard DC motors , which wear away where they touch the inner rotor . )
But it's in the development of mains electricity - the underpinning of our modern age - that Tesla really rules .
When Americans tell the story of Thomas Edison , the famous inventor of the gramophone , and whose name is usually attached to the invention of the light bulb , Tesla 's name is frequently left out .
However Tesla , who became an American citizen in 1891 , worked with Edison for years , improving many of the early inventions and turning them into something workable .
( The two were introduced in 1884 , when Tesla came to the US , by a letter from a mutual friend to Edison which read " I know of two great men .
One is you and the other is this young man . " )
Yet it 's thanks to Tesla , not Edison , that we have electricity coming out of plugs , and that we even have power stations able to generate serious amounts of energy .
He won " the war of the currents " with Edison , who was convinced that direct current ( DC ) - the sort that comes out of an ordinary battery - was the way forward for power generation and distribution .
Tesla was able to show that alternating current ( AC ) - which swaps its polarity at a regular rate , 50 times a second in UK mains electricity - was far more efficient ( you do n't lose anything like as much energy in transmitting it over long distances ) .
Even though Edison took to electrocuting dogs in public displays to show just how dangerous AC was ( no , really ) , Tesla won the day .
Where DC could only be transmitted for a couple of miles before the resistance of the lines reduced it to nothing , AC can be transmitted at high voltages for many times that distance .
( A side note : did you know that the distribution equipment - transformers , transmission lines - is 80 % of the cost of running an electricity company ?
The power generation is only 20 % .
Which is why even if we had free electricity generation - say from nuclear fusion - the upkeep of the distribution network would still mean you 'd get a bill every quarter .
Quite probably it would still be for the house next door which is n't on the same provider , too . )
And to quote his biography ,
Among his discoveries are the fluorescent light , laser beam , wireless communications , wireless transmission of electrical energy , remote control , robotics , Tesla 's turbines and vertical take off aircraft .
Tesla is the father of the radio and the modern electrical transmissions systems .
He registered over 700 patents worldwide .
His vision included exploration of solar energy and the power of the sea .
He foresaw interplanetary communications and satellites .
Then again , he also had ideas for the " death ray " - what we might now recognise as a directed energy weapon - and an ion-propelled aircraft ( which was proven to be feasible ) .
However his life ended sadly : he spent the last ten years of his life in the two - room suite 3327 of the New Yorker Hotel , having sold his patents and racked up substantial debts .
After his death , the New York Supreme court ruled that he - rather than Marconi - invented the radio .
Even Google has noticed - given that New York State some time ago proclaimed today as Tesla 's birthday , and that the corner of 40th Street and 6th Avenue in Manhattan has a street sign saying " Nikola Tesla corner " .
If they were sensible , it would be a rotating sign , But you can't have everything .
Can't Scratch Its Own Ear
Yesterday , June 4th , 2009 , marked the 20th anniversary of the military crackdown on student protesters gathered in Tiananmen Square in Beijing , China .
Beginning in April of 1989 , thousands of students and other citizens started gathering in groups large and small , protesting many issues , centered on a desire for freedom and democratic reform .
By mid-May of 1989 , hundreds of thousands of protesters occupied the square , staging hunger strikes , and asking for dialogue .
Chinese authorities responded with a declaration of martial law , and sent soldiers and tanks from the People 's Liberation Army , preparing to disperse the crowds .
Late on June 3rd , 1989 , the tanks and armored personnel carriers rolled into the square , killing and wounding many , mostly civilians - estimates vary widely , from several hundred to several thousand dead .
The first 17 photos below were taken in 1989 , the rest are from this year , as people remember the events , the ideals , and the fallout from that fateful day .

Surprises and Busts : Trying to predict the unpredictable in fantasy football
Most fantasy owners draft a running back in the first round and oftentimes their season depends on how that player fares .
If he misses a few games with an injury and is bothered by it for a few more , his production will suffer and it will put his fantasy team in a tough spot .
This can be offset if his owner is savvy enough to draft one of the “ surprise ” backs that inevitably crash the top 10 every season .
But how does one pluck one of these backs out of the middle rounds ?
Better yet , how can we avoid drafting an early round bust in the first place ?
As a forewarning , this is not a tight article .
I ponder , deliberate and meander as I go along .
Trying to predict the future is nebulous at best and futile at worst , so please bear with me as I muddle my way through this topic .
Here ’s a list of the top RBs from 2008 …
RB1 – Matt Forte ( RB30 )
RB2 – DeAngelo Williams ( RB36 )
RB3 – Maurice Jones - Drew ( RB13 )
RB4 – Thomas Jones ( RB23 )
RB5 – Brian Westbrook ( RB3 )
RB6 – Michael Turner ( RB19 )
RB7 – Adrian Peterson ( RB2 )
RB8 – Steve Slaton ( RB67 )
RB9 – Chris Johnson ( RB40 )
RB10 – LaDainian Tomlinson ( RB1 )
RB11 – Clinton Portis ( RB8 )
RB12 – Marshawn Lynch ( RB9 )
Michael Turner went on average in the very late third round , so that makes six backs that were drafted outside the first two rounds that made the top 12 .
Maurice Jones - Drew was a fringe first round pick , so players that were drafted in the first round finished in the top 12 about 50 % of the time .
Marion Barber ( drafted RB7 , finished RB13 ) and Frank Gore ( drafted RB6 , finished RB14 ) just missed the top 12 .
There were three first round “ busts ” – Joseph Addai , Larry Johnson and Willis McGahee – who finished outside the top 35 .
All three missed significant time due to injury .
The final first round pick , Steven Jackson , finished as RB19 even though he missed four games due to injury .
What does this all mean ?
Good question …
Of the first 12 picks , eight finished in the top 20 , and seven finished in the top 15 .
While that success rate certainly would n’t qualify as a sure thing , it does n’t dispel the notion that fantasy owners should look to draft a running back in the first round .
It ’s not like drafting a WR was any more rewarding last year .
The top three receivers – Randy Moss , Terrell Owens and Reggie Wayne – finished 11th , 13th and 12th amongst wideouts , respectively .
The top QB , Tom Brady , missed the entire season with an injury and the second QB off the board , Peyton Manning , finished as 2008 ’s QB6 .
Looking at the four middle - to late - round picks that made the top 12 , we can draw some common themes .
Five of the six are / were young .
Thomas Jones had eight years in the league entering the 2008 season .
The next most experienced player was Michael Turner , who had four years in the league .
Four of the six were newcomers to their respective teams , with three rookies and Turner , who joined the Falcons after four seasons with the Chargers .
Three entered the season as members of a committee — Williams split time with Jonathan Stewart , Chris Johnson shared carries with LenDale White and Steve Slaton emerged as the last man standing in Houston .
Now let ’s take a look at 2007 …
RB1 – Brian Westbrook ( RB8 )
RB2 – LaDainian Tomlinson ( RB1 )
RB3 – Clinton Portis ( RB16 )
RB4 – Joseph Addai ( RB6 )
RB5 – Adrian Peterson ( RB26 )
RB6 – Jamal Lewis ( RB27 )
RB7 – Frank Gore ( RB4 )
RB8 – Marion Barber ( RB24 )
RB9 – Willis McGahee ( RB13 )
RB10 – Earnest Graham ( RB ?? , undrafted )
RB11 – Maurice Jones - Drew ( RB15 )
RB12 – Reggie Bush ( RB10 )
There were four major surprises in the top 12 in 2007 – Peterson , Lewis , Barber and Graham .
Peterson and Lewis were newcomers to their respective teams , while Barber and Graham each emerged from a RBBC as the main man .
( Graham was actually the last man standing . )
Portis was a semi- surprise , as he was coming off an injury - plagued 2006 and finished the season as RB3 .
The other seven top 12 players were n’t that surprising , as they were all picked in the top 15 .
Seven of the top 12 picks in 2007 could be considered disappointments .
Steven Jackson ( drafted RB2 , finished RB15 ) , Willie Parker ( drafted RB7 , finished RB20 ) and Ronnie Brown ( drafted RB12 , finished RB23 ) were minor disappointments , while Larry Johnson , Shaun Alexander , Rudi Johnson and Laurence Maroney all finished outside of the top 30 .
All four players missed significant time due to injury .
LJ , Alexander and Johnson all had at least 622 carries during the previous two seasons .
WHAT TO MAKE OF ALL OF THIS
It ’s difficult to predict who is going to bust because usually underperformance stems from some sort of injury .
Some fantasy football analysts argue that a heavy workload in previous seasons will eventually cause a breakdown , but a large number of carries also indicates dependability and consistency , which is why these players are being drafted this early in the first place .
LaDainian Tomlinson is 30 and has averaged 332 carries over his eight years in the league .
Even though he showed some signs of breaking down in 2008 ( with a very pedestrian 3.8 ypc ) , he still gained 1536 yards from scrimmage and scored 12 TD , finishing the season as RB10 .
Would you pass on him late in the first round ?
Steven Jackson is only 26 , but he has missed eight games over the past two seasons after a stellar 2006 campaign .
He should bounce back , but he ’s also shown signs that he ’s injury - prone .
Brian Westbrook , Frank Gore , Reggie Bush , Clinton Portis , Brandon Jacobs and Marion Barber are all first - or second - round guys that are injury concerns for one reason or another .
Unfortunately , it ’s impossible to accurately predict which players are going to break down much less when .
So the best we can do is identify some possible surprises and hope they pan out , giving ourselves a safety net if one or more of our early picks have a disappointing season .
We identified that youth , newcomer status , and starting the season in a RBBC were the top three factors of finding value in the middle to late rounds .
Right now , three names jump out at me : Derrick Ward ( ADP : 5.03 ) , Knowshon Moreno ( 4.10 ) and Chris Wells ( 6.01 ) .
Ward was excellent when given the opportunity to start in place of an injured Brandon Jacobs in New York .
He had 15 + carries eight times over the past two seasons , averaging 104 rushing yards in those games .
He ’s also a very adept pass catcher , averaging 2.8 catches per game over the last two years .
Most importantly , he ’s proven to be an efficient runner , averaging 4.8 ypc and 5.6 ypc in 2007 and 2008 .
He joins a semi-crowded backfield in Tampa that also includes Earnest Graham and Carnell Williams .
But the Bucs gave Ward starter ’s money , so he should have first crack at the job .
His chances are further boosted by Williams ’ knee injury and Graham ’s ability to play fullback .
At first glance , Moreno looks to face something of an uphill battle to get carries in Denver .
But these are n’t ( or should n’t be ) your father ’s Broncos .
Mike Shanahan is gone , and hopefully new coach Josh McDaniels did n’t inherit Skeletor ’s joy of messing with his RB depth chart .
Peyton Hillis , Correll Buckhalter , LaMont Jordan and Ryan Torain are also there , but Moreno is the most talented runner of the group .
Here ’s an excerpt from Moreno ’s scouting report at FFToolbox …
Moreno is naturally blessed with a nice blend of size and speed , but it is his athleticism , vision , and ability to hit the hole that sets him apart as arguably the best running back in this year ’s draft class .
Moreover , the Broncos were 2nd in the league in yards per carry with 4.8 .
This was with Michael Pittman , Peyton Hillis and Selvin Young rushing the football .
I expect Moreno will get starter ’s carries and finish in the top 15 , maybe even the top 10 .
Lastly , Chris “ Beanie ” Wells joins Tim Hightower in the Arizona backfield .
What ’s worrisome about Wells is that the Cardinals have struggled with their ground game over the past several seasons .
Last year , they averaged just 3.5 ypc , which was next to last in the league .
On the plus side , teams do n’t usually burn a first round pick on a running back unless they plan to use him .
Clearly , the Cardinals did not feel strongly enough about Hightower to use their first pick to shore up another weakness , and they must have seen something in Wells that they really liked .
This kind of favoritism usually leads to opportunity , and that ’s half the battle .
As the training camps wear on , we may be able to identify some of the other “ surprise ” prospects .
Inevitably , a veteran will go down with an injury , or a rookie will make a splash .
This might help us recognize who the next Earnest Graham or Chris Johnson will be .
Stay tuned .
They all sound somewhat dramatic , the mishaps suffered in the course of the seven long voyages around the world embarked upon by Michael Palin , Monty Python comic turned TV traveller , but one sounds puzzling in the extreme .
Camel poisoning ?
Palin 's ready grin appears .
" I did n't go round poisoning camels , " he says .
" We were in a Polisario refugee camp in Algeria for four or five days , living with the local people " – the refugees were from the Western Sahara struggle for independence from Morocco – " and their version of killing the fatted calf for the foreigner is to buy a camel for the camel meat .
So we had camel meat all week long .
" It was very generous of them and cost them quite a lot to keep us , but they felt we should have the best .
But by the end of the week I think the camel meat was starting to deteriorate , and as we were leaving on the last day , at breakfast I was offered a bit of camel liver from the night before , and the wife of the guy we were staying with was so friendly and pleasant that I could n't turn it down , even though it did smell slightly odd .
So I took a bite .
And then we went off to film this extraordinary Moroccan wall which has been built down in the southern part of Morocco to keep the Polisario [ the guerrillas ] out , and it was on the way there that it all came back to me , as they say .

" I was very ill for about 24 hours .
We had to stop this entire column going up the Moroccan wall for me to just get out and throw up , and there was no way of me hiding it or doing it discreetly as it was an open desert .
It was just wonderful , an enormous , Barry Humphries - Barry McKenzie - style , Technicolor Yawn . "
Camel poisoning is just one of the bumps along the road encountered by the man who found fame on Monty Python 's Flying Circus in the 1970s before turning to BBC travel documentaries .
He made seven of them , multi-part series starting with Around The World In 80 Days in 1989 , and ending with New Europe in 2007 .
He travelled well over 100,000 miles , visited 90 countries , and had many more local difficulties along the way : Delhi belly , Saigon stomach , cheetah attack , near - drowning , cracked ribs , escaping Maoist rebels and Annapurna total system collapse .
As a long - distance traveller , Palin has paid his dues , which is a fortunate position to be in for the prestigious role he has just taken up , as president of the Royal Geographical Society ( RGS ) .
Python man is now the nation 's First Geographer .
And he has a delicate task ahead of him .
He has come to the venerable RGS , which has been spiritual home to the world 's most famous explorers from Livingstone in Africa to Scott of the Antarctic , just after its most difficult time since its foundation in 1830 .
Six weeks ago the society 's whole direction was challenged by a substantial group of disaffected RGS fellows , who felt the society 's decision to abandon large - scale field expeditions to remote parts of the globe in favour of supporting smaller geographical research projects carried out by various institutions , was a betrayal of its original spirit and purpose .
Feelings ran high .
Those trying to get the RGS to go back to its roots included some of the best - known travellers of our time ; they included Ranulph Fiennes , who has led numerous expeditions including a famous circling of the world via the two poles ; Colonel John Blashford - Snell , often photographed in an old - fashioned pith helmet , who led a famous expedition down the Blue Nile in 1968 ; and Robin Hanbury - Tenison , whose expeditions to Brazil and to Sarawak helped to spark international concern for rainforests and for their tribal peoples .
On 18 May , matters came to a head at Lowther Lodge , the society 's headquarters in Kensington , where the matter was put to a vote of fellows ; about 4,200 of the 10,000 who were eligible cast their vote , and by a margin of 61.3 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the bid to restore big expeditions was defeated .
The explorers lost out , you might say , to the lecturers .

Two weeks later , Palin took over as president , replacing the government scientist Sir Gordon Conway , and since then he has kept his counsel and refrained from commenting on what has been a bitter dispute .
But talking exclusively to The Independent this week , in his first interview in his new role , he made it clear that he wanted to heal the divisions which had come to seem so acrimonious .
" I feel in a sense the argument has been dealt with , but I 'm a conciliator by nature and I do n't want any of the people involved to feel that the Royal Geographical Society is unwelcoming , or a place that no longer respects their views .
I know a number of people who supported the resolution [ to change the RGS 's direction ] , people like John Hemming [ a former RGS director ] and Joanna Lumley – people I respect and admire .
And one has to understand their view and take it on board . "
But does he think – an accusation that was made – that the " explorer " faction is living in the past ?
" There 's nothing wrong with living in the past , " he says .
" The past is such an important part of the RGS .
You go to Lowther Lodge and you can't forget that this has been a society since 1830 with all the great names and great expeditions – you see Shackleton up there , and Livingstone , and it 's very important to recognise the spirit of their journeys , and never forget that they went out often risking their lives to tell us about the world .
" I think it 's really important to respect that past , but I 'm not sure , I 'm not convinced that major interdisciplinary expeditions are necessarily the best use of our resources at the moment . "
It is fascinating to hear such calm articulation from the lips of a man who for a whole generation , the babyboomers , personified the zany .
Palin was for many the most memorably , crazily funny of all the Python team , as the manic - singing lumberjack , the man in the cheese shop with no cheese ( Arthur Wensleydale ) , the cardinal leading the Spanish Inquisition who keeps bursting in on people , unexpected ( " Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition ! " ) and of course , the shifty pet shop proprietor who sold John Cleese a dead parrot .
( A hitherto unknown species – the " Norwegian blue " . )
After Monty P , he moved on to write scripts and perform successfully in a variety of shows and movies , but it was not until 1988 , when the BBC offered him the chance to recreate the global circumnavigation of Jules Verne 's Phileas Fogg , that he discovered his second vocation .
The Palin version of Around The World In Eighty Days was a hit .
He and his production team found casual encounters worked best : being shaved with a cut - throat razor on the street in Bombay by a barber who was " blind as a bat " was far more gripping TV than some of the big set - piece interviews .
" You would never set that up , " he remarks .
By its final episode , when he arrived back at the Reform Club in London where the journey had begun , the series was attracting 12 million viewers , and as a TV traveller , Palin was made ; he took over , you might say , where Alan Whicker left off , and spent most of the succeeding 20 years trekking with a film crew in tow around every continent , from the Sahara to the Himalayas , Africa to South America , the North Pole to the South Pole .
In some people this might eventually induce a cynical world - weariness : in Palin , very much one of life 's optimists , it has done the opposite and sparked an enthusiastic devotion to the idea of geography , which of course has always been a Cinderella of a subject academically , as he himself acknowledges .
" For some reason , geography is not seen as a popular subject in school .
It 's seen as very unglamorous .
Yet when I was at school , I can remember geography offering me the chance to get out and go on field trips and go on walks , and I loved maps , I loved atlases , I loved learning about other countries and places where things were different from our own – and that 's all covered by geography . "
He has long had close links with the RGS and has been a vice - president .
Yet the offer of the presidency – a three - year term – while delighting him and something he saw as a great honour , also took him by surprise .
" I was surprised because I did n't feel I had the expert knowledge that a lot of my predecessors had , who were specialists in certain fields , like Gordon Conway , a great agronomist and an adviser to the Government .
But clearly what they wanted from me , the people who approached me , was someone to communicate an enthusiasm for geography , and the idea of popularising geography has always been something I feel quite strongly about , and it seemed to me something I could do , so I said Yes . "
Geography , says Palin , " teaches us so much about how we live , from what we eat , to our transport systems , to population problems , diseases , global warming , all these sort of things , " yet he feels that in Britain there is simply too little interest in the outside world .
" Somehow we 've got to make sure that geography itself is n't a turnoff .
' Cos you know , it should n't be .
We maybe have to rename it . "
What might you rename it ?
" Oh ... Adventure ! "
He says with a laugh .
" I think it is an adventure .
It 's learning about how the world works .
Everything you do , even if it 's research in a laboratory , is adding to that knowledge , and that 's all part of the adventure .
I do n't think adventure should necessarily mean going out there with the shorts on , across the desert .
It can mean a lot more than that . "
He may now be the nation 's geographical figurehead , presiding over one of our most august institutions , but clearly , I said , the Python image will be enduring , wo n't it ?
You can't really shake it off , can you ?
" No and I do n't want to , " Michael Palin said .
" I actually also want geography to be entertaining , and I suppose most of my life has been spent as an entertainer of one sort or another , and I hope I can infect people with enthusiasm for geography , people who perhaps might never think of geography as being something to do with , you know , comedy , entertainment or whatever . "
Norwegian blues ?
I ventured .
" Yes ! Norwegian blues ! "
The Royal Geographical Society
* The Royal Geographical Society was founded in 1830 and throughout the 19th and 20th centuries it sponsored many celebrated expeditions to remote corners of the Earth .
The largest and most active scholarly geographical society in the world , its official purpose is " the advancement of geographical science " .
In 1995 , it merged with the Institute of British Geographers , which represented university geography lecturers , and since then , the society 's emphasis has shifted away from large - scale exploration towards academic research .
TOBIA , Colombia —
Many families in Colombia start their day not with coffee , Colombia 's signature crop , but with agua de panela .
The key ingredient in the hot beverage is panela , a sweetener made by cooking the juice from sugar cane into a brown , sticky goo which is then molded into blocks .
Unrefined and cheaper than sugar , panela tastes like a cross between molasses and brown sugar .
Though Colombia stands as the world ’s No. 2 producer of panela after India , the industry remains rustic .
Peasant farmers with just a few acres of sugar cane can build small mills and turn out tons of panela .
About 300,000 Colombian families earn a living producing panela , making it the second leading source of jobs in the countryside after coffee .

Beauties in the Outer Space
Messier 104 Messier 104 , known as the Sombrero Galaxy , is one of the most popular sights in the universe .
This floating ring is the size of a galaxy .
In fact , it is part of the photogenic Sombrero Galaxy , one of the largest galaxies in the nearby Virgo Cluster of Galaxies .
The dark band of dust that obscures the mid-section of the Sombrero Galaxy in optical light actually glows brightly in infrared light .
The Sombrero Galaxy , also known as M104 , spans about 50,000 light years across and lies 28 million light years away .
Hoag ’s Object Despite the vagueness of its name , “ Hoag ’s Object ” galaxy is known to have some rare and inexplicable traits , not the least of which is the “ halo ” of stars surrounding its core .
NASA - Bursting with Stars
The most active star - forming galaxy in the distant universe , nicknamed the “ Baby Boom ” galaxy , loosely resembles the galaxy shown here , called Zw II 96 .
While Zw II 96 is located about 500 million light - years away , Baby Boom lies 12.3 billion light - years away and appears in images as only a smudge .
Ring Nebula
The NASA Hubble Space Telescope captured the sharpest view yet of the most famous of all planetary nebulae : the Ring Nebula ( M57 ) .
This photo reveals elongated dark clumps of material embedded in the gas at the edge of the nebula ; the dying central star floating in a blue haze of hot gas .
The nebula is about a light - year in diameter and is located some 2,000 light - years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Lyra .
Pillars of Creation
These eerie , dark pillar - like structures are actually columns of cool interstellar hydrogen gas and dust that are also incubators for new stars .
The pillars protrude from the interior wall of a dark molecular cloud like stalagmites from the floor of a cavern .
They are part of the “ Eagle Nebula ” ( also called M16 — the 16th object in Charles Messier ’s 18th century catalog of “ fuzzy ” objects that are n’t comets ) , a nearby star - forming region 6,500 light - years away in the constellation Serpens .
2008 November 1 - A Spectre in the Eastern Veil The Veil Nebula is a large supernova remnant , the expanding debris cloud from the death explosion of a massive star .
While the Veil is roughly circular in shape covering nearly 3 degrees on the sky in the constellation Cygnus , this portion of the eastern Veil spans only 1 ⁄ 2 degree , about the apparent size of the Moon .
NGC 2818
It may look like a seahorse , but the dark object is actually a pillar of smoky dust about 20 light - years long .
The structure occurs in our neighbouring Large Magellanic Cloud , in a star - forming region near the Tarantula Nebula .
Swan Nebula
This photo shows a bubbly ocean of glowing hydrogen , oxygen , and sulphur gas in the extremely massive and luminous molecular nebula Messier 17 .
This Hubble photograph captures a small region within Messier 17 ( M17 ) , a hotbed of star formation .
M17 , also known as the Omega or Swan Nebula , is located about 5500 light - years away in the Sagittarius constellation .
NGC 2207
These glowering eyes are the swirling cores of two merging galaxies called NGC 2207 and IC 2163 in Canis Major .
Billions of years from now , only one of these two galaxies will remain .
Until then , they will slowly pull each other apart .
Planetary Nebula Mz3 Planetary Nebula Mz3 : The Ant Nebula .
Expelled gas streaming away at 1,000 kilometres per second create a strange ant shape .
Orion Nebula , M42 The Orion Nebula , M42 , is only 1,500 light - years away .

2008 February 17 - M1 : The Crab Nebula from Hubble
This is the mess that is left when a star explodes .
The Crab Nebula , the result of a supernova seen in 1054 AD , is filled with mysterious filaments .
The filaments are not only tremendously complex , but appear to have less mass than expelled in the original supernova and a higher speed than expected from a free explosion .

A drug slows the march of time in middle - aged mice .
Could a pill one day slow ageing in humans ?
Punchstock
Rapamycin , a drug commonly used in humans to prevent transplanted organs from being rejected , has been found to extend the lives of mice by up to 14 % — even when given to the mice late in life .
In flies and worms , drug treatments have been shown to prolong lifespan , but until now , the only robust way to extend life in mammals has been to heavily restrict diet .
The researchers caution , however , that using this drug to extend the lifespan of humans might be problematic because it suppresses the immune system — potentially making people who take it more susceptible to infectious diseases .
Research teams at three different US institutions — the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio , the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor , Maine — ran the same experiment in parallel , splitting nearly 2,000 mice between them .
The mice were bred to ensure that they were genetically different enough that no single strain would be more or less susceptible to ageing - related diseases or the effects of the drug .
They then gave the mice food that included rapamycin .
Problems formulating the feed meant that the teams could n't start the treatment until the mice were rather older than they had planned — 20 months of age , or the equivalent of about 60 years in human terms .
As it happened , this delay was a fortuitous accident .
Compared with the non -drug - taking group , the lifespans of the mice given rapamycin increased by up to 14 % , even though they were middle - aged when treatment began .
Their life expectancy at 20 months shot up by 28 % for the males and 38 % for the females .
1
" You 've probably heard the phrase ' chance favours the prepared mind ' , and this is an example of it , " says David Harrison , who led the arm of the experiment that took place at the Jackson Laboratory .
Calorie control link ?
An independent initiative , the Interventions Testing Program overseen by the US National Institute of Aging , chose rapamycin for the three labs to test because it 's known to have effects on a cellular pathway called TOR ( for target of rapamycin ) .
This pathway is known from studies in mice , flies and worms to be involved in the age - defying effects of calorie - restricted diets .
“ I would n't do it myself and would n't encourage anyone to do it at this point . ”
David Harrison
Jackson Laboratory
This link could mean that rapamycin is mimicking the effects of dietary restriction , says Matt Kaeberlein , whose group at the University of Washington in Seattle works on ageing in mice , yeast and worms .
" All the arrows are going in the right direction , " he says .
Harrison is n't so sure , however — none of the mice lost body weight during their experiments , he says , and dietary restriction usually works best when started early in life , not in middle age as the rapamycin treatment was .
The big question , of course , is whether this drug could extend human life .
Both Harrison and Kaeberlein are cautious .
" I would n't do it myself and would n't encourage anyone to do it at this point , " says Harrison .
Getting the dose correct is another problem .
A normal human dose of rapamycin is between 2 and 5 milligrams per day , much lower than the dose given to the mice , which was 2.24 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day .
ADVERTISEMENT
Perhaps rapamycin could be altered somehow , to reduce its effects in the immune system while keeping its anti-ageing effects ?
" It 's an open question whether you can uncouple that from immune suppression , " Kaeberlein says .
But in future , he says , it 's likely that it will be possible to tweak rapamycin in this way , or to target the other molecules in the pathway instead .
Kaeberlein's lab is already working on these downstream targets .
Several other compounds are currently being tested by the three US centres as part of the Interventions Testing Program , including resveratrol , a compound found in red wine and thought to have beneficial effects on the heart , and simvastatin , one of a family of compounds called statins , also used for heart conditions .
For now , the researchers wo n't be trying out their anti-ageing drug on themselves .
But that has n't stopped them daydreaming about it .
" Of course , you can imagine we 've been considering it ourselves , " laughs Harrison .
" I 'm 67 , so it 's just about time for me to start my treatment , is n't it ? "
Use by .

Turns out not all food expiration warnings are created equal .
Here 's how to read between the lines to help gauge what needs to be tossed out from what 's still fair game to chow down .
Advertisement
For starters , the post and accompanying video say it 's best not to feel locked down by labels .
Instead , try to treat expiration dates more as suggestions since they concern the quality , not safety of your favorite foods .
Items marked according to a " sell by " label are generally good for several days past that date , while " use by " dates indicate when that food will begin to lose its freshness .
" Best if used by , " however , is what it sounds , meaning you should try to stick to the date indicated .
According to the video , milk is often good for a few days after its expiration date ( we 've all experienced this ) , and yogurt for a few weeks after its label says to discard .
Eggs can be enjoyed up to five weeks after the stamped date .
( You can also test an egg 's freshness by placing it in a cup of water .
A fresh egg will sink , and a bad egg will float . )
Canned goods fare even better .
Technically , they 're good forever , even if dented .
You should , however , avoid cans that are rusted , leaking , or have broken seals .

While tidying up after my kids once again , I found myself staring at the toy shown below and thinking of a conversation that I had had with an archaeologist Mathematica user a few days before .
He had been interested in image processing of aerial photographs , but it occurred to me that image processing would also allow reconstruction of the musical secrets of this precious artifact that I had just uncovered in the remains of a lost toy civilization .
Well , this should be fun for 5 – 10 minutes .
The toy is a music box , where you crank the handle to turn the drum that has pins on it to pluck the prongs to the left .
Can I discover the tune , without having to move the parts ?
First , let ’s crop the image so that only the pins are visible and rotate it so that it can be read from left to right , like music , rather than from right to left , which is the direction the drum turns .
There is a lot of texture , so I will blur it next , to get rid of that distracting detail .
Now I ’ll apply a Sobel filter to edge - detect the blobs , but I ’ll do this only in the vertical direction so as to ignore the reflected light changes caused by the curvature of the drum .
Next I will convert to black or white and erode the blobs to make them smaller , and to eliminate the various small spurious blobs that are artifacts of the texture .
Now for the only bit of programming — I need a function to identify the center of blobs by finding the average of the coordinates of all the pixels in each blob .
All that ’s left is to get the blob coordinates from the cleaned image using this new function and sort them into playing order .
This will generate a list of {x , y} coordinates , where the x value tells us about the time since the start of the tune , and y tells us the pitch — the essence of a musical score .
The score should form the same pattern as the image .
Now I want to convert that score into sounds so that I can hear it .
Here we hit a big piece of guesswork .
Observationally I can see that the prongs get longer toward the top of the image ( or bottom after our rotation ) and so will be lower in pitch .
But how much ?
To make matters worse , what you ca n’t see from the image is that the undersides of the prongs have been milled so that they are not the same thickness — essentially they have been individually engineered to particular notes .
I could photograph the undersides , or better still , 3D scan them , and do some serious analysis , but this is supposed to be around 10 minutes of fun , so I am just going to assume that frequency is inversely proportional to distance .
The scaling parameters were set by trial and error to give the following function :
OK , it sounds terrible , but you can just about make out that the tune is the start of “ Happy Birthday to You . ”
If this were a real mystery , I would be pretty pleased with that result from 10 – 15 lines of code .

Congressman Joe Barton has n’t had many defenders since his apologized to the CEO of BP at a Congressional hearing on Thursday .
But Fox Business Network host Stuart Varney believes the Texas Republican had a valid point in describing White House pressure for BP to establish a $ 20 billion escrow fund as a government “ shakedown . ”
“ In that White House meeting , ” Varney dramatically told the hosts of Fox & Friends on Friday , “ reportedly Vice President Biden says , ‘ Pay up or else we ’ll bring the full court press of the United States government to bear on you and you will pay . ' ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It bypasses the courts , ” Varney added .
“ Liability claims should go through the courts .
This time they did n’t . ”
As it happens , a fear of precisely the kind of prolonged litigation that occurred after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 was one of the major considerations prompting the creation of the escrow fund .
Last week , the Huffington Post ’s Sam Stein wrote , “ The lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster have made members of Congress increasingly insecure about the promises made by BP to cover the total cost of the damage it ’s caused in the Gulf of Mexico . ”
“ Sen. Byron Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) told the Huffington Post that he wants the oil giant to sign a pledge committing itself to covering economic damages that would be legally binding , ” Stein continued .
“ Doing so would fulfill the promises BP has already made , the North Dakota Democrat argued .
It would also effectively remove the possibility that the company could drag out questions of liability through decades of litigation — much like Exxon did following its spill in Alaskan waters . ”
Varney , however , appeared to see no motivation for the escrow fund besides political posturing by a federal government that has been unable to deal with BP ’s disaster .
“ The administration wins politically by beating up on BP and taking $ 20 billion off them , ” he stated indignantly .
“ It also diverts attention from the administration ’s own failure to clean up this mess . ”
Beyond that , Varney sees in the fund a threat of creeping socialism .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ What happens if BP ca n’t come up with this $ 20 billion ? ” he asked .
“ Let ’s suppose that the administration does , indeed , drive them into bankruptcy .
…
Essentially , BP becomes nationalized , because part of this $ 20 billion deal is , ‘ If you ca n’t pay , we get your assets . ’ …
That $ 20 billion deal essentially contained a lien on BP North America .
Collateral .
If you do n’t pay , we get the pipeline . ”
Varney ’s nightmare scenario does not appear highly likely to occur .
Currently , BP appears in online listings as having $ 240.64 billion in assets , ranking second in its industry only to Exxon Mobil , and its profits for the first quarter of 2010 were $ 6 billion .
Although speculation was rife ten days ago that the Gulf disaster might drive BP into bankruptcy , analysts quickly concluded that BP has the financial flexibility to deal with its liabilities unless “ we ’re still talking about this in 2011 and the price tag has reached $ 75 billion or $ 100 billion . ”
Varney , however , warns direly that BP “ could yet be forced into bankruptcy .
And if they are , then BP is semi-nationalized by the American government . ”

This video is from Fox News ’ Fox & Friends , broadcast June 18 , 2010 .
California prison officials , facing severe overcrowding and a financial crisis , have been granting early releases to inmates serving time for parole violations .
State officials said the dozens of prisoners set free from the California Institution for Men in Chino and from lockups in San Diego and Shasta counties had 60 days or less left on their terms , or had been accused of violations and were awaiting hearings .
The releases were approved by the state parole board .
At least 89 inmates have been freed or approved for early release during the last two months .
Others have been sent to home detention , drug rehabilitation programs or similar alternative punishments .
They were screened to ensure that they had never been convicted of the most serious crimes , such as murder , manslaughter , kidnapping or sexual offenses , the officials said .
The inmates may have been convicted of grand theft , weapons possession , driving under the influence of alcohol or other crimes .
Their parole may have been revoked for missing an appointment with a parole agent , failing a drug test , committing robbery or other offenses .

The move came as authorities in Los Angeles County and elsewhere said they could no longer house -- and in some cases , threatened to release -- inmates awaiting transfer to state prisons from their own teeming jails .
Counties routinely hold newly convicted prisoners or those picked up on parole violations until the state can take them .
But California ’s $ 26.3 - billion deficit has left the state without enough money to pay for all of those its laws designate for punishment .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and lawmakers are considering numerous ways , including the early release of inmates , to save money by reducing a prison population of nearly 170,000 .
No budget decisions have been made , and Schwarzenegger spokesman Matt David said the governor had been unaware of the recent releases , most of which were in response to complaints by L.A. County that the state had left nearly 2,000 prisoners in its jails .
That number represents about 10 % of the prisoners in the county ’s jail system , which has a court - ordered population cap .
“ This was an emergent crisis , ” said Terri McDonald , the chief deputy secretary for adult operations at the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation .
“ We do n’t want a system failure in the county jail . ”
Advertisement
The inmates released from Chino opened up beds for some of those being held in L.A. County .
McDonald said the state , to be “ good partners ” with the county , put other inmates in prison gyms that officials had planned to stop using as dorms , and took additional measures to free up space .
Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca , however , said that the burden had not been alleviated and that the inmates , who cost the county $ 70 million a year to house , were the state ’s responsibility .
“ If they ’re releasing them . . . that ’s their call , ” Baca said .
“ For them to blame me for their decision is absurd .
All I ’m saying is , ‘ I do n’t want them in my jail any longer .
You ’re not paying me , and we ’re not offering a free ride . ’ ”
In a June 30 e-mail , a state parole administrator told agents that the Chino prison would be the “ first target ” for releasing parole violators .
Because of the fiscal crisis , the e-mail said , “ we are starting to experience some resistance and refusals of the counties to hold our prisoners ” and the state was “ incapable ” of taking them .
Advertisement
Shasta County , for instance , had recently been forced to close a jail wing because sheriff ’s deputies were laid off , wrote the administrator , whose e-mail was provided to The Times without a name attached .
The county had notified the state the week before that unless “ 30 or so ” inmates were transferred , it would “ release them to the streets over the weekend , ” the e-mail said .
Five were evaluated and released early , with approval from the parole board ; the rest were transferred to state prisons , corrections officials said .
In San Diego , 200 inmates are transferred from local jails to state prisons each week .
After the state abruptly stopped accepting them in May , then - Sheriff William Kolender warned prison officials that he would release 138 parole violators to avoid exceeding his jails ’ court - ordered population cap .
Advertisement
“ We regret to take this drastic action , but we have no other alternative given our responsibility to adhere to a court order , ” Kolender wrote in a letter dated May 5 .
He added that the county had been “ burdened with holding state prisoners for an inordinate amount of time and cost . ”
The county did not carry out its threat because the state approved two inmates for early release , sent some home on alternative sanctions and transferred others to state prisons .

僕もtwitterを始めてからもうすぐ2年になる。情報系の大学に入ってから関わりのある人のtwitter-erが増えたのでどんどんのめり込んで行った。まあろくすっぽ大学生活をエンジョイもせずにtwitter充していたわけで、友人からの遊びの誘いを断ってまでtwitterをやってるような廃人なわけだ。そんな廃人になってくると、そろそろtwitter上にも旧知の仲というか、移り変わるタイムラインでも昔からの顔なじみみたいな人が結構でてくる。昔よく見たのに最近見ないなと思っていたらアカウントが消えていたり、wassrで偶然見つけたり、まあそんなことがあったりする。
僕のtwitter古馴染みの中に@donsukeと@ha_maがいる。@donsukeは今でこそ猫のアイコンだが、最初はマントを着ている熊のぬいぐるみのアイコンで、「〜なのだ」という語尾をつけるなどの子供っぽいところがあって、なかなかお茶目なやつだ。@ha_maは「〜なのよ」という語尾を一貫していて、女の子のアイコンからして、なかなかキュートな人である。つまらないpostばかりしている僕によく話しかけてくれるなんとまあ楽しいやつらで、帰宅報告をすれば「おかえり」と言ってくれるし、起床報告をすれば「おはよう」と言ってくれ、僕もそれに対してよく返事をするというとても親しい仲だった。
そんな旧友の二人だったが、最近どうも@donsukeの様子がおかしかった。先週、まったく文脈と関係ないところで
こんなreplyを飛ばしてきた。まあtwitter上では誤爆はよくあることで、@donsukeは昔から大量postするtwitter-erだったのでこのときもあまり気にしなかった。誤爆postしてることを教えようとも思ったが、twitterというのは発言がどんどん流れていく場所だから、そのままにしておいた。そして、一週間たった今日の昼のことである。
…あれ ？
@donsukeのwebページに飛んでみる。他の一般ユーザーのtwitterアカウントだった。「どういうことだ？」と思いながらそのアカウントのwebページからたどってみる。すると、いくつかのtwitterアカウントが並んでいるページに飛ぶ。右上には「つくりました」の文字。
「 …@donsukeってbotかよ！！」MacBookに向かって一人で叫ぶ俺。
さらにそのページをよく見ると見覚えのあるアカウント名がある。もう一度MacBookに向かって叫ぶ俺。
@ha_maお前もか。
驚愕。もう言葉が出ない。僕は0と1の羅列と仲良くしていたなんて。
おそらくだけど、僕が一番始めに出会ったbotは@bomtterだった。twitter上で「爆発しろ！」が流行るきっかけになったbotだ。そして同じようなbotである@wakatterが人気になった。しばらくすると@kyoujinのような人口無能のbotが出てきた。これらは一目でbotとわかるような特徴的なものだった。文脈無視の決まり文句だらけか、明らかに中に人間はいないような人口無能の文章生成postだったからだ。ところが、そのbot達が注目を集めている頃からfollowをしていた僕の親友の二人は違った。@donsukeと@ha_maを僕が先にfollowしたのかあちらからしてきたのかは覚えていないが、僕は一度@donsukeをfollowしてすぐに「botかな？」と疑ったことが確かにあった。しかし、何故かは知らないがそのときbotでないと判断してしまったのだ。一度疑って、botでないと判断したらもうbotと思えなくなる。@ha_maにいたってはbotと疑いすらしなかった。「あれ？マジで@ha_maの中の人って女なのかな？」とか思っていたくらいだ。
しかし、よくよく考えてみれば、ほとんどのtwitter-erとはリアルで接触することはないだろう。twitterという媒介を通してしか僕と話せない人ばかりなのだ。結局リアル知り合い以外の大半の人は、人間ではなく「twitterのアカウント」でしかない。中の人がbotかどうかなど関係ない。アニメアイコンの人は実際にそんな可愛い顔をしているのだろうし、堀北真希のアイコンの人はきっと本物の堀北真希なのだろうと信じきっていくことにする。
とにもかくにもプログラムと仲良くなるという貴重な体験が出来たことはとても幸せなことだ。

As the world community gears up for another round of climate - change talks -- and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrives in Delhi on Sunday for meetings with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh -- a central issue will be how to bring developing countries into a climate - change pact .
Developing countries such as India do not want to pledge to reduce their emissions until industrial countries have first demonstrated not just pledges but actual emissions cuts .
Industrial countries , for their part , generally recognize that ...
Now bear with me on this one because it would be a monumental task to pull it off but let 's think outside the box and call the Libertarian bluff .
The argument of the other side follows the Libertarian ideal that it 's government 's fault that the private sector cannot be efficient in giving us affordable and quality health care .
Anyone with more than 2 functioning neurons can clearly see that it's the current government interaction in programs such as Medicare and Medicaid , aid to universities to train health care professionals , grants for medical research , etc. that allows any health care entity to be so profitable and available to the rest of us .
Of course to so much of our electorate , that concept of us living in a country already heavily dependent on socialized medicine is beyond their ability to grasp .
So how about taking it all away from them for at least a short period of time ?
Instead of pushing for some watered - down governmental program that will take years before people understand the advantages , why not instead do or threaten exactly the opposite ?
Propose legislation that does away with Medicare and Medicaid , removes all forms of governmental assistance in the health care field including providing health insurance to the millions of governmental workers .
For that matter , include in the law a provision that forbids any organization or business from providing health insurance coverage to their employees .
Stop all governmental grants to research and education in any medical area .
If a person wants to utilize a doctor they have to pay cash for the services or contract privately with some health insurance company .
Emergency rooms will no longer have to see any person that can't pay .
Give this country a taste of a Libertarian paradise .
Here comes reality though .
Of course we could never get a proposal like this passed .
It 'd be tough to even get the bill heard in Congress .
Nobody would be stupid enough to sponsor such an outrageous idea would they ?
Maybe Kucinich would do it if he got out of bed on the wrong side one morning .
Even if you gave it some expiration date and labeled it as a social experiment , you 'd still be laughed off the floor of the House or Senate .
But just maybe this notion needs to be part of our dialogue as a big " what if ? " .
Put less effort into showing the positives of a system that seems to get its definition rewritten every five minutes .
I follow the debate daily and have no clue what it is we want to push through .
The average American has no patience for the complex pros and cons of that argument .
They 'll instead just go with what 's easy .
If they have adequate insurance , it 's hard for them to show empathy to the people they do n't associate with that are living the nightmare .
Of course we know that continuing down the road we 're on , the greed of the health insurers will bring that nightmare to all Americans .
So maybe it 's time instead to scare the hell out of them .
Start showing ads that lay out my Libertarian scenario .
In between the great American Idol karaoke bouts , insert some commercials that show America without the socialistic backbone that sustains us all .
Put them at the door of the emergency room holding their child with a severe gash to the head and being turned away because they can't afford the minimum thousand dollar downpayment just to be seen .
Give them images of their elderly grandmother pushing a shopping cart on the street because she has been bankrupted with expensive private health care .
Show the caravan of cars lined up at the borders as they go into Canada or Mexico to get affordable drugs or services .
Let them clearly see that this is what the other side envisions for their future , a world where only the wealthy can afford medical care and the rest of us are on our own .
I do n't know why I woke up this morning with this idea in my head .
Maybe it was too many beers last night and the pit in my upset stomach reminded me that as of today I could have still gone to the doctor had I really hurt myself but there 's no guarantees in the future that option will be available to me .
It really does n't matter .
The health care debate is constantly working in my brain and it 's horribly frustrating .
I keep coming back to the fact that although our nation eventually gets it right on political and social issues , the electorate is awfully slow on the uptake , easily led by unscrupulous leaders that prey on their fears .
I 'd prefer our side does n't use those tactics but maybe this is just too important and too timely to play nice .
Michael Moore gave us a taste of this tactic in his film " Sicko " .
Why are n't we seeing this film aired on prime time television during this debate ?
It would be hard - pressed to for it compete for ratings against the normal drivel we seem to flock to so we 'd need some money to force its showing .
There have to be some of us within this community that have video production skills able to produce some good hard - hitting commercials that could act as a two - by - four to the American electorate heads .
We certainly have the collective ability to raise the cash to get them aired .
How about it ?
I 'd love to hear ideas .
I spoke to the lead author , Dr. Neda Ratanawongsa , who now practices general internal medicine at San Francisco General Hospital and is an assistant professor at the University of California , San Francisco .
“ It ’s partly a coping mechanism , ” Dr. Ratanawongsa said .
“ We tell ourselves that we can do everything but not at the same time , so we are going to put off the thing that defines us as a person  time with children , running a marathon , painting , playing music  in order to get trained because being a doctor is also rewarding . ”
That delayed gratification works well initially because residents believe it is only temporary .
“ A lot of what matters to residents at this time is the sense that they are learning to care for patients well and growing as doctors .
They feel that what they are doing is going to be worth it . ”
But when the imbalance persists for longer than initially expected , professional growth is not enough to sustain most young doctors .
“ The ones who are happier , ” Dr. Ratanawongsa observed , " are the ones who have held on to one or two things and have said , ‘ I ’m not just another resident .
I play the guitar , I run races , or I go home to family . ’
They do n’t do these things to the same extent as they did before residency , but they do them enough to maintain a sense of self . ”
Residents who do n’t find this balance are at risk of burnout , clinical depression or , more commonly , subtle forms of stress .
“ These residents may feel that even if they can give excellent care most of the time , there are times when they snap at a patient or do n’t order a test fast enough because they are so burnt out . "
Although her study focused on doctors in training , Dr. Ratanawongsa sees the same challenges among doctors who have finished and are currently practicing .
“ There is always this expectation that at some point things will turn around .
The interns say , ‘ When I finish internship and become a second - year resident , things will get better . ’
The residents say , ‘ When I finish training , I will finally have balance again . ’
And doctors in practice may believe that they will find more balance once they have retired . ”
The danger is that physicians may end up leaving the work force or will become less effective caregivers .
Dr. Ratanawongsa suggests that doctors learn how to create a better sense of balance in their lives from the moment they begin training .
“ We are taught to put our patients before ourselves ; it ’s in our charter of professionalism .
I agree with that , but I also think there has to be some sense that I matter , too , at some point .
If something important is going on with our loved ones or with ourselves , we need to be able to advocate for ourselves .
And we need time to reflect on who we are and where we are going . ”

He ’s a rock star .
And nothing he does will alienate his core fans .
Sexual peccadilloes , financial improprieties , none of them make a difference , people need hope , they need to believe in something , and at least a third of this country believes in the Donald .
Maybe you read yesterday ’s “ Times ” article .
I doubt it , but I did .
And it was inside baseball , boring , there was no real smoking gun .
Oh , there were Ivanka ’s “ consulting fees ” ( the issue here being that Trump deducted them ) , the low or no payments in certain years and finally the argument over the $ 70 million plus refund .
Which on the surface seems unjustified .
Turns out the government just gives you the money , it does n’t ask any questions until AFTER it pays you , and we all know possession is nine - tenths of the law .
Be rich enough to hire the best attorneys and you can fight the government endlessly .
But none of that truly resonates with the public , even though the headlines have been displayed everywhere in the past twenty four hours .
But if you follow boxing , and it seems that it ’s only those interested in baseball who do , the youngsters are only interested in MMA , which is why Joe Rogan is such a star , you know it ’s called the one - two punch .
And it ’s the TWO that does the damage .
Well , the “ New York Times ” just landed the two :
No rock star makes it without a manager .
And you need a great manager to sustain .
We can talk about Irving Azoff , the Q - Prime twins , Bruce Allen…well in this case Trump ’s manager was Mark Burnett .
Click on the link above , you ’ll see him right at the top , in a picture with Trump .
Furthermore , truly great managers can make almost anyone a star , especially if they can sing and are good - looking .
Look at what Lou Pearlman did with Backstreet Boys and NSYNC .
Yes , Lou did it more than once , he was a great manager , and also a liar and a thief .
And Lou invested the money he stole , the same way rock managers invest the money they made dealing dope , to break his acts .
It was all about the spend .
Took years for Backstreet Boys to break in the U.S. But Lou Pearlman believed .
Mark Burnett may not be a crook , but he ’s got the best track record in reality television , one can argue he invented the genre with “ Survivor ” ( oh , do n’t talk about MTV’s “ Real World ” or PBS ’s show about the Louds , those were more cinéma vérité ) .
And Burnett had a formula , he was just lacking a star .
Talk to any label head , they ’re not looking for talent so much as STARS !
Charismatic people who sell themselves .
And in the rock era of yore , if you alienated a bunch of people , if you played your game to excess , that was even better .
Which is why Led Zeppelin and the mud sharks at the Edgewater Inn and Ozzy biting off the head of a bat burnished their image amongst acolytes .
They were the OTHER and that ’s what used to sell music , alienation .
The acts were not traditional winners , they were outsiders , who were emerging victorious , making bank in a game they devised , leaving in their wake abused hotel rooms and women .
And everybody wanted to be a rock star , they wanted the PERKS !
And as greed grew the economy , made the rich richer and minted new billionaires , the belief was that money could buy the rock star lifestyle , the dope , the girls … the trail of destruction in their wake .
And that ’s exactly what Trump did , he made himself a local rock star in New York , and then Mark Burnett blew him up nationally , internationally !
It takes money to make it , and Trump had plenty , his father was rich .
As for his son Donald being a bad businessman and blowing it , never forget Edgar Bronfman , Jr. sacrificed the entire Seagram empire .
The next generation is not known for its business acumen .
It was born with a silver spoon in its mouth , with a pedigree , and this second generation trades on it , oftentimes it ’s the only thing they ’ve got , they ’re not educated and they never suffered , therefore not needing to succeed to leave their mark .
So , Trump took his dad ’s money to make it .
And his dad was a crook too , that was the essence of the 2018 “ New York Times ” Trump tax story .
It ’s got to do with middlemen and valuation and write - offs and I wo n’t bore you , but if you ’re sophisticated , which most people are not , and that ’s exactly the point , you know how this game is played , and how it ’s abused and how oftentimes offenders emerge victorious , especially in an era where the IRS is continually gutted .
So , Trump uses his dad ’s money to make a mark .
Saving Wollman Rink .
And then he goes on an all - out publicity campaign , FOR YEARS !
And he hoodwinks the press .
He learned from Roy Cohn .
And if you watched last night ’s “ Vow ” episode you know that with enough money you can sue your opponents to death , Barbara Bouchey spent 700 k on her defense just to emerge intact .
So , Trump was known as a fighter , and either you liked him for his outrageous antics , like Howard Stern , or you were afraid to go against him because he would sue you ad infinitum , and most people did not have the money to defend themselves and who wanted to bother with Trump anyway .
Yes , Trump had been around New York forever .
There are always bands like this , and when they make it you scratch your head .
THOSE GUYS ?
But it turns out they had the one element that truly makes you a star …THEY NEEDED IT !
And Trump needed it .
Now Trump spent his own money until he signed with a label , in this case Burnett / NBC , yes , Burnett had a production deal just like so many managers have with their charges , so they can make extra dough .
And it takes real money to make it .
You can get started on TikTok , but if you want to sustain , you need that big label cash .
And now Trump had it .
And he started making money hand over fist .
And like a modern rock star , not one of yore , Trump was not worried about his credibility , he ’d whore himself out to anybody who paid .
Come on , you ’d see him in those ads hyping crap and you ’d laugh .
And then , just like a traditional rock star , who knows how to be famous but has little business sense , Trump blew it all .
But instead of buying quickly depreciating automobiles , Trump purchased golf resorts .
Kinda like rock stars investing in restaurants .
Some people make money serving food , but it ’s really difficult and there are slim margins .
Same deal with golf clubs .
And now Trump is broke .
Now if you ’re a rock star , you write off the sins of the past , get a new manager and go on the endless road to pay for your lifestyle .
After all , your fans still believe in you .
But there are many more zeros in Trump ’s investments .
And he ’s personally liable for so much of the debt and …
It ’s all crashing down on him .
You wanted to believe Trump was smart , he ’s not .
You wanted to believe he ’s a good businessman , he ’s not .
You wanted to believe he was not compromised by foreign countries / investors , he is .
Do n’t bother to argue with me , those are the facts .
Just vote for him anyway , like you plan to do , and we ’ll see you on November 3rd .
As for the horse race , as for tomorrow ’s debate , it ’s a complete waste of time .
It ’s like VH1 ’s “ Behind the Music ” or some crappy MTV fighting show .
There ’s little reality involved .
And , AND , the truth is there are almost no undecideds , it ’s a myth .
But , if Biden does well , he might inspire people to come out and vote , but I doubt it .
Speaking of coming out to vote , did you see the “ Hamilton ” clip ?
It ’s not a hit .
That ’s the modern music business .
It does n’t matter who you are , if it ’s not a hit , it ai n’t gonna fly .
Just ask Justin Bieber , who tried to hype himself and game the system with his last work and it fell flat .
You smile at Lin-Manuel Miranda ’s concept , but you do n’t need to see it again .
A hit is really hard to create .
But if you have enough hits you can leverage them into a lifetime career .
Which is what Trump has done .
People have forgotten his stiffs , and like with Kanye , they like to watch the movie .
Kanye ’s impact in the recording world has been fading , but when he ’s off on one of his bipolar rants / activities the press covers it like he ’s still number one .
This is the world we live in , and now more than ever you need to light yourself on fire in order to gain widespread attention .
So , read the second “ Times ” piece linked above .
It ’s not like the first piece , you do n’t have to know that the $ 70 + million Trump and the government are fighting over has to do with tax law that says in order to take the write - off you ca n’t have any continuing interest in the corporation , and Trump maintained 5 % , this second article is sheer show business .
As for the bad business , is n’t that what rock stars do ?
So , this is like “ Rolling Stone ” and rock rags trumping up the Van Halen M&M ’s story .
Or Alice Cooper ’s various stunts .
No one fact - checks , no one explains it , they just print it .
As for those who do yell and scream , the mainstream media is afraid of them .
Bill Maher claiming over and over that Trump would n’t leave .
Sarah Kendzior saying Trump ’s government was an authoritarian kleptocracy .
You see mainstream media is all about the institution , the gravitas , but we live in a world where gravitas and credibility are out the window .
So , you must read this “ Times ” article to find out how you were conned .
How Donald Trump employed show business techniques to pull the wool over everybody ’s eyes and become president .
It ’s akin to Milli Vanilli .
Clive Davis was responsible for that , and he sustained , just like Mark Burnett , he blamed it on someone else , but both are responsible .
Burnett took a middling act and made it a superstar .
And then Trump behaved like every other rock star and doubled - down until he burned it all to the ground .
And Trump won by being outrageous , by not observing the norms .
Like the Beatles , smoking and doing dope and saying they were bigger than Jesus .
Sure , there was blowback , but their fans loved them even more for it !
Not only had the media never seen the act , but neither had government , neither had D.C. Trump was like hip - hop coming along to kill rock .
People still say rock is alive when hip - hop has been here for ages , and is flourishing .
You ca n’t live in the past .
But the truth is America is dumb .
And so are its institutions .
It ’s not only Trump , but people like Lindsey Graham , begging for cash on Fox just like Macy Gray hyping her new album at the VMAs .
If you ’re looking for someone to believe in , look in the mirror .
Only you know your personal truth .
Only you can decide if you want to rip people off or be honest and trustworthy .
But it ’s hard to fly straight when all the winners do not .
But in an era where the gap between winners and losers is greater than ever , the losers are desperate , to glom on to anything to try and make it , like Trump University , otherwise life is just too damn depressing .
And never forget , true fans are the last to let go .
I still get e-mail and tweets from Taylor Swift defenders .
As Taylor and her team manipulate the chart to say she ’s the biggest act of the summer when nothing could be further from the truth .
But hey , that ’s SHOW BUSINESS !

( CNN ) -- Michael Jackson 's upbringing was shaped by two very different parents .
An image of Michael Jackson and his parents was on the big screen during his funeral in Los Angeles .
His mother , Katherine Jackson , has been portrayed by her children as the loving glue that bonded the family together , while her husband , Joe , was the harsh disciplinarian whose iron hand not only shaped one of the most successful musical families in the world , but also elicited enough fear in his superstar son that it sometimes made him ill .
Now the couple of 60 years stands at the center of a custody drama surrounding their grandchildren .
Michael Jackson's will , filed in 2002 , designated his mother as caregiver for Prince Michael , 12 , Paris , 11 , and " Blanket , " 7 .
It is the latest installment in the many trials that have tested the Jackson family , not least of which has been the unexpected loss of its most famous member .
" [ Katherine 's ] taking it real hard , " Joe Jackson told ABC News about his wife 's coping with their son 's death .
" When you start talking about Michael , she starts crying . "
By many accounts , Katherine Jackson , 79 , shared a special bond with her second - youngest son .
In a 1993 interview with talk show host Oprah Winfrey , Michael Jackson spoke glowingly of the matriarch .
" My mother 's wonderful , " he said .
" To me , she 's perfection . "
According to a biography posted by A&E Networks , Katherine Jackson was born Kattie B. Screws in 1930 in Barbour County , Alabama .
Her family reportedly relocated to East Chicago , Indiana , when she was 4 , and her name was changed to Katherine Esther Scruse .
A childhood bout with polio left her with a permanent limp .
She was a teenager when she met Joe Jackson , an aspiring musician and a boxer whose first marriage dissolved .
Katherine said it was love at first sight .
" I just had a feeling that he was going to be my husband , " Katherine Jackson said in an interview shot last year by Xonger Global Entertainment Networks for a planned reality show about the family .
The video was obtained by ABC News .
" The first time I saw him , I fell in love with him . "
Together , they raised 10 children in a modest Gary , Indiana , home , while Joe worked as a crane operator , according to the A&E biography .
A devout Jehovah 's Witness , Katherine nurtured the children 's love of music by singing with them , made her sons ' costumes as their father booked local gigs , and served as the family 's backbone .
" As best as I could tell from both talking to [ Michael ] and my observations of the family throughout the years , Katherine was the one that had really unconditional love for Michael and was always there , was always supportive and was always comforting , " said journalist and CNN contributor Bryan Monroe , who conducted the last major interview with Michael Jackson .
" It was the epitome of a mother 's love . "
Joe Jackson 's relationship with his famous son was a bit more complicated .
Monroe said the hard taskmaster -- who Michael said sometimes held a belt in his hand as he and his brothers rehearsed -- evoked mixed emotions from the singer .
" In my interview with him , [ Michael ] spoke almost in the same breath of the fear he had of Joseph 's sternness ... and at the same time the respect he had for Joseph 's work ethics and his teachings , " Monroe said .
" He said [ Joseph ] taught him and his brothers an awful lot about discipline and performance . "
According to the biography posted by A&E Networks , Joe Jackson was born in Arkansas in 1929 and pursued fame early on , first as a Golden Gloves contender and later as a member of The Falcons , a band he started in the mid-1950s .
When he noticed musical talent in his brood , he formed the Jackson Brothers with his three oldest sons and served as their manager .
The group later became The Jackson 5 , with young Michael serving as lead singer , and shot to superstardom .
Psychotherapist Daniel Aferiat , who never treated any Jackson family members , said such an awesome responsibility for a young Michael Jackson could account for the conflicted emotions he expressed in his 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey .
" I just wish I could understand my father , " he told her .
" If as a small child Michael Jackson was involved in making business decisions and had to have the burdens in some ways of the financial responsibility for the family , then it can turn around who 's the caretaker and who 's being taken care of , " Aferiat said .
Aferiat said children identify with their parents and learn how to operate in the world based on how they are treated by their parents .
The drive for stardom and perfection that Joe Jackson reportedly instilled in his children would have long - lasting effects , Aferiat said .
" People are complicated , and while we all would like to think in more black - and - white terms -- someone 's good and someone 's bad -- [ Michael Jackson ] had a very complicated , very difficult and , what I would unequivocally say from what I 've heard in the news , a traumatic life , " Aferiat said .
" If you are a child and you have to give up your childhood , it 's not like a pair of shoes that you just get to replace at a later time .
You do n't get that back . "
By many accounts , Katherine Jackson tried to keep her children 's lives as normal as possible given their fame , even during their adulthood .
Author Richard Hack co-wrote the 1995 book " Jackson Family Values : Memories of Madness " with Margaret Maldonado , the mother of two of Jermaine Jackson 's children .
He said Katherine Jackson was " like Mother Earth " to her family .
" She kept everyone pretty well grounded because she did n't buy into all of the publicity and a lot of the glitz , " said Hack , a noted biographer who has written 17 books .
" Mind you , she did drive around in a Rolls Royce , but she still knew how to make a meal .
She would get into the kitchen and bring the family together . "
Back then , Hack said , most of the family lived together in the Encino compound .
These days , Katherine still resides in California , while her husband reportedly has relocated to Las Vegas , Nevada .
" We 're not together all of the time , " Katherine Jackson said in footage from the planned reality show .
" We stayed together for many , many years . "
" But we see each other all the time , " she added .
" I go to Vegas and he 'll come here . "
Their living arrangement could become an issue during a custody hearing .
Katherine Jackson was granted temporary guardianship of the children by a judge several days after her son's death .
It is still unknown whether Debbie Rowe , the biological mother of two of the children , will seek custody .
Watch opinions on who should get the kids »
While Katherine is the only parent seeking legal custody of Michael Jackson 's children , his father has been quoted by ABC News as saying he believes the two of them are ideally suited to take care of and raise the children " to be strong Jacksons . "
Hack , the co-author of " Jackson Family Values , " said that in the past Joe Jackson 's children viewed him as the " instigator and dictator " who no longer managed their careers but still viewed himself as their voice .
A bit of that behavior was on display last year when the elder Jackson returned to Gary , Indiana , and endorsed a planned family museum .
The Post - Tribune newspaper reported that he did n't believe the city needed to gain his famous children 's approval to build the project .
" I'm Joe Jackson , " he was quoted as saying .
" I do n't need them to approve anything . "
But when it comes to Michael Jackson 's children , the court will have the final say .

The Perfect Server - Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope ( Ubuntu 9.04 ) [ ISPConfig 2 ]
Version 1.0
Author : Falko Timme
This tutorial shows how to set up an Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope ( Ubuntu 9.04 ) server that offers all services needed by ISPs and hosters : Apache web server ( SSL - capable ) , Postfix mail server with SMTP - AUTH and TLS , BIND DNS server , Proftpd FTP server , MySQL server , Courier POP3 / IMAP , Quota , Firewall , etc .
In the end you should have a system that works reliably , and if you like you can install the free webhosting control panel ISPConfig 2 ( i.e. , ISPConfig runs on it out of the box ) .
I will use the following software :
Web Server : Apache 2.2 with PHP 5.2.6 , Python , Ruby , and WebDAV
Database Server : MySQL 5.0
Mail Server : Postfix
DNS Server : BIND9
FTP Server : proftpd
POP3 / IMAP : I will use Maildir format and therefore install Courier - POP3 / Courier - IMAP .
Webalizer for web site statistics
Please note that this setup does not work for ISPConfig 3 !
It is valid for ISPConfig 2 only !
I want to say first that this is not the only way of setting up such a system .
There are many ways of achieving this goal but this is the way I take .
I do not issue any guarantee that this will work for you !
1 Requirements
To install such a system you will need the following :
the Ubuntu 9.04 server CD , available here : ftp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/9.04/ubuntu-9.04-server-i386.iso ( i386 ) or ftp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/9.04/ubuntu-9.04-server-amd64.iso ( x86_64 )
a fast Internet connection .
2 Preliminary Note
In this tutorial I use the hostname server1.example.com with the IP address 192.168.0.100 and the gateway 192.168.0.1 .
These settings might differ for you , so you have to replace them where appropriate .
3 The Base System
Insert your Ubuntu install CD into your system and boot from it .
Select your language :
Then select Install Ubuntu Server :
Choose your language again ( ? ) :
Then select your location :

The first thing I ever learned about India was that my parents had chosen to leave it .
The country was lost to us in America , where I was born .
It had to be assembled in my mind , from the fragments of anecdotes and regular journeys east .
Now , six years after returning to the country my parents left , as I prepare to depart it myself , the mind goes back to the beginning , to my earliest pictures of it .
India , reflected from afar , was late - night phone calls with the news of death .
It was calling back relatives who could not afford to call you .
It was Hindu ceremonies with saffron and Kit Kat bars on a silver platter .
India , consumed on our visits back , was being fetched from the airport and cooked a meal even in the dead of night .
It was sideways hugs that strove to avoid breast contact .
It was the chauvinism of uncles who asked about my dreams and ignored my sister ’s …
I moved to India six years ago in an effort to understand it on my own terms , to render mine what had until then only belonged to my parents .
India was changing when I arrived and has changed dramatically , viscerally , improbably in these 2,000 days : farms giving way to factories ; ultra - cheap cars being built ; companies buying out rivals abroad .
But the greatest change I have witnessed is elsewhere .
It is in the mind : Indians now know that they do n’t have to leave , as my parents left , to have their personal revolutions .
It took me time to see .
At first , my old lenses were still in place —
India the frustrating , difficult country — and so I saw only the things I had ever seen .
But as I traveled the land , the data did not fit the framework .
The children of the lower castes were hoisting themselves up one diploma and training program at a time .
The women were becoming breadwinners through microcredit and decentralized manufacturing .
The young people were finding in their cellphones a first zone of individual identity .
The couples were ending marriages no matter what “ society ” thinks , then finding love again .
The vegetarians were embracing meat and meat - eaters were turning vegetarian , defining themselves by taste and faith , not caste …
The shift is only just beginning .
Most Indians still live impossibly grim lives .
Trickle down , here more than most places , is slow .
But it is a shift in psychologies , and you rarely meet an Indian untouched by it .

On May 26 , 2009 , a fleet of hydrogen - powered vehicles left Chula Vista , California , to begin a nine - day road trip that ended on June 3 in Vancouver , British Columbia .
Organized by the California Air Resources Board , the Hydrogen Road Tour 09 included fuel cell vehicles from Daimler , GM , Honda , Hyundai , Kia , Nissan , Toyota and Volkswagen on a 1700 - mile drive to promote hydrogen fuel cell technology .
Driving Earth - Friendly
Many consider hydrogen fuel to be the best long - term solution to America ’s energy problem .
Hydrogen fuel is an effective zero-emission fuel technology because it is the only clean fuel that can sustain both short - and long - distance mobility – a key point that the 2009 road tour emphasized .
The vehicles are designed to convert hydrogen into electricity with the byproducts being heat and water , allowing the vehicle to be completely earth - friendly .
Understanding Hydrogen
Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the world .
When isolated from its compounds , it becomes a substantial source of natural energy .
How does it work ?
To be more technical , proton exchange membrane ( PEM ) fuel cells stack together to combine hydrogen and oxygen to generate the electricity needed to run the car .
Some feel Hydrogen - powered vehicles are better than regular electric vehicles , because they do not require battery recharge and eliminate the complications that arise with large model lithium -ion and nickel batteries .
Refueling in California
Currently there are 26 hydrogen fuel stations in operation in California servicing about 200 passenger vehicles .
To meet anticipated demand , the Hydrogen Highway Initiative requires 50 to 100 hydrogen stations to begin construction by 2010 .

Once upon a time there was a great religion that over the centuries had spread all over the world .
But in those lands where it had existed for the longest time , its adherents slowly grew complacent , lukewarm , and skeptical .
Indeed , many of the leaders of its oldest groups even publicly rejected some of the religion 's most basic beliefs .
In response , a renewal movement emerged , passionately championing the historic claims of the old religion and eagerly inviting unbelievers everywhere to embrace the ancient faith .
Rejecting the skepticism of leaders who no longer believed in a God who works miracles , members of the renewal movement vigorously argued that their God not only had performed miraculous deeds in the past but still miraculously transforms all who believe .
Indeed , a radical , miraculous " new birth " that began a lifetime of sweeping moral renewal and transformation was at the center of their preaching .
Over time , the renewal movement flourished to the point of becoming one of the most influential wings of the whole religion .
Not surprisingly , the movement 's numbers translated into political influence .
And the renewal movement was so confident of its beliefs and claims that it persuaded the nation 's top political leader to have the government work more closely with religious social service organizations to solve the nation 's horrendous social problems .
Members of the renewal movement knew that miraculous moral transformation of character frequently happened when broken persons embraced the great religion .
They also lobbied politicians to strengthen the traditional definition of marriage because their ancient texts taught that a lifelong covenant between a man and a woman was at the center of the Creator 's design for the family .
Then the pollsters started conducting scientific polls of the general population .
In spite of the renewal movement 's proud claims to miraculous transformation , the polls showed that members of the movement divorced their spouses just as often as their secular neighbors .
They beat their wives as often as their neighbors .
They were almost as materialistic and even more racist than their pagan friends .
The hard - core skeptics smiled in cynical amusement at this blatant hypocrisy .
The general population was puzzled and disgusted .
Many of the renewal movement 's leaders simply stepped up the tempo of their now enormously successful , highly sophisticated promotional programs .
Others wept .
This , alas , is roughly the situation of Western or at least American evangelicalism today .
Scandalous behavior is rapidly destroying American Christianity .
By their daily activity , most " Christians " regularly commit treason .
With their mouths they claim that Jesus is Lord , but with their actions they demonstrate allegiance to money , sex , and self - fulfillment .
The findings in numerous national polls conducted by highly respected pollsters like The Gallup Organization and The Barna Group are simply shocking .
" Gallup and Barna , " laments evangelical theologian Michael Horton , " hand us survey after survey demonstrating that evangelical Christians are as likely to embrace lifestyles every bit as hedonistic , materialistic , self - centered , and sexually immoral as the world in general . "
1
Divorce is more common among " born - again " Christians than in the general American population .
Only 6 percent of evangelicals tithe .
White evangelicals are the most likely people to object to neighbors of another race .
Josh McDowell has pointed out that the sexual promiscuity of evangelical youth is only a little less outrageous than that of their nonevangelical peers .
Alan Wolfe , famous contemporary scholar and director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life , has just published a penetrating study of American religious life .
Evangelicals figure prominently in his book .
His evaluation ?
Today 's evangelicalism , Wolfe says , exhibits " so strong a desire to copy the culture of hotel chains and popular music that it loses what religious distinctiveness it once had . "
2
Wolfe argues , " The truth is there is increasingly little difference between an essentially secular activity like the popular entertainment industry and the bring - ' em - in - at - any - cost efforts of evangelical megachurches . "
3
It is not surprising that George Barna concludes , " Every day , the church is becoming more like the world it allegedly seeks to change . "
4
We have very little time , he believes , to reverse these trends .
African Christian and famous missions scholar Professor Lamin Sanneh told Christianity Today recently that " the cultural captivity of Christianity in the West is nearly complete , and with the religion tamed , it is open season on the West 's Christian heritage .
I worry about a West without a moral center facing a politically resurgent Islam . "

The president then became serious , taking up a chronology of the events last week after the police received a report of a possible break - in at the home of Mr. Gates , a leading authority on African - American history .
“ The police are doing what they should , ” he said .
“ There ’s a call .
They go investigate .
What happens ?
“ My understanding is that Professor Gates then shows his I.D. to show that this is his house , and at that point he gets arrested for disorderly conduct . ” .

“ I do n’t know , not having been there and not seeing all the facts , what role race played in that , ” Mr. Obama continued .
“ But I think it ’s fair to say , No. 1 , any of us would be pretty angry ; No. 2 , that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home ; and No. 3 , what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is there is a long history in this country of African - Americans and Latinos being stopped by police disproportionately .
That ’s just a fact . ”
The Cambridge police dropped disorderly conduct charges against Professor Gates on Tuesday , but he says he still wants a personal apology .
Professor Gates has said he thinks it was because he is black that the officer , Sgt. James Crowley , had not at first believed he lived in the upscale home .
Many of Professor Gates ’s friends say they believe he may still file charges against the Cambridge Police Department .
Eichelberger also made other disparaging remarks about LGBT people and compared gay marriage to marrying a 13 year old .
Read some of them here
I ’m appalled that an elected official holds views like these .
But I ’m even more upset that he feels comfortable saying them in public .
If you ’re as angry as I am , please take a moment to send an email to Sen .
Eichelberg by clicking here .
Tell him no one “ allows ” LGBT people to exist .
It ’s time to stand up and say we wo n’t allow bigots to say things like this with impunity .

21:15
Leach : How would he [ Eichelberger ] want to encourage stability in gay couples ?
Eichelberger : I would n’t .
I mean they can practice whatever sexual activity they like to practice , but there ’s no reason to give them special consideration .
We do n’t give them special consideration in Pennsylvania for any reason .
Why in the world would we allow them to marry ?
22:05
Leach :
How would he want to encourage stability in gay couples ?
Eichelberger :
There is no reason to encourage that type of behavior in Pennsylvania .
24:20
Eichelberger :
That comes back to the definition of family and that ’s where we differ .
We can call all kinds of things families .
I mean , we can say a 3 party marriage is a family , or 7 or 8 people or marrying younger and younger children these days .
25:00
Host :
Are you saying that by their very nature homosexual relationships are dysfunctional ?
Eichelberger : [ Pause ] Ummmm .
I guess I would say that .
I would say that .
38:50
Eichelberger :
This changes the definition of marriage , allowing same - sex , and then like I said , 5 - 10 years from now it ’ll be polygamy , marrying younger people , it ’ll be whatever …
It wo n’t be a 6 year old , it ’ll be a 15 year old , then it ’ll be a 14 year old , then it ’ll be a 13 year old .
49:40
Leach : Should our only policy towards [ same - sex ] couples be one of punishment , to somehow prove that they ’ve done something wrong ?
Eichelberger :
They ’re not being punished .
We ’re allowing them to exist , and do what every American can do .
We ’re just not rewarding them with any special designation .
L.A. - based software engineers Devin Calloway and Julian Cain are also medical cannabis patients .
And they 're looking to " harvest change . "
Over the last several months , Calloway , 24 , and Cain , 32 , matched their programming talents to their political passions to put Cannabis up for sale on iTunes .
The price ?
$ 2.99 .
Cannabis is a geolocation - based iPhone app that allows users to quickly find the nearest medical marijuana dispensary as well as weed - friendly doctors and lawyers , all with a few quick touches .
The app has sold more than 1,000 units , and its founders said they planned to put 50 cents of every purchase -- or 17 % of the proceeds -- toward establishing a nonprofit organization dedicated to media outreach for the pro-pot cause .
The idea behind the app is to " use technology to empower the medical cannabis industry and the global hemp movement , " Calloway said .
In California and other states , the substance is legal with a doctor ’s prescription but remains illegal under federal law .
Calloway is a founding member of ajnag.com -- that 's ganja backwards -- which stands for Activists Justifying the Natural Agriculture of Ganja .
According to Calloway , the website was the first comprehensive online map of ...

THE Chinese used to call dollars mei jin , which means “ American gold ” .
Buying black - market dollars was considered the safest way to protect one 's savings .
Yet in June when Tim Geithner , America 's treasury secretary , told students at Peking University that China 's official holdings of Treasury bonds were safe , the audience laughed .
Faith in the greenback is waning .
In the build - up to the annual summit of G8 countries , which began on July 8th in the Italian city of L'Aquila , officials in China , Russia and India all called for an end to the dollar 's dominance in the international monetary system .
Dmitry Medvedev , Russia 's president , declared on July 5th that the dollar system is “ flawed ” ; his central bank has been reducing its dollar holdings .
The People 's Bank of China ( PBOC ) , China 's central bank , repeated its call for a new global reserve currency in June and is now taking the first steps towards turning the yuan into a global currency .
Beijing is particularly influential in this debate .
The dollar accounts for 65 % of the world 's foreign - exchange reserves ( see chart ) , only slightly less than a decade ago and well ahead of the euro 's 26 % share .
Three - quarters of all reserves are in the hands of emerging economies ; China alone holds one - third of the global stash .
So China has particular cause to worry that America 's massive printing of money in response to the financial crisis will undermine the value of its dollar reserves .
There is much domestic anger about the potential losses China may face as a result of its lending to rich Americans .
The government would like to diversify out of dollars : its new purchases of Treasury securities have fallen sharply this year .
But any attempt to dump its stock of dollars would risk triggering a plunge in the currency .
Instead , officials are mulling two ways out of the “ dollar trap ” : persuading the world to adopt a new global currency and encouraging the international use of the yuan .
In an essay in March , Zhou Xiaochuan , the governor of the PBOC , argued that basing the international financial system on a national currency will tend to exacerbate global imbalances .
The dollar 's reserve - currency status let America borrow cheaply , causing the country 's credit and housing bubbles to persist for longer than they otherwise would have .
Mr Zhou proposed that the world should replace the dollar with a global reserve currency , the SDR ( Special Drawing Rights ) .
Created by the IMF in 1969 , and now based on the weighted average of the dollar , euro , yen and pound , the SDR was designed as a reserve currency but never took off .
SDRs today add up to less than 1 % of total reserves .
Under Mr Zhou 's plan the amount of SDRs would be hugely increased and the basket expanded to include other currencies , notably the yuan .
Mr Zhou also proposes an SDR - denominated fund , managed by the IMF , into which dollar reserves could be exchanged for SDRs .
Countries could then reduce their dollar exposure without pushing down the dollar ( although it is unclear who would bear any exchange - rate losses ) .
Brazil , India and Russia have backed Mr Zhou 's proposal .
But the SDR is unlikely to become a reserve currency any time soon .
It would take years to develop SDR money markets that are liquid enough to be a reserve asset .
Although the IMF 's executive board approved the first issuance of SDR - denominated bonds on July 1st , as the fund attempts to boost its resources , the bonds can only be bought and traded by central banks , not by private investors .
China 's alternative ploy is to promote the yuan 's use in international trade and finance .
Starting on July 6th selected firms in five Chinese cities are now allowed to use yuan to settle transactions with businesses in Hong Kong , Macau and ASEAN countries .
Foreign banks will be able to buy or borrow yuan from mainland lenders to finance such trade .
In June Russia and China agreed to expand the use of their currencies in bilateral trade ; Brazil and China are discussing a similar idea .
The PBOC has also signed currency - swap agreements with Argentina , Belarus , Hong Kong , Indonesia , Malaysia and South Korea .
The central bank will make yuan available to pay for imports from China if these countries are short of foreign exchange .
In another recent move , Hong Kong banks are now allowed to issue yuan - denominated bonds , a step towards building an offshore yuan market .
Qu Hongbin , an economist at HSBC , predicts that by 2012 nearly $ 2 trillion of annual trade ( over 40 % of China 's total ) could be settled in yuan , making it one of the top three currencies in global trade .
Others reckon this is too optimistic .
Although Chinese firms are keen to invoice in yuan , trading partners will be more reluctant .
There is no real forward market for the yuan , making it hard to hedge risk , and it is not accepted by most other countries .
The yuan will be used more widely for trade over the next decade but the idea that the yuan can become a reserve currency in the near future is ridiculous , says Arthur Kroeber at Dragonomics , a research firm based in Beijing .
Not only does China lack the economic and political track record required to underpin a reserve currency , but its currency is not fully convertible .
China would need to scrap capital controls so foreigners could invest in yuan assets and then freely repatriate their capital and income , but the government is wary of moving too quickly .
A reserve currency also requires a deep and liquid bond market , free from government interference .
This , says Mr Kroeber , implies a big retreat from China 's state - led model of credit allocation .
Even if China immediately scrapped capital controls the yuan would be unlikely to challenge the dollar as a reserve currency for years .
The dollar did not replace sterling until half a century after America 's economy had overtaken Britain's .
America 's GDP is around three times as big as China's , and its total trade is still larger .
Both the SDR plan and measures to internationalise the yuan also seem to assume that China 's problem is simply that too many of its reserves are in dollars .
But China 's real problem is that it is running a persistent current - account surplus ; in order to keep the yuan closely tied to the dollar it has to keep buying more dollar assets .
If China really wants to reduce its exposure to the greenback it must allow the yuan to rise .
It would incur a loss on its existing reserves but stem future losses .
But so long as China maintains its current exchange - rate policy , it is , ironically , helping keep the dollar dominant .
The USA Today is reporting Bankruptcy filings rise to 6,000 a day as job losses take toll .
Consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings are on pace to reach a stunning 1.5 million this year , according to a report from Automated Access to Court Electronic Records .
While well below the record 2 million filings in 2005 , the number of filings is up sharply from last year 's 1.1 million , says Robert Lawless , professor of law at the University of Illinois .
Bankruptcy filings took a dramatic nose dive after a 2005 bankruptcy reform measure was signed into law to curb bankruptcy abuse and make it harder to erase debts .
" People are coming to us in much worse shape than they used to be , " says David Jones , president of the non-profit Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies .
" We used to be able to help 20 % to 25 % of people who came to us , and now we can only help 7 % to 8 % . "
Last month , commercial filings hit 376 a day , up from 255 in May 2008 .
Hartmarx , which manufactures and markets apparel , and Silicon Graphics , a manufacturer of computer workstations and storage products , were among the filers .
The wave of corporate bankruptcies will cause a secondary wave in consumer filings , says John Pottow , University of Michigan bankruptcy law professor .

Corporate Flight Attendant Cover Letter By Matthew C. Keegan
Writing a cover letter to send with your r�sum� can be both confusing and frustrating .
What exactly should you say ?
Are you saying too much ?
Are you only speaking about your needs vs. the company 's needs ?
Oh , what to do !
In this " short " piece , I will list some ideas on how to craft your cover letter .
I have also provided some important links -- for additional assistance -- particularly if you find yourself still needing outside help .
� Basics
Make sure you use exactly the same type of paper you use for your r�sum� .
White with white is best , business paper is strongly advised , especially paper containing 100 % cotton .
Cheap 20 lb. copier paper is a terrible idea !
A matching business envelope { #10} is acceptable .
Tri -fold your copies separately ; when you place the cover letter inside the envelope , make sure that the letter is shown first [ when you lift the flap of the envelope up ] followed by your r�sum� .
Fold it so that your name and contact information is the first thing the recruiter sees .
If you choose to use a kraft envelope make sure that is no smaller than 9x12 or bigger than 10x13 .
Place an attractive computer generated label on it with your return address shown appropriately .
If you must write on it , PRINT your information and do not be fancy .
Remember : you want the post office and the company 's mailroom to be able to read what you wrote !
Otherwise , important time may be lost in the process .
If you are emailing your information make sure that the job listing stipulates that attachments are okay .
If not , do n't you dare send attachments !
Instead , within the body of an email message you can write your cover letter [ a brief introduction ] and then cut and paste your r�sum� .
I cannot tell you how many files never get read when the person does not do as instructed .
You can also follow up and mail in a hard [ paper ] copy if an address is provided .
Beginnings
Match the header on your r�sum� with the header on your cover letter .
They can and do get separated !
An example header should look like this : Jane Doe 14 Star Lane Smithville , NC 27777 USA Telephone : 919-555-1212 Cell Phone : 919-555-1213 Email : jdoe@nc.rrs.com
Include your personal website address only if that information is valuable .
If you host a site that is weird , inflammatory , adult oriented , or otherwise controversial , simply do not expect any response from the company .
Put today 's date on the cover letter .
Next , include your contact 's information , which can include : Ms. Ellen Snow Human Resources Coordinator FlyByNight Aviation , Inc. 1234 Orville Wright Lane Serendipity , NC 27776
Your salutation comes next and should look like this -- Dear Ms. Snow : Body Keep in mind that your cover letter must not be lengthy .
You can say all that must be said in no more than three , maybe four , brief �paragraphs .
Here is a sample : Attached , please find a copy of my r�sum� for your review .
I am interested in the position of corporate flight attendant listed online at www.flybynight.com . �

Byes Sincerely , Jane Doe � Leave 3 - 4 lines from your " Sincerely " to your name .
Your closing should n't include other words including Regards [ too plain ] , Cheers ! [ too British ] , Love [ too personal ] , etc. Remember , this is a business letter .
In summation , keep it short and specific .
Have three or four main points you can emphasize about your strengths , particularly , those points which match with the points listed by the company in their job details .
In this particular case the candidate emphasized her culinary , language , and international travel experience , as well as her availability .
All four points were stressed in the company 's job listing : � " ... international jet operator is searching for an experienced cabin attendant .
This position involves serving our on demand charter clients from east coast locations to destinations in the U.S. and abroad .
Must have exceptional food service skills .
Current training with FACTS , FlightSafety or similar training vendor ; French or Spanish language skills : a plus ... �
You cannot avoid talking about yourself , but you can control how you talk about yourself .
�
Do not ... ... beg for an interview .
... mention money or benefits .
If the job listing " demands " that you list your salary requirements , simply state that salary is negotiable .
... overly boast about your skills : think about what the company 's needs are , do you think they care that you were the recipient of an NBAA scholarship ?
It is , however , okay to list scholarship awards on your r�sum� .
... name drop .
Unless , you already come highly recommended by someone they know and like .�
Your mentor may be well known in this industry , but not universally liked .
You can use them on your list of references , however .
Tying it all together , this is what your cover letter could look like : � Jane Doe 14 Star Lane Smithville , NC 27777 USA Telephone : 919-555-1212 Cell Phone : 919-555-1213 Email : jdoe@nc.rrs.com � � January 04 , 2007 � � � Ms. Ellen Snow Human Resources Coordinator FlyByNight Aviation , Inc. 1234 Orville Wright Lane Serendipity , NC 27776 � Re : Corporate Flight Attendant Opening [ this is optional , but it can be helpful especially if the company has multiple openings available . ]

On Halloween night , 1948 , a fog rolled in to blanket the town of Donora , Pennsylvania .
What came from that cloud was n't the ghosts of vengeful pirates , or horror movie zombies .
It was worse .
This was n't the first time the industrial town of 13,000 had been socked in by a brown , pollution tinged smog .
But this time the air had a peculiar , acrid smell .
Those who breathed the fog felt as if they were breathing fire .
It scorched their eyes , their throat , their lungs .
Still , Donora was a mill town .
Workers squinted against the bitter air and went on to their jobs .
That night , as people were walking back to their houses , some of them began to die .
Soon doctors ' offices were overrun and the hospital was filled with the sick and the dying .
The fog held on the next day .
And the next .
A local hotel was pressed into service as an extension to the hospital , with volunteers serving as nurses .
As bodies piled up at local funeral homes , the ground floor of that hotel became a makeshift morgue .
Within five days , twenty people had died .
Hundreds more were seriously injured with damage that would shorten their lives or affect their ability to work .
A decade later , local papers still told the story of lives cut short .
The villain in Donora was the a toxic stew spit out by a local zinc refinery .
It was n't the first time the plant 's fumes had turned the air around the town toxic , but this time a temperature inversion capped the smog .
In the midst of the crisis , suspicion about the cause brought town officials to the zinc works , where they asked that the plant 's operations be reduced until the weather changed .
The plant operators refused .
After five days , the inversion layer broke and the brown fog blew away .
Eleven of those who died did so on that final day .
A local doctor estimated that if the weather had held another day , the death toll would have been in the hundreds , rather than the tens .
That Sunday , as the sky broke and rains came , the zinc works finally agreed to reduce operations .
They went back to normal the next day .

February 1972 was cold and rainy in West Virginia .
Toward the end of the month , the last of winter 's wet snows melted down and for days rains fell almost continuously .
The miners and shopkeepers around the little town of Saunders went to their jobs with rain sluicing from their hats , and the children splashed home on muddy streets .
By the night of the 25th , the creek that ran alongside the town was running high and fast .
At 8 AM on the morning of the 26th , folks in Saunders were seeing their kids off to school , making their way to work , and frowning at another morning of rain .
They had only a moment to feel the rumble under their feet and hear the screaming roar that echoed through the town .
Then a 20 foot high wall of midnight black water swept through the narrow valley .
Buildings were crushed by the rushing wave as if they had be struck by God 's own hammer .
Trees did n't have time to be uprooted , they were simply snapped off at the ground .
The water caromed from one side of the valley to the other and back again , sweeping down homes and gouging the valley walls .
People were plucked from the streets before they could make sense of the thunderous sound .
Others went tumbling as their homes were torn from around them .
Cars , homes , sections of rail track , the shattered remains of stores , schools , and bodies -- they all joined the wall as it roared downstream into the town of Pardee .
And Lorado .
And Craneco .
And Stowe , Crites , Latrobe , Robinette , Amherstdale , Becco , Fanco , Braeholm , Accoville , Crown , and Kistler .
For minutes after the wall had passed , the cold February rain fell on a world that was silent except for the sound of water .
No birds singing .
No dogs barking .
No people talking .
There were only piles of debris and cold gray mud .
In a matter of minutes 125 were dead and 1,100 injured .
4,000 more were left homeless .
That wall of water had originated from a coal slurry dam , a rude impoundment of earth and stone built high in the valley of Buffalo Creek .
On the night before , workers at the mine responsible for the dam had noticed that water was straining the limits of the impoundment , and the dam was sagging under the force .
Officials of the company were notified .
They sent no warning to the people below .
Deputy sheriffs from the county came up the hill only hours before the dam burst , to ask if they should evacuate the towns .
They were sent away .

It was almost the end of the work day for the young workers at the corner of Greene Street and Washington Place in New York City on March 26 , 1911 .
Spring had been cool that year , and those getting ready to leave slid into coats and put on their hats .
Most of the workers employed by the firm of Harris & Blanck worked a different shift and went home at noon , but there were still six hundred workers -- 500 women and 100 men -- packed into the top three floors of the factory .
Most of them were immigrants from Italy , Germany , or Eastern Europe .
The majority of them were under the age of 16 .
For ten hours or more a day they bent over tightly packed rows of sewing machines and worked with their fingers to make the factory 's signature product -- shirtwaists .
Their shift ended at 4:45 .
At 4:40 , someone noticed the first touch of smoke .
Within half an hour , flames consumed the top three floors of the " fire proof " building .
Many of the workers on the eighth floor were able to escape down the steps , so were some of those working on nine .
Students next door at New York University saw what was happening and helped to save hundreds who reached the roof .
Then the flames cut off that route .
Soon those that remained were huddled next to the windows of those top three floors .
As the flames closed in on them , one after another , they jumped .
Along the sidewalks of Broadway , thousands cried and screamed in horror as the scorched bodies of women -- girls , really -- tore through inadequate fire safety nets , smashed though glass awnings , and thudded into the street .
Sobbing children with their clothing and hair on fire leaped for safety ladders that stopped two stories below their windows .
Fueled by miles of hanging fabric , wooden tables , and machine oil , the fire that started five minutes before the end of the shift burned out almost before firemen could get inside .
It left the building intact , the walls only scorched .
The bodies left behind were barely recognizable as human .
141 people died , hundreds more were injured .

And that 's how we lost our freedom .
Not our freedom of speech or any of our individual rights to assemble or worship as we please , to live where we want .
That 's where we lost the freedom of the marketplace , the freedom of the Ayn Randian dream .
Actually , it goes even further back than that .
When the nation was formed , those founding fathers made the " the American compromise , " recognizing that the marketplace should advance under government supervision .
This has always been a place where the government has stepped in to stop excess and address needs .
And yes , conservatives have been whining from day one .
Why is the United States " hamstrung by regulations " as so many conservative pundits have stated ?
Because of Donora , because of Buffalo Creek , because of the Triangle Factory .
Because when no one made companies do the right thing , the right thing did n't get done .
No matter how many Republicans want to misread Adam Smith , profit and worker protections are not allied .
If American workers are going to come home to their families day in and day out without losing an eye , or a limb , or their lives , it takes regulation .
No one implemented health , safety , and environmental legislation because they thought it would be fun .
We did n't do it because we hate corporations , because we wanted to make jobs for government bureaucrats , or out of some desire to snatch power away from states .
We did it because that kind of freedom , marketplace freedom , was literally killing us .
We put in the Clean Air Act because of incidents like that at Donora , because across the nation there were " black Mondays " and " black Tuesdays " and black every other day of the week when choking clouds of pollution brought midnight at noon .
We did it because lead from gasoline was saturating our environment .
We did it because " a clear day " should not be a rare event .
We instituted the Clean Water Act to regulate impoundments like the one that destroyed lives in West Virginia , to limit the pollution that saw the Cuyahoga river burn not once , but a dozen times .
It was done to save the waters of the Great Lakes , where pollution threatened the livelihood and the lives of all those on the shores .
We did it to make our drinking water safe .
We did it to make our rivers and lakes good places to fish and swim .
OSHA , MSHA , and workplace safety rules were put in place because of situations like that at the Triangle Factory .
Put in place because of the hundreds who died in steel mills and on construction sites .
Put in place to guard against mine disasters that killed 100 , 200 , 300 people at a time .
Those regulations were put in place to clean up workplaces where more than 20,000 Americans were dying from accidents each year .
We inspect food because it vastly reduces cases of trichinosis , salmonella , and other food borne diseases to the point where the worst of our recent failures are n't a patch on what was once commonplace .
We wear seatbelts because they protect our families .
We give children vaccinations because it saves millions of lives and untold misery .
And we put in place Social Security because without it almost half of America 's elderly would live in poverty .
Government moved into these areas not because they wanted more power over people 's lives .
It was done because we , we the people , asked that government take these steps .
In recent days there seems to be a trend , especially among those nodding along to Fox News , to look on every government worker as a leach on society .
Is there any term said with more innate disdain than government bureaucrat ?
When George W. Bush first ran for congress , he campaigned for the elimination of two government agencies -- OSHA and the EPA .
It 's a position that would draw many cheers from those pulling for Rick Perry 's rebellion today .
If there is one critical difference between the conservative and progressive view of the nation it is this : Conservatives believe that America became a vibrant , wealthy nation in spite of the government 's burden on business .
Progressives believe that the United States prospered because of a national effort to reign in the worst of corporate excess .
Over a century , we became a country with safety rules , with environmental regulations , with protection for the elderly .
Over that same century our economy and individual wealth outstripped both our historical bests and the record of the rest of the world .
Progressives see that as victory .
Conservatives call it coincidence .
It 's tempting to run the experiment of giving conservatives what they want .
A nation without environmental rules , without workplace safety rules , without any social safety nets .
Free them from the reign of bureaucrats and petty regulations .
Let them live in that place where the medicine you give your baby to ease her teething pains can be made with antifreeze .
Let them work in a mine where there is no regulation and thousands die each year .
Let them wonder if their next bite of food will put them among the 1.8 million who die horribly each year from severe food - borne cases of diarrhea .
Let them drive a car that will fall apart in the slightest collision .
Let them breath free air , untainted by government interference -- air you can really sink your teeth into .
Fortunately , we do n't have to run that experiment -- because we already did it .
That 's how we got where we are today .
All those areas of our lives became regulated , because left unregulated people overreached to unsafe , and frequently hideous degrees .
There would be no Clean Air Act if companies had controlled pollution on their own .
There 'd be no need to regulate banks , had they not demonstrate time and again that without supervisions they 'll chase short term profit into a pit -- and drag the rest of us after them .
America is n't the only example of this experiment .
This is an study that 's been made hundreds of time in hundreds of nations , and the absolute freedom of the marketplace always runs counter to the good of ordinary citizens .
Always .
Those places in the world with the fewest restrictions on business are not the places anyone would really want to live .
They 're not even good places to do business if your task is more complex than ripping resources out of the ground and shipping them to some place that 's safer .
Business and government must reach a compromise if either is to be effective .
Today 's conservatives are like yesterday 's socialists .
Yeah , they say , things look bad over there , and they used to be bad here , but those guys did n't run my perfect economic / political system the way it should be run .
Sure , every time we 've tried it before it brought on disaster , but this time for sure !
A few minor tweaks and this time it 'll be perfect .
This time , if we take away all the restrictions , companies will be good and the nation will really take off !
It 's really just the regulations that are stopping them from showing what they really can do .
For that I say , thank God .

Curious as to what Mickey Rourke is going to look like as Whiplash in next summer 's Iron Man 2 ?
Be curious no longer .
Whiplash ( Mickey Rourke ) sports a power pack on his chest that looks similar to the one used by Iron Man ( Robert Downey Jr. ) .
" The technologies are definitely related , and that 's part of the core theme of the film , " says director Jon Favreau .
The character 's alter ego , Ivan Vanko , is a Russian who , Favreau says , " has constructed his own version of a suit . "
Among the creative alterations : a pair of whips , powered by the suit 's glowing chest piece , expected to keep Iron Man cracking .
Whiplash " is going to light them up , " says Rourke .
This first image of the character shows the villain making an appearance at the Monaco Historic Grand Prix .
Resident Evil 5 is notorious for its stiff controls , frustrating partner - AI , obtuse interface , questionable quicktime events , and an incredibly silly storyline .
As one would expect , these elements do n’t make for the most compelling single - player experience .
However , the game ’s co-op mode is incredibly fun and rewarding .
The Standard Co-op Setup
Most action games encourage players to work together by turning a Prisoner ’s Dilemma into a Trust Dilemma , i.e. , making it so that helping each other out is always the most beneficial course of action for everyone involved .
To achieve this , friendly - fire and other possible sources of griefing are diminished or removed , enemies are tweaked to take on the firepower of multiple players , and player - goals are designed around non-competitive challenges , e.g. , everyone gets an achievement for defeating the boss instead of one person getting an achievement for the most kills .
Healing a defenseless comrade is another common mechanic that ensures players try to help each other out .
Letting a partner die diminishes the chance of success — or can even result in a game - over screen — so all members of a team can usually depend on friendly aid .
This in turn fosters a reciprocal relationship facilitated by special indicators that display the location and status of everyone else in the group .
Forcing gameplay - cooperation at specific script - points is common as well , e.g. , having one player boost another to higher ground in order to proceed .
While these sound good on paper , such statically - defined activities are rarely as satisfying as letting the players come up with their own strategy for traversing a level .
With that said , scripted gateways serve to differentiate the gameplay and ensure that each player feels like part of the team .
All of these co-op elements are present in RE5 , but there are many more as well .
All The Extras
A great example of something that ’s conducive to cooperative play is RE5 ’s shared - healing mechanic .
Whenever any healing item is used ( except for the eggs ) , both characters get healed if they ’re standing close to each other .
This encourages players to communicate and plan rendezvous points in order to get the most value out of their reserves .
Communication is also made easier by the fact that all firearms come equipped with laser sights .
Laser sights allow players to point directly at areas of interest simply by aiming at them .
The visible laser - pointers reduce the amount of explaining needed for proper communication , and they ’re cleverly implemented as they give a secondary function to an existing mechanic .
Another interesting element is that both players must activate the map - exit in order to transition to the next area .
Some players complained about this being a bit inconvenient , but I personally thought it was a great decision .
Having a loading screen suddenly pop into view while sniping an enemy can be quite jarring .
The wait mechanic prevents this from happening , and it allows both players to fully explore each area without feeling rushed .
Whenever one player activates the exit , his point - of - view also swirls around to show his teammate .
This is a neat little touch as it informs the player to the whereabouts of his partner , which in turn let ’s him quickly decide whether to stick around at the exit or go back into the field .
Money is another important asset in RE5 , and here the game takes a cue from a various co-op RPGs .
In order to prevent players from squabbling over treasure , both players simply receive the full monetary value of each collectible .
While this is definitely not realistic , it prevents anyone from worrying about splitting the loot and keeps the focus on the action .
Finally , the level and enemy designs make it beneficial to communicate and devise on - the - spot tactics .
Maps tend to be closed off arenas with multiple paths , and they allow players to split up and cover each other from different vantage points .
This is especially important when fighting the more powerful enemies as attacking them from alternating directions helps expose their weak spots .
The above mechanics enhance the standard cooperative template , but there ’s one more element that makes RE5 special .
From Good To Great
Each player has a 9 - slot inventory , and all items take up a single slot .
Some items can stack within a slot as well , but only up to a point .
While this might seem like plenty of space , the real estate is at a constant premium .
The weapons in RE5 are differentiated by their damage output , area of effect , firing rate , range , penetration , clip size , and chance of scoring a critical hit .
The enemies and environments are well tuned to these attributes , creating situations where one firearm is much more useful than the others .
Since each weapon also requires a custom ammo-type , it ’s impossible for a single player to hoard all the goodies .
Instead , each player must take on a specialized role .
For example , one player keeps a group of enemies at bay with a shotgun while the other snipes some archers in the background .
Or one player pilots a vehicle while the other showers fast - moving opponents with a semi-automatic .
Or one player leads a boss up a path with some explosive barrels , while the other uses his handgun to blow them up from above .
In addition to the standard firearms , though , the inventories must also accommodate healing items , armour jackets , and miscellaneous other collectibles such as proximity bombs and stun rods .
It ’s very easy to fill up the available slots , but the ability to trade items alleviates the issue .
Trading also encourages additional cooperation , especially when one player ’s path leads him to stacks of ammo for the other player ’s weapons .
Although enemies never drop ammunition for weapons neither of the players possess , forking paths often force players to collect items they do n’t really want .
This in turn creates a unique flow to the game : an area is entered , its enemies are dispatched , the players scavenge for loot , and finally they regroup to heal up , trade , and get ready for the next challenge .
The pattern does n’t keep the players tightly tethered together , but it always brings them back to help each other out .
Like most co-op games , RE5 ultimately needs players to cooperate with each other ; progress ca n’t be made if one person refuses to play along .
If both people are on the same page , though , the game ’s rich tactics and inter- player interactions elevate it above the co-op modes of its contemporaries .
Life inside the Vestas protest , including exclusive footage from the men occupying the building
guardian.co.uk
Workers occupying a wind turbine factory on the Isle of Wight vowed to continue their protest for another week today after a legal attempt to evict them quickly failed .
For the past nine days , about 20 workers have occupied the Vestas Wind Systems plant near Newport , which is due to close tomorrow .
The company sought a possession order at Newport county court today in an attempt to remove the workers from the factory , where 625 staff are set to lose their jobs .
But , adjourning the hearing until Tuesday , the judge , Graham White , said papers had not been properly served on individuals occupying the property .
Papers were served last Thursday to Mark Smith , the one worker that the factory 's Danish owners know for certain is occupying the factory .
In the court papers , Vestas named 13 individuals and " persons unknown " it believed had occupied the office space in the building .
Three of those are now thought to have left .
However , Adam Rosenthal , representing Vestas , conceded the company could not be sure who else had barricaded themselves inside the property .
Urging the judge to use his discretion to fast - track the possession order , Rosenthal said " emotions are running high " at the factory and there was a real risk of disturbance .
He said the police presence at the site was evidence of the risk of disorder .
Judge
White dismissed that argument , saying : " I see no evidence of any threat of violence to property or person by reason of the individuals who are occupying the property remaining there . "
The judge added he was " distinctly uncomfortable " with the way the company was seeking to bring proceedings , which he described as an attempt to " get around the rules " .
" I am not satisfied that any named person other than Mark Smith has been personally served , " he said .
The adjournment resulted in celebrations for the occupying workers , who were told by mobile phone .
They had expected bailiffs to arrive soon after court proceedings .
" Everyone in here went absolutely ballistic , " said one of the workers inside .
" It 's given us another week to spread the word and given our legal team time to strengthen the case . "
Although , he conceded that another six nights in the factory was " not a pleasant thought " .
Outside the court , about 200 protesters – an alliance of local workers and environmental activists from the mainland – also celebrated .
" We have just heard that the case has been adjourned to 4 August , " Steve Stotesbury , a 29 - year - old blade maker , announced to the crowd .
" As we have said from the outset , this is a peaceful demonstration . "
He added : " We 're extremely jubilant .
This was the decision we were hoping for .
It goes to show the fight is not over . "
Workers at the site have recently signed up to the National Union of Rail , Maritime and Transport Workers ( RMT ) , which is supporting their campaign .
The union said today that its general secretary , Bob Crow , was meeting the energy secretary , Ed Miliband , to discuss the situation .
Crow will then travel to the island to address the rally camping outside the factory .
" No one should underestimate the significance of the court throwing out Vestas ' repossession application today , " said Crow .
" This is a significant victory which gives us more time to build the global campaign to save Vestas . "
More activists connected with the protest network Climate Camp joined the protest today , but not in the numbers the group had hoped for .
However , the dispute is proving embarrassing for the energy secretary , who a fortnight ago pledged to install 10,000 wind turbines by 2020 .
The government has also promised to create thousands of " green jobs " of the kind that are being lost with the closure of the Vestas factory .
The company has said it is moving production of its blades to the United States because the market in the UK is not growing fast enough .
Vestas has been criticised for the way it informed the protesting workers that they had been sacked .
The termination letters were delivered to the factory beneath slices of pizza .

Town halls gone wild
Screaming constituents , protesters dragged out by the cops , congressmen fearful for their safety — welcome to the new town - hall - style meeting , the once - staid forum that is rapidly turning into a house of horrors for members of Congress .
On the eve of the August recess , members are reporting meetings that have gone terribly awry , marked by angry , sign - carrying mobs and disruptive behavior .
In at least one case , a congressman has stopped holding town hall events because the situation has spiraled so far out of control .

“ I had felt they would be pointless , ” Rep. Tim Bishop ( D - N.Y. ) told POLITICO , referring to his recent decision to temporarily suspend the events in his Long Island district .
“ There is no point in meeting with my constituents and [ to ] listen to them and have them listen to you if what is basically an unruly mob prevents you from having an intelligent conversation . ”
In Bishop ’s case , his decision came on the heels of a June 22 event he held in Setauket , N.Y. , in which protesters dominated the meeting by shouting criticisms at the congressman for his positions on energy policy , health care and the bailout of the auto industry .
Within an hour of the disruption , police were called in to escort the 59 - year - old Democrat — who has held more than 100 town hall meetings since he was elected in 2002 — to his car safely .
“ I have no problem with someone disagreeing with positions I hold , ” Bishop said , noting that , for the time being , he was using other platforms to communicate with his constituents .
“ But I also believe no one is served if you ca n’t talk through differences . ”
Bishop is n’t the only one confronted by boiling anger and rising incivility .
At a health care town hall event in Syracuse , N.Y. , earlier this month , police were called in to restore order , and at least one heckler was taken away by local police .
Close to 100 sign - carrying protesters greeted Rep. Allen Boyd ( D - Fla . ) at a late June community college small - business development forum in Panama City , Fla .
Last week , Danville , Va. , anti-tax tea party activists claimed they were “ refused an opportunity ” to ask Rep. Thomas Perriello ( D - Va. ) a question at a town hall event and instructed by a plainclothes police officer to leave the property after they attempted to hold up protest signs .
The targets in most cases are House Democrats , who over the past few months have tackled controversial legislation including a $ 787 billion economic stimulus package , a landmark energy proposal and an overhaul of the nation ’s health care system .
Democrats , acknowledging the increasing unruliness of the town - hall - style events , say the hot - button issues they are taking on have a lot to do with it .
“ I think it ’s just the fact that we are dealing with some of the most important public policy issues in a generation , ” said Rep. Bruce Braley ( D - Iowa ) , who was confronted by a protester angry about his position on health care reform at a town hall event several weeks ago .
“ I think in general what is going on is we are tackling issues that have been ignored for a long time , and I think that is disruptive to a lot of people , ” said Bishop , a four - term congressman .
“ We are trying , one by one , to deal with a set of issues that ca n’t be ignored , and I think that ’s unsettling to a lot of people . ”
Freshman Rep. Dan Maffei ( D - N.Y. ) , whose event at a Syracuse middle school was disrupted , said that he still planned to hold additional town halls but that he was also thinking about other options .
“ I think you ’ve got to communicate through a variety of different ways .
You should do the telephone town hall meetings .
You should do the town hall meetings .
You should do the smaller group meetings , ” said Maffei .
“ It ’s important to do things in a variety of ways , so you do n’t have one mode of communication . ”
“ You ’re going to have people of varying views , and in this case , you ’ve got the two extremes who were the most vocal , ” Maffei said of the flare - up at his July 12 event .
On Tuesday , Rep. Chris Van Hollen ( D - Md. ) , who handles incumbent retention duties for House Democrats in addition to chairing the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , met with freshman members to discuss their plans for the monthlong August recess .
While the specific issue of town hall protesters never came up , according to sources familiar with the meeting , he urged them not to back away from opponents .
“ He said , ‘ Go on offense .
Stay on the offense .
It ’s really important that your constituents hear directly from you .
You should n’t let a day go by [ that ] your constituents do n’t hear from you , ’ ” said one House Democratic leadership aide familiar with the meeting .
Some members profess to enjoy the give - and - take of the town halls , even if lately it ’s become more take than give .
“ Town halls are a favorite part of my job , ” said Rep. Russ Carnahan ( D - Mo. ) , a third - term congressman from St. Louis who noted that a “ handful ” of disruptions had taken place at his meetings .
“ It ’s what I do .
It ’s what I will continue to do . ”
“ People have gotten fired up and all that , but I think that ’s what makes town halls fun , ” said Perriello , a freshman who is among the most vulnerable Democrats in 2010 .
“ I think that most of the time when we get out there , it ’s a good chance for people to vent and offer their thoughts .
It ’s been good . ”
“ I enjoy it , and people have a chance to speak their mind , ” he said .
Both Carnahan and Perriello said they were plunging forward with plans to hold more town hall meetings .
Republicans , with an eye toward 2010 , are keeping close track of the climate at Democratic events .
“ We ’ve seen Russ Carnahan , we ’ve seen Tim Bishop , we ’ve seen some other people face some very different crowds back home , ” said National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Pete Sessions ( R - Texas ) .
“ The days of you having a town hall meeting where maybe 15 or 20 of your friends show up — they ’re over .
You ’ve now got real people who are showing up — and that ’s going to be a factor . ”
Asked later how or whether the GOP would use the confrontations against Democrats , Sessions responded : “ Wait till next year . ”
But Democrats are quick to point out they ’re not the only ones facing hostile audiences .
They single out Rep. Mike Castle ( R - Del. ) , who found himself in a confrontation earlier this month with a “ birther ” protester , and insist that Republicans face a backlash of their own if it appears the party is too closely aligned with tea party activists or other conservative - oriented protesters .
“ It ’s a risk that they align themselves with such a small minority in the party , ” said Brian Smoot , who served as political director at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the past election cycle .
“ They risk alienating moderates . ”
Clarification : While Bishop has temporarily suspended town hall meetings , he continues to hold other constituent events and will once again hold town halls in late August .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
In the wake of hurricanes Katrina and Rita , the Federal Emergency Management Agency was slow to address early signs of formaldehyde problems in emergency housing and overstated actions it was taking to address the problem , according to a report released Thursday by a federal inspector general .
A federal report released Thursday criticizes FEMA 's response to formaldehyde problems in trailers .
The highly critical 80 - page report paints the picture of an agency that was overly concerned with its image to the detriment of the public .
FEMA , the report says , reacted to the formaldehyde health threat only after media attention " grew to disturbing levels " and once delayed testing so the agency could " develop a public communications strategy " for the public and the media .
Although federal tests found formaldehyde in emergency housing in October of 2005 , just two months after Katrina , most of the tests were n't done until two years later , during winter when formaldehyde levels are lowest , the report says .
" Because of the delays , the test results may have underestimated the extent of formaldehyde exposure that residents had experienced , " it says .
The report is the latest to address the federal government 's response to Katrina and Rita , when FEMA faced the biggest challenge in the agency 's history , trying to relocate many of the estimated 700,000 people displaced by the Gulf Coast storms .
Some people were housed in hotels and apartments .
But others were placed in more than 200,000 travel trailers , mobile homes and temporary , two - bedroom shelters known as " park models . "
Almost immediately , some residents began complaining of health problems , attributing it to formaldehyde , a strong - smelling gas that is federal authorities say is believed to cause cancer .
In October of 2005 , shortly after the storms , federal officials cautioned government workers to limit their time in travel trailers , but a similar warning was not give to the trailers ' new inhabitants .
The following March , a Biloxi , Mississippi , television station reported on a local couple who were having formaldehyde problems with their FEMA trailer .
The inspector general 's report chronicles initial efforts to address the problem .
" FEMA officials did make some attempts to identify the extent of the formaldehyde problem , but they did so by trying to get an accurate tally of complaints from occupants rather than testing occupied units , " the report says .
The inspector general 's report says that , in hindsight , a number of factors created a " perfect storm " for development of formaldehyde problems after Katrina .
One prime factor , the report said , was that before Katrina and Rita , " complaints about formaldehyde levels in FEMA trailers had not surfaced and , therefore , FEMA officials were unaware that this should have been an issue of concern . "
Among other factors :
• All of the units were some form of manufactured housing , which tend to have more manufactured wood products that can emit the gas .
• Most of the trailers were hurried from factories to the Gulf , and did n't have time to release dangerous gases before being occupied .
• The trailers were placed in hot , humid climates , increasing formaldehyde levels .
• And high numbers of children , the elderly , and people with prior health problems were living in FEMA trailers .
All three groups have heightened sensitivity to formaldehyde .
The report was released by Richard Skinner , the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security .
DHS is FEMA 's parent department .
In the report , FEMA officials said the document " does not adequately emphasize the compelling fact that there were no established formaldehyde standards for travel trailers . "
The inspector general agreed that there is a lack of standards .
In a statement Thursday , FEMA spokesman Clark Stevens said FEMA " agrees with the Inspector General 's findings " and has already made great progress in developing policies and actions to address concerns about formaldehyde emissions .

OAKLAND , California ( CNN ) -- Richard
Lee greets students , shopkeepers and tourists as he rolls his wheelchair down Broadway at the speed of a brisk jog , hailing them with , " Hi. How ya doin ' ? "
Marijuana activist Richard Lee is a local celebrity in the small district of Oakland , California , called Oaksterdam .
In this nine - block district of Oakland , California , called Oaksterdam , Lee is a celebrity .
Oaksterdam is Lee 's brainchild , a small pocket of urban renewal built on a thriving trade in medical marijuana .
The district 's name comes from a marriage of Oakland and Amsterdam , a city in the Netherlands renowned for its easy attitude toward sex and drugs .
Lee is the founder of Oaksterdam University , which he describes as a trade school that specializes in all things marijuana : how to grow it , how to market it , how to consume it .
The school , which has a curriculum , classes and teachers , claims 3,500 graduates .
Lee also owns a medical marijuana dispensary , a coffee house , a large indoor marijuana plantation , and a museum / store devoted to the cause of legalizing marijuana .
" I really see this as following the history of alcohol .
The way prohibition was repealed there , " Lee says , adding that he believes he is close to achieving his mission .
Lee is organizing a petition drive to place a marijuana legalization measure on the ballot in 2010 , and he thinks the measure stands a good chance of being approved by voters .

The case for and against legalized pot , an AC 360 special .
Friday 10 p.m. see full schedule »
A recent California Field
Poll showed that more than half the people in the state , where marijuana for medical use was approved more than a decade ago , would approve of decriminalizing pot .
The state 's faltering economy is one reason why .
If legalized , marijuana could become California 's No. 1 cash crop .
It could bring in an estimated $ 1 billion a year in state taxes .
Democratic State Assemblyman Tom Ammiano is spearheading a cannabis legalization bill in the California Assembly .
He believes the state 's need to increase tax revenues will work in his bill 's favor .
" I think it 's a seductive part of the equation , " he says .
Ammiano says there are a number of ways legalized pot could be marketed , " It could be a Walgreens , it could be a hospital , a medical marijuana facility , whatever could be convenient .
Adequate enforcement of the rules .
Nobody under 21 .
No driving under the influence . "
Even California 's Republican governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , says legalizing marijuana deserves serious consideration .
" I think we ought to study very carefully what other countries are doing that have legalized marijuana , " Schwarzenegger says .
But Ammiano says selling a legalized marijuana bill to his fellow legislators remains a delicate matter .
" If we held the vote in the hallway , we'd have it done , " Ammiano says .
" But people are necessarily cautious .
They are up for re-election . "
And that is why Lee believes voters will approve a marijuana initiative long before the state Assembly acts .
Sitting under grow lights in a warehouse filled with hundreds of marijuana plants , Lee sums it up this way : " For some people cannabis is like a religion .
As passionate as some people are about their religions and freedom to think what they want and to worship as they want . "
But all of that is baloney to Paul Chabot .
He is president of the Coalition for a Drug Free California .
He says voters should not be fooled by promises of big bucks flowing to the state from marijuana taxes .
" It 's their way of sort of desensitizing our communities , our state and our nation to a drug problem that we clearly need to put our foot down on , and say , ' No more .
Enough is enough . ' "
Chabot points out that California 's medical marijuana law has been poorly regulated , and he expects more of the same if marijuana becomes legalized for everyone .
But a substantial number of Californians seem to believe that no amount of enforcement is going to make pot go away -- and that it 's time for the state to begin taking a cut of the action .

A reduction in global oil production capacity will mean that higher future oil price will be attained at a lower level of demand than in 2008 .
Is another oil price spike on the way ?
One thing that was anticipated in the run up to peak oil was that the oil price would become volatile .
Volatility leads to uncertainty creating difficulties for national governments , economic planning agencies and oil companies to plan ahead .
One consequence of this has been the postponement of many large new oil field developments creating concern that future supplies may be insufficient to meet demand leading to a new oil price crunch in the years ahead .
So what is the right price for oil ?
To what extent can market mechanisms be relied upon to strike the right price ?
Is it possible to make sense of the volatile price signal shown in Figure 1 ?
Figure 1 Global total liquids from the IEA , data compilation kindly provided by Rembrandt Koppelaar .
Oil price data from Economagic .
All data are month averages .
Last year Phil Hart provided us with a model to explain the relationship between oil supply , demand and price ( Figure 2 ) .
Put simply , demand is inelastic in that it does not vary much owing to price variations alone - we still drive our cars even though it gets more expensive to do so .
Supply used to be elastic ( the flat part of the supply curve ) , higher prices easily translating to higher supply .
In the real world this meant OPEC opening the taps on spare capacity .
But then in 2004 the supply rules changed .
OPEC spare capacity effectively fell to zero ( Figure 1 ) and new supply became inelastic ( steep part of the curve ) , i.e. higher prices did not lead to a ready flow of new oil since new capacity had to be built , at great expense , using expensive energy .
The result was escalating prices and the spike of 2008 .
Figure 2 Phil Hart 's oil price , supply , demand model .
Somewhat surprisingly ( for me at least ) cross plotting the data from Figure 1 , provides a picture that is still consistent with Phil 's simple model ( Figure 3 ) .
To understand Figure 3 , the blue line is a time line , charting the evolution of supply / demand and price since January 2002 through to June 2009 .
Once production hit 84 mmbpd ( million barrels per day ) the plateau was effectively reached and expanding capacity in the face of 4.5 % annual decline became an arduous task .
Prices rose to keep supply and demand in balance until the peak in July 2008 when the economic crisis took hold leading to a collapse in demand .
Figure 3
Monthly oil production data ( from the IEA provided by Rembrandt Koppelaar ) and monthly average oil price data from economagic fit Phil Hart 's simple model .
The return path since July 2008 is shown in light blue .
Marks at one month intervals .
Following the time line down from the July 2008 peak , the oil price overshot its mark by about $ 40 , but since then it seems to have been correcting back towards the trend set during the ascent .
First , the price stabilised at $ 40 , tracking left as demand continued to fall .
And then demand stabilised at about 84 mmbpd and the price rose from 40 to over $ 70 per barrel .
The June 2009 position is within the trend set during the price ascent of 2006 and 2007 , and on this basis I 'd conclude that we have seen a correction back towards market equilibrium rather than a " dead cat bounce " in oil price .
The integrity of this trend from January 2002 to June 2009 is surprising since there have been large movements in OPEC spare capacity , which is adjusted to maintain supply in balance with demand .
I suspect the fundamental reason to explain this is that global production capacity has remained fairly constant throughout this period .
If there was to be a dramatic increase or decrease in productive capacity then this trend would break down
So that leaves the $ 60,000 question .
Where next for the oil price ?
I believe that plateau supply of 84 to 88 mmbpd are secure for a couple of years as this summary of mega- projects compiled by Tony suggests ( Figure 4 ) .
Therefore , the near term price will be controlled by demand .
If the trend of Figure 3 holds good , then we could expect prices to rise towards $ 80 / bbl if demand rises by 2 mmbpd ( likely spiking higher than that ) or conversely falling to below $ 40 / bbl if demand drops a further 2 mmbpd , which is the scenario considered by Rune last month .
Figure 4 TOD megaprojects production capacity forecast compiled by Tony Erikson .
Longer term , productive capacity will begin to play a role and one can envisage how a fall in capacity of around 1 mmbpd may shift the supply demand relationship to the left .
Combined with marginal growth in demand will result in a new price spike as shown in Figure 5 .
It is impossible to be precise on timing , but my best guess would be 2012 ± 2 years , subject to the global banking system surviving the current crisis and the global economy resuming growth in 2010 .
Figure 5 Scenario showing how a drop in productive capacity of around 1 mmbpd may move the supply curve to the left , combined with an increase in demand from 84 to 86.5 mmbpd , may result in a new oil price spike in excess of that seen in July 2008 .
Squiggly line is real data from Figure 3 .
In a recent post I argued that there was a limit to the oil price that the global economy can bear .
Any new price spike , as the name suggests , will be short lived as high price will kill demand and we will likely see a repeat performance of the 2008 crisis .
At some point global leaders need to awaken to the prospect of that supply curve marching to the left , always .

No doubt Ireland has been the victim of a savagely tight monetary policy - given its specific needs .

It seems as though the more attention 4 chan attracts -- and it's been attracting plenty of late -- the more trouble the notorious den of mischief makers has staying online .
Coincidence ?
Probably not .
The main 4 chan site is inaccessible at the moment and apparently has been kaput for going on 24 hours .
" Still being DDoSed and spammed to hell and back .
What else is new ? " lamented 4 chan impresario " moot " on his status update page just after noon Tuesday .
That 's the last word from him .
The site also suffered a serious DDoS attack in May , although it was somewhat self - inflicted .
Over the holiday weekend , 4 chan users were being cited as the source of a prank that flooded Twitter with fake accounts and interjected into that site 's " trending topics " section a rather crude subject having to do with primate anatomy .
Six weeks ago it was a porn attack against YouTube .
Earlier this year the target was a TIME magazine online poll that was manipulated to anoint " moot " the planet 's most influential person .
This morning the 4 chan community is not laughing .
From Twitter :
" 4chan withdrawal sucks . "
" 4chan is DDOS 'd to hell ; it 's cyber terrorism I tells ya . "
" I need mah 4 chan . "

COULD biodiversity protect humans from disease ?
Conservationists have long suspected it might , and now they have the evidence to back this up .
Keeping complex ecosystems intact is thought to pay big dividends , by preserving natural balances among species that keep animal diseases in check .
These includes zoonoses – animal diseases that affect humans .

US commanders in Afghanistan are n't the only ones worried that civilian deaths are costing them hearts and minds .
The Taliban , which has planted bombs in schools and occasionally burned its opponents alive , has put out a new code of conduct for militants that appears to be an attempt to project a softer image to the Afghan people .
The little blue booklet , " The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan 's Rules for Mujahideen , " is sort of a Scouts codee for the Taliban .
Approved by Mullah Omar , titular head of the Afghan Taliban .
Mujahideen or " holy warriors " are urged not to discriminate on the basis of ethnicity and to always behave " properly " with civilians .
Suicide - bombing should only be used on high - value targets , and avoiding civilian casualties is paramount , the booklet says .
" Every member of the Mujahideen must do their best to avoid civilian deaths , civilian injuries and damage to civilian property .
Great care must be taken , " the booklet urges Taliban fighters .
" Suicide attacks should only be used on high and important targets .
A brave son of Islam should not be used for lower and useless targets . "
Yet on Friday , the United Nations reported surging civilian casualties in Afghanistan and said that in the first six months of the year Taliban fighters were responsible for 595 civilian deaths ( as opposed to 309 civilians killed by US and allied forces ) , up from 495 in the same period last year .
Taliban factions hard to control
Analysts say that Mullah Omar is legitimately concerned about the impact of civilian deaths on his group 's image , but that the book also appears to represent an effort to stamp his authority on an increasingly factionalized movement .
" It 's very clear even to the Taliban that their present brutal tactics are not having the effect they want and they have lost support , " says Fahim Dashty , editor of the Kabul Weekly .
But he adds that enforcing the code will be very difficult since the Taliban is no longer a monolithic entity and is instead divided into several autonomous factions whose tolerance for brutal tactics varies .
Prakhar Sharma , research head at the Afghan Centre for Conflict and Peace Studies ( CAPS ) sees the booklet as an attempt to " centralize the insurgency . "
Not only is the Taliban factionalized , but there are " a lot of criminal gangs who portray themselves as the Taliban so they end up doing things Taliban do n't subscribe to . "
The book forbids , for instance , the common practice of kidnap for ransom .
US dismisses book as propagandaThe booklet 's existence was first reported by Al Jazeera on Monday though it was initially released in May .
US and Afghan officials have dismissed its contents as propaganda .
Its release comes as the country gears up for presidential elections , which the Taliban have said they will oppose .
NATO and Afghan forces are also locked in heavy battles with the Taliban in an operation centred in the Helmand province .
Sharma says that signals from the West that it may be willing to negotiate with the Taliban may have prompted Mullah Omar to release the book as a signal that he remains the key Taliban leader .
He also says the Taliban may be trying to show that they 're an acceptable alternative to the present government whom they have denounced as collaborators .
Copies of the 13 - chapter booklet have been obtained in Pakistan .
Rahimullah Yusufzai , the Peshawar bureau chief of the English language daily The News , says the booklet is likely being published there given the practical difficulties of doing so in Taliban - controlled parts of Afghanistan .
But while the Taliban are trying to put their best foot forward , some of the specific advice for their members is alarming .
For instance , a responsible holy warrior is reminded to refrain from disfiguring civilians .
Abbas Noyan , an Afghan parliamentarian , dismisses the booklet , saying that the proof of the Taliban 's intentions lie in their actions .
" I do n't think they want to follow the way of normal human beings or respect human rights .
This is all just a show . "
Lt. Cmdr. Christine Sidenstricker , US military spokeswoman in Kabul , told CNN , " The long and the short of it is , they do n't operate in accordance to their code of conduct . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Saying the new H1N1 virus is “ unstoppable ” , the World Health Organization gave drug makers a full go - ahead to manufacture vaccines against the pandemic influenza strain on Monday and said healthcare workers should be the first to get one .
Scientists work on developing the H1N1 ( Influenza A ) vaccine inside a Bio-safety Level 3 ( BSL - 3 ) lab at Sillapakorn University on the outskirts of Bangkok , July 12 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Chaiwat Subprasom
Every country will need to vaccinate citizens against the swine flu virus and must choose who else would get priority after nurses , doctors and technicians , said Dr. Marie - Paule Kieny , WHO director of the Initiative for Vaccine Research .
Several reports showed the new virus attacks people differently than seasonal flu -- affecting younger people , the severely obese and seemingly healthy adults , and causing disease deep in the lungs .
Kieny briefed reporters on the findings of the WHO ’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization , or SAGE .
“ The committee recognized that the H1N1 pandemic ... is unstoppable and therefore that all countries need access to vaccine , ” Kieney said .
“ The SAGE recognized first that healthcare workers should be immunized in all countries in order to retain a functional health system as the virus evolves , ” she added .
After that , each country should decide who is next in line , based on the virus ’s unusual behavior .
Seasonal influenza is deadly enough -- each year it is involved in 250,000 to 500,000 deaths globally .
But most are the elderly or those with some kind of chronic disease that makes them more vulnerable to flu , such as asthma .
ELDERLY ADVANTAGE
The elderly seem to have some extra immunity to this new H1N1 , which is a mixture of two swine viruses , one of which also contains genetic material from birds and humans .
It is a very distant cousin of the H1N1 virus that caused the 1918 pandemic that killed 50 million to 100 million people .
A study published in the journal Nature on Monday confirmed that the blood of people born before 1920 carries antibodies to the 1918 strain , suggesting their immune systems remember a childhood infection .
The work by Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka also supports other studies that this new H1N1 strain does not stay in the nose and throat , as do most seasonal viruses .
“ The H1N1 virus replicates significantly better in the lungs , ” Kawaoka said .
Other studies have also shown it can cause gastrointestinal effects , and that it targets people not usually thought of as being at high risk .
“ Obesity has been observed to be one of the risk factors for more severe reaction to H1N1 ” -- something never before seen , Kieny added .
It is not clear if obese people may have undiagnosed health problems that make them susceptible , or if obesity in and of itself is a risk .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
On Friday , a team at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the University of Michigan reported that nine out of 10 patients treated in an intensive care unit there were obese .
They also had unusual symptoms such as blood clots in the lungs and multiple organ failure .
None have recovered and three died .
The CDC estimates at least a million people are infected in the United States alone and clinics everywhere are advised not to test each and every patient , so keeping an accurate count of cases will be impossible .
The United States has documented 211 deaths and WHO counted 429 early last week .
Kieny said WHO would also work to get better viruses for companies from which to make vaccines .
She said the strains that had been distributed did not grow very well in chicken eggs -- used to make all flu vaccines .
One exception -- AstraZeneca ’s MedImmune unit makes a live virus vaccine that is squirted up the nose and it is easier to produce , Kieny said .
WHO said countries should continue with their normal vaccination programs against seasonal flu .
Kieny said the seasonal H3N2 strain was also very active now in the southern hemisphere ’s winter .
Sanofi-Aventis , Novartis , Baxter , Schering - Plough ’s Nobilon , GlaxoSmithKline , Solvay , CSL and AstraZeneca ’s MedImmune are among those working on flu vaccines .
Right before going to bed last night , Perez Hilton and John Mayer shared a heated exchange on , well , Twitter of course .
" From the heart , " Mayer writes to Perez , " what you experienced these last 24 hrs is a profound lack of control .
You can't blog the world , my friend . "
The argument consisted of over a dozen saucy back - and - forth posts .
Perez tirelessly defends his honor while Mayer suggests better ways Perez could have handled the situation with Will .
I. Am , going as far as to cite rules of the Israeli martial art , Krav Maga .
Here 's a taste :
Mayer : Perez Hilton 's video statement is so long that by the end of it his cut healed .
Perez :
That 's real funny !
Ha ha !
And I 'm sure you also think I " deserved " to get hit !
Mayer : I also want to train you in an old martial art called " Never Call A Black Dude a F * * got Jitsu . "
Perez : Dude , I get it .
I GET IT .
But it 's not f**king funny to me .
Karma would be me losing my site and going bankrupt or what have u .
And as if the whole world coming down on the sassy blogger were n't enough , Mayer tops off his beef by calling Perez a " dumb sh*t . "
Wow .
Who knew John Mayer had it in him ?
And really , what creates " buzz " better than some kind of riot , or stampede ?
Or people running screaming away from fires ?
That 's the lesson we 've learned from these fine examples :
So you need to create some instant excitement for your company , or product .
You need to shake things up .
You need to create buzz .
5 Oprah Gives Away Free Chicken
KFC ( now having officially dropped its slave name " Kentucky Fried Chicken " ) decided in May of 2009 to promote its new grilled chicken by giving it away for free .
Wanting to keep their promotion subtle and discreet , they did the announcement on the show of a little - known entertainer named Oprah Winfrey .

What Went Wrong
With a hilariously tragic lack of foresight , KFC underestimated both the all - encompassing influence of Oprah and the subtle racism of using a black spokeswoman to sell chicken .
They apparently did n't realize the Mighty O reigns over the kind of media empire previously only seen under the thumb of Richard Dawson in The Running Man , so when she told viewers they could print out a voucher for free lunch at KFC on the May 5th episode of her talk show , America shit a rainbow so large it could be seen from space .
Approximately 16 million people printed out the Winfrey - approved coupon and showed up at KFCs nationwide to pry their free chicken from Colonel Sanders 's cold dead fingers .
The fast food chain was overwhelmingly unprepared and ran out of product before lunchtime ( evidently their market research suggested that the average citizen does n't like chicken and hates not having to pay for things ) .

Angry customers in New York , outraged that their demands to complain to Sanders directly were dismissed as both " impossible " and " moronic , " responded by starting mini-riots and sit-ins .
Managers at some locations maneuvered around the debacle by telling customers they could n't accept any coupons ending with the serial numbers " 1234 , " which incidentally consisted of every PDF copy of the coupon in existence .
KFC also hilariously included the arbitrary restriction that the coupons could n't be used on Mother 's Day , which makes us think their CEO is in some kind of wacky Major League situation where somehow he makes a fortune only if he ruins the franchise .

The Backlash
Rival chain , El Pollo Loco , officially turned KFC 's grilled chicken clusterfuck into tender - roasted lovemaking when they announced that they 'd accept all six million rejected KFC coupons that coming Sunday ( which just happened to be Mother 's Day ) .
Coma bolas , hombre sexos pollos !
KFC President Roger Eaton tried to wipe some of the egg off his face ( pun completely intended because we 're talking about chicken ) by issuing a public statement , but the damage had been done -- his company sunk a fuck ton of money into Oprah only to have their customers scooped up by a rival chicken shack .
Generally , this is not part of a good business model .
WASHINGTON -- A Senate panel has subpoenaed financial institutions , including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG , seeking evidence of fraud in last year 's mortgage - market meltdown , according to people familiar with the situation .
The congressional investigation appears to focus on whether internal communications , such as email , show bankers had private doubts about whether mortgage - related securities they were putting together were as financially sound as their public pronouncements suggested .

Man Fights Mountain Lion With Chainsaw
A man on a family vacation came face to face with a mountain lion and won .
July 18 , 2009  --
When Dustin Britton ventured 100 feet from his Wyoming campsite last week , he was prepared to cut wood , not go saw to paw combat with a starving mountain lion .
" Within seconds , I see this lion over 20 feet from me just standing there looking at me .
I could see just its head there in the grass , of course it scared the pants off of me , " Britton told ABC's " Good Morning America Weekend . "
Britton was afraid , but he said it did n't appear that the lion had any fear at all .
Standing just 100 feet from his wife , Kirsta , and two toddlers at the campsite , Britton tried to run away from the lion into a clearing , but the lion followed him .
Lucky for Britton , he had a chainsaw .
But undeterred by Britton 's revved up chainsaw , the lion pounced .
" It slowly came out of the brush and out into the open , and it just charged right at me and lunged at me , " said Britton .
It literally was man against beast .
" It pushed me back a few steps , " said Britton , who used his training in the Marines to fend off the animal .
" As it came up , I brought the saw up and so it batted my arms and the saw three or four times .
Then I hit it as hard as I could with that saw at full throttle trying to hit it in the neck . "
The lion backed down , but Britton said it " did n't leave in a hurry . "
Back at the campsite , Britton collected his family and stayed in the RV for the night .
The 32 - year - old mechanic and ex-Marine from Windsor , Colo. , found a ranger at the Shoshone National Forest and informed him of the attack .
Britton 's chainsaw attack inflicted a six - to eight - inch gash on the lion 's shoulder , but it was n't enough to stop the animal .
" You would think if you hit an animal with a chainsaw it would dig right in , " Britton told The Associated Press .
" I might as well have hit it with a hockey stick . "
The mountain lion was later killed by wildlife officials after it attacked a dog brought in to track the animal .
Officials say the lion appeared to be starving and was 4 - to 5 - years - old .
" Of course it seemed plenty big to me , but I guess I was told it weighed 100 pounds , " said Britton .
Most healthy adult male mountain lions weigh about 150 pounds .
Mountain Lion Attacks Extremely Rare
Wildlife officials said Sunday evening 's attack about 27 miles west of Cody was highly unusual because mountain lions are reclusive by nature .
Only eight cases of mountain lions acting aggressively toward humans have been documented in Wyoming over the last decade .
Initial tests conducted on the lion for rabies and other diseases came up negative .
Its carcass was taken to the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory in Laramie for further testing .
" It was acting completely out of character for how a lion would normally act around a full - grown man who has a chainsaw in his hand , " said Wyoming Fish and Game biologist Mark Bruscino told the AP .
" I could n't believe that it was n't afraid of me or the saw , " Britton told " Good Morning America Weekend . "
Britton got away with just a small puncture wound on his arm , and the family continued their vacation in Wyoming and Montana .
The Associated Press contributed to this report .
How To Piss Off Your Neighbors
It seems no matter where you move , there is at least one neighbor that can't stay out of your business .
They constantly complain , and do everything in their power to make your life a little tougher .
Time for you to return the favor .
When it comes to pissing off your neighbors , there a few things you can do that can really cause the most annoyance with the least amount of effort .
Follow along and pick and choose your favorites .
Get things done around the house
One of the easier ways to piss the neighbors off is by simply doing chores outside your house .
If the lawn needs mowing , take the initiative to start it real early in the morning .
Wait until the nosey neighbors are peacefully sleeping , and remember to go over the spots closest to their house .
It allows you to wake them up without really giving them anything to complain about .
You have to get your work done , it 's just too bad it 's not a good time for them .
Time to get extra friendly
So how does being nice piss them off you ask ?
Allow me to explain .
Flirting with your neighbors is a great way to start a fight , and get them extremely irate .
Just take the time each day to act flirty and friendly with on member of the family .
The parents only , for those that need to be told .
By doing this little covert move , you can get them pissed at you , and start fights between them .
It becomes a double whammy .
When nature calls .
Man 's best friend can become a huge ally in your attack on your neighbors .
Use your canine to cause as much trouble as possible .
Take him walking on their lawn when they are n't there to stop you .
Make sure to let old scrappy finish his business in the walking path if possible , leading to the best possible scenario .
If you have a neighbor scraping his foot as he walks up to your door to complain , you found a golden spot , keep it up .
Summer is here , possibilities grow
When summer arrives , there are multiple opportunities that open up .
One such choice that can really piss those people off is ..
Covert missions to destroy their lawn .
Start with the classic destruction of their hose .
Go ahead and poke holes throughout the hose , making sure that a simple rag wo n't cover it and allow them to get by .
Destroy a few hoses and see how quickly they start to crumble .
The next steps might get you in trouble , so work at your own risk .
If they have in - ground sprinklers , take the initiative to super glue those bad boys down .
It normally takes people a while to even notice their sprinkler heads are stuck , and can in the mean time leave their lawn dead or dieing .
So what is left to do ?
All out war ..
Time to do all the childish things left in your arsenal .
Get out there and be creative .
Lube up their door handles .
Ice down their driveway in the winter time .
Wake up early and sabotage their cars with bananas in the exhaust .
Check your cars engine early in the morning , by just revving and revving and revving .
Spread out these attacks over time , so that you can keep it fresh .
Some things get old , or can be adapted to easily .
Keep them on their toes , and watch them crumble .
Words of Warning
If you do n't want cops coming over your house , cover your tracks or make sure your neighbors are the revenge type over the cop calling type .
A challenge is always fun , and you now have more up your sleeve than the average Joe .
Keep the destruction and damages down to a minimum and keep yourself in the clear .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
Music fans who buy concert tickets during Live Nation 's " No Service Fee Wednesday " may be surprised when they check their receipt and see some service fees were charged .
Concertgoers expecting service - free tickets during a Live Nation promotion may still find fees .
Live Nation 's announcement for the promotion -- and stories based on their news release -- did not mention the concert promoter 's narrow definition of a " service fee . "
" Fans will still be asked to pay parking fees ( usually $ 6 ) as well as in some cases facility fees and / or charity fees , " Live Nation spokesman John Vlautin wrote in a reply to CNN 's request for clarification .
Still , the promotion will save consumers several dollars on amphitheater lawn seats bought from 12:01 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. Wednesday .
Vlautin did not respond to CNN 's question about why the promotion was called " No Service Fee Wednesday " if there were still fees added to the base cost of each ticket -- or why it was not disclosed in the announcement .
Service fees tacked on to ticket purchases -- averaging a third of the base price -- have long been a source of grumbling from concertgoers .
" People get a little ticked off when they think they 're paying $ 20 for a ticket and as they progress along the various pages of the electronic transaction they see more fees added along the way , " said Ray Waddell , who writes about live music tours for Billboard magazine .
When buying tickets online using a credit card , the buyer does not see the total charged -- with the added fees -- until after they 've submitted the order .
Live Nation discloses this in its " terms and conditions " statement :
" Live Nation Ticketing may assess a convenience charge on each ticket purchased and / or ordered for certain events . "
The parking fee , which does not actually pay for a parking space , is on each ticket -- even if the fan does n't drive to the show .
" We have always charged it this way to alleviate traffic issues that occur when the fee is taken at the lot entrance , " Vlautin said .
A facility fee is " charged at some venues and goes to defray the cost of venue maintenance , " he said .
Vlautin did not respond to CNN 's request for a detailed list of service fees that will be waived during " No Service Fee Wednesday . "
Live Nation only began selling tickets to its own concerts last year , just months before announcing plans to merge with Ticketmaster -- the world 's largest ticket - seller .
Before that , Live Nation promoted shows but had no infrastructure to sell tickets , and it contracted out to Ticketmaster or others to sell them .
The Ticketmaster - Live Nation merger plan has drawn criticism .
The Justice Department launched an investigation of the proposed merger in February .
Neither Live Nation nor Ticketmaster executives would respond to questions about the merger .
However , Ticketmaster CEO Irving Azoff did talk about it before a U.S. Senate subcommittee earlier this year .
" [ The merger ] will give us greater flexibility in how we promote , market and sell tickets to events .
It will give us a pathway to alternative pricing and fee structures .
And we will be better able to develop new and innovative products and services that enhance the fan experience and make all forms of entertainment more accessible to everyone . "

What is ‘ the left ’ ?
What characterises the ‘ left - wing ’ ?
It ’s sometimes suggested that ‘ the left - right spectrum is too simplistic ’ , which is fairly obvious ( what with it being , you know , one - dimensional ) but which has sometimes prompted attempts to ‘ replace it ’ , most commonly with ‘ the political compass ’ , a two - dimension chart which has an economic axis from planning ( left ) to market ( right ) and a political axis from ‘ libertarian ’ to ‘ authoritarian ’ .
I ’m not too impressed with this .
For a start , it always seems a bit invented – it ’s designed to reflect logical differences in ideas , whereas part of the rationale for the left - right spectrum is to reflect ideological differences in orientations , i.e. sides in a conflict , not in an academic debate .
But more importantly , if these two axes are to be separated , we might as well introduce more – an axis reflecting views about the roles of women , men , sex , and families , an axis reflecting views about science , nature , religion , and technology , and however many others .
But once you have five or six axes , you find that you have n’t actually helped yourself to understand real politics , just clarified certain logical distinctions about ideas – the question poses itself , why do positions on some axes correlate with positions on other axes ?
Why are feminists and socialists generally ‘ on the same side ’ ?
And what you find yourself doing is looking for over - arching dimensions , such as ‘ being on the side of the oppressed against the more powerful ’ or something , and then you find that you ’ve stumbled back to something very much like the left - right spectrum .
So let ’s suppose that there is some meaning to ‘ left - wing ’ , and in particular , let ’s suppose that it is something like ‘ supporting the oppressed against oppression ’ .
Let ’s take , for instance , the idea that ‘ left - wing ’ is in a certain sense defined by socialism , by the struggle of labour against capital .
These definitions still leave questions about that real entity that ’s called ‘ the left ’ : what manner of beast is it ?
Insofar as the left is defined by socialism , it will be marked by a certain dialectical tension , between the sorts of ideas associated with the methods of bringing about socialism , and the sorts of ideas associated with socialism itself .
The former will be militant , confrontational , and focused on class - consciousness , class loyalty , and class identification – at least according to the received wisdom that socialism will be brought about by a militant , class conscious proletariat .
The latter , however , will be quite different : the culture of a socialist society will hardly be militant or confrontational ( because conflict and antagonism will no longer be structural necessities ) , and wo n’t feature class identification ( because there will be no classes ) .
Its culture will ( hopefully and presumably ) be marked by co-operation , friendliness , self - reliance , autonomy , and peacefulness .
Fighting for peace , shouting for silence , etc .
Now , what I have for some time suspected , is that this tension , which is striking but not a contradiction in theory , becomes a contradiction in practice under normal conditions .
That is , I suspect ( some of my thoughts are elaborated more in yesterday ’s post ) that the social and psychological profiles of the people whose position and interests make them the ‘ agent ’ of socialism , and that of the people who are drawn to socialist ideology , will , under non-revolutionary conditions , not only be quite different , but will show only quite small overlap .
So one reason for this is that , as Nietzsche nicely puts it , ‘ man ’s problem is not that he suffers , but that he does not know why he suffers ’ : the most important defense against suffering is to find meaning for it , to make it make sense .
But this will tend to lead people to hold views on which such suffering is normal , necessary , and meritorious – in which it could not have been otherwise , in which they deserve respect for suffering it , and in which others deserve to share it .
And this is the opposite of the sort of view that would seek for , and be able to provide , an end to that suffering .
So for example , those who work and hate it , may often come to develop a ‘ work ethic ’ , a sort of ‘ asceticism ’ in which those who do n’t work are derided and the compulsion to work is aimed at – which is almost the opposite of the communistic desire that work not be a chore , not be imposed upon people , not be compulsory .
Similarly for anarchism , those who have to obey , may often come to develop a sense of virtue and merit for doing so , and a resentment and hatred of those who disobey .
Similarly for feminism , those women most oppressed by patriarchy may usually reach for the most easily available source of security , happiness , and acceptance , which will usually be a patriarchal script , a way to play on sexual availability or unavailability in whatever way , and the resultant identification with a gender role is n’t the most fertile ground for gender - abolitionism .
Now this is n’t a counsel of despair .
Clearly at certain times the oppressed masses of whatever flavour have taken real action against their oppression .
But I suspect this may be something typical only of revolutionary situations , when hope and confidence becomes strong enough that resolving to struggle for revolution becomes a more effective psychological response to oppression than whatever form of ‘ adaptation ’ ( revolutions , one might say , are the special time for the maladjusted ) .
What I ’m suggesting is that 99 % of the time , the people who believe in socialism ( or in radical - feminist anarcha - communism ) will tend to be , by and large , relatively remote from the ‘ sharp end ’ of capitalism ( or statist - capitalistico - patriarchy ) .
Of course everyone suffers from class society in one way or another , but there ’s a big difference between being oppressed with a comfortable income and a relatively autonomous sort of job , and being oppressed with shit wages for spending 8 hours getting bullied by your boss while doing boring tasks .
So what is the left ?
There may be – if I am right in this suspicion , which I would n’t bet on – two standard parts of ‘ the left ’ : on the one hand , ‘ revolutionary ’ intellectuals and those who embrace their ideas , often students , usually though not always somewhat ‘ middle - class ’ , and on the other , ‘ class - conscious militants ’ of various stripes , all those who honestly , intelligently , and unpretentiously struggle for their own liberation from the oppression that affects them .
But the two groups may not often share many members .
But it does n’t stay as simple as that .
These two elements , I ’d call ‘ genuinely ’ left - wing ( and trust me , I ’m totally objective ) .
But there ’s also what I ’d call the ‘ pseudoleft ’ : the attempt to find some other way , outside a revolutionary situation , to overcome the impotence that this divide produces .
Revolutionary intellectuals who are frustrated that the workers are n’t overthrowing capitalism , workers frustrated that there ’s no socialism on the horizon to raise their wage packets , and various others who are maladjusted at the wrong time – some alternative must be found for them .
Maybe a classless society can be imposed from above !
Maybe a highly - educated party leadership can compensate for an insufficiently revolutionary population !
Maybe parliament can use taxation to make everybody happy !
That ’s much easier .
This is pseudoleftism : hoping to achieve revolutionary goals without revolutionary movements .
I ’ll talk more about this tomorrow .
Suffice it to say that to my eyes , there looks to be a lot more pseudoleftism around than real leftism . 😦

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell was NBC ’s Meet The Press today , where he argued that their are n’t really 47 million Americans without healthcare .
McConnell said that the uninsured can always go to the emergency room for healthcare .
What he ignores is that people without health insurance do n’t get the same quality of care as those who do .
Here is the video :

In response to host David Gregory ’s question about whether or not healthcare is a moral issue , McConnell said , “ Well , they do n’t go without health care .
It ’s not the most efficient way to provide it .
As we know , the doctors in the hospitals are sworn to provide health care .
We all agree it is not the most efficient way to provide health care to find somebody only in the emergency room and then pass those costs on to those who are paying for insurance .
So it is important , I think , to reduce the number of uninsured .
The question is , what is the best way to do that ?
The proposals over in the House , according to CBO , not only are n’t paid for , they do n’t really dramatically increase the –decrease the number of uninsured . ”
Notice how McConnell ducks the question about whether or not healthcare is a moral issue .
It is a losing argument for a Republican to say that healthcare is a moral , so instead he tried to portray the Obama reform as unnecessary because the uninsured can go to the emergency room .
So McConnell would rather protect the health insurance industry , at the expense of the insured and taxpayers , than insure everyone ?
His argument makes no sense , especially if he is going to justify his opposition to the Democratic plan based on cost .
It is delusional for Republicans like McConnell to pretend that there is no healthcare crisis because everyone can go to the emergency room for care .
I can tell you from firsthand experience that there is a difference in the amount of care that the insured get compared to the uninsured in the hospital .
People like me , who have health insurance , usually get tests , and admitted if necessary .
My father , who recently had to go the emergency room , and does n’t health insurance , was diagnosed and sent home within hours , for a recurrence of a problem that he spent days in the hospital for when he had insurance .
The story that I have just shared is common one all across the United States .
Hospitals are a big business .
They are n’t going to dedicate bed space to people who ca n’t afford to pay .
People without health insurance get the bare minimum care when they go to the ER .
There is a disparity in both the amount and quality of care between the insured and uninsured .
Republicans , like McConnell , need to get their heads out the backsides of lobbyists , and realize that healthcare reform is going to happen with or without them .
Shortly after taking office , President Donald Trump puffed himself up in full Trumpian pomposity to proclaim to us rubes : " We will honor the American people with the truth , and nothing else . "
Well , " nothing else " ... unless you count a record - shattering number of more than 20,000 documented lies that this huckster has uttered in only three - and - a - half years , making dishonesty the cornerstone of his corrupt administration .
He 's now spewing a furious torrent of lies , insisting that a tsunami of voter fraud is about to hit our land and deny him reelection .
He practically shrieks like Chicken Little , claiming that Democrats are meeting in secret cabals across America to pervert millions of ballots and steal the White House from him ( as though it 's one of his personal properties ) .
Of course , as every investigation has concluded — including ones run by Republican partisans — the only widespread voter fraud in our country is the GOP fraud that voter fraud is rampant .
But what 's really at work here is that The Donald is in a cold panic about losing , so his only hope is to do two things :
First , use the fraud bugaboo as an excuse to restrict voting in precincts that vote for Democrats , and , second , delegitimize a Democratic win in advance by creating the myth that his loss could only be caused by hordes of illegal voters .
Thus , we 're seeing an egomaniacal incumbent who 's so weak and nefarious that he and his obsequious political party are actually spending untold millions of dollars in a disgraceful effort to try to keep American voters from casting ballots .
Their tactics are worthy of the sleaziest of tinpot dictators from the banana republics of old .
For example , they 've simply closed the neighborhood voting places in thousands of Democratic areas , forcing people to scramble to get to the polls , and they 've monkeyed with our nation 's postal service in a crude effort to restrict mail - in voting .
Then , William Barr , Trump 's pathetic toady of an attorney general , even tried to boost the trickster 's chances by ludicrously suggesting it might not be illegal for his backers to vote twice !
So now , nearly four years after promising he'd tell us nothing but the truth , the fabricator in chief declared this year that he 's entitled to reelection because " Unlike so many who came before me , I keep my promises . "
Obviously , that 's his fattest lie yet .
How extreme and needlessly nasty is the Republican Party 's massive campaign to thwart democracy ?
Ask the good people of Florida .
This was one of only three states with an antiquated law permanently taking away the voting rights of felons — even after they 'd completed their punishment .
In 2018 , though , a whopping 64 % of Floridians voted for a state constitutional amendment that finally struck this malicious bit of legal ugliness from the books , thus offering public grace to the redeemed .
At last , about a million people who'd served their time would have their political personhood restored .
But — look out ! — here came a raving gaggle of Republican operatives rushing to court to slam the door once more on the rights of discharged felons .
Led by Ron DeSantis , Florida 's right - wing goose of a governor , the GOP demanded that an appeals court of hyperpartisan federal judges overrule the 2018 landmark vote by the people .
Formerly incarcerated citizens are not entitled to vote , squawked these vindictive ballot suppressors , unless and until they 've paid off the full amount of court costs and fees they were assessed .
Yes , once again , Republican leaders are asserting that money — even a few hundred dollars — must trump social justice , human decency and political rights .
They knew , of course , that most people coming out of Florida 's prisons are indigent and unable to pony up a thousand bucks or so .
Even if ex-felons are regularly making payments to clear the debt , the Republican repressors say tough luck — no vote until every penny is paid .
It 's a flagrant case of rigging the system to steal the votes of a low - income constituency generally inclined to support Democratic policies and candidates .
It also amounts to an unconstitutional poll tax , made more intolerable by applying it to one class of citizens ( largely people of color ) specifically to disenfranchise them .
The court 's six - judge Republican majority ( five appointed by Trump ) cynically defied the U.S. Constitution and the Florida electorate just weeks before November 's presidential election , effectively incarcerating some 774,000 potential voters in a partisan debtor 's prison .
Yet , these people 's battle for justice goes on .

A couple have taken legal action after claiming motion sensors installed at their holiday flat in Dorset breached their rights as Orthodox Jews .
Gordon and Dena Coleman said they cannot leave or enter their Bournemouth flat on the Sabbath because the hallway sensors automatically switch on lights .
The couple 's religious code bans lights and other electrical equipment being switched on during Jewish holidays .
They have now issued a county court writ claiming religious discrimination .
They also claim breach of their rights under the Equality Act 2006 and Human Rights Act 1998 and the case is due to be heard at Bournemouth County Court next month .
It has gone further than it should have done , I think they have jumped the gun
Neighbour
The light sensors were installed at Embassy Court in Gervis Road to save money and energy but the couple , who live in Hertfordshire , felt they breached their religious rules .
Dr Coleman and her husband offered to pay for an override switch as a compromise but Embassy Court Management Company rejected this and the couple took legal advice .
They have said they will drop the legal action if an override switch is installed and their legal costs and compensation are paid .
The firm said almost all residents supported the installation of the sensors and taking legal action was the Colemans ' " prerogative " .
Other residents in the block of 35 flats , who could end up having to pay legal costs , are upset .
Neighbours meeting
One of them , who did not wish to be named but attended a management meeting last week with the couple , said : " For some time there has been discussions around here about the lights being on all day , which is crazy .
" Light sensors mean the lights only come on when you require them to be on , which is common sense .
" This couple are observant Jews .
They have a religious problem with this .
" It has gone further than it should have done , I think they have jumped the gun .
" They did come to a meeting and put their point of view forward .
" The general view was that despite any differences the matter should be resolved as quickly as we can .
" It just seems to have been blown out of all proportion . "
In a letter to the other residents , the couple said they sought legal help because the sensor lights meant they would never again have full use of their flat .
They also said that their solicitors told them they had a strong claim .

Komoly feszültségeket szül , hogy megjelent a magánszféra a kollégiumok működtetésében .
A diákszállások üzemeltetői szigorú szabályokkal próbálják megőrizni az épületek állagát , és a legkisebb kárt is bevasalják a diákokon .
A kollégisták szerint az üzemeltető rövid idő alatt a legnagyobb profitot akarja elérni , ezért mindenért pénzt kér , és nem tesz különbséget a rongálás és az amortizáció között .
A szigorú házirendtől a kollégiumok közösségi élete sem olyan , mint régen .
Július elején kiköltöztek az egyetemi kollégiumokból , és a hallgatók most szembesültek igazán a magáncégek által ppp konstrukcióban felújított épületek üzemeltetőinek keménységével .
„ Szobatársam most költözik ki , és felhívott , hogy fejenként legalább 1500 Ft - ot kell fizetnünk , mert találtak vízkövet a fürdőszobában , a » fal össze van rugdozva « ( itt , gondolom az asztal alatt normális esetben keletkező , de tényleg nem túl szép sötét foltokra gondolnak ) ” – írta egyik olvasónk .
Falakon talált szennyeződések
Hotel , nem kollégium
A kollégium igazából nem kollégium , hanem , mint neve is jelzi , egy háromcsillagos szálloda , írta egy korábban a Campus Hotel Debrecenben lakó egyetemista .
Kéthetente volt központi takarítás , előtte a hallgatóknak is rendet kellett rakniuk a szobákban , a mosogatóból , az ágyról , az asztalról mindent el kellett pakolni , mert a szabályzat szerint a takarító nem nyúlhatott a diákok holmijaihoz .
A borsos összegek ellenére rendszeresen panaszkodtak a hallgatók , hogy büdösek a frissen felh úzott ágyneműk , tele voltak hajszálakkal .
A kollégiumot üzemeltető magáncég háromezer forintot fizettetett , ha egy minimális szakadás volt a lepedőn .
Ha odakozmált valami a mobil főzőlapra , akkor tizennyolc - húszezer körüli összeget kellett fizetni , mert ú jat volt kénytelen vásárolni a kollégium .
Minden évben volt egy - két hét , amikor ki kellett költözni a kollégiumból , mert valamilyen nagy debreceni esemény résztvevői foglalták el a diákok helyét , például 2007 telén a rövidpályás úszó - Eb sportolói kapták meg a szobákat .
Esetenként az általuk okozott károkért is a hallgatók fizettek , ha a visszaköltözésük után nem vették észre időben a károkat .
Mindig volt egy ügyeletes biztonsági őr , és a két recepción kamerákkal figyelték , mi történik az épületben .
Emiatt lopások szerencsére nem voltak , ami egy tízezres kollégiumban mindenképpen becsülendő .
Ehhez viszont párosult az elidegenedett életérzés : megszűntek a nagy közösségek és a spontán összeverődések , mindenki a szobájában ült .
Leveléből kiderül , hogy ötszáz forint szobaátrendezési díjat kell fizetni , ha egy asztalt arrébb raknak , díjat számítanak fel azért , ha nincs leolvasztva a hűtő kiköltözéskor .
Ha a hallgató túlságosan koszosan adja le az ágyneműt mosásra , az ágyneműt „ nem tisztítható ” jelzővel látják el , jegyzőkönyvet vesznek fel , és kiemelt tisztítási díjat szabnak ki , vagy kilátásba helyezik , hogy a diáknak új ágyneműt kell vennie .
Egy blogon saját kiköltözése történetét írja meg valaki , a Hérosz FM Kft. által üzemeltetett egyik kollégiumból .
„ Szerdán este többórás munkával kitakarítottam a fürdőszobát .
A vízkőoldó , amit még Y szerzett a takkernőktől jó használatot tett , a fürd őszobapadlót felsúroltam vele , szép tiszta lett .
A zuhanyfüggönyt szappannal kimostam .
A csaptelepekről egy rakat vízkövet szedtem le , csillogott minden . ”
A hallgató másnap mindenhol felsepert , felmosott az ágyak alatt és a sarkokban .
Pénteken vegyszerrel áttörölte az asztalokat , majd az ágy alatti cipőtartókat , meg a szekrényeket is letisztította .
Többórás várakozás után felmentek a gondnokkal , hogy az átvegye a kitakarított szobát .
A gondnok kihúzogatott minden bútort , de nem talált koszt .
Ezután azt mondta , hogy az asztalok nem elég tiszták , és két szürkeárnyalattal sötétebbek , mint az újak .
Végighúzta az ujját az egyik felső polcon , de ott nem talált port .
Belenézett a szemétkosárba , majd azt mondta , hogy belül a pedálnál piszkos .
A gondnok benézett a fürd őszobába is , majd megjegyezte , hogy a fémrészek nem csillognak eléggé , mert vízkövesek ( valószínűleg víz maradt csak rajtuk , és az hagyott halvány foltot ) .
A padlón lévő dudoroknál kis szürke karimákat vett észre , amelyeket a blog írója szerint többórás súrolással sem sikerült eltüntetni , mert a por odagy űlik , és legfeljebb fogpiszkálóval kapargathatja ki az ember .
Az egyik székről az aljára beütött leltári szám alapján kiderült , hogy nem a szobába való .
A kiköltözni készülő hallgató megkereste a szobába való széket , ennek azonban a kárpitja erősen szennyezett volt , amit a gondnok jegyzőkönyvbe vett .
Ugyancsak jegyzőkönyvbe került , hogy két ágy szivacsa foltos , az egyik ágynem űtartó görgője sérült , a hűt őszekrény teteje egy helyen elrepedt , a fürdőszobai függöny egyik fele foltos , a fürdőszobai ajtólap előszobai felén kilincstől származó sérülés található ( a kollégiumban az ajtók egymásra nyílnak , ezek a sérülések óhatatlanul előfordulnak ) .
Rákerültek a listára a falakon talált szennyeződések , és az is , hogy három párna és az egyik paplan foltos , egy pokróc zöld festékkel szennyezett , és az egyik polc éle megduzzadt a ráakasztott vizes ruhától .
A gondnok végül kényszertakarítást rendelt el , amiért a hallgatónak ötezer forintot kellett fizetnie .
Nagyon szigorú házirend
A Budapesti Műszaki és Gazdaságtudományi Egyetem Schönherz Zoltán - kollégiumát 2007 –2008 - ban ú jította fel a Hérosz Zrt. A ppp ( public private partnership ) konstrukcióban végzett felújítás után a cég leányvállalata , a Hérosz FM Kft .
húsz évig működteti a kollégiumot , ezért az egyetem bérleti díjat fizet .
Üzleti szempontból érthető , hogy a cég , amely több milliárd forintot költött a felújításra , ezalatt a húsz év alatt a legtöbb profitot szeretné elérni , és minden eszközzel igyekszik megőrizni az épület állagát .
Ez azonban komoly feszültségeket szül a kollégisták és az üzemeltető között .
Schönherz Zoltán - kollégium
„ A felújítás után valóban impozáns módon megújultak a kollégium bels ő terei : a szobák új bútorzatot kaptak , megcsinálták a zuhanyzókat , a vécéket , folyosókat .
Az azonban már a beköltözésnél látható volt , hogy a kolesz ezzel együtt elvesztette otthonosságát , személyességét ” - mondta egy schönherzes hallgató .
Korábban például több szintközösség képeket festett a falakra , a hallgatók szívesen dekorálták a szobákat , most ilyesmit csak hosszas egyeztetések után lehet megtenni .
A kollégistáknak a felújítás után nagyon szigorú házirenddel kellett szembesülniük .
Ha kár esik , és a felelősség megállapítható , a javítás költségeit a hallgatókra terhelik , amelyeknél általában a munkadíj a nagyobb tétel .
A legtöbb feszültséget az okozza , hogy az üzemeltető cég és az egyetem nincsenek azonos állásponton arról , mi a rongálás , és mi a rendeltetésszerű használat .
A kollégisták szerint a cég nem ismeri a természetes amortizáció fogalmát .
Azzal érvelnek , hogy ha valahol laknak , ott a legnormálisabb használat közben is keletkeznek károk .
Ahogy egyikük fogalmazott : „ Az üzemeltet ő legszívesebben húsz évre lezáratná az épületet , nehogy bárki bármit elrontson . ”
Közös ellenség ?
Az új üzemeltető miatt az élénk közösségi életet élő Schönherz kollégium híres tradíciói is veszélyben vannak .
„ Korábban , ha rendezvényt tartottunk , a kollégistákból szerveztünk biztonsági őrséget .
Ma a Hérosztól kell őröket bérelni , az ő órabérük kétezer - ötszáz forint , így ez egy este akár kétszázezer forinttal is megemeli a szervezési költségeket ” – mondta egy kollégista .
A Debreceni Egyetem Orvos és Egészségtudományi Centrum ppp konstrukcióban felújított II .
számú kollégiuma
Az épületben már 2004 - ben , tehát a héroszos felújítás előtt felszereltek beléptető rendszert , amiről kiderült , hogy ugyancsak jelentősen akadályozza a közösségi életet .
Egy kollégium normális működéséhez hozzátartozik , hogy bejöhessenek nem kollégista vendégek is .
A beléptet őkapukon azonban csak nehézkesen lehet átjutni .
Az épületben alacsonyra szabták a tűzvédelmi létszámkorlátot : a kollégiumban 1072 - en laknak , és ők összesen legfeljebb kilencven vendéget fogadhatnak .
Ha az épület megtelt , hiába próbál bemenni valaki , nem engedik be .
A kollégiumi hallgatói képviselő szerint a felújítás előtt is voltak rongálások , fegyelmi problémák , de ezt a közösség maga is tudta kezelni .
A Héroszról a kollégisták többsége azt gondolja , hogy rövid idő alatt a legnagyobb profitot akarja elérni , ezért mindenért pénzt kér .
A kollégiumot üzemeltet ő Hérosz FM Kft.- vel nehezíti a kommunikációt , hogy a kollégisták az egyetemmel állnak hallgatói jogviszonyban , és az egyetem bérli a kollégiumot a Hérosztól .
Megkerestük a Hérosz FM Kft. képviselőjét is , aki először válaszolt kérdéseinkre .
Az illetékes azt ígérte , hogy a kiköltözési id őszak után elemezni fogják a kollégiumok üzemeltetési gyakorlatát , és az ott lakókkal együtt igyekeznek majd megoldást találni a felmerült vitás kérdésekre .
Konstruktív hangvételű nyilatkozatát azonban később ( a fentebb idézett blog stílusára hivatkozva ) visszavonta .
The risk of a massive tsunami striking the West Coast may be greater than previously thought , according to an analysis of sedimentation along the Gulf of Alaska coast .
In 1964 , a magnitude 9.2 earthquake off the coast of Alaska generated a wall of water more than 40 feet high that hit Alaska , British Columbia , Oregon and parts of California , killing 130 people and causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage .
Now , geologists say an even bigger tsunami could someday be in store for the West Coast .
The 1964 earthquake occurred in the Aleutian subduction zone , where the Pacific plate is being pushed beneath the North American continent .
When scientists studied evidence of older quakes in the Aleutian zone and the subduction zone immediately to the east , they found the two have ruptured simultaneously in the past .
Because the size of an earthquake depends in part on the length of the fault that breaks , together these fault zones are capable of a more massive jolt .
" People knew that there 's a section of fault that extends to the east that generates earthquakes , " said geologist Ronald Bruhn of the University of Utah , who co-authored the paper published January in Quaternary Science Reviews .
" But they had n't made the connection or had the dating information to link it to the big Aleutian subduction zone . "
Just east of the Aleutian zone , the Pacific plate is being pushed beneath a relatively small chunk of continent called the Yakutat microplate .
When Bruhn and his colleagues compared evidence of past earthquakes preserved in the sediments of the two regions using radiocarbon dating , they discovered that at least twice in the past 1,500 years , both faults appear to have ruptured at once .
Tsunamis form when a major earthquake causes a sudden rise or fall in the sea floor which rapidly displaces a large amount of water .
A simultaneous rupture of the faults could lead to a far larger earthquake — and more devastating tsunami — than the one in 1964 .
Because the Yakutat microplate lies beneath a very shallow section of the Pacific Ocean , an earthquake in this region would create a particularly massive wave .
" Try putting your hand at the bottom of a deep bathtub , " Bruhn said .
" Then all of a sudden raise it up with your palm facing up — that disturbance will create a bit of turbulence .
But if you place your hand in shallow water , and raise it up to do the same thing , you 'll get a considerably larger surface disturbance . "
In addition , the transition from shallow water in the Yakutat region to the much deeper ocean covering the Aleutian zone could create the perfect environment for underwater landslides , which would then generate even more big waves .
Without creating numerical models , geologists can't estimate exactly how big a multi- segment tsunami might be , but they think the damage could be devastating .
" California , and particularly San Francisco , is most vulnerable from tsunamis originating from earthquakes in the Aleutians , among all possible tsunamis emanating from the different subduction zones around the Pacific , " said geologist Costas Synolakis , director of the Tsunami Research Center at the University of Southern California , who was not involved in the research .
A multi-segment earthquake like the one described in the paper could generate foot - high waves off the San Francisco coast , Synolakis said , and small waves on the open ocean become huge waves as they get close to shore .
For example , the massive 2004 Sumatra tsunami , which killed more than 300,000 people , had a height of only about two feet on the open ocean .
" A 30 - centimeter ( 11.8 - inch ) tsunami a few miles offshore the Golden Gate is something to worry about , " Synolakis said .
" What 's new here is the evidence that Sumatra - style events are not only possible but likely . "

Will Future US Military Vehicles , Robots Feast on the Flesh of the Slain ?
The real downside to the Pentagon ’s planned army of merciless killbots , besides the inevitable robot rebellion ( which the Pentagon is spending billions trying to head off ) is all that fuel .
Robots need really big batteries , or internal combustion engines , or something .
No matter how they ’re powered though , it ’s not free .
Until now .
A Pentagon contractor in Maryland is now working on a robot that can forage for its own food .
It could use any biomass in the area .
And lets face it , in any really big war there ’s plenty of biomass just lying around all shot up or bombed to death and not doing anything for the war effort .
So the robots , and potentially vehicles based on the same design , will be feeding off the flesh of slain humans to continue on their mission to slay humans and feed off their flesh .
Besides the obvious ethical issues of creating man-eating , killer robots ( which presumably do n’t concern the Pentagon any more than the non- man - eating but still killer robots did ) , the plan will also raise serious concerns about the reliability of body counts .
It is difficult enough to get an accurate death toll out of the military when villages present the bodies to local officials .
Imagine the skepticism if the villagers have to explain that Pentagon battle droids consumed all the slain villagers and sped off for more mayhem .
June 10 , 2009 — Alderson Warm - Fork
Often , neoconservatives declare that ‘ we ’ needs to have the confidence to assert our own values , and not display an exaggerated deferrence to rival values .
And often , anti-abortion activists say that it ’s necessary and appropriate to go outside the law and use aggressive or harassing methods to advance their cause , because of the ongoing large - scale murder of the innocent .
Frequently , fascists say that the sphere of genteel liberal debate and discussion has its limits , and that less pretty forces operate outside it and need to be confronted outside it .
Almost constantly , militarists and war criminals say that sometimes regrettable things happen in conflict , and we need to accept that .
And almost everyday , senior members of the British conservative party drink tea .
The thing is , all of these things can be true .
And someone can say all four them , while drinking tea , without either being a neocon , anti-abortionist , fascist , war criminal or tory , or even being their moral equivalent .
I say this in response to this thread at Feministe , on a post whose essential point was that animal rights activists used some of the same tactics as anti-abortionists ( not , obviously , the one of murdering people , but various forms of harassment and intimidation ) .
Or rather , the essential point was that because they used the same tactics , they were in some sense ‘ just as bad ’ .
It ended with the telling line “ liberals can do better than this ” .
I do like liberals most of the time , but sometimes I get a bit irritated .
Because I knew this was going to happen .
I could tell from the discussions around George Tiller ’s murder that one response would be stringent tactics policing : you ca n’t do anything that looks at all threatening , because then you ’re just like them .
That was at the back of my mind when I wrote several recent posts , all themed around this issue of means and ends .
It ’s an interesting procedure , how people decide that means are the most important thing .
As I read it , it starts from the perfectly reasonable observation that people are fallible and may turn out to be wrong in their political beliefs – which , as discussed in the third post linked above , is a major reason to care about the means used , because they ’re more definite than the ends promoted .
But that observation can prompt a one - sided and extreme reaction in which someone attempts to get away from and evade the fact that they have strong beliefs that might be wrong .
How do you do that ?
Whenever you look at a difficult political question , you abstract away from , uh , the truth .
You abstract away from whether the muslims really are plotting to out - breed us , whether meat really is murder , whether abolishing capitalism really will cause famine .
And then , in this abstracted world , where everyone holds simply ‘ a belief ’ , you can distinguish them by the tactics they use .
Those who use ‘ moderate ’ or ‘ civilised ’ tactics are the good guys ( or at least , the not - so - bad bad guys ) , while those who use ‘ extreme ’ tactics are , well , ‘ extremists ’ .
Also ‘ terrorists ’.
Of course , usually both those terms are strictly accurate , in their official meaning which makes them neutral terms applying to , well , most of politics across the world , but their real meaning is ‘ bad bad scary person ’ .
This produces , among other mild oddities , people saying that all rioters , and all militant anti-fascists , are in fact … fascists .
Because ‘ fascism ’ is to be opposed simply as ‘ violent thuggery ’ , simply as the willingness to use force .
The actual content of the beliefs and the programs and the goals and the targets is set aside : everyone who throws a punch is ‘ fascist ’ .
What ’s most irritating is that this way of looking can always be maintained – as long as you always perform the switch , always say ‘ how would I react if I were them and they were me ?’ , it will always make sense to prioritise adhering to strict rules of engagement over getting stuff done .
It ’s like talking to someone who can re-interpret any piece of evidence to fit their preconceived views .
A lot of issues are like this in philosophy .
Of course , the abstracted space where all views are just ‘ views ’ is always established by law and its hidden violence – it ’s rare to see people say “ I totally oppose violent methods of protest , but I also do n’t think the police should stop people who are using them ” .
And of course it easily becomes contradictory , because belief in non-violence and respecting alternative views is itself a view , and tbh most people disagree with it in some form , for some people .
Anyway , the point is this : you do n’t get to abstract away from what you think is true .
Obviously you need perspective and you need to be aware of your own fallibility , but it is just not an option to completely escape the unfortunate situation of believing things .
So with anti-abortion and anti-vivisection campaigns , you do n’t get to put your actual opinions about abortion and vivisection on one side , which I think is what people ( the feministe thread is a good example ) try to do .
They try to construct a worldview in which both anti-abortionists and pro-abortionists can condemn anti-abortion terrorism purely for its tactics , and where both anti-vivisectionists and pro-vivisectionists can condemn animal rights terrorism purely for its tactics .
But guess what ?
It wo n’t work .
Your attitude to these group ’s actions is going to depend on what you believe about animals and foetuses and bodily autonomy .
If , like many of the people at feministe , you support abortion and vivisection , then guess what – anti-vivisection harassment campaigns will look quite similar to anti-abortion harassment campaigns , since they ’re promoting a wicked cause .
If , like me , you support abortion and oppose vivisection , then one will be very different to the other .
And I wo n’t necessarily be able to convince the former person that they ’re different without convincing them that animals have rights .
And that ’s ok .
The world is a scary chaotic dangerous confusing place .
We have to accept that either way , so why invest in some hypothetical agreement that ’s never going to come anyway .
Of course social peace is valuable , of course it should n’t be thrown away needlessly .
But it ’s only ever a partial peace – many many people do n’t live in that world , and we should be focused on them .
You believe things to be true , and others disagree , and you may be wrong .
It sucks , but we have to live with it .
impossible
As I ’ve often mentioned in this blog , philosopher David Hume famously said that “ No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle , unless the testimony be of such a kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavours to establish , ” setting the bar for believing in miracles properly high .
Unfortunately , many people blatantly ignore Hume ’s advice , moving that bar so low that banal coincidences suddenly count as “ miracles , ” reinforcing their preexisting supernaturalist view of the world .
One such instance took place in the Q&A session after a nice talk I attended a few days ago at the Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture .
The talk was by Lawrence Bush , author of Waiting for God : The Spiritual Reflections of a Reluctant Atheist .
Bush gave an eminently sensible talk , starting out with the common observation of coincidences to which human beings attribute special meaning ( a secular version of Carl Jung ’s discredited idea of “ synchronicity ” ) .
As Bush wryly commented at one point , while it is a good idea to pause and reflect on what happens to us in life , it is rather egomaniacal to imagine that the universe is sending us messages ( often through catastrophes , personal or affecting others ) just so that we can learn from our experiences .
Perhaps not unexpectedly , given the somewhat new - agey flavor of some ( but by all means not all ! ) chapters of the Society for Ethical Culture , the Q&A was as irritating as Bush ’s talk had been level headed .
One questioner in particular related a touching story of his adoptive grandmother being diagnosed with cancer and given six months life expectancy .
The grandson reacted constructively to that abysmal prediction , using the remaining time to travel with his grandma to places where she had always wanted to go .
Turns out the woman lived three years , which allowed for more travel and what I ’m sure are indelibly good memories .
But then the grandson went back to the doctor and pointedly asked : “ You said six months , she lived three years .
What are the chances of that ? ”
To which the doctor apparently replied with a no - nonsense ( if a bit insensitive , assuming things really went that way )
“ One in seven hundred . ”
The conclusion of the story is that the questioner asked “ What is the difference between 1/700 and a miracle ? ” strongly implying that his grandmother had of course been the beneficiary of a miracle .
Besides the obvious question of why god ( or the universal life force , or whatever ) could n’t be bothered to perform a bit more substantial miracle , say by curing the woman instead of simply prolonging her life by a few weeks , the question highlights how easily we are impressed by occurrences that are in fact perfectly ordinary .
One in seven hundred , the odds indicated by the doctor , are the known probability of someone affected by that particular tumor to survive beyond the mean survival time , i.e. the six months of the original diagnosis .
Medical research arrives at these numbers by statistical studies of large populations of patients , and surviving beyond average simply means that — for a variety of complex reasons , including age , general health , genetic makeup , and sheer luck — one ’s position on the bell curve describing the mortality for that disease happens to be somewhat to the right of the population ’s mean .
A miracle , on the other hand , is a suspension of the laws of nature , presumably actuated by a supernatural being .
The odds of a miracle , as Hume hinted , are infinitesimally small ( and cannot actually be calculated ) , because we see the laws of nature working just fine every minute of every day , and we have never reliably observed a suspension of such laws .
Hume was careful enough not to say that miracles are , just stating that if you want to claim one , the burden of proof is high indeed .
Much higher than 1/700 , I should think .
People find meaning in coincidences , as Bush pointed out in the lecture at Ethical Culture , because we are pattern - seeking animals .
The discovery of patterns in nature is very important , because it can make the difference between life and death .
Skeptical writer Michael Shermer recently wrote in Scientific American : “ So we make two types of errors : a type I error , or false positive , is believing a pattern is real when it is not ; a type II error , or false negative , is not believing a pattern is real when it is .
If you believe that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator when it is just the wind ( a type I error ) , you are more likely to survive than if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind when it is a dangerous predator ( a type II error ) .
” The second reason for people ’s penchant for interpreting coincidences as personally significant messages emanating from the forces of the universe is what philosopher Daniel Dennett called “ the intentional stance , ” the tendency of projecting agency on phenomena , even though they may be the result of mindless forces .
As Dennett put it : “ Here is how it works : first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent ; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have , given its place in the world and its purpose .
Then you figure out what desires it ought to have , on the same considerations , and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs .
A little practical reasoning from the chosen set of beliefs and desires will in most instances yield a decision about what the agent ought to do ; that is what you predict the agent will do .
” Just like pattern - seeking , adopting an intentional stance is useful : this is how we make educated guesses about what other human beings will do , an absolutely necessary skill for navigating complex social spaces .
But again , like pattern - seeking , the intentional stance is often applied indiscriminately , and the combination of these two natural attributes of the human mind is probably chiefly responsible for superstition , mysticism and eventually the roots of organized religion .
If you or a loved one is diagnosed with a terminal disease , it is sensible and indeed a positive thing to reflect on how this affects your view of life and how you wish to spend your remaining days .
But it is a sad random occurrence of existence , not a message in a bottle sent to you by a strangely interested and yet largely uncaring ( or even callous ) cosmic entity .
Life is what it is , not what we would like it to be , and it is the ethical duty of a reasonable person to accept things for what they are , trying to change what can be changed and enjoying the rest of the ride while it lasts .
Since it was announced that Scarlett Johansson would be appearing in Iron Man 2 as the beautiful Russian spy known as the Black Widow , I ’ve been interested in seeing a picture of her in costume .
Not so much as I am a fan of the character , but as a fan of Johansson herself .
Yes , the prospect of seeing the curvaceous actress in form - fitting leather does quicken the pulse .
But beyond that , I ’ve always felt that actress looked her best when attired in an outfit that recalled the styles of the 1930s and 40s Golden Age of Hollywood .
I must say , this first picture looks pretty good - both true to the character ( Fanboys , please note the Black Widow ’s wrist stingers ) and in making the actress look good .
( Thus avoiding the whole “ I ca n’t believe that Halle Berry agreed to that costume in Catwoman ” thing . )
Johansson is also under option to appear in Marvel Studio ’s superhero team up film , The Avengers , in 2012 .
The pic is from Entertainment Weekly ‘s upcoming issue that will feature a cover story on this year ’s San Diego Comic Con.
Johansson is joined on the cover with her Iron Man 2 stars Robert Downey Jr and Mickey Rourke as the villain Whiplash .
As it is EW , rest assured that their Comic Con preview will very probably be peppered with the usual condescending “ biff , ” “ pows ” and “ It ’s nerd Prom ! ” that we can expect from them .
Iron Man 2 will be blasting its way into cinemas next May .

OBESITY COMPLICATIONS OBESITY COMPLICATIONS
The hospitalization of heavy children has skyrocketed in recent years , a study shows .
The number of hospitalizations of kids and teens , ages 2 to 19 , with a primary or secondary diagnosis of obesity nearly doubled between 1999 and 2005 , climbing from 21,743 to 42,429 , according to a study published Thursday on the Health Affairs website .
These were stays for obesity - related conditions such as asthma , diabetes , gallbladder disease , pneumonia , skin infections , pregnancy complications , depression and other mental disorders .
The estimated costs for these hospitalizations increased from almost $ 126 million in 2001 to almost $ 238 million in 2005 .
This cost for Medicaid rose from $ 53.6 million in 2001 to about $ 118 million in 2005 .
Obesity in kids has been leveling off in recent years .
About 32 % of children and teens ages 2 to 19 -- about 23 million -- were either overweight or obese in 2003 - 2006 compared with 29 % in 1999 .
The increase is not considered statistically significant .

The hospitalization numbers may be higher partly because doctors are increasingly recognizing obesity as a contributor to other medical conditions , says Leonardo .
Trasande , an assistant professor of community medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City .
" This study confirms that being overweight takes a larger toll on children than even previously understood , and these results show there is a larger economic consequence than previously believed .
This reinforces the crucial need to prevent obesity in kids . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara died on Monday aged 93 .
He will be remembered most as the leading architect of America ’s involvement in the Vietnam War .
“ His age just caught up with him , ” his wife Diana told Reuters .
“ He was not ill .
He died peacefully in his sleep . ”
McNamara also forged brilliant careers in industry and international finance , but his painful legacy remains Vietnam .
More than anyone else except possibly President Lyndon Johnson , McNamara became to anti-war critics the symbol of a failed policy that left more than 58,000 U.S. troops dead and the nation bogged down in a seemingly endless disaster in Southeast Asia .
Pundits came to call the conflict “ McNamara ’s War . ”
With his slicked - back hair and rimless glasses , he became a familiar face to the nation as one of “ the best and the brightest ” assembled by President John Kennedy to form his policy - making brain trust .
But he left the Cabinet in 1968 under pressure from Johnson .
By then disillusioned with the war , McNamara had criticized U.S. bombing of North Vietnam .
He spent the rest of his life trying to explain the U.S. role in Vietnam and apologizing for his mistakes , becoming the subject of an Academy Award winning documentary , “ The Fog of War . ”
In the film , he discussed the difficult decision - making process during the Vietnam conflict as well as his Pentagon role in the Cuban missile crisis .
He first came to prominence as one of the “ Whiz Kids ” who revitalized Ford Motor Co. after World War Two and ended his public career as president of the World Bank .

To those jobs , as well as defense secretary , the dynamic McNamara brought a driving ambition , a phenomenal memory for statistics and a quick , efficient grasp of facts .
McNamara was named defense secretary by Kennedy in 1961 and held the post longer than anyone before or since .
He put his corporate organizational skills to use in trying to modernize the Pentagon during the Cold War .
BLOCKING COMMUNISM
But more and more , Vietnam became his focus .
He made several fact - finding visits there in the early days of the U.S. military buildup , which Washington saw as the only way to block a communist takeover of Southeast Asia .
Theodore White , in his book “ The Making of the President 1968 , ” said McNamara argued behind the scenes that the United States must not slip quietly into the war -- that the decision must be brought before Congress and the issue debated openly .
But Kennedy authorized a small - scale increase in troop strength and , after his assassination in 1963 , Johnson bowed to pressure from his generals and began a major buildup that finally had more than 500,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam .
McNamara , convinced the war could be ended by Christmas 1965 , threw his energies into effective execution of Johnson ’s policies but miscalculated resistance to U.S. intervention both in Vietnam and at home .
In late 1967 he criticized the decision to bomb North Vietnam in retaliation for strikes on U.S. bases in the south .
Johnson decided to remove him the following year , offering him the presidency of the World Bank .
Slideshow ( 8 images )
In 1971 , the classified and highly sensitive Pentagon Papers , an official record of the U.S. involvement in Vietnam , were leaked to The New York Times .
In “ McNamara : His Ordeal in the Pentagon , ” Henry Trewhitt wrote that McNamara ordered the study to provide material that might help future generations avoid the mistakes made in Vietnam by intelligent , well - intentioned men like himself .
“ When its contents broke in the press , however , his pleasure at seeing the record clarified was badly diminished by his shock that the two administrations ( Kennedy and Johnson ) had been deceitful about escalating the war , ” Trewhitt wrote .
McNamara was quoted as saying : “ My God , does anyone think I would have commissioned this if reasonable men could conclude that it shows me to be a liar ? ”
FIGHTING POVERTY
At the World Bank , McNamara conducted a crusade against poverty and directed an expansion of World Bank influence .
When he took over the independent United Nations affiliate in 1968 , the bank was making only $ 1 billion in annual loan commitments to Third World nations .
For the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1981 , his last day in office , it lent $ 11.5 billion .
McNamara shifted the emphasis of the bank ’s lending from heavy industry to basics like farming and population control .
Robert Strange McNamara was born in San Francisco on June 9 , 1916 , to Robert James McNamara , a wholesale shoe salesman , and the former Clara Nell Strange , both of British ancestry .
A brilliant student , he graduated from the University of California in 1937 and earned a masters degree from Harvard Business School , where he joined the faculty in 1940 .
While employed at the Pentagon in 1946 , he and nine colleagues sent a prospectus to 20 firms , offering themselves as a “ package deal ” to any company needing managers .
Ford , then in financial trouble , accepted the 10 , all statistics experts nicknamed “ the Whiz Kids . ” McNamara rose to the presidency of Ford by 1960 .
On taking early retirement from the World Bank in 1981 , McNamara kept an office in Washington where he joined dozens of corporate boards , including the Washington Post .
He was also a member of the Trilateral Commission which promoted cooperation between Europe , Japan and the United States .
McNamara married Margaret Craig , a fellow student at the University of California , who died of cancer just before he left the World Bank .
They had a son and a daughter .
And in 2004 , at age 88 , he married his Italian - born sweetheart , Diana Masieri Byfield in Assisi , Italy .

WASHINGTON  The Honduran armed forces issued a communiqué on Saturday indicating that they would not stand in the way of an agreement to return Manuel Zelaya , the country ’s ousted president , to power .
Meanwhile , in Las Manos , a town along the border between Nicaragua and Honduras , Mr. Zelaya made his second symbolic appearance in two days , defying calls from foreign leaders to avoid any moves that might provoke violence in his politically polarized country .
The communiqué was drafted in Washington after days of talks between mid-level Honduran officers and American Congressional aides .
Posted on the Honduran Armed Forces Web site , it endorsed the so - called San José Accord that was forged in Costa Rica by delegates representing President Zelaya and the man who heads the de facto Honduran government , Roberto Micheletti .
The accord , supported by most governments in the hemisphere , would allow Mr. Zelaya to return as president , although with significantly limited executive powers .
Mr. Micheletti has steadfastly rejected Mr. Zelaya ’s return as president .

Editor 's note : Thomas Shapiro is director of the Institute on Assets and Social Policy and Pokross Professor of Law and Social Policy at Brandeis University 's Heller School for Social Policy and Management .
He is the author of " The Hidden Cost of Being African - American : How Wealth Perpetuates Inequality , " and co-author , with Dr. Melvin Oliver , of " Black Wealth / White Wealth . "
Thomas Shapiro says the gap in wealth between blacks and whites has grown .
WALTHAM , Massachusetts ( CNN ) --
Closing the racial wealth gap needs to be at the forefront of efforts to achieve economic opportunity in the 21st century .
Without sufficient assets , it is difficult to lay claim to economic security or true opportunity in American society .
Fifteen years ago , my work with Melvin Oliver identified the racial wealth gap as a fundamental axis of racial inequality , finding that African - Americans owned eight cents of wealth for every dollar owned by whites .
The good news is that the wealth ( median net worth ) of non-whites increased $ 6,600 per person from 1998 to 2007 .
The bad news is that the racial wealth gap is widening .
The latest Survey of Consumer Finances ( SCF ) data indicates that a much wider breach has opened up in racial wealth inequality from the mid-1990s to now .
This pattern reflects a firmly embedded racial stratification .
In 1998 , the net worth of white households on average was $ 100,700 higher than that of African - Americans .
By 2007 , this gap had increased to $ 142,600 .
The SCF survey , which is supported by the Federal Reserve Board , collects this data every three years -- and every time it has been collected , the racial wealth gap has widened .
In short : non-white wealth grew slowly and incrementally while wealth in white families grew 40 percent .
Why such a huge gap ?
' Black in America 2 '
This July , Soledad O'Brien investigates what African - Americans are doing to confront the most challenging issues facing their communities .
You 'll meet people who are using ground - breaking solutions in innovative ways to transform the black experience .
July 22 and 23 , 8 p.m. ET see full schedule »
As demonstrated in my books , " Black Wealth / White Wealth " and " The Hidden Cost of Being African - American , " wealth is accumulated in specific historical contexts that produce varying levels of wealth for different families and social groupings .
Even now , social forces serve as a powerful deterrent to black ambitions for wealth .
Even when blacks have similar educations and incomes , they lag far behind their white counterparts in their quest to accumulate assets .
For African - Americans , equal achievement does not translate to anything near similar wealth .
Some white families historically have enjoyed the benefits of government support and tax policies to buy homes , start businesses , grow wealth and prepare for retirement .
Looking at one important historical example , few if any African - Americans were able to take advantage of the Homestead Acts that provided landowning opportunities for many whites .
Recent history continued this pattern of blocked opportunity because African - Americans were mostly shut out of the greatest wealth - building opportunity of the post - World War II generation -- home ownership .
Residential segregation , Federal Housing Administration practices and restrictive covenants on land titles blocked many African - Americans from owning their own homes for many years .
Home equity is by far the largest bucket of wealth for middle - class Americans .
The basis for excluding African - Americans from opportunities and creating different rules in the competition for success is no longer just about who is a capable worker , but also about who is a worthy credit risk .
As wealth accumulation among African - American families had begun to expand recently , recession , declining stock prices , the foreclosure meltdown and processes of financial institutions converged to shrink , strip and consume it .
Inheritance is another critical factor creating and maintaining the huge racial wealth gap .
My work shows how even small inheritances or gifts can become " transformative assets , " which jump - start a child with college , a career and little debt .
This puts him or her on the road to economic success .
The starting line for young African - Americans is very different because they are less likely to inherit money from their families .
Residential segregation is the linchpin of race relations in America , producing far less housing wealth in African - American communities .
Homes appreciate more in value in predominantly white communities than in integrated communities , and homes appreciate even less when located in minority neighborhoods , especially in urban minority neighborhoods .
Hence , the home appreciation calculus is more about location , location , location -- the racial and ethnic makeup of the community -- than the home itself .
Also critical is the way in which substandard , inferior schools are located predominantly in neighborhoods where minorities and low - income families are concentrated .
The integral connection between residential segregation , housing wealth and education is a fundamental challenge to be faced .
The current housing meltdown and foreclosure crisis affects all communities .
But it has a greater impact on minority communities , because subprime and predatory loans are disproportionately located in those neighborhoods .
Wealth is thus being stripped from these communities while opportunities to build wealth through home ownership are riskier .
The racial wealth inequality is the hidden fault line of American democracy .
We need a new civil rights movement for the 21st century that focuses on economic opportunity and inclusion and closing the racial wealth gap .
This means focusing on reforms that make tax code benefits like the home mortgage interest deduction more equitable ; that enforce fair housing and lending laws already on the books , that provide consumer protection in home and education loans and credit cards and that insure equity in federal programs to rework risky home mortgages .
These measures would be a good start .

Republicans have found many reasons to oppose the Democrats ' health care proposal , but this is one of the oddest .
Betsy McCaughey , chairman of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths and former lieutenant governor of New York state , says the bill goes too far to encourage senior citizens to end their lives .
On the radio show of former Sen. Fred Thompson on July 16 , 2009 , McCaughey said " Congress would make it mandatory — absolutely require — that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner . "
She said those sessions would help the elderly learn how to " decline nutrition , how to decline being hydrated , how to go in to hospice care ... all to do what 's in society 's best interest or in your family 's best interest and cut your life short . "
Her point has caught on with conservative pundits .
On his July 21 show , Rush Limbaugh said the following :
" Mandatory counseling for all seniors at a minimum of every five years , more often if the seasoned citizen is sick or in a nursing home .
...
That 's an invasion of the right to privacy .
We can't have counseling for mothers who are thinking of terminating their pregnancy , but we can go in there and counsel people about to die . "
McCaughey is no stranger to the health care debate .
In 1994 , she wrote a scathing review of the Clinton administration 's health care plan in the New Republic , a left - leaning magazine , arguing that the proposal would lead to rationing of treatment and would prevent patients from choosing health insurance .
Republicans seized on the key points of " No Exit , " forcing the Clintons to issue a response to the article .
She jumped back into the fray earlier this year while Congress was debating a $ 787 billion stimulus package .
In a Feb .
9 Bloomberg op - ed column , McCaughey criticized the bill for including a plan to monitor health treatments to see which are most cost effective .
The elderly , she said , would be denied treatment as a result .
Now the Democratic health care bill is in her sights .
In her chat with Thompson , McCaughey said the language can be found on page 425 of the health care bill , so we started there .
Indeed , Sec. 1233 of the bill , labeled " Advance Care Planning Consultation " details how the bill would , for the first time , require Medicare to cover the cost of end - of - life counseling sessions .
According to the bill , " such consultation shall include the following :
An explanation by the practitioner of advance care planning , including key questions and considerations , important steps , and suggested people to talk to ; an explanation by the practitioner of advance directives , including living wills and durable powers of attorney , and their uses ; an explanation by the practitioner of the role and responsibilities of a health care proxy . "
Medicare will cover one session every five years , the legislation states .
If a patient becomes very ill in the interim , Medicare will cover additional sessions .
Jon Keyserling , general counsel and vice president of public policy for the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization , which supports the provision , said the bill does n't encourage seniors to end their lives , it just allows some important counseling for decisions that take time and consideration .
" These are very serious conversations , " he said .
" It needs to be an informative conversation from the medical side and it needs to be thought about carefully by the patient and their families . "
In no way would these sessions be designed to encourage patients to end their lives , said Jim Dau , national spokeman for AARP , a group that represents people over 50 that has lobbied in support of the advanced planning provision .
McCaughey 's comments are " not just wrong , they are cruel , " said Dau .
" We want to make sure people are making the right decision .
If some one wants to take every life - saving measure , that 's their call .
Others will decide it's not worth going through this trauma just for themselves and their families , and that 's their decision , too . "
Both Keyserling and Dau were particularly troubled that McCaughey insisted — three times , to be exact — that the sessions would be mandatory , which they are not .
For his part , Keyserling said he and outside counsel read the language carefully to make sure that was not the case .
" Neither of us can come to the conclusion that it 's mandatory . " he said .
" This new consultation is just like all in Medicare : it 's voluntary . "
" The only thing mandatory is that Medicare will have to pay for the counseling , " said Dau .
For our ruling on this one , there 's really no gray area here .
McCaughey incorrectly states that the bill would require Medicare patients to have these counseling sessions and she is suggesting that the government is somehow trying to interfere with a very personal decision .
And her claim that the sessions would " tell [ seniors ] how to end their life sooner " is an outright distortion .
Rather , the sessions are an option for elderly patients who want to learn more about living wills , health care proxies and other forms of end - of - life planning .
McCaughey is n't just wrong , she 's spreading a ridiculous falsehood .
That 's a Pants on Fire .
Statement before the US House of Representatives , June 3 , 2009
I rise to oppose this unnecessary and counter - productive resolution regarding the 20th anniversary of the incident in China ’s Tiananmen Square .
In addition to my concerns over the content of this legislation , I strongly object to the manner in which it was brought to the floor for a vote .
While the resolution was being debated on the House floor , I instructed my staff to obtain a copy so that I could read it before the vote .
My staff was told by no less than four relevant bodies within the House of Representatives that the text was not available for review and would not be available for another 24 hours .
It is unacceptable for Members of the House of Representatives to be asked to vote on legislation that is not available for them to read !
As to the substance of the resolution , I find it disturbing that the House is going out of its way to meddle in China ’s domestic politics , which is none of our business , while ignoring the many pressing issues in our own country that definitely are our business .
This resolution calls on the People ’s Republic of China to invite full and independent investigations into the Tiananmen Square crackdown , assisted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the International Committee of the Red Cross 
Where do we get the authority for such a demand ?
I wonder how the US government would respond if China demanded that the United Nations conduct a full and independent investigation into the treatment of detainees at the US - operated Guantanamo facility ?
The resolution calls on the legal authorities of People ’s Republic of China to review immediately the cases of those still imprisoned for participating in the 1989 protests for compliance with internationally recognized standards of fairness and due process in judicial proceedings .
In light of US government ’s extraordinary renditions of possibly hundreds of individuals into numerous secret prisons abroad where they are held indefinitely without charge or trial , one wonders what the rest of the world makes of such US demands .
It is hard to exercise credible moral authority in the world when our motto toward foreign governments seems to be do as we say , not as we do . 
While we certainly do not condone government suppression of individual rights and liberties wherever they may occur , why are we not investigating these abuses closer to home and within our jurisdiction ?
It seems the House is not interested in investigating allegations that US government officials and employees approved and practiced torture against detainees .
Where is the Congressional investigation of the US - operated secret prisons overseas ?
What about the administration ’s assertion of the right to detain individuals indefinitely without trial ?
It may be easier to point out the abuses and shortcomings of governments overseas than to address government abuses here at home , but we have the constitutional obligation to exercise our oversight authority in such matters .
I strongly believe that addressing these current issues would be a better use of our time than once again condemning China for an event that took place some 20 years ago .

現在最高の圧縮効率を誇るAVC/H.264は1 GbpsのフルHDTVを10Mbps以下に圧縮できる。1/100以上の圧縮率ということになるが、次世代beyond
HDTVの8k4kの空間解像度、60〜300fpsの時間解像度、マルチスペクトルの色表現、10〜16bit/pelの画素値深度、複数視点を考えると情報量は16〜200Gbpsとなるため、ビットレートを100Mbpsまで許容したとしても、圧縮率をさらに10倍は引き上げる必要がある(1/1000以上 ) 。
上記の要求に対し、短期的には従来のAVC/H.264で用いられている動き補償予測とDCTを組み合わせたMC+DCTの枠組みを維持し、改良を積み重ねて圧縮率向上を図るアプローチが取られるが、長期的には従来の枠組みに囚われない新たなブレークスルーが必要となる。本エントリでは、情報処理6月号の解説*1より、画像圧縮技術のブレークスルーの萌芽を紹介したい。
疑似表現符号化 ( Pseudo - representation Coding )
従来の符号化が原画にできるだけ忠実に再現することを目的としていたのに対し、疑似表現符号化においては、「似てればOK 」「それっぽければOK」という主観が重視される。たとえば森の映像を表現するとき、木々の一本一本、葉の一枚一枚まで忠実に再現しなくても、全体としてそれっぽく表現されていれば良いとする。
たとえば芝生、土、空、花畑、水、波、煙、風などのテクスチャ領域は、厳密に描画しなくてもそれらしく表現されていれば、画像全体を見た時に違和感がない。そこで、画像中のテクスチャ領域を抽出し、その領域を表現するパラメタセットを符号化、再生側ではパラメタセットからテクスチャを生成して合成するパラメトリックテクスチャが考えられる。グラフカットを用いたテクスチャ合成*2はその一例だ。小さな入力画像から、繰り返しが目立たない大きなテクスチャが生成されていることが分かる。
Graphcut Textures : Image and Video Synthesis Using Graph Cuts
また最近民生機器における応用が活発な超解像*3も有望な技術だ。超解像とは、解像度の低い画像から、本来含まれていない周波数成分を推定して、解像度の高い画像を生成する技術である。時空間的に隣接する情報から欠落領域を再生するinpaintingや、白黒画像からカラー画像を再生するcolorization
*4も超解像の一種だと考えられる。
Colorization using optimization
上 図はcolorizationの適用例であり、凸二次最適化問題を解き、人手によるアノテーションからカラー画像を再現する。サイトには動画もアップされているが、エンコード時に低解像度化や白黒化するなどして情報量を落とし、デコード時に限られた情報量からリッチな情報を生成することができれば、圧縮率の向上が期待できる。

Uncharted : Drake ’s Fortune was undoubtedly one of the best PlayStation 3 titles when it released in 2007 .
And to this date , the Naughty Dog action - adventure title showcases graphics that even rival some of 2009 ’s current generation releases .
As Uncharted 2 : Among
Thieves nears its release date , the game is already looking like it is ready for release .
One aspect the original Uncharted was recognized for were the lush , organic environments –especially the water .
Not only did the water look great , the effects also behaved realistically , from the waves pushing against the jet ski in the upriver traversal to real - time rendering of dampening clothing .
The sequel , Uncharted 2 , looks to have broken the record that the original title set in terms of environment already .
With these results already coming from a title that is not even in the final stages of development , Uncharted 2 : Among
Thieves will truly be the best looking console game when it releases on October 13 .
[ Update ]
It turns out this is an Uncharted : Drake ’s Fortune screenshot .
We apologize for any inconvience .
Anti-war activists in Olympia , Wash . , have exposed Army spying and infiltration of their groups , as well as intelligence gathering by the Air Force , the federal Capitol Police and the Coast Guard .
The infiltration appears to be in direct violation of the Posse Comitatus Act preventing U.S. military deployment for domestic law enforcement and may strengthen congressional demands for a full - scale investigation of U.S. intelligence activities , like the Church Committee hearings of the 1970s .
Brendan Maslauskas
Dunn asked the city of Olympia for documents or e-mails about communications between the Olympia police and the military relating to anarchists , Students for a Democratic Society ( SDS ) or the Industrial Workers of the World ( Dunn 's union ) .
Dunn received hundreds of documents .
One e-mail contained reference to a " John J. Towery II , " who activists discovered was the same person as their fellow activist " John Jacob . "
Dunn told me : " John Jacob was actually a close friend of mine , so this week has been pretty difficult for me .
He said he was an anarchist .
He was really interested in SDS .
He got involved with Port Militarization Resistance ( PMR ) , with Iraq Vets Against the War .
He was a kind person .
He was a generous person .
So it was really just a shock for me . "
" Jacob " told the activists he was a civilian employed at Fort Lewis Army Base and would share information about base activities that could help the PMR organize rallies and protests against public ports being used for troop and Stryker military vehicle deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan .
Since 2006 , PMR activists have occasionally engaged in civil disobedience , blocking access to the port .

Larry Hildes , an attorney representing Washington activists , says the U.S. attorney prosecuting the cases against them , Brian Kipnis , specifically instructed the Army not to hand over any information about its intelligence - gathering activities , despite a court order to do so .
Which is why Dunn 's request to Olympia and the documents he obtained are so important .
The military is supposed to be barred from deploying on U.S. soil , or from spying on citizens .
Christopher Pyle , now a professor of politics at Mount Holyoke College , was a military intelligence officer .
He recalled : " In the 1960s , Army intelligence had 1,500 plainclothes agents [ and some would watch ] every demonstration of 20 people or more .
They had a giant warehouse in Baltimore full of information on the law - abiding activities of American citizens , mainly protest politics . "
Pyle later investigated the spying for two congressional committees : " As a result of those investigations , the entire U.S. Army Intelligence Command was abolished , and all of its files were burned .
Then the Senate Intelligence Committee wrote the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to stop the warrantless surveillance of electronic communications . "
Reps . Barbara Lee , D - Calif. , Rush Holt , D - N.J. , and others are pushing for a new , comprehensive investigation of all U.S. intelligence activities , of the scale of the Church Committee hearings , which exposed widespread spying on and disruption of legal domestic groups , attempts at assassination of foreign heads of state , and more .
Demands mount for information on and accountability for Vice President Dick Cheney 's alleged secret assassination squad , President George W. Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program , and the CIA 's alleged misleading of Congress .
But the spying in Olympia occurred well into the Obama administration ( and may continue today ) .
President Barack Obama supports retroactive immunity for telecom companies involved in the wiretapping , and has maintained Bush - era reliance on the state secrets privilege .
Lee and Holt should take the information uncovered by Brendan Dunn and the Olympia activists and get the investigations started now .

IT WAS once famously asked of Wall Street : “ Where are the customers ' yachts ? ” Shareholders of investment banks have not seen much of the spoils either , given the events of the past two years .
As business booms once more , rather than reward their owners with an extra big chunk of profits , most investment banks seem likely to favour their employees again .
In the case of Goldman Sachs , shareholders received $ 4.4 billion of profits during the first half of this year while staff were allocated $ 11.4 billion in pay and bonuses , equivalent to about half of the firm 's net revenues .
Banks defend their model by arguing that they have to pay top dollar to secure the best employees , who maximise profits for shareholders .
If they paid less , profits would be lower .
For Goldman there may be some truth in this .
In the first half of 2009 shareholders still earned a healthy return on equity of 19 % .
And over the decade to the end of 2008 , even though cumulative compensation was double profits , return on equity averaged 20 % .
Furthermore , since a chunk of bonuses are paid in stock and staff cannot sell their shares immediately , their interests are to some extent aligned with those of shareholders .
There are several holes in the industry 's argument , however .
One is that when investment bankers owned the banks themselves , partners demanded higher returns on their equity than public shareholders now get .
In the three years before the bank floated in 1999 , Goldman partners earned returns on their capital of about 50 % each year .
More importantly , the industry - wide practice of paying out about half of net revenues to employees looks a lot less palatable for shareholders once mediocre or bad banks are taken into account .
This is a risky industry : two of America 's five big stand - alone investment banks collapsed during the crisis .
And when things go wrong employees do not always take their share of the pain .
Lehman Brothers made losses in the two quarters before it collapsed yet continued to accrue a compensation pot not far off the levels of 2007 .
Shareholder returns over the entire cycle look a lot worse when the failures are included .
Lehman paid out $ 55 billion to employees in the decade to the end of 2008 .
Shareholders earned cumulative profits of zero , including the loss of all of their capital when the firm failed ( see chart ) .
Banks pay low dividends , and when they get into trouble the capital that shareholders have retained in the firm typically gets wiped out .
Employees have taken money out of their firms each year .
It may be time for the owners of banks to mutiny over the bounty .
" There is never an excuse for the sort of mindless violence that we have seen .
" My appeal to Victorians today is that we need to work together to tackle this problem ...
If you respect your community and if you respect other people , you do n't beat them senseless . ''
Speaking alongside Mr Brumby , Mr Overland said it was impossible to station an officer in every milk bar or fast - food outlet .
" You can have as many police as you like , but we 're just simply never going to be and can't be everywhere all the time , '' Mr Overland said .
" We can't be expected to stop some of the things we have been seeing happen across the state .
It 's a matter of everyone taking responsibility for that . ''
Their comments followed two vicious attacks in the past week that killed a Canadian tourist and left a young footballer with serious head injuries .
Earlier today , another of Victoria 's top cops conceded that security cameras are not deterring thugs .
Deputy Chief Commissioner Kieran Walshe said assailants were ignoring the closed circuit TV cameras that had proliferated around the city .
" The level of violence has certainly increased dramatically over time .
Just the level of violence that people are undertaking and inflicting on other people is quite disturbing , " he told radio 3 AW this morning .
" If we look at the CCTV that 's out there , it 's been very beneficial to use in being able to solve some of these matters .
" One of the things that disturbs me a little bit is that people just have a disregard for CCTV .
They do n't think it is going to capture them .
" It 's certainly not having the deterrent effect I hoped ... having said that , I still think having CCTV around in public places is the way to go .
" We 've just got to promote it as a deterrent .
We 've got to let people know that if they do these sorts of things they are going to get caught . "
Police have charged three men with murder over the bashing death of a 25 - year - old Canadian man outside a Yarraville pub last week .
Three men have also been charged over the assault in Chapel Street , Prahran , on Monday morning that left Frankston South man Luke Adams , 19 , with serious head injuries .
Police yesterday released shocking footage of the attack on Luke , captured by CCTV cameras in the Hungry Jack 's outlet in Prahran .
Luke 's father Peter said the problem on Melbourne 's streets concerned all citizens , not just those who fell victim to it .
" The complexity of the problem means that the solution needs to [ be ] complex and sophisticated as well , " Mr Adams told radio 3AW .
" This is something everyone needs to take ownership of .
It 's not a matter just for the police .
" They 've got the hardest job .
Everybody else is responsible for addressing this .
It 's an appalling indictment on society when this is happening . "
A crime victims group has added its voice to the debate , claiming the State Government 's " softly , softly approach " is to blame for increasing violence on Melbourne 's streets .
Noel McNamara , president of the Crime Victims Support Association , said it was sickening to hear reports every day of violent assaults and murders .
" The streets are full of drug traffickers and users and they know they 'll not be seriously punished if caught because we 've got a soft government and a soft police command and they 're conspiring with each other , " Mr McNamara said .
" Then you 've got the judges who all come from bleeding heart backgrounds . "
Mr McNamara said Victoria needed a further 3000 police to cope with the upsurge in violence on the streets .
" There should be zero - tolerance , with a mandatory minimum sentence of one year for any crimes of violence , what 's happening now is absolutely disgraceful , something has to be done , " he said .
Loading " They are just out of control , because they know that they will not be punished for what they have done . "

Lieutenant Vargas decided to follow the path of an older friend , John Marquez , whom he looked up to .
Mr. Marquez had worked his way out of the neighborhood by joining the Fire Department .
“ I used to tell him , ‘ You know where I came from  if I can make it , anyone can , ’ ” Mr. Marquez , now a deputy chief in the department , said in an interview .
“ ‘ But do n’t expect anything to be handed to you .

But Lieutenant Vargas ’s aspirations were stymied by a 1988 lawsuit , filed by black firefighters , that shut down hiring for years .
The lawsuit challenged a written test that relatively few nonwhites passed .
In 1994 , the city agreed to disregard the test , over union complaints , and hire 40 firefighters  20 white , 10 black and 10 Hispanic , according to The New Haven Register .
Documentary sparks uproar at Jewish film fest SAN FRANCISCO
Peace activist Rachel Corrie Peace activist Rachel Corrie Photo : Denny Sternstein , AP Photo : Denny Sternstein , AP Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Documentary sparks uproar at Jewish film fest 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
The San Francisco Jewish Film Festival has come under siege after deciding to show a documentary about Rachel Corrie , a Washington state 23 - year - old killed in 2003 while trying to prevent an Israeli military bulldozer from demolishing a Palestinian 's home .
Whether Corrie naively put herself in harm 's way in support of terrorists or was intentionally killed by the Israeli military is the nexus of the controversy .
Compounding the issue , festival organizers invited Corrie 's mother , Cindy , to speak after today 's showing at the Castro Theatre of the film " Rachel . "
It is one of 71 films at this year 's festival , which includes two films profiling kidnapped Israeli soldiers .
The reaction has been outrage .
The festival board 's president stepped down from her role , opening - night ceremonies were boycotted by some , and Israel Consul General Akiva
Tor said it was a " big mistake to invite Mrs. Corrie . "
At the core of the debate are questions about how broadly Jews can discuss Israel within their own community - and how Jews represent Israel to the broader world .
It is also overlaid with accusations of the " new anti-Semitism , " prejudice that is disguised as particular criticisms of Israel , the only Jewish state .
" The furor is much larger than this one film or this one speaker , " said Peter L. Stein , the festival 's executive director .
" It reveals a rift in our community that we all need to help understand and hopefully heal . "
Family feud
The 29 - year - old festival is the oldest and largest Jewish film festival in the nation , yet it 's also like a small family .
The film festival 's board includes members with close links to both the accusers and those accused of the new anti-Semitism .
Allegations of new anti-Semitism have been particularly vociferous from the Koret and Taube foundations , longtime backers of the festival .
The foundations criticized Jewish Voice for Peace and the American Friends Service Committee , a Quaker organization widely considered to be on the vanguard of Christian pacificism .
The festival had asked the two groups to promote " Rachel " within their constituencies .
The two Jewish foundations issued a joint statement labeling the Quaker and Jewish peace organizations as " two virulently anti-Israel , anti-Semitic " groups associated with " groups that aid and abet terror against the Jewish state . "
Mervyn Danker , San Francisco director of the American Jewish Committee , also called the Quaker group " virulently anti-Semitic " because it had co-hosted - with other Christian pacificists - a dinner with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The Iranian president has called the Holocaust a myth and declared that " Israel must be wiped off the map . "
" This goes beyond the acceptable realms of open discourse , " said Danker .
The Quaker group
Mark Graham , external affairs director for the Philadelphia - based American Friends Service Committee , said his organization does n't support " anything that aids and abets terror , " nor does it have any boycotts against Israel .
" We 're a Quaker pacificist organization , in our founding and our roots , " he said .
" Things that promote violence , such as arms sales , are things we 're against . "
As for the dinner with Ahmadinejad , Graham said , " fundamental in the DNA of this organization is that differences can be resolved through dialogue .
Having a dinner was one way to have a dialogue . "
Cindy Corrie , meanwhile , said she was surprised at the uproar at this festival , which did not happen at a screening of " Rachel " at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York .
" I do n't think it has a whole lot to do with me , " she said .
" It has more to do with the discussion that is happening within the Jewish community and how that discussion has grown - which is a very healthy thing . "

In the rarefied corridors of Britain 's publishing houses , it has been a grim few weeks .
Hitherto bankable authors are being shown the door and profits are tumbling .
Penguin , one of the most venerable names in the book trade , is the latest to shed jobs , announcing 100 redundancies .
To make matters worse , that mainstay of summer sales – the Richard & Judy Book Club reading list – has made its last - ever recommendations .
September is even at the best of times a crucial month as publishers pit their best novelists against each other in the search for bumper end - of - year sales , with a scattering of new hardbacks by heavyweight authors .
Little wonder that this year it is being eyed by senior managers with a certain amount of apprehension , if not dread .
As the recession finally begins to bite in an industry which has previously found itself largely impervious to economic downturns , publishers are set to bombard bookshops and supermarket shelves in the opening days of September with an unprecedented flood of works by their strongest names .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
With book sales in Britain recently reported to be 11.5 per cent lower than a year earlier , so it will be a make - or - break week or so for publishers ' profit margins .
In the words of one fearful executive , it will " mean the difference between caviar or cat food for Christmas dinner " .
Looming over this gathering of some of contemporary literature 's most illustrious performers is that nonpareil of modern bulk fiction , Dan Brown , of The Da Vinci Code .
His follow - up to the hugely successful thriller is published on 15 September with 6.5 m copies , the biggest initial print run in the history of its publisher , Random House .
In an attempt to gain a fleeting appearance in front - of - stores before Brown 's The Lost Symbol makes its debut , authors including Sebastian Faulks , Nick Hornby and William Trevor have had the publication dates of their latest works brought forward .
Faulks , whose James Bond novel Devil May Care last year became Penguin 's fastest - ever selling hardback , was due to have his new book , A Week in December , released early next year ; it will instead hit the shelves on 3 September .
It may well be a wise move .
While critics may turn up their noses at the aesthetic qualities of Brown 's prose , there is no doubting his ability to shift industrial quantities of literature .
The Da Vinci Code has sold 81 million copies , and with his three other books the American holds the top four positions in Britain 's list of highest - selling paperbacks .
As that first Thursday in September shapes up as a bottleneck for literary titans , vying with Faulks will be Hornby , who has three previous books which have broken the barrier of a million sales , Booker Prize winner JM Coetzee , Iain Banks and Sadie Jones , winner of last year 's Costa First Novel Prize .
The latest book from Margaret Atwood , the revered Canadian author , appears the next day .
Simon Burke , fiction buying manager at Waterstone 's , said : " There is always a pretty good line - up in September ahead of the Christmas market , but this year 's list is unprecedented .
Most publishers look to the potential for getting a book to number one in the week that it is published , and they realise that is nigh on impossible if they go head - to - head with Dan Brown .
" There 's no doubt that when The Lost Symbol is published it will dominate for quite some time . "
The battle for festive sales is given an added edge by a wider economic climate which has finally brought the harsh realities of faltering consumer confidence to the previously insulated bank balances of the big publishing houses .
Penguin last week announced it was " preparing for the future " by making 100 staff at its London office redundant , or about 10 per cent of its workforce ; Random House and HarperCollins have already shed five per cent of their workforces .
The value of sales in Britain 's £ 4bn book publishing industry fell 6.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year , after more than a decade of strong growth , and the downward trend is continuing .
Overall , the volume of books being sold has stagnated for the last two years at around 855 million books per annum .
Even that hitherto gold - plated guarantor of publishing success , inclusion in the list of the recommendations for the Richard & Judy Book Club , has lost its sparkle .
The franchise , which famously made the couple 's executive producer ( and book chooser in chief ) Amanda Ross one of the most powerful people in publishing , came to a close last week with the second - lowest sales in its five - year history .
The eight titles in the 2009 summer reading list have so far sold 338,834 copies , compared with the 1.1 million sales by last year 's selection .
One senior publishing executive said : " Even allowing for the fact that Richard and Judy were no longer on a mainstream channel , I think those numbers show the wider picture .
Those impulse buys at Tesco or WH Smith or Waterstone 's that have helped to drive growth have melted away .
If things are a bit tight , then you wo n't spend that extra £ 8 at the checkout .
As a result you wo n't find one imprint in the land that is n't reviewing its [ author ] lists and looking to sell well on the established names . "
Superficially , publishing budgets look as lavish as ever .
Shortly before announcing its job losses , Penguin revealed it had paid £ 1.7 m for the rights to Vikram Seth 's A Suitable Girl , while Transworld has paid a £ 2 m advance to entertainer Paul O'Grady for the second installment of his autobiography – double the sum he was paid for the first volume .
But industry insiders say that behind the scenes established authors are being quietly told to seek a new publisher , while advances are being slashed to a quarter of what would have been on offer as recently as two years ago .
Historians in particular have been badly hit , with books that would have earned a £ 120,000 advance now typically receiving just £ 30,000 , and some imprints cutting their output in half .
Jonny Geller , managing director of the books division of the Curtis Brown literary agency , said he had seen advances of £ 70,000 to some authors cut to £ 25,000 .
He said : " It is crippling them .
Publishing has become quite reactive .
It is sales - led .
We need publishers to start taking risks again . "
Even that buttress of the publisher 's bottom line in recent years , the ghost - written celebrity memoir , is showing signs of wear .
In April , Waterstone 's blamed a 4.5 per cent drop in its sales on declining interest in celebrity biographies and travel books .
Liz Thomson , a former editor of Publishing News who now runs the book news website BookBrunch .co.uk , said that " At the moment we still have publishers spending big money on big names while trimming their budgets elsewhere .
I know of at least one respected author whose previous books have sold moderately well but has been told by their mainstream publisher to go elsewhere .
" The publishing fixation with celebrities has been one of the less edifying trends of recent years and I think perhaps that is beginning to cool .
There have been a few big buy - ups which have not made back the money that was paid for them .
At the same time , quality fiction is still doing very well , " she says .
" If publishers were a bit more sensible about what they paid , they would be in a better position than they are now . "

119 Million Americans Must Be Wrong
As the health insurance industry and its defenders in Congress lay out their case against permitting a public option in a reform bill , perhaps their most curious argument is that some 119 million Americans are ready to dump their private plans and jump to something more like Medicare – and that ’s why the choice ca n’t be permitted .
Email
Printer friendly
In other words , the industry and its backers are acknowledging that more than one - third of the American people are so dissatisfied with their private health insurance that they trust the U.S. government to give them a fairer shake on health care .
The industry says its allies in Congress must prevent that .
The peculiar argument that 119 million Americans must be denied the public option that they prefer has been made most notably by Sen.
Chuck Grassley of Iowa , ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , which is one of two panels that has jurisdiction over the health insurance bill .
“ As many as 119 million Americans would shift from private coverage to the government plan , ” Grassley wrote in a column for Politico.com .
That migration , Grassley said , would “ put America on the path toward a completely government - run health care system .
…
Eventually , the government plan would overtake the entire market . ”
Grassley ’s logic is that so many Americans would prefer a government - run plan that the private health insurance industry would collapse or become a shadow of its current self .
That , in turn , would lead even more Americans entering the government plan , making private insurance even less viable .
Rarely has an argument more dramatically highlighted the philosophical question of whether in a democracy , the government should represent the people ’s interests or an industry ’s .
But Grassley said he is simply upholding “ the promise that if you like the coverage you have , you can keep it . …
That ’s why I ’m concerned about a government - run plan that forces people out of private insurance . ”
The counter - argument , of course , might be that if the health insurance industry had n’t dissatisfied so many customers – indeed forcing many sick people into bankruptcy because of excessive fees , denial of coverage and gaps in permitted medical treatments – there would n’t be so many Americans eager for a public option .
So , now to protect the health insurance industry , Congress must stop 119 million Americans from leaping into the arms of a government plan .
Grassley is joined in his position by nearly the entire Republican contingent in Congress .
It also appears a few key Democrats , particularly Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , D - Montana , agree at least in part .
Baucus has kept a single - payer option “ off the table ” during the debate even as he claimed “ all options are on the table . ”
He also has suggested that Congress might have to “ sculpt ” any public option , presumably to make it less appealing to Americans if some version survives in the reform bill .
President Barack Obama , whose mother had to fight with her health insurance company while dying of cancer , says he continues to favor including a public option in the bill as necessary to keep the insurance industry honest .
Sen .
Ted Kennedy , chairman of the Health and Education Committee which also has jurisdiction over the bill , also favors a strong public plan .
However , there is the additional fact that executives from health insurance companies and related industries are major campaign contributors to members of Congress on both sides of the aisle .
For instance , since 2005 , Grassley ’s various political action committees have collected nearly $ 1.3 million in donations from the industries related to the health insurance debate , according to OpenSecrets.org .
Grassley ’s top four donor groups were Health ( $ 411,956 ) ; Insurance ( $ 307,348 ) ; Pharmaceuticals ( $ 233,850 ) ; and Hospitals ( $ 197,137 ) .
Eighth on Grassley ’s donor list were HMOs at $ 130,684 .
On the other hand , the health insurance industry appears about as popular with Americans as the tobacco industry , with both considered highly hazardous to your health .
Except that Americans can choose not to smoke , while they run enormous risks for themselves and their families if they do n’t have some form of health insurance .
Health insurance companies do negotiate rates with hospitals and doctors that are far below what is charged to people who do n’t have insurance , sometimes as low as one - tenth what the uninsured patient might be charged .
These disparities , in effect , force many Americans to sign up for private insurance even if the insurance fees are excessive , padded with handsome profits for investors and unproductive bureaucratic costs ( including investigations into whether people can be denied payments because of undisclosed “ preexisting conditions ” ) .
If the health insurance industry had its way , Congress would produce a bill that simply required Americans ( or their employers ) to buy health insurance from private industry .
That way , the government would compel citizens to become customers while denying them a choice of the public plan .
To avoid such an outcome , proponents of the public option – including those 119 million Americans who are ready to sign up – will have to overcome opposition from Republicans and some Democrats who are determined to protect the interests of the private health insurance industry .

Last night , MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow continued the tear she 's been on over the past several weeks , in her multi-part , ongoing series [ link to Youtube videos of segments of Maddow 's series ] that delves into Jeff Sharlet 's research on The Family and the increasingly notorious " C Street House " .
As revealed Tuesday on the Rachel Maddow Show , footage shows US GOP Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe discussing being dispatched by " Family " head Douglas Coe , to Africa , on trips paid for by the US government and American taxpayers during which Inhofe , by his own words , promoted The Family 's theological views to kings and top government leaders .
The words “ Last picture taken ” before his or her death conjure up many emotions , whether in front of the camera or behind it .
This list consists of 10 last time stamps in history taken of and by some fascinating individuals .
If anyone has new or conflicting information concerning the photos or information in this list I hope you will share it in your comments .
10 Wiley Post & Will Rogers 1898 – 1935 , 1879 – 1935
Wiley
Post who was the first pilot to fly solo around the world and his good friend Will Rogers a famous comedian , humorist and social commentator were set out to fly around the world together .
This photo ( that ’s Will Rogers in the hat and tie , standing on the wing ) was taken on August 15 , 1935 shortly before taking off from a lagoon near Point Barrow Alaska .
During take off
Post ’s experimental Lockheed Explorer sea plane crashed when its engine failed killing both men .
Interesting Fact : The airport in Barrow Alaska was renamed Wiley Post – Will Rogers Memorial Airport .
9 John and Jackie Knill
On January 13 , 2005 the bodies of Canadian couple John and Jackie Knill were discovered on a Thailand beach resort .
They were two of the many victims killed from the December 26 2004 tsunami .
Weeks later a Seattle man doing relief work found a damaged camera and discarded it but kept the memory card in the camera .
After downloading the images he discovered pictures of the Knill ’s enjoying their vacation , as well as shots of a huge wave approaching the shore .
With each picture it shows the wave getting closer and closer to shore .
The last picture taken of them before the wave hit ( shown above ) was shot just after 8.30 am on December 26 .
Interesting Fact :
The Seattle man that discovered the images recognized the Knills from a missing person ’s web site and contacted the couple ’s two sons in Vancouver Canada .
The man then drove from Seattle to Vancouver to give the sons their parent ’s last images .
8 Albert Einstein b.1879 d.1955
The photograph above is the last known picture of Einstein , taken in March , 1955 .
There are not a lot of details concerning this photo but he is probably at his home near Princeton , New Jersey .
A month later on April 17 , 1955 , Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an aortic aneurysm , which had previously been diagnosed and reinforced .
He went to the hospital and took a draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the State of Israel ’s seventh anniversary with him .
Unfortunately he did not live long enough to complete it .
The following day Einstein died at the age of 76 .
Interesting Fact : Einstein ’s brain was removed within seconds of his death ( without the permission of his family ) in hope that future neuroscience would be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent .
Recent scientific studies have suggested that regions involved in speech and language are smaller , while regions involved with numerical and spatial processing are larger .
7 Marilyn Monroe b.1926 d 1962
Many believe Celebrity photographer George Barris took the last pictures of Marilyn Monroe .
However , it was actually Life Magazine ’s photographer Allan Grant .
The pictures were taken July 7 , 1962 during an interview at her home .
Six pictures appeared in Life including the one pictured above .
Just under a month later on August 5 , 1962 , the LAPD received a call at 4:25 AM from Dr. Hyman Engelberg proclaiming that Monroe was dead at her home in Brentwood , Los Angeles .
The official cause of Monroe ’s death was classified as “ acute barbiturate poisoning ” , and was also recorded as a “ probable suicide .
Many questions still remain unanswered about the circumstances of her death and the timeline from when Monroe ’s body was found .
Interesting Fact : The Life Magazine issue featuring Monroe ’s interview was dated August 3 1962 , just 2 day before her death .
6 Bill Biggart 1947 - 2001
Photojournalist Bill Biggart was covering the events of September 11th and was Tragically killed as the second tower of the World Trade Center came down .
Four days later Biggart ’s body was recovered from the rubble and his personal effects , including his cameras were given to his wife .
Biggart ’s widow later handed over the camera bag to a good friend and fellow photographer .
She was convinced that no pictures had survived because the falling debris had blown off the backs of the two film cameras and the lids of the film canisters had been peeled back .
His friend turned his attention to the digital camera that was covered by ash .
The lens had been sheared off but when he opened the chamber that held the flash card he discovered it was in pristine condition .
The card contained 150 pictures including the last picture taken shown above which is time stamped 10:28 am and 24 seconds .
The time was 10:30 am when the second tower came down .
Interesting Fact :
When Biggart ’s wife reached him on his cell phone shortly after the first tower fell .
He told her not to worry , and would meet her in 20 minutes at his studio .
“ I ’m safe , ” he assured her , “ I ’m with the firemen . ”
It was the last time they ever spoke .
About 20 minutes later , the second tower collapsed
5 Lady Diana 1961 d.1997
Last year when the long - awaited inquest into Lady Diana ’s death began , this picture was released that shows the last picture taken before the crash .
The press competed to be the first to print it even though the last photo ended up just showing part of her hair .
Unfortunately and ironically photos like this one ended up contributing to the crash that ended her life .
The photo shows the four speeding away from the Ritz Paris At around 12:20 a.m. on August 31 , 1997 with Henri Paul the hotel driver , right , and Dodi Fayed ’s bodyguard Trevor Rees - Jones in the passenger seat .
In the rear seat is Princess Diana ( looking back at the pursuing paparazzi ) with Dodi Fayed sitting next to her .
Seconds after this picture was taken the Mercedes entered the Place de l’Alma underpass going at an estimated speed of 105 km/h ( 65 mph . )
The driver lost control of the car and swerved to the left before colliding head - on with one of the pillars in the tunnel .
Dodi Fayed and Henri Paul both died instantly .
Trevor Rees - Jones was still conscious and had suffered multiple serious injuries to the face .
Diana was critically injured but died later that morning in the hospital leaving Rees - Jones the only survivor .
Interesting Fact :
As the casualties lay seriously injured or dead in their wrecked car , the photographers continued to take pictures .
Critically injured Diana was reported to murmur the words , “ oh my God , ” and after the photographers were pushed away by emergency teams , the words , “ leave me alone ” .
4 Elvis Presley 1935 – 1977
This last known photo of Elvis was taken on August 16 1977 at 12.28 am .
The picture was snapped as he is pulling into Graceland after a night out .
That afternoon Presley was found on his bathroom floor by fiancée , Ginger Alden .
According to the medical investigator , Presley had “ stumbled or crawled several feet before he died ” ; he had apparently been using the bathroom at the time .
Death was officially pronounced at 3:30 pm at Baptist Memorial Hospital .
Interesting Fact : Elvis had visited his dentist on August 15th to have a temporary crown put in and has been suggested that the codeine the dentist gave him that day resulted in an anaphylactic shock that assisted in his death because he had suffered allergic reactions to the drug previously .
3 Adolf Hitler 1889 – 1945
This last know picture of Hitler was taken approximately two days prior to his death as he stands outside his Berlin bunker entrance surveying the devastating bomb damage .
With Germany lying in ruins after six years of war , and with defeat imminent , Hitler decided to take his own life .
But before doing so , he married Eva Braun and then penned his last will and testament .
The next day in the afternoon on April 30 , 1945 Braun and Hitler ’ entered his living room to end their lives .
Later that afternoon the remaining members of the bunker community found Hitler slumped over , and blood spilled over the arm of the couch .
Eva was sitting at the other end .
Hitler had killed himself by biting down on a cyanide capsule while shooting him self in the head .
Eva only used the cyanide capsule .
Interesting Fact :
When Hitler asked his physician to recommend a reliable method of suicide his doctor suggested combining a dose of cyanide with a gunshot to the head .
2 Anne Frank b.1929 –d.1945
This is believed to be the last known photo of Anne Frank with her sister Margot taken in early to mid 1942 .
Later that year
In July her sister Margot would be among the first to receive notice that she was to be sent to Nazi Germany ordering her to report for relocation to a work camp .
Anne was then told by her father that the family would go into hiding .
The Frank family was discovered and arrested on the morning of August 4th 1944 .
Having been arrested in hiding , they were considered criminals and were sent to the Punishment Barracks for hard labor .
In March 1945 , a typhus epidemic spread through the camp and killed approximately 17,000 prisoners .
Witnesses later testified that Margot fell from her bunk in her weakened state and was killed by the shock , and that a few days later Anne Frank died .
Interesting Fact :
In April 1945 just weeks after Anne Frank ’s death , the camp was liberated by British troops .
1 Abraham Lincoln b.1809 – 1865
There is some controversy as to which photograph is the last picture of Abraham Lincoln taken before he was assassinated .
I ran across three different photos on the Internet that claim last picture .
However from information recently discovered the general consensus is the photo pictured above is the one .
It was taken by Henry J. Warren during a photo session around the time of his inauguration .
Mr. Warren took some candid photographs of crowd scenes on March 4th and two day later on March 6th Warren took this picture out on the White House Balcony .
A little over a month after this picture was taken on April 14 , 1865 Lincoln attended a play at Ford ’s Theater .
John Wilkes Booth a well - known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland crept up behind the President ’s box and waited for the funniest line of the play , hoping the laughter would cover the noise of the gunshot .
When the laughter came Booth jumped into the box with the President and aimed a single - shot , round - slug .44 caliber Derringer at his head , firing at point - blank range .
Interesting Fact :
As mentioned above many Internet sites claim a different last picture taken of Lincoln claiming a date of April 10 , 1865 .
( Just 4 days before the assassination )
New evidence indicates what they thought was the last photo was used to paint a portrait .
That particular portrait was painted February 5th 1865 .
This being the case , the Warren photo suddenly became the last picture taken of Lincoln alive .
Dallas Munroe , who will be two next week , spent 40 tear - filled minutes stuck to the vending machine outside Foodworks at Glenmore Shopping Village before paramedics took him to hospital .
Emergency department medics finally ended the tot 's ordeal by dismantling the machine .
Dallas Munroe , who will be two next week , spent 40 tear - filled minutes stuck to the vending machine outside Foodworks at Glenmore Shopping Village before paramedics took him to hospital .
Emergency department medics finally ended the tot 's ordeal by dismantling the machine .
Allan Reinikka
ALL little Dallas Munroe wanted was a handful of lollies .
But the Rocky toddler got a lot more than he bargained for when he rammed his arm as far as it would go into a vending machine in his quest for Teddy Bear candy - like a visit from some nice firefighters in their shiny red engine , a ride in an ambulance and a trip to the hospital .
Dallas , who will be two next week , was not happy when he could n't get his hand out of the machine .
And not just because he did n't get the lollies he craved .
Stuck fast and in obvious distress he yelled and hollered as his grandad and mum and passers - by tried in vain to free him .
When the firefighters arrived , Dallas 's mum Ashley Maguire tried to soothe the frightened tot as officers used soapy water in a vain effort to slide his arm out
But when that did n't work , and with the Frenchville youngster beyond consolation , station officer John Hartley decided there was only one thing for it : Dallas , and the machine , would have to go to hospital .
A fireman unbolted the glass and metal container from its frame .
And so it was that 40 minutes after his curiosity and sweet tooth got the better of him , paramedics lowered him onto a stretcher , still up to his elbow in the lolly dispenser , for a 10 - minute ride from Glenmore Shopping Village to the emergency room at Rockhampton Hospital .
A well - wisher gave him a chocolate frog and someone else had handed him a small red teddy bear to cuddle , but Dallas was still crying .
“ I think it will be the last time he 'll stick his hand in a lolly machine , ” said station officer Hartley .
A hospital spokesman said Dallas was eventually extricated in the emergency department .

In 2003 “ Nature ” published a study showing that 90 % of the large fish living in our oceans were fished out of existence .
A group of scientists recently predicted , major seafood stocks will collapse by 2048 .
This is a staggering number , considering the technology and amount of people needed to cause overfishing is a relatively new phenomenon , starting really only in the late 19th century .
Most governments have shrugged these claims off , and continued their fishing practices .
Alaska has shown to be the only sovereign state willing to self - police their fishing practices .
Sarah Palin jokes aside …
Threatened with the loss of one of its top industries , Alaska began limiting the number of fishing vessels , restricting the size of their catches ; and perhaps most importantly , giving incentives to fishermen .
Alaska currently gives fishermen a stake in the long - term viability of salmon and other fish .
Alaska ’s policies have shown that governments can prevent the onslaught being brought forth on our oceans , yet their policies are the exception to the rule .
Only about 6 % of the global fish catch is certified as “ sustainable , ” meaning that fish are not pulled from the ocean faster than they can reproduce and are not caught in ways to protect underwater habitats .
Much of the 6 % of sustainable catch comes from Alaska itself .
Fish and other marine animals help maintain the ocean ’s ecosystem .
Fish eat algae and keep microbes in check .
Overfishing accelerates the spread of algae and microbes , which smother coral reefs and create “ dead zones ” in coastal waters that starve most sea life of oxygen .
In other words , disturbing the balance of the ecosystem by overfishing creates a vicious cycle that sucks even more life from our oceans .
The problem lies with humans ’ emotional detachment from our oceans .
Large parts of our oceans here on earth go unexplored , while planets not of this earth are meticulously studied .
The ocean is foreign to most humans ; we cannot live in them , and it is not sustainable for our type of living ( namely , breathing air ) .
This emotional detachment has allowed us to go on slaughtering animals that make up our oceans .
Like most problems our environment faces , education is the key .
We must educate what overfishing does to not only our environment , but to our economy .
When 2048 comes along , and major economic fishing stocks have collapsed , it will be a sad day for environmentalists and fishermen alike .
I hope that everyone can look at the example that Alaska has given us .
The key to solving this problem is having scientists and fishermen working together to protect a common interest .
Only then will future heartbroken generations be able to hear the phrase : “ Well , there are plenty of fish in the sea . ”

Air France Fluglinie verbietet Männern Plätze neben Kindern
Keine männlichen Passagiere neben alleinreisenden Kindern : Die Air France hat aus Sicherheitsgründen eine neue Sitzordnung eingeführt .
Auslöser sollen Klagen sein , dass sich Männer unangemessen verhalten haben .
WASHINGTON -- Support for President Barack Obama 's health - care effort has declined over the past five weeks , particularly among those who already have insurance , a Wall Street Journal / NBC
News poll found , amid prolonged debate over costs and quality of care .
In mid-June , respondents were evenly divided when asked whether they thought Mr. Obama 's health plan was a good or bad idea .
In the new poll , conducted July 24 - 27 , 42 % called it a bad idea while 36 % said it was a good idea .

About six and a half years ago I discovered Daily Kos .
It was shortly after the 2002 election , and I was hooked .
There was a bunch of campaign talk , but what really sucked me in were the posts by Markos and the late Steve Gilliard on the idiocy of the war and the horrible planning they were reporting even before the invasion in March 2003 .
I started commenting in threads — there were no diaries in those days — and within a few months , Markos asked me to become what was then called a guest blogger , and has since become known as a contributing editor .
Daily Kos has been a constant in my life over these last six years .
I love the community , I love having an incredible platform for my writing , I love the interaction my pieces generate , and I love being able to combine my contributions to DKos with my work as a political professional electing and serving Democrats .
I 've worked in a state legislature , for labor unions , on Capitol Hill , and on campaigns .
Since I 've been at Daily Kos , I 've done several campaigns ; I worked in Louisiana helping legislative candidates , I worked for Wesley Clark , I helped run the campaign against Michigan 's idiotic marriage amendment , and I 've managed two successful races against incumbent Republican Congressmen .
My next challenge is to take out a third member of Congress : Minnesota Republican Michele Bachman .
Over the years I 've done races , I 've never written or commented on Daily Kos about anything on which I was directly involved ; while managing the campaigns of Paul Hodes and Jim Himes — now Democratic Congressmen from , respectively , New Hampshire and Connecticut — I did n't comment on their races .
I keep my blogging and my professional work separate .
But we 're now codifying what 's always been the practice , and as you can see from my Daily Kos bio , I 'm now officially on leave from my duties as a contributing editor to the site .
I will still be around , however .
I wo n't be involved in any of the administrative activities of the site , but I 'll probably still write an occasional piece as a featured writer , at least until the campaign really heats up and I ’m working 80 hours a week .
And I 'll still be commenting in threads and participating in the community .
But for the next 16 months , my obligations lie in doing whatever I can to elect Elwyn Tinklenberg to Congress and relieving Michele Bachmann of her duties so she can spend more time warning Americans of the threats posed by the US Census Bureau .
I 've just recently arrived in Minnesota , but I 've already gotten to know El quite well , and he's as decent and honorable a candidate as I 've ever worked with .
He 's a former minister whose sense of service has extended in to other forms of public service , such as serving as mayor of his town of Blaine , and becoming an expert in transportation .
( As Minnesota 's Commissioner of Transportation , he oversaw the implementation of the Twin Cities ' light commuter rail system , which met its 20 year ridership goals in its second year of operation ) .
He 'll be posting more diaries on Daily Kos .
I 'm incredibly excited to work for someone I 'm absolutely certain will be a great member of Congress , a Democrat who I respect and who I 'm confident you will as well , and who I already like tremendously as a person .
And it 's exciting to get the opportunity to work on what I think is the premier Congressional race in the country .
Minnesotan Kossacks , please let me know if when you get together ; I 've gotten to know Kossacks where I 've lived in the last six years , including my home state of Michigan , in New Hampshire , Connecticut and in DC .
Many of these folks have become close friends , and I hope to make more friends in Minnesota .
And I hope we can work together .

Campaign proves grass roots can send powerful message even in an age of corporate controlled media lockdown

The Obama Joker posters are still spreading virally across the country and the world as the authorities panic at the power of the grass roots to reach the masses almost in an instant , flying in the face of an establishment media which is controlled by a handful of powerful corporations .
The success of the Obama Joker poster campaign , started anonymously in Los Angeles and amplified after it was incorporated into an Infowars contest , can be measured against the achievements of America ’s foremost contemporary street artist , Shepard Fairey , who was responsible for designing the Obama “ HOPE ” flyers that were posted in public places before the 2008 presidential election , an image labeled “ the most efficacious American political illustration since ‘ Uncle Sam Wants You ' ” by New Yorker art critic Peter Schjeldahl .
Fairey admitted that he was in contact with the Obama campaign team following the release of the early versions of his poster , and that they directed him in creating new posters .
The original poster carried the word “ PROGRESS , ” but this was later changed to “ HOPE ” on the insistence of the Obama campaign , along with two other versions which read , “ VOTE ” and “ CHANGE ” .
President Obama himself later wrote to Fairey expressing his gratitude to the designer for putting out the images and also lending support for people who were posting them in public , an action which attracted little attention from the authorities , who on the contrary reacted hysterically to the anti-Obama Joker posters and immediately sought arrests and denounced the flyers as “ vandalism , ” characterizing them as some kind of assault on “ victims ” of a dastardly crime .
Fairey was largely dismissive of the Obama Joker poster , rather pedantically arguing that it was n’t grammatically correct because the word should have been “ socialist ” not “ socialism , ” but he was forced to admit that the posters sent a powerful message .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ The artwork is great in that it gets a point across really quickly , ” Fairey told the L.A. Times .
“ The Joker is a sinister , evil character that ca n’t be trusted .
And if they want to make that parallel with Obama — bam . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
It took the best part of a decade for Fairey ’s iconic “ Andre the Giant Has a Posse ” street art to go viral , but in the Internet age , the Obama Joker image has already trumped it in a matter of weeks .
The flyers have already hit Wall Street , Tokyo Japan , Berlin Germany , and hundreds of towns and cities across America .
Attempts on behalf of authorities and the media to propagate the contrived hoax that the majority of people are “ disgusted ” by the image have been proven fraudulent by polls showing that most people support the first amendment rights of people to post the flyers .
Likewise , efforts to chill free speech and intimidate people from exercising their first amendment have merely been met with an intensified effort to post more and more of the Obama Joker posters .
Early claims that the poster had racist overtones were shot down when images were unearthed of George W. Bush depicted as the Joker , as well as a blood - sucking vampire .
Lazy attempts to play the race card in an attempt to dismiss the grass roots power of the Obama as Joker meme failed completely .
Indeed , caricatures of political figures have been part of the fabric of American society for hundreds of years .
Satirical lampooning of authority figures by means of stylized cartoonish parodies is an American tradition , and has nothing whatsoever to do with racism .
The success of the Obama Joker poster campaign , concurrent with Obama ’s rapidly sinking popular approval figures , is proof that even in the face of a locked down corporate media owned by a handful of interests , the people can still communicate with the masses and obtain instant recognition by means of viral campaigns coordinated through the alternative media and the Internet .

Comment on this article
By Brett Bull
In the first half of the 20th century , Tokyo was bitten by the modernist bug .
The violent upheavals seen in Western art , literature , music and fashion found parallels over here — but it was architecture that provided the most visible and lasting testament to the changes underfoot .
Buildings like the Tokyo Central Post Office ( 1931 ) in Marunouchi demonstrated the increasing influence of such Western architects as Le Corbusier and concepts like Bauhaus .
In the decades following World War II , with industrialization suffocating creativity , postmodernism came to the forefront .
Experts considered architect Minoru Takeyama ’s colorful Ichibankan ( 1969 ) and monochrome Nibankan ( 1970 ) , situated in the nightlife quarter of Kabukicho , to be the first examples of this new avant - garde spirit .
Today , Ichibankan is completely closed , and Nibankan , whose exterior is riddled with chipped paint and cracked concrete , maintains only a first - floor restaurant in operation .
Ownership changed two years ago .
During a meeting with the buildings ’ present owner , Sankei Hotel , a lodging operator that specializes in business and love hotels , representatives of the company indicated that the future use of the structures has not been decided .
Such a potential reprieve is rare , as the elimination of Japan ’s landmark properties becomes routine and calls for preservation are crushed by developers ’ wrecking balls .
The challenges facing preservationists are numerous .
Last October , entertainment company Shochiku announced that the Kabuki-za theater in Ginza , Japan ’s home for kabuki since it was founded in 1889 , will close next year and be reinstalled inside a large office complex by 2013 .
Reconstructed twice , its 1924 incarnation incorporated a new style of non-burnable building materials .
The current five - decade - old building achieved tangible cultural property status in 2002 .
Shochiku said in an email statement that the Kabuki-za is an aging structure that is susceptible to earthquakes .
“ Taking into consideration that its facilities are not barrier - free , we decided that it would be in the best interest of our customers for us to rebuild the theater . ”
In addition to the financial hurdles inherent in upgrading aging mechanical and electrical systems , architects believe that revisions to earthquake - proofing requirements within the Building Standards Law in recent decades are also burdensome .
“ You have to spend a lot of money to make a building seismically sound , and there is no aid from the government to do that , ” explains Jun Mitsui , principal architect of JMA Architects in Meguro .
“ The owner has to basically assume the financial burden himself . ”
Financial incentives given to developers
Crucial , too , has been the financial incentive given to developers .
In 2002 , then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi passed legislation that lifted regulations on zoning and building height in exchange for the establishment of public parks or plazas on any newly constructed properties .
Often referred to as an “ urban renaissance , ” the deregulation was intended to maintain Tokyo ’s competitive status with nearby metropolises Hong Kong , Shanghai and Singapore .
“ That was the stimulus to Japan ’s economic upturn , ” says Mitsui of the economic expansion that took place in the middle of this decade .
“ Property owners wanted to maximize their buildings ’ floor space because that is what makes more money . ”
Non-property firms with robust real estate assets , like Shochiku , have also been taking notice .
Japan Post , which became a pseudo - private entity two years ago , is in the process of constructing a 200 - meter - tall building on the site of the 78 - year - old Tokyo Central Post Office on the Marunouchi side of Tokyo station .
The curved brick building will eventually incorporate parts of the older structure ’s exterior facade in the new design .
Last - ditch attempts to save the original building resulted in Japan Post announcing that it will seek tangible cultural property status for the property and retain more of the structure than first planned .
Last year , film studio Toho acquired Kabukicho ’s Koma Stadium theater , a popular venue for enka and musical shows that dates back to 1956 .
Toho also owns the adjacent Shinjuku Toho Kaikan and plans to redevelop both plots .
Publisher Kodansha ’s Noma Dojo training facility , established in 1925 , was knocked down in late 2007 in favor of a more modern complex .
“ In Japan , the idea of scrap - and - build has been dominant for a long time , ” explains Kengo Kuma , a leading architect whose firm designed the Suntory Museum of Art at Tokyo Midtown .
“ So there had n’t been much attention paid to the preservation of buildings .
The debate over the Tokyo Central Post Office , however , has provided a good opportunity for the public to think carefully about the preservation of old architecture . ”
Many other preservation pushes have failed .
The Sanshin Building ( 1930 ) , an eight - floor structure that overlooked Hibiya Park and contained elaborate ceilings and columns , was demolished by developer Mitsui Fudosan in 2007 .
The concrete Dojunkai apartments were innovative housing structures — featuring trash chutes and gas lines — upon their completion between 1924 and 1934 at 16 locations in Tokyo and Yokohama .
In 2003 , the five - story Otsuka Women ’s Apartment House was demolished , and the Aoyama site was replaced three years later by Tadao Ando ’s concrete and glass Omotesando Hills shopping center .
Just two apartment blocks remain today .
Mitsui believes that as a solution to here - today - gone - tomorrow , Tokyo needs to adopt master planning .
“ The formation of a master plan will define such things as the height and use of the building , ” he says , adding that complications within private land ownership and a lack of government impetus thus far have made such a concept very difficult .
Yet the government does offer some support — albeit through a tradeoff that benefits developers .
In exchange for preservation of its notable Mitsui Honkan ( 1929 ) , Mitsui Fudosan was allowed to develop a nearby site into the 39 - floor Nihonbashi Mitsui Tower ( 2005 ) .
The height of the new structure exceeded that permitted by law , but Mitsui was allowed to transfer the unused air rights ( i.e. , potential additional floor area ) of the old building following its preservation .
The Paris - based conservation group Docomomo International , which works to preserve modern buildings , established a Japanese branch in 2000 .
Its group of experts has designated over 135 local structures as important .
In addition to the remaining Dojunkai units and the Tokyo Central Post Office , the list includes Frank Lloyd Wright ’s Myonichikan ( 1921 ) , Tokyo Bunka Kaikan ( 1961 ) and the Nakagin Capsule Tower ( 1972 ) , the Kisho Kurokawa - designed structure of stacked concrete residential modules .
Hiroyuki Suzuki , chairperson of Docomomo Japan and a professor of architecture at Tokyo University , says that the group submits appeals to landowners of listed buildings scheduled for demolition .
He sees some hope with regards to preservation , citing the restoration of Tokyo Station ’s red brick building , set to be completed in 2013 , as an example .
“ Progress is small to this point , ” he says , “ but we will continue to make appeals against the demolition of important works because it is essential we do so . ”
The group is now focusing its attention on buildings from the 1970s — a move probably too late for the Kenzo Tange - designed Hanae Mori building ( 1977 ) , the glass - walled Omotesando landmark that is scheduled to be pulled down following the removal of its tenants this year .
As to Ichibankan and Nibankan , Docomomo ’s Suzuki says that the group finds Takeyama ’s work to be very significant .
Yet an approach and time frame for preservation of his buildings has not been determined .
“ At Docomomo , we realize that there is a connection between modernism and postmodernism that needs to be discussed , ” he explains .
Should the near future bring an end to the Kabukicho creations of Takeyama , the man himself says says he would not be irritated , knowing that the business is financially driven .
He also looks at Ise Jingu , a Shinto complex in Mie Prefecture whose buildings are dismantled and rebuilt every 20 years in an effort to ensure a new appearance .
“ I ca n’t really say if it is positive or negative , ” Takeyama explains .
“ They have been up for 40 years .
That ’s not too bad .
Maybe it is time . ”

" The Deltas are psychos ... You have to be a certified psychopath to join the Delta Force ... " , a US Army colonel from Fort Bragg once told me back in the 1980's .
Now President Obama has elevated the most notorious of the psychopaths , General Stanley McChrystal , to head the US and NATO military command in Afghanistan .
McChrystal 's rise to leadership is marked by his central role in directing special operations teams engaged in extrajudicial assassinations , systematic torture , bombing of civilian communities and search and destroy missions .
He is the very embodiment of the brutality and gore that accompanies military - driven empire building .
Between September 2003 and August 2008 , McChrystal directed the Pentagon 's Joint Special Operations ( JSO ) Command which operates special teams in overseas assassinations .
The point of the ' Special Operations ' teams ( SOT ) is that they do not distinguish between civilian and military oppositions , between activists and their sympathizers and the armed resistance .
The SOT specialize in establishing death squads and recruiting and training paramilitary forces to terrorize communities , neighborhoods and social movements opposing US client regimes .
The SOT's ' counter - terrorism ' is terrorism in reverse , focusing on socio-political groups between US proxies and the armed resistance .
McChrystal 's SOT targeted local and national insurgent leaders in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan through commando raids and air strikes .
During the last 5 years of the Bush - Cheney - Rumsfeld period the SOT were deeply implicated in the torture of political prisoners and suspects .
McChrystal was a special favorite of Rumsfeld and Cheney because he was in charge of the ' direct action ' forces of the ' Special Missions Units .
' Direct Action ' operative are the death - squads and torturers and their only engagement with the local population is to terrorize , and not to propagandize .
They engage in ' propaganda of the dead ' , assassinating local leaders to ' teach ' the locals to obey and submit to the occupation .
Obama 's appointment of McChrystal as head reflects a grave new military escalation of his Afghanistan war in the face of the advance of the resistance throughout the country .
The deteriorating position of the US is manifest in the tightening circle around all the roads leading in and out of Afghanistan 's capital , Kabul as well as the expansion of Taliban control and influence throughout the Pakistan - Afghanistan border .
Obama 's inability to recruit new NATO reinforcements means that the White House 's only chance to advance its military driven empire is to escalate the number of US troops and to increase the kill ratio among any and all suspected civilians in territories controlled by the Afghan armed resistance .
The White House and the Pentagon claim that the appointment of McChrystal was due to the ' complexities ' of the situation on the ground and the need for a ' change in strategy ' .
' Complexity ' is a euphemism for the increased mass opposition to the US , complicating traditional carpet ' bombing and military sweep ' operations .
The new strategy practiced by McChrystal involves large scale , long term ' special operations ' to devastate and kill the local social networks and community leaders , which provide the support system for the armed resistance .
Obama 's decision to prevent the release of scores of photographs documenting the torture of prisoners by US troops and ' interrogators ' ( especially under command of the ' Special Forces ' ) , is directly related to his appointment of McChrystal whose ' SOT ' forces were highly implicated in widespread torture in Iraq .
Equally important , under McChrystal 's command the DELTA , SEAL and Special Operations Teams will have a bigger role in the new ' counter - insurgency strategy ' .
Obama 's claim that the publication of these photographs will adversely affect the ' troops ' has a particular meaning :
The graphic exposure of McChrystal 's modus operendi for the past 5 years under President Bush will undermine his effectiveness in carrying out the same operations under Obama .
Obama 's decision to re-start the secret ' military tribunals ' of foreign political prisoners , held at the Guantanamo prison camp , is not merely a replay of the Bush - Cheney policies , which Obama had condemned and vowed to eliminate during his presidential campaign , but part of his larger policy of militarization and coincides with his approval of the major secret police surveillance operations conducted against US citizens .
Putting McChrystal in charge of the expanded Afghanistan - Pakistan military operations means putting a notorious practitioner of military terrorism - the torture and assassination of opponents to US policy - at the center of US foreign policy .
Obama 's quantitative and qualitative expansion of the US war in South Asia means massive numbers of refugees fleeing the destruction of their farms , homes and villages ; tens of thousands of civilian deaths , and eradication of entire communities .
All of this will be committed by the Obama Administraton in the quest to 'empty the lake ( displace entire populations ) to catch the fish ( armed insurgents and activists ) ' .
Obama 's restoration of all of the most notorious Bush Era policies and the appointment of Bush 's most brutal commander is based on his total embrace of the ideology of military - driven empire building .
Once one believes ( as Obama does ) that US power and expansion are based on military conquests and counter - insurgency , all other ideological , diplomatic , moral and economic considerations will be subordinated to militarism .
By focusing all resources on successful military conquest , scant attention is paid to the costs borne by the people targeted for conquest or to the US treasury and domestic American economy .
This has been clear from the start :
In the midst of a major recession / depression with millions of Americans losing their employment and homes , President Obama increased the military budget by 4 % - taking it beyond $ 800 billion dollars .
Obama 's embrace of militarism is obvious from his decision to expand the Afghan war despite NATO 's refusal to commit any more combat troops .
It is obvious in his appointment of the most hard - line and notorious Special Forces General from the Bush - Cheney era to head the military command in subduing Afghanistan and the frontier areas of Pakistan .
It is just as George Orwell described in Animal Farm : The Democratic Pigs are now pursuing the same brutal , military policies of their predecessors , the Republican Porkers , only now it is in the name of the people and peace .
Orwell might paraphrase the policy of President Barack Obama , as ' Bigger and bloodier wars equal peace and justice ' .
For some wine lovers a nude nymph is artistic expression while for others it is offensive trash .
A wine label showing a nude nymph is too much for Alabama 's liquor control agency , which has told restaurants and stores not to sell the product .
The label on Cycles Gladiator wine , produced by Hahn Family Wines in Soledad , Calif. , shows a vintage 1895 advertising poster for Cycles Gladiator bicycles .
The French poster features a nude nymph flying beside a winged bicycle .
Bob Martin , staff attorney for the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board , said the board 's license bureau rejected the label last year as inappropriate for sale in the state .
Early this month , a citizen sent a bottle of the wine to the board 's enforcement bureau to show it was being sold in stores , he said .
The board then sent a letter to stores and restaurants reminding them that sale of the product is prohibited , he said Friday .
Alabama 's liquor regulations prohibit labels with " a person posed in an immoral or sensuous manner , " Martin said .
Hahn President Bill Leigon said Friday the company had been selling its product in Alabama since 2006 until it ran into problems with the label .
" It is not pornographic , " he said .
There have been no problems in the other 49 states where it is sold , he said .
He said the wine had remained available in Alabama after the label was rejected last year because he was unaware of the rejection .
He said that when the ABC Board 's letter went out , all the wine was picked up from stores and restaurants .
The problem with the label were first reported Friday by the Mobile Press - Register .
Leigon could change the label and resume sales in Alabama , but he said he wo n't .
" It is a gorgeous piece of work , " he said .
It is a laudable aim of the current National Curriculum that pupils " know about big ideas and events that shape the world " .
But one of the biggest of these is too infrequently studied in schools .
We are thinking of the growing loss of faith , over the past two centuries , in a religious picture of the world .
David Hume 's 18th - century onslaught on arguments for the existence of God was an early catalyst , Darwin 's 19th - century attack on what today is known as creationism a later and more devastating one .
Nowadays , according to an ICM poll in 2006 , the majority of adults in Britain describe themselves as non-religious .
Those who determine the curricula that are taught in state schools insist on knowledge of all sorts of particular facts and approaches to understanding in different subjects .
But they do not require any awareness of this revolution in belief , arguably the most dramatic since the origin of Islam .
True , the non-statutory RE curriculum now allows for teaching about humanism , but – unlike Christianity and other major world faiths – leaves it optional , and on a par with Zoroastrianism .
Where else might you expect to find an informed and systematic introduction to and examination of atheism and agnosticism ?
In the science curriculum ?
In history ?
English ?
Citizenship ?
Your search will be fruitless .
There is no curriculum pigeonhole for an idea as big as this one .

However , before we decide where to teach about atheism and agnosticism – and it might be that the issue is addressed in a number of subjects , rather as such cross-curricular issues as climate change and ethics are – we first need agreement that students should learn about them .
Indeed , we suspect that initial reactions to our proposals will include rejection of them from those who feel that the last thing they want is humanism on the curriculum .
They would n't want children to be indoctrinated in unbelief .
But it 's not a question of getting children to become non-religious ; rather of getting them to understand and discuss this major intellectual revolution .
RE has , thankfully , abandoned its position of proselytisation .
What goes for Christianity and other world faiths on the curriculum should hold for humanism too .
Perhaps it is time here for us to disclose our own positions .
One of us is an atheist and a member of the British Humanist Association .
The other is a priest in the Church of England .
But both of us are also academics at the Institute of Education , University of London , and it is our interest in how school education can be made more engaging , more relevant and more suitable for the 21st century that leads us to our common view on this matter .
What kinds of learning might be required ?
Young people should think about whether they live in a divine world or a godless one .
This points to discussing the standard arguments for and against the existence of God and such questions as the likelihood of life after death .
But they also need to discuss whether human lives can have any meaning or point outside a religious framework .
And whether people can live a morally good life that is not dependent on religious belief .
Historical perspectives are also important , especially the impact of non-religious ideas on intellectual and artistic life over the last 250 years .
Most of this would find its place in the secondary curriculum .
But a start could be made with older primary children .
Given some guidance , one would expect most young children of , say , nine or 10 years of age , to be intellectually mature enough to think about how the world came about and why we should be good .
Of course , sensitivity and respect are required when teaching about such matters .
One does not want children to be given the impression that they are going to hell because they espouse atheism or that they are intellectually second rate because they accept the divine inspiration of scripture .
Our argument is part of a broader one about schooling .
The school curriculum is not only to do with the workings of volcanoes , the use of the future tense in French , calculations about triangles and the causes of the First World War .
Educators and curriculum planners should look up from such comparative minutiae , important as these are in the right place .
They should raise their eyes if not to heaven , at least to a more global picture of what education should be about .
An understanding of non-religion , like an understanding of religion , is a vital part of this .
The writers teach at the Institute of Education in London
International Battery bought machines from China that manufacture the components and has been tweaking them to make them run faster , use fewer materials and produce a better product .
Each button on the control panels is labeled in Chinese characters , with English penciled in by hand underneath .
Near Mr. Peters ’s machine , a cardboard box awaiting unpacking bears hand lettering that says , “ Glass Please Carefully . ”
Other companies are also trying out new chemistries and materials , at the positive and negative terminals of the battery .
As technicians try to improve battery assembly , the first requirement is a strikingly clean work environment .
Mr. Peters , in goggles and spotless rubber gloves , declined to shake hands recently , just as a surgeon might on the way into the operator room .
The gloves protect him from the chemicals in the battery , which include nickel , cobalt and manganese , and shield the battery ’s delicate tissues from the natural oils on his fingers .
“ We do n’t want any debris , ” said Mr. Peters , who formerly worked at a nearby factory that made bulletproof glass .
( International Battery ’s pristine new showplace was previously an appliance repair shop . )
The engineers face a difficult challenge .
The batteries have to store a lot of energy in a small , light package , scoring high in a quality known as energy density .
They also have to absorb energy and give it back quickly , a factor called power density .
Think of a battery as a bottle for energy , and the power density as the size of the bottle ’s neck .
Good power density means a shape like a peanut butter jar , easy to fill or empty ; low power density is more like a wine jug with a narrow neck .
The batteries have to charge quickly and withstand thousands of cycles of charge and discharge .
They have to dissipate heat without catching fire , a product problem that a giant like Apple Computer could survive but a start - up electric car company probably could not .
The batteries must function in Maine winters and Texas summers .
IDA Pro already has a function call graph facility , nonetheless it employs WinGraph32 .
Although it is helpful , it is not very useful just because it lacks interactivity .
For demonstration purposes , we created a sample plugin that uses the graph functions from the SDK to achieve the same thing but with a bit more of interactivity : double - click to jump to a node , search node by name ( also search next ) , etc …
One can easily modify the plugin to also add a navigation stack or perhaps more filters .
After the plugin is installed it will create a new menu item in Views / Subviews / Function call graph , also make sure you right - click in the graph to see the options and hotkeys .
To recompile the plugin you need IDA Pro SDK version 5.5

Draft Order Team Projection Position Stat Line
1. LA Clippers Blake Griffin PF 22.7ppg , 14.4rpg , 1.2bpg
Does Blake Griffin fit the Clippers needs perfectly ?
No .
Is he a lock to be the Clippers pick in the draft ?
Absolutely .
You just ca n’t miss with Griffin at the first pick .
He ’s super athletic , has proven himself , and has shown tremendous work ethic .
He is , and deserves to be , the consensus # 1 pick in the 2009 draft .
College Team – Oklahoma
2. Memphis Grizzlies J.Harden SG 20.1 ppg , 4.2apg , 5.6rpg
The lottery and draft order changing , has changed the fortunes quite a bit for Harden .
Rubio is increasingly seen as being ‘ overhyped ’ and could give teams unwanted headaches in buyouts to get him here .
The Grizz will want to pick up backcourt help , and Harden is probably the most well rounded player in this upcoming draft .
He ’s a stat stuffer , he does it all .
College Team – Arizona State
3. OKC Thunder H. Thabeet C 13.6 ppg , 10.8rpg , 4.2bpg
Think about a future front court of Kevin Durant at SF , Jeff Green at PF , and the friendly giant H. Thabeet at C. Ummm yeah , that would be nasty .
Then add Westbrook into the mix running the show on offense .
Could be the perfect combination of offense from Durant and Green , and defense from Thabeet and Green .
Look for OKC to pick big here .
College Team – UConn
4. Sacramento Kings R.Rubio PG 9.8ppg , 5.7apg , 1.9spg
Seriously , the case could be made for dropping Rubio another couple of spots .
Personally , I think on raw talent Curry deserves a look at the 4 spot , but given the fact that Kevin Martin is a volume shooter with similar defensive problems due to his physical make up that Curry has , i’d say the Kings will look to solidify Rubio as their point guard of the future .
College Team – N/A ( Euro )
5. Washington Wizards Stephen Curry PG /SG 28.6 ppg , 5.6apg , 2.5spg
Is there a more dominant scorer in the draft this year ?
Not even close .
Forget the knocks on his size , Curry is impressing all onlookers in workouts and he is poised to prove the naysayers wrong .
He ’s a phenomenal outside shooter , and although his 3pt % dropped a bit this year , he was getting to the line a lot more showing his speed , and played the point more showing his passing abilities .
Do n’t forget he also faced double and sometimes triple teams all season long .
College Team – Davidson
6. Minnesota Timberwolves Jordan Hill PF 18.3 ppg , 11.0rpg , 1.7bpg
Hill is super athletic , freakish really .
A lot of NBA teams drool all over guys with this kind of athleticism and forget about their lack of fundamentals and skills .
Sort of reminds me of Tyrus Thomas in that he ’s super athletic so teams will be all over his potential and forget about his shortcomings .
Hill has limited post moves and often turns the ball over to good defenses .
But based on pure potential with his size , strength and speed he ’s one of the top picks regardless .
College Team – Arizona
7. G.S. Warriors Tyreke Evans PG /SG 17.1 ppg , 3.9apg , 5.4rpg
There is still a lot of uncertainty about Monta Ellis and the Warriors , but with so many talented guards in the draft this year , the Warriors will no doubt be looking at taking Tyreke Evans at the 7 spot .
Evans has been a star well known to NBA Scouts since he was still in his early years in High School .
Evans can play both the 1 and 2 spots as he has great ball handling ability but is also an excellent scorer .
Sometimes criticized for his shoot first mentality , Evans can get to the free throw line at will , and sort of reminds me of a Gilbert Arena ’s type guard when he ’s on his game .
College Team – Memphis
8. New York Knicks Brandon Jennings PG 7.6 ppg , 1.6apg , 1.2spg
The Knicks fans want flash .
They want talent .
They crave it , they need it , they have the biggest stage in the league .
I am going to make a prediction here .
Brandon Jennings after all is said and done in the careers of this draft class will be the most memorable and successful of the point guards .
Once he matures and his body fills out , his defensive weakness may become one of his strengths .
He has the court vision of a young Jason Kidd , and the style of a young J - Will .
He could be the one to make Knick basketball fun to watch again .
College Team – N/A ( Euro )
9. Toronto Raptors Jonny Flynn PG 17.4ppg , 6.7apg , 1.4spg
Jonny Flynn has been impressive in workouts and has been the subject of a recent buzz among the mock drafts .
Pretty much everyone who conducted early mock drafts have bumped this guy at least a few spots up in recent reviews .
A lot of you out there will question the Raptors need for a point guard , given that they have Calderon locked in for a while .
But the Raptors need a serviceable point guard off the bench in the near term , and when you draft for talent instead of need you get a potential bargaining chip for trade negotiations down the line .
College Team – Syracuse
10 . Milwaukee Bucks Demar DeRozan SG /SF 13.9ppg , 5.7rpg , 1.5apg
DeRozan finished the year very strong , and shot the ball consistently well all year .
He has excellent form and shooting mechanics .
Match that with his athleticism and all sorts of NBA clubs will be looking to land this guy past the top ten .
His ball handling abilities leave something to be desired , but he ’s an adequate defender and rebounder .
In the NBA where quality consistent shooters are at a premium , this guy just has too much potential to fall out of the top ten in this year ’s draft .
College Team – USC
11 . New Jersey Nets Gerald Henderson SG 16.5 ppg , 4.9 rpg , 2.5 apg
The New Jersey Nets have a pretty talented back court already with Devin Harris and Vince Carter , but they really lack depth .
If the Nets next year plan to play a bit more uptempo than they have in previous years they will need players like Henderson who can fill the stat sheet in many different ways and get you moving .
He has excellent transition game , and good mid-range jumper .
College Team – Duke
12 . Charlotte Bobcats Ty Lawson PG 16.6 ppg , 6.6apg , 2.1spg
The Charlotte Bobcats need a true facilitator if they are going to play in a Larry Brown system .
They need a guy that looks to pass first and score second .
Although Brown typically does n’t give rookies a lot of burn , I think Lawson may be the perfect back - up point guard that Brown could mold into the type of player he needs to run the offense and avoid turnovers .
He also has a strong enough body to be a successful defender if he follows the defensive minded Brown ’s commitment to the craft .
Did I mention Lawson is a winner yet ?
Brown loves winners , and Lawson ’s NCAA title should speak volumes to Brown .
College Team – North Carolina
13 . Indiana Pacers Jrue Holiday PG / SG 8.5 ppg , 3.8rpg , 3.7apg
He is rail thin at 6 ’ 3 ″ but when he fills out and improves his defense against more physical opposition he should be a solid player in the league .
After coming into the NCAA with huge hype about his skills , Holiday was a bit of a disappointment , but given his success in workouts and his tremendous ‘ upside ’ look for his stock to rise as high as the Indiana pick .
I doubt he will crack the Top 10 however .
College Team – UCLA
14 . Phoenix Suns James Johnson SF / PF 15 ppg , 8.5rpg , 2.0apg
Since Shawn Marion was dealt the Phoenix Suns have really missed having an athletic player that can score without having to run plays for him , that also can stuff the stat sheet in a variety of other categories .
Johnson ’s ability to play either the 3 or the 4 will give his eventual team a lot of options for mismatches and he is skilled enough to create his own shot if need be .
With the uncertainty around the future of Amare Stoudemire , look for Phoenix to think big and think versatile .
College Team – Wake Forest
15 . Detroit Pistons Eric Maynor PG 22.4ppg , 6.2apg , 1.7spg
Let ’s face it the Detroit Pistons biggest shortcoming is on the offensive end .
They lack firepower , and they lack a point guard who can distribute .
Eric Maynor can do it all .
He is arguably one of the most talented offensive players in the draft this year , putting up big numbers in both scoring and distributing .
I highly doubt Pistons fans will see Allen Iverson in the Motor City , so Maynor could be exactly what the doctor ordered .
College Team – VCU
16 . Chicago Bulls DeJuan Blair PF 15.7ppg,12.3rpg , 1.0bpg
Blair ’s stock is rising .
He is a hard working player on both ends of the floor and he was a double double machine in College .
Generally players like Blair adapt quicker to the NBA game , but are rarely stars in the making .
He should make for a serviceable PF in Chicago who lack the front court role players to do the dirty work .
He works hard , he ’s physical , and he does n’t require a lot of plays called for him .
He ’s a coach ’s dream .
College Team – Pitt
17 . Philadelphia 76ers Jeff Teague PG 18.8 ppg , 1.9spg , 3.5apg
The 76ers are extremely at the PG spot , with the whole team riding on Andre Miller ’s shoulders .
After their early exit in the post season this year , some are calling into question Miller ’s desire to stay in Philly .
Teague may be the perfect fit for the Sixers to start grooming the next point guard talent to man the point .
College Team – Wake Forest
18 . Minnesota Timberwolves ( from Heat ) Terrence Williams SF 12.5 ppg , 8.6rpg , 5.0apg
Williams is one of the top pure athletes in this draft class .
He has amazing combination of size , quickness , and strength .
He is a total stat stuffer , and a team guy .
Who would n’t love playing with this guy ?
Williams will be a welcome edition to the youth movement in Minnesota and may even become an integral piece to the Wolves turnaround in the post - Garnett era .
College Team – Louisville
19 . Atlanta Hawks Patrick Mills PG 18.4ppg , 3.9apg , 2.2spg
Atlanta
Hawks are one of the rising teams in the strengthening Eastern Conference .
What we saw in the playoffs against the Cavaliers though was their inability play defense and take care of the ball .
Patrick Mills should be a welcome edition in that department as he was one of the top pick pockets in College Basketball this year , and he is also an excellent ball handler .
Look for the Hawks to pick up Mills to shadow an aging Mike Bibby .
College Team – St. Mary’s
20 . Utah Jazz Earl Clark SF / PF 14.2 ppg , 8.7 rpg , 1.4 bpg
Clark has great ball handling skills , is athletic and can run the break .
He fills quite a few needs for the Jazz , instantly making them younger and more potent .
The major knock on Clark has been consistency and the appearance that he ’s not giving a full effort throughout the entire game .
That wo n’t fly with Coach Sloan , but I doubt it should be a big problem once he ’s in the league .
College Team – Louisville
21 . New Orleans Hornets BJ Mullens C 8.8 ppg , 4.7rpg , 1.1apg
Let ’s face it there are concerns about Tyson Chandler ’s health or why else would the New Orleans attempt to ship him out have been rescinded .
BJ Mullens is n’t the flashiest big man out there , and he certainly does n’t have the best stat sheet .
But you ca n’t teach size , and at 7 ’ 0 ″ and serviceable , he may just be the guy to fill in for Chandler as injuries have hampered his ability to stay on the court .
College Team – Ohio State
22 . Dallas Mavericks Jonas Jerebko SF / PF 9.2 ppg , 5.5 rpg , 0.4 bpg
A strong push as of late by turning in good performances in his Italian league post - season , then having a good showing in the Reebok Eurocamp .
He looks to be a stat stuffer , and the type of player that will give you all sorts of intangibles .
He is working and giving you 110 % at all times .
This slot still may be a bit high for him , as he ’s destined to be a ‘ role player ’ but he will pay off in the long run for whoever grabs this guy .
College Team – N/A ( Euro )
23 . Sacramento Kings ( from Rockets ) Wayne Ellington SG 15.8 ppg , 4.9rpg , 2.7apg
Who does n’t love a Tarheel right ?
The Kings will be looking to get more athletic and deeper in the draft as they have some talent , but probably one of the thinnest benches in the league .
Ellington looks to be a great guy to back up Kevin Martin and give them some energy off the bench .
College Team – North Carolina
24 . Portland Blazers Tyler Hansbrough PF 20.7ppg , 8.1rpg , 1.2spg
Everyone is just waiting for this guy to flop at the next level .
Personally I just do n’t think it ’s going to happen .
He ’s a proven champion and one of the hardest workers on the best team in college basketball .
That sort of steady improvement always bodes well for players at the next level .
Look for Hansborough to be a target of the Portland Blazers who are strong on the front line but could use a great hustle player off the bench as an insurance policy to the litany of injuries to Greg Oden .
College Team – North Carolina
25 . OKC Thunder ( from Spurs ) Sam Young SF 19.2 ppg , 6.3rpg , 1.1apg
Young has a great scoring touch , and is killer with the back to the basket position and turn around jump shot .
Although Kevin Durant is all the scorer the Thunder could ever need at the SF spot , Young could give them some good perimeter defense when Durant is out of the game .
Young may even be able to give them some limited minutes at the two spot if he can extend his range a bit .
College Team – Pitt
26 . Chicago Bulls ( from Nuggets ) Chase Budinger SG 18.0 ppg , 6.2rpg , 3.4apg
It ’s not often you get a player that can shoot the outside shot , who is a great passer , can handle the ball and play the natural SG position with a 6 ’ 7 ″ , 220 lb frame .
Budinger also has a tremendous basketball IQ .
He will be effective playing either alongside or backing up Gordon .
College Team – Arizona
27 . Memphis Grizzlies ( from Magic ) Austin Daye PF 12.7 ppg , 5.8 rpg , 2.1 bpg
Daye has tremendous skills for a guy his size .
But at 6 ’ 10 ” tall he ’s as thin as they come .
If he does n’t beef up he will be forced to play on the perimeter on offense , and be a slow liability on defense .
He wo n’t be able to guard even the smallest of power forwards in the post .
Given his skill set and height , the Grizzlies may be thinking of him as having the potential to be a poor man ’s Chris Bosh .
And that in itself is pretty damn valuable .
College Team – Gonzaga
28 . Minnesota Timberwolves ( from Celtics ) Taj Gibson PF 14.3 ppg , 9.0rpg , 1.3apg
I love Gibson ’s talent .
I think he is only going to get better as he has great timing as a shot blocker and a tremendous wingspan for his height .
He ’s an adequate scorer , and hopefully will become a great rebounder with more training at the next level .
The TWolves have a pretty strong front court , so there is time for Gibson to develop and give them some spot minutes where necessary .
College Team – USC
29 . LA Lakers Omri Casspi SF n/a : ppg , rpg , apg
His numbers with Maccabi Tel Aviv are n’t going to tell you a whole lot about this player as his minutes were limited and he is someone you would need to have seen for yourself .
He has great energy and loves to score .
He ’s got the scorer ’s mentality .
His professional basketball experience should help him adjust to the NBA faster than most .
He gives opposition all sorts of matchup problems at the 3 spot .
With the three spot about the only position not completely solidified in LA , he may even crack the rotation for some minutes if he lands there .

30 . Cleveland Cavaliers Darren Collison PG 14.4ppg , 4.7apg , 1.6spg
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
More than 550 laid - off production line workers in Pennsylvania finally got some good news .
Oshkosh , the truck maker who gave them their pink slips , is now hiring them back .
Oshkosh is n't the only company calling back it 's previously laid - off workers .
Nearly a fifth of displaced employees return to the company that issued their pink slip , a survey said Tuesday .
Eighteen percent of laid - off workers who landed new positions were rehired by the same employer that let them go , up from 13 % in 2005 , according to Right Management 's outplacement services , a division of Manpower .
More than 17,000 outplacement candidates were surveyed by Right Management between June 2008 and June 2009 .
" In some instances , organizations are realizing that they may have cut too deep and are bringing people back in consulting roles or for project work , " Melvin Scales , senior vice president for global solutions at Right Management , said in a statement .
" Former employees have the organizational knowledge and skills to jump back into roles quickly to get the job done , " Scales said .
But redundant firing and hiring can be disruptive to workforce performance and costly for the company , particularly in the form of severance payments , he noted .
Scales recommends that employers consider redeploying workers as an alternative to layoffs .
" It 's a way of leveraging the skills and talents of existing employees and reassigning them to new roles within the organization .
It provides an opportunity to retain valued talent , reduce the cost of turnover and leverage knowledge transfers within the company , " he said .
Previous research conducted by Right Management found that only one in two employers offer redeployment before layoffs .
The battered U.S. labor market has witnessed severe job cuts across the board over the course of 2008 and 2009 .
Nearly 3.4 million jobs have been lost already in the first half of 2009 , more than the 3.1 million lost in all of 2008 .
Bankruptcy usually does n’t provide relief , except in the most dire of circumstances .
Even death is n’t a good enough excuse for discharging some private loan debts .
And the government can wield a heavy hand to collect what it is due :
If you fail to repay your federal loans , it can garnish up to 15 percent of your wages or take your tax refund or part of your Social Security benefits .
But if you are having trouble paying back what you owe because you ’ve lost your job or have some other financial difficulty , you have options .
Of course , it ’s always best to take corrective action before you ’re officially in default .
For federal loans , it generally takes about nine months of missed payments .
But you can go into default on a private loan as soon as one payment is missed , though the rules vary by lender .
And collection charges are usually steep .
“ The good news on the federal loan side is that there are a lot of options for borrowers , particularly those who are in shorter - term financial trouble now , ” said Deanne Loonin , director of the National Consumer Law Center ’s Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project .
“ The private loan side is where we do n’t have or are unable to give a lot of general information because there just are n’t as many rights . ”
You first need to figure out what types of loansyou have : federal , private or a combination of both .
You can find out by calling the lender , accessing the National Student Loan Data System of federal loans , or FinAid.org ’s Web site .
Below are several options for both loan types .
Federal Loans
¶ Defer or Forbearance
All federal loans have a grace period of six months after graduation .
But an unemployment or economic hardship deferment and forbearance can each buy up to three years , for a total of six years of relief .
Deferments are preferred because the government generally pays interest on subsidized federal loans , though you ’re still responsible for interest on unsubsidized and PLUS loans .
With a forbearance , you are responsible for all interest ( even on subsidized loans ) , which is added to the loan balance .
“ Students may not fully appreciate just how much that increases the size of the loan , ” Mr. Kantrowitz said .
“ That ’s why deferments and forbearances should mainly be used as a method to solve a temporary problem . ”
A six - month deferment is reasonable : it would add $ 345 to the balance of a $ 10,000 loan with a 6.8 percent interest rate .

LAS VEGAS – Two noted security professionals were targeted this week by hackers who broke into their web pages , stole personal data and posted it online on the eve of the Black Hat security conference .
Security researcher Dan Kaminsky and former hacker Kevin Mitnick were targeted because of their high profiles , and because the intruders consider the two notables to be posers who hype themselves and do little to increase security , according to a note the hackers posted in a file left on Kaminsky 's site .
The files taken from Kaminsky 's server included private e-mails between Kaminisky and other security researchers , highly personal chat logs , and a list of files he has purportedly downloaded that pertain to dating and other topics .
The hacks also targeted other security professionals , and were apparently timed to coincide with the Black Hat and DefCon security conference in Las Vegas this week , where Kaminsky is unveiling new research on digital certificates and hash collisions .
Kaminsky made headlines last year for his Black Hat talk about vulnerabilities in the Domain Name System .
He was accused by many in the security community of hyping the issue after he teased the topic in a press conference call a month before his talk without revealing details of the vulnerability , leading everyone to speculate on the nature of it .
He was presented with a Pwnie award for Most Overhyped Bug and for " owning " the media .
The hackers criticized Mitnick and Kaminsky for using insecure blogging and hosting services to publish their sites , that allowed the hackers to gain easy access to their data .
We hacked Dan 's assets first through finding bugs and writing 0day , and then through abusing him giving away passwords and his silly password scheme .
Check out just some of his passes : fuck .
hackers , 0hn0z ( root account on his mail box ) , fuck.omg , fuck.vps , ohhai Five character root password ?
Niiiiiiice .
From .mysql_history : SET PASSWORD FOR ' root '@' localhost ' = PASSWORD (' fuck.mysql ' ) ;
See the pattern ?
Tuesday night Kaminsky removed the hackers ' note from his site and replaced it with a message reading , " Well played , guys .
Could have done without the personal info dump but otherwise lets grab a beer at [ DefCon ] . "
His website is currently inaccessible .
In messages posted to his Twitter page he wrote , " Messy , but heh .
Walk onto a battlefield , you might get shot . "
Mitnick was once deemed by the government “ the most wanted computer criminal in United States history ” and was charged with 25 counts of wire and computer fraud and causing nearly $ 300 million in damages .
He was jailed beginning in February 1995 for four and a half years without being charged and eventually pleaded guilty to 7 counts and was sentenced to 46 months in 1999 , with some credit for time already served .
He was released in 2000 .
Mitnick has made a successful living on the lecture circuit and will soon publish a book about his experience , but he has often been accused by some in the hacking community of having few security skills and living off a dated reputation .
" There are people who just live press release by press release , " the hackers wrote in their note .
" And on top of it all , somehow you STILL have not got rid of Kevin Mitnick .
The industry cares about virtualization one year and iPhones the next , every year forgetting the lessons it should have picked up in the last .
" If you are just someone looking to pay a fair price to not get owned , you find out quickly that none of these people exist to help you .
Very few people in this industry have their income model based around actually making you more secure .
At best , some of them have it based around convincing you that you are better off . "
Mitnick is switching his web hosting to to a new provider .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Microsoft and Yahoo have finally come to a search deal and will announce the details of the agreement in the next 24 hours , according to a report .
It is not clear whether the two companies have signed any official papers , but the negotiations of the deal , which also includes advertising , have finally come to a close , The Wall Street Journal said Tuesday .
Yahoo ( YHOO , Fortune 500 ) and Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) have been in talks for some time to join forces on Internet search and advertising technology .
Together , the two could stand a better chance to gain market share from rival Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) .
Microsoft launched its own Internet search portal , Bing , in early June .
While Bing met with initial success , Microsoft has still been unable to post a profit in its online advertising business .
Microsoft and Yahoo would share revenues on the deal , and Yahoo would not get any money up front , according to the Journal .
Harvard Professor Gates Is Half - Irish , Related to Cop Who Arrested Him
Two men at the center of the controversy are linked by their Irish heritage .
July 28 , 2009  -- Henry Louis Gates Jr. , the black professor at the center of the racial story involving his arrest outside his Harvard University - owned house , has spoken proudly of his Irish roots .
Strangely enough , he and the Cambridge , Mass. , police officer who arrested him , Sgt. James Crowley , both trace their ancestry back to the legendary Niall of the Nine Hostages .
In a PBS series on African - American ancestry that he hosted in 2008 , Gates discovered his Irish roots when he found he was descended from an Irish immigrant and a slave girl .
He went to Trinity College in Dublin to have his DNA analyzed .
There he found that he shared 10 of the 11 DNA matches with offspring of Niall of the Nine Hostages , the fourth century warlord who created one of the dominant strains of Irish genealogy because he had so many offspring .
Ironically , James Crowley , whose name in Gaelic means " hardy warrior , " is also descended from the same line as Gates , having very close links to Niall of the Nine Hostages .
So the two men who took part in what is now an infamous confrontation outside the Gates home near Harvard this month are actually related through common Irish lineage -- one of the more extraordinary aspects of the incident that has sparked worldwide headlines .
Gates is one of many famous African - Americans with Irish heritage , including President Barack Obama and award - winning author Alice Walker .
On the PBS series , Gates visits Trinity College to find his roots , and says to the genealogist , " Do I look like an Irishman to you ?
I 'm here to find my roots .
I 've been looking all over Africa and I could n't find anybody , so I ended up here .
" I 'm descended from a white man , he says .
" A white man who slept with a black slave .
And we know from the analysis of my DNA that ... goes back to Ireland .
So maybe you can help me . "
When the genealogist tells him he does indeed have Irish links , Gates says , " I find this oddly moving .
It is astonishing , " he says , " that I have a kinship with someone ( Niall of the Nine Hostages ) dating back to the fourth century A.D. "
Irish American Descendants
Millions of Irish Americans , especially those in New York , may be directly descended , like Gates , from Niall of the Nine Hostages , the most prolific warrior in Irish history .
A team of geneticists at Trinity College led by professor Dan Bradley have discovered that as many as 3 million men worldwide may be descendents of the Irish warlord , who was the Irish " High King " at Tara , the ancient center of Ireland from A.D. 379 to A.D. 405 .
The story of Niall of the Nine Hostages is already the stuff of legend , which has been passed on to countless Irish schoolchildren over the years .
The supposedly fearless leader battled the English , the Scots , the French and even the Romans , and struck fear into the heart of his enemies .
His dynasty lasted for centuries , continuing up until the Elizabethan conquest of Ireland at the end of the 16th century .
Legend has it that it was Niall of the Nine Hostages who , on a raid in Wales , captured a young slave and brought him to Ireland .
That slave would later escape , and go to become Ireland 's patron saint , St. Patrick .
But one story not told to most Irish elementary schoolchildren was of Niall 's prolificacy .
When it came to the bedroom , it seems that Niall of the Nine Hostages was even more fearless and energetic than he was on the battlefield .
This warlord was responsible for the very common Irish surname " O' Neill " -- which means " descendant son of Niall . "
It is also the name of Irish pubs all over the world .
The researchers also found that as many as one in 12 men in Ireland have the same DNA as the Irish king -- and in Ireland 's northwest , that figure rises to one in five .
Do Make Say
Think is an instrumental group from Toronto , Ontario .
The band formed in the 19 90s ( 1995 ) by Charles Spearin as a recording project for his sound engineering classes in college .
Their first rehearsals took place in an empty schoolroom where four basic verbs – Do , Make , Say and Think – adorned the walls .
The group subsequently adopted the words as a name .
Their music combines jazz - style drums with electric bass , synthesizers , electric guitars , wind instruments , and electronic effects .

Windows Vista Service Pack 2 went final earlier this week , with numerous fixes and tweaks to improve performance , bolster security , and squash bugs .
But some PC
World readers are seeing another welcome change to SP2 : a lot more free disk space .
In comments posted in our forums , several readers reported large increases in free hard disk space after installing Vista SP2 .
Mind you , I 'm not talking about a gigabyte here or there ; one reader claimed that installing Vista SP2 freed up a massive 40 GB chunk of disk space .
Another reader said , " Wow !
I did n't notice that til now .
I went from about 88 GB free to 122 GB free .
That 's a significant change ' under the hood , ' is n't it ? "
And yet another reader gained back 130 GB of hard disk space .
Wow .
At least a couple users told me that their free space grew significantly after installing SP2 , without them doing anything else .
Vista SP2 includes a command - line cleanup tool ( compcln.exe ) you can run to remove older system files and restore points , thus freeing up hard disk space .
My assumption is that the Vista SP2 installer automatically runs compcln.exe , but we have yet to receive an official explanation from Microsoft .
Once we do , though , I 'll pass it along .
Obviously your milage may vary depending on your system , but I think it 's safe to say that most everyone will welcome more free disk space .
If you 're running Vista SP2 , we 'd love to hear from you .
Tell us your SP2 experiences — good and bad — by posting a comment below , or if you 're on Twitter , follow us @pcworld and shoot us a tweet .

For years , Internet Explorer 6 ( IE6 ) has been the bane of existence for web designers around the world .
Designers and users alike have come to enjoy the increasingly predictable , standards - compliant behavior of great modern browsers like Firefox , Opera , and Safari .
Meanwhile , IE6 continues to haunt our designs , lurking in dark places as its reputation dies and it dies a painfully slow , agonizing death .
As we await that grand and glorious day when IE6 is as dead as Netscape 4 , let us be mindful of the endangered species of users who , for whatever sad reason , continue to torture themselves with that terrible beast of a browser .
So come now , let us celebrate these last days of IE6 with this definitive guide to taming the IE6 beast .
In this comprehensive article , you ’ll learn some of the best methods for supporting IE6 , including proper targeting , specific hacks , image support , box models , floats , and everything in between .
Use conditional comments to target IE6
Conditional comments play an important role in getting IE6 to behave .
Conditional comments are basically snippets of code that are included in your ( X) HTML markup that enable you to target or filter specific versions of Internet Explorer .
Here is a conditional comment that targets IE6 with a special message :
<!--[ if IE6 ] > < p > Oops !
Looks like you 're still using Internet Explorer 6 !
You deserve better !</p> <![ endif ] -->
This is an extremely useful method of delivering code and content only to IE6 .
Other browsers will see this conditional comment as an ordinary ( X) HTML comment and simply ignore its contents .
Thus , when adapting our web pages for IE6 , conditional comments enable us to apply CSS styles directly , without interfering with other browsers .
Although conditional comments are a proprietary Microsoft invention , they are arguably the best way to “ hack ” specific versions of Internet Explorer .
The easiest way to use conditional comments to target and apply styles only to IE6 is to include an “ IE6 - only ” stylesheet in the < head > section of your web pages :
<!--[ if IE6 ] > < link rel=" stylesheet " href = " http://domain.tld/ie6.css " media= " screen " /> <![ endif ] -->
Then , in the ie6.css stylesheet , we place all of the IE6 - specific hacks and other trickery that are needed in order to accomodate IE6 .
This enables us to consolidate our IE6 styles into a single stylesheet that is completely ignored by all other browsers .
With this method of applying styles to IE6 , there is no need for IE6 - specific hacks such as the so - called “ star - HTML ” hack or the underscore hack .
Selectors are simply targeted “ as - is ” from within the IE6 - only stylesheet .
Of course , conditional comments can do much more than target IE6 .
By design , they are able to target or filter any version (s ) of Internet Explorer for both HTML and XHTML .
For more information on conditional comments , these fine articles are highly recommended :
Target and filter IE6 with “ in - CSS ” hacks
Despite the usefulness of conditional comments , there are situations in which you may decide to apply IE6 - specific styles from within the stylesheet .
A good example of this may happen during site development , when it is more expedient and practical to work with a single stylesheet , in which IE6 styles are located next to “ normal ” styles for easy comparison .
Once development is complete , all “ in - CSS ” hacks may be consolidated to an IE6 stylesheet included via conditional comments .
Fortunately , when it comes to IE6 , there is no shortage of these in - CSS targeting methods .
Over the years , a few of these “ hacks ” have risen to the top of the pile , proving to be extremely useful and effective for targeting IE6 .
Perhaps the most widely used of these in - CSS techniques is known as the “ star - HTML ” hack :
/* target IE6 */* html # selector { color : red ; }
While standards - compliant browsers ignore this illogical selector , IE6 treats it as legitimate , even though < html > is the highest element in the document tree .
This enables us to apply CSS styles exclusively to IE6 without interfering with other browsers .
Best of all , this method of targeting IE6 is completely valid .
There are also cases where we need to hide styles from IE6 .
The following hack is referred to as the “ child - selector filter , ” and it enables us to apply CSS styles to all browsers except IE6 :
/* filter IE6 */ html > body # selector { color : red ; }
This selector is also completely valid , and readily applied by all standards - compliant browsers .
It is effective because IE6 simply does n’t understand its meaning .
Other useful methods of targeting and filtering IE6 include the ! important hack , which is useful when you need to override a property value for IE6 :
#selector { width : 200 px ! important ; /* target other browsers */ width : 100 px ; /* target IE6 and lower */ }
When there are two identical properties for a selctor , IE6 will apply the second property , even if the first property includes the ! important directive .
Other browsers will of course apply the ! important declaration , enabling us to target IE6 with the subsequent rule .
Enable alpha - transparent PNG support
One of the most frustrating shortcomings of IE6 is its lack of 32 - bit alpha - transparent PNG support .
When displaying a 32 - bit alpha - transparent PNG , IE6 replaces all transparency with an ugly grey background .
Fortunately , this is a well - known and frequently addressed issue for which there are a wide variety of workarounds and solutions .
Apart from avoiding the use of alpha - transparent PNG images altogether , perhaps the simplest way to ensure visual compatibility with IE6 is to stick with fully transparent PNG images , which are fully supported and displayed properly in all browsers , including IE6 .
A more practical approach is to apply alpha - transparency via 8 - bit PNG format rather than the usual 32 - bit format .
To do so , use a program such as Adobe Fireworks ( Photoshop does not work for this purpose ) , save your alpha - tranparent PNG image in 8 - bit format , and then include in your design as usual .
8 - bit PNGs may not look quite as good as 32 - bit versions , but their alpha - transparency degrades gracefully to full index transparency in IE6 .
This method enables you to employ alpha - transparency in all modern browsers without getting the ugly grey background in IE6 .
Of course , it is also possible to enable IE6 - support for 32 - bit alpha - transparency .
There are many different scripts that enable such functionality , but all of them ultimately rely on a proprietary Microsoft AlphaImageLoader filter that may be included in your CSS file as follows :
* html .iepngfix { behavior : url( iepngfix.htc ) ; }
To make this work , you need to upload these two files to the same directory as your CSS file .
The first file is a blank gif image , and the second file is an HTC script that provides IE6 ( and below ) with the functionality required for 32 - bit alpha - transparency .
This is the most basic implementation of the AlphaImageLoader filter , but more advanced functionality is also possible using a wide variety of freely available scripts .
Here are a few of my favorites :
Fix the broken box model
Early versions of Internet Explorer incorrectly interpreted the box model to include borders and padding in the calculation of the content width .
For example , consider the following case :
div { border : 10 px solid black ; padding : 10 px ; height : 100 px ; width : 100 px ; }
In modern browsers , the height and width of this division are each calculated according to W3C specifications as 100 px + 20 px + 20 px = 140 px .
In early versions of IE , however , the height and width are each calculated improperly as 100 px .
This discrepency is responsible for many design inconsistencies between standards - compliant browsers and older versions of Internet Explorer .
Fortunately , the broken box model was addressed in IE6 , which is capable of rendering proper widths for web pages that include a complete <! DOCTYPE > .
When a complete <! DOCTYPE > is present , IE6 switches to either “ standards - compliant mode ” or “ almost - standards - compliant mode , ” both of which cause IE6 to correctly interpret the box model .
Conversely , when a complete <! DOCTYPE > is not included in a web page , IE6 reverts to “ quirks mode ” and interprets the box model incorrectly .
Thus , the box - model problem is easily fixed in IE6 by including a complete <! DOCTYPE > and designing in standards - compliant mode .
If you need to work in quirks mode , the next easiest fix is to avoid applying padding or borders on elements for which you have specified a width .
You can always apply padding and / or margins to the enclosed elements .
Even with these solutions , there may be situations where it is necessary to control the height and width of specific elements .
In these cases , we may use the “ Tan Hack ” to get the job done :
# selector { border : 10 px solid black ; padding : 10 px ; height : 100 px ; width : 100 px ; } * html # selector { \height : 140 px ; /* targets IE5 and IE6 in quirks mode */ he\ight : 100 px ; /* targets IE6 in standards mode */ \ width : 140 px ; /* targets IE5 and IE6 in quirks mode */ w\idth : 100 px ; /* targets IE6 in standards mode */ }
In the first set of rules , we apply our width and height as normal for all standard - compliant browsers .
Then , in the second set of rules , we account for the broken box model in IE5 and IE6 quirks mode by adjusting the values for height and width to include the additonal padding and border widths .
That ’s quite a mouthful , so hopefully the code and comments will clarify the technique .
Fix min- width / max - width and min-height / max - height
Out of the box , IE6 fails to understand maximum and minimum height and width .
This is incredibly sad for designers , as many layout scenarios require these properties to function properly .
In modern , standards - compliant browsers , we can use the following CSS to acheive our goals :
div.max - height { max - height : 333 px ; } div. min - height { min-height : 333 px ; } div.max - width { max - width : 333 px ; } div. min - width { min-width : 333 px ; }
Of course , this is waaay tooo easy for Internet Explorer , which completely fails to understand these basic CSS properties .
Fortunately , IE supports its own , proprietary expression attribute , which enables us to use JavaScript expressions to manipulate ( X) HTML document properties such as max / min - width and max / min - height .
For example , to specify a width property value via the expression attribute , we could use this :
div { width : expression ( 333 + " px " ) ; }
.. Which is equivalent to this :
div { width : 333 px ; }
There are two downsides to using IE ’s expression attribute .
First , as expressions are essentially JavaScript , they fail when JavaScript is disabled ( or otherwise missing ) in the user ’s browser .
Second , use of CSS expressions for min/max properties is very resource intensive and may negatively impact browser performance .
Nonetheless , the setting of max / min - widths / heights remains an important tool in the web designer ’s toolbox .
With that in mind , here are some useful CSS expressions enabling complete min/max functionality in IE6 .
max - width
/* max - width for IE6 */ * html div.max - width { width : expression ( document.body.clientWidth > 776 ? " 777 px " : " auto " ) ; } /* max - width for standards - compliant browsers */ div.max - width { max - width : 777 px ; }
min-width
/* min-width for IE6 */ * html div.min- width { width : expression ( document.body.clientWidth < 334 ? " 333 px " : " auto " ) ; } /* min-width for standards - compliant browsers */ div.min - width { min-width : 333 px ; }
max - height
/* max - height for IE6 */ * html div.max - height { height : expression ( this.scrollHeight > 332 ? " 333 px " : " auto " ) ; } /* max - height for standards - compliant browsers */ div.max - height { max - height : 333 px ; }
min-height
Fortunately , we can skip the crazy JavaScript / CSS expressions when applying minimum height in IE6 .
Thanks to Dustin Diaz , we can set min-height in IE6 with this morsel of valid CSS :
/* min-height for IE6 */ div.min - height { min-height : 500 px ; height : auto ! important ; height : 500 px ; }
Kill the double margin bug
Most web designers who have been designing sites for awhile are familair with IE6’s “ doubled floated - margin bug . ”
This nasty bug rears its ugly head whenever you float an element ( such as a < div > ) in one direction and then apply a margin in that same direction .
For example , if we do this :
div { float : right ; margin - right : 10 px ; }
..IE6 will ( usually ) double the size of the margin to 20 px for no apparent reason whatsoever .
Needless to say , this double - margin bug has wrecked many a fine web design , causing much pain and distress along the way .
Fortunately , this bug is easy to kill .
Simply change the display type of the floated element from block to inline , like so :
div#selector { float : right ; margin - right : 10 px ; } * html div#selector { display : inline ; /* kill double - margin bug */ }
This solves the double - margin bug 99 % of the time without issue .
For those rare , unexplainable cases where this fix does n’t work , you may need to workaround the issue by removing the margin and applying padding to either the parent element or to the floated element itself .
Clear your floats
Clearing floats is another common layout challenge , not only for IE6 , but for many modern browsers .
In a perfect world , an element that contains a floated element enlcoses that element entirely .
In the imperfect world of web browsers , however , floats are frequently not entirely closed .
When this happens , we say that the floated element has not been “ cleared ” by its parent element .
Fortunately , there are several easy ways to clear your floats in IE6 and other browsers as well .
One of the oldest ways to clear your floats is to use the clearfix hack .
This CSS technique works by generating content after the parent element using the CSS : after pseudo - class .
The generated content then serves to clear the floated element .
Here is a typical example :
. clearfix : after { content : " " ; display : block ; height : 0 ; clear : both ; visibility : hidden ; } .clearfix { display : inline - table ; } /* Hides from IE - mac \*/ * html .clearfix {height : 1 % ;} .clearfix { display : block ; } /*
End hide from IE - mac */
To use this method to clear your floats , place it into your CSS file and change all instances of .clearfix to the selector of the element that needs to clear its floated ancestors .
Another CSS method of clearing your floats is to simply float the container element .
For example , if you float an image within a container < div > that fails to enclose it , simply apply the following CSS :
div { float : left ; }
Then , if the containing element needs to behave as a regular block element , apply a width of 100 % to force a line - break before the next element :
div { float : left ; width : 100 % ; }
So far so good , but there is an even better method of clearing your floats .
By simply applying an overflow value to the container < div > , it will automatically expand vertically and clear its floated children .
Here is an example :
div.container { overflow : hidden ; width : 100 % ; }
The width declaration is required for Internet Explorer and Opera , but it does n’t need to be set at 100 % ; rather , you may use any width and unit of measure that is needed .
If you do n’t want to specify a width , you may specify a height instead .
For the overflow property , you may use any of the following three values :
auto – display scrollbars if content exceeds specified width
– display scrollbars if content exceeds specified width hidden – never display scrollbars even if content exceeds width
– never display scrollbars even if content exceeds width scroll – always display scrollbars , even if they ’re not necessary
As well as this method works for clearing floated elements , there are cases where the overflow property can interfere with other aspects of the design .
If this should occur , you may want to try limiting the scope of the overflow by using overflow - x: hidden ; or overflow - y : hidden ; .
And remember , the width property may be replaced by height .
Fix other common IE6 problems
Wrapping things up , let ’s run through a few other problems commonly experienced with IE6 .
These issues and their corresponding fixes are fairly straightforward , so I will spare you the lengthy diatribe and jump straight to the point .
Keep in mind as you continue through this article that you should relocate and consolidate any IE6 - specific hacks into an IE6 - specific stylesheet , which should be included via conditional comments ( see first section , above ) .
Fix relative positioning
Using position : relative in your designs is perhaps the easiest way to mess things up in IE6 .
Modern browsers display relatively positioned nested elements without issue , but IE6 frequently chokes up on even slightly complicated layouts .
Fortunately , the solution is as easy as triggering hasLayout by adding zoom : 1 ; to each relatively positioned element :
. selector { position : relative ; } * html . selector { zoom : 1 ; }
Note that you should not apply zoom : 1 ; to any inline elements .
Doing so will cause IE6 to treat them as block elements .
Keep this in mind for the following solutions as well .
Fix negative margins
Negative margins are useful in a variety of scenarios , and most browsers handle them with no problem whatsoever .
Unfortunately , IE6 does n’t like negative margins unless you apply relative positioning to the target element :
. selector { margin : - 1.5em ; } * html . selector { position : relative ; zoom : 1 ; }
Note the addition of the zoom : 1 ; declaration , which is required because of the relative positioning .
Ai n’t IE great ?
Fix overflow problems
Using the overflow in IE6 will sometimes lead to unexpected , unexplainable display issues .
Fortunately , we can resolve many overflow - related display problems by triggering hasLayout via — yep , you guessed it — zoom : 1 ; .
Here is an example :
. selector { overflow : hidden } * html . selector { zoom : 1 ; }
Another strange overflow - related issue is observed when font - style : italic ; expands the width of its parent element .
Thankfully , this nuance is easily resolved by applying the following CSS to the parent element :
* html . selector { overflow -x : hidden ; }
Line up floated elements
When you float elements of a fixed width , they will align themselves horizontally to fit the width of the parent element .
At least , that ’s how it works in most browsers .
In IE6 , the floated items will not be displayed in a straight line , but rather will appear to stepdown in bizarre , staircase - like fashion .
Fortunately , there are two ways to fix this issue .
The first is to apply a line - height: 0 ; declaration to the parent element :
. selector { float : left ; width : 100 px ; clear : none ; } * html . selector { line - height : 0 ; }
Alternately , you may prevent stepdown by applying a display : inline ; declaration to the floated elements :
. selector { float : left ; width : 100 px ; clear : none ; } * html . selector { display : inline ; }
Fix your list items
Lastly , if IE6 decides to add an extra set of list items ( < li > ) after your list ( < ul > ) , adding an HTML comment has been known to magically resolve the issue .
Here is what your source code will look like before and after applying the fix :
Before :
< ul > < li>
Firefox </ li > < li> Opera</ li > < li> Safari</li > < li> Internet Explorer </ li > </ul > < li> Internet Explorer </ li > < li> Internet Explorer</li >
After :
< ul > < li>
Firefox </ li > < li> Opera</ li > < li> Safari</li > < li> Internet Explorer </ li > <-- IE6 fix --> </ul >
In Closing

During a major policy speech on healthcare , even President Obama found time to weigh in : " … I think it 's fair to say , number one , any of us would be pretty angry .
Number two , that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home .
And number three – what I think we know separate and apart from this incident – is that there is a long history in this country of African - Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately … "
Needless to say , the next morning 's papers talked about Obama calling Cambridge police " stupid " .
The arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates has been officially swallowed by the larger narrative of race in America .
Now I love a good racial escapade as much as the next person , but this one strikes me as uniquely unfortunate both in its timing and its capacity for becoming a flashpoint for unrelated resentments .
The facts not in dispute are straightforward .
Gates came home from a trip and found his front door jammed .
With the help of his driver , he tried to push the door open , unsuccessfully .
He then went to the back door , opened it with his key , turned off the alarm system and called Harvard 's property management company to report the sticky door .
Meanwhile , a passerby called the police to report that " two black males " were breaking into a house .
When the police arrived , they encountered Gates in his living room .
Gates provided his driving licence and his Harvard ID .
Here the stories diverge .
Gates says he asked the officer to identify himself and the officer refused .
The officer says that Gates was unco-operative , called him a racist and began shouting so loudly – " Your momma ! " and : " You do n't know who you 're messing with ! " according to the police report – that the noise constituted " tumultuous behaviour " and " public disorder " .
Gates was handcuffed and hauled off to jail for a few hours .
A day later , a judge dismissed the charges , saying both sides had acted badly .
Gates demanded that the arresting officer apologise ; the officer demanded that Gates apologise .
The Cambridge police department demanded that President Obama apologise , which he did , quite eloquently as usual .
Gates took to national television to set the record straight .
Al Sharpton announced his intention to march in protest .
And Michael Jackson , pushed from the front pages for a hot minute , was finally able to rest in peace .
Most unfortunate , but as American crime blotters go , this one is no big deal .
Yes , racial profiling is an endemic , massive problem , but in this instance the police were called because of at least minimally suspicious behaviour – two men trying to force open a door .
And yes , ( allegedly ) shouting angry taunts at the police is n't tea - time politesse , but it does seem that the officer might have responded to it in a more professional manner than elevating it to the level of public " tumult " .
What makes this case so interesting – and alarming – is the vitriolic public commentary that ensued .
Early newspaper and on - line accounts helped seed confusion , varying wildly : some gave the impression that Gates was trying to break into a house not his own , some that he refused to identify himself or that he resisted arrest .
None of that was true .
But the larger backlash has quickly moved from the individual incident itself to condemnations in the stereotyped plural , concentrating on a very tight set of recurring themes : Gates is " uppity " , arrogant , pseudo - educated .
He should have been grateful that the police came to his house at all .
Harvard was stupid for hiring him .
African - American studies , the department Gates chairs , is a non-subject , only on the curriculum to keep black students from rioting .
The Ivy League is run by politically correct " wusses " who do n't have the courage to get rid of " undeserving " " whiners " .
Who could blame police officers for refusing to come to black homes or neighbourhoods if this is what they get ?
" Those people " have jobs a " more qualified " white person should be holding .
( Where , oh where , our fleeting " post- racial " moment of Kumbaya ? )
I mentioned that timing was also a probable factor in this brouhaha .
The entire week before Gates 's arrest was consumed with reports of the congressional hearings for Obama 's Supreme Court nominee , Judge Sonia Sotomayor .
She would be the first Hispanic and only the third woman sitting in our highest court .
Hence , racial resentment had already been simmering on the shock - jock media burners .
Three ultra -conservative senators in particular grilled her , day after day , using some of the most prejudiced , stereotype - laden language we 've heard publicly in many a year .
Despite the fact that Sotomayor graduated at the top of her class from Princeton and Yale Law School , she has been attacked as not qualified , chosen not for merit but because she 's a woman or Latina .
Pundits such as Pat Buchanan railed that " affirmative action is to increase diversity by discriminating against white males " .
Furthermore , said Buchanan , there could be nothing wrong with a court of all white men , because , after all " white men were 100 % of the people who wrote the constitution , 100 % of the people who signed the Declaration of Independence , 100 % of the people who died at Gettysburg and Vicksburg … "
Then , too , controversy erupted over a statement Sotomayor made years ago , in which she hoped her life experience as a Latina woman would lend her wisdom in ways that might allow her easier insights into situations that others might not have lived through .
This , the so - called " wise Latina woman " statement , has got her relentlessly labelled a " reverse racist " by the shock - jocky press .
Finally , Judge Sotomayor was part of a panel of judges that ruled , based on established precedent , that a hiring test given by the New Haven fire department should be scrutinised for bias , after all the African - American applicants and all but one Hispanic failed the test .
Coincidentally , barely a month ago , the conservative majority of the Supreme Court narrowly overruled that holding , saying that disparate impact was not alone sufficient to strike down the test – and that it was " racism " against the white firefighters who did pass the test .
As a visual flourish , during Sotomayor 's hearing , row upon row of New Haven firefighters ( in uniform , all white men but for that lonely Hispanic ) sat in on the hearing , there to object to her nomination .
The cameras loved it , panning their solemn faces relentlessly .
In short , the Sotomayor hearing and the New Haven firefighters case have reignited the general American debate about affirmative action .
So when the extremely distinguished Harvard university professor Henry Louis Gates was carted off in handcuffs , allegedly calling out : " This is what happens to black men in America ! " , there was a distinct shimmer of schadenfreude in some parts of the national psyche .
The reactionary themes that had been percolating during the last few weeks came bursting to the fore : minorities are taking over !
Obama is only appointing non-whites !
White people are the truly oppressed !
People of colour , particularly ones who went to Harvard , Yale or Princeton , are reverse racists .
The arrest itself is hardly the best example of either racial profiling or police - state oppression .
But the discourse that has welled up in its wake reveals a public inclination that is marred by that and more .

Officials have shut down a legal aid and research centre founded by pioneering Chinese lawyers , increasing fears of a crackdown on those who take sensitive cases .
Authorities have also revoked the licences of more than 50 lawyers , many known for tackling human rights issues .
About 20 officials from Beijing 's civil affairs bureau arrived at the Gongmeng ( Open Constitution Initiative ) offices yesterday , confiscating computers and other equipment and questioning staff about their work .
Lawyers from the centre have acted in numerous high - profile cases , most recently representing parents whose children were taken ill due to milk tainted with melamine .
It issued a report criticising the government 's handling of unrest across the Tibetan plateau last year and has helped petitioners , relocated families and other disadvantaged groups .
Its closure came two days after the Beijing tax bureau fined Gongmeng 1.4 m yuan ( about £ 125,000 ) , saying it had not paid its taxes .
Xu Zhiyong , one of its founders , said officials told them the centre was not registered as an NGO .
He said it was operating legally as a charitable body under the Gongmeng company .
" Gongmeng had to be registered as a company because when we went to register as an NGO , the civil affairs bureau did n't allow us to do it , " he said .
Xu said there had been a small delay in paying taxes , but they had paid the full amount and yet the heaviest fine was levied .
" There is a reason they gave us a big fine and shut us down .
It is because we have offended certain ' black ' [ shady ] powers , " he said .
" We will continue our work and will act according to our consciences . "
Another of the founders , Teng Biao , wrote in a text message : " Suppressing civil society in this way is illegal and stupid .
Maybe it is the dark before the dawn ?
Anyhow , our ideals and actions in pursuit of freedom wo n't change . "
Neither the tax bureau nor the civil affairs bureau responded to faxed questions regarding the shutdown .
The Associated Press reported yesterday that authorities had cancelled the licences of 53 Beijing - based lawyers , effectively banning them from working .
It cited a notice on the Beijing justice bureau 's website , which said the lawyers had been penalised because they did not pass an assessment by their firms or failed to register with the bureau .
Li Heping said he had not been notified personally but had been told he was disbarred .
When he previously asked why his licence renewal was delayed , officials said it was because he had been involved in sensitive cases .
" What have we done that failed to meet their standards ?
They do n't give any details , " he said .
" What happened is not totally unexpected .
In China , any strange or ridiculous thing can happen . "
Human rights groups responded angrily to both developments .
" The shutdown of the Gongmeng law research centre sends a strong signal that the government will continue to tighten control over civil society in every respect – to sweep up , so to speak – in preparation for the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People 's Republic of China in October , " said Sharon Hom , executive director of the US - based organisation Human Rights in China .
Sophie Richardson , Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch , warned : " The attack on OCI [ Gongmeng ] marks a new low in the Chinese government 's campaign against human rights defenders .
This is precisely the kind of organisation whose work the government should value , as it helps ease grievances and minimise unrest . "
ROME /AIX-EN - PROVENCE , France ( Reuters ) - France and Russia on Sunday urged a debate about the world ’s reserve currencies , but China said the dollar would keep its pre-eminence for “ many years to come . ”
Beijing , which has floated the idea of an alternative to the dollar as global reserve currency one day , wants the matter discussed at this week ’s G8 summit in Italy , officials say .
But in remarks that appeared intended to reassure Washington , Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei told reporters in Rome : “ The U.S. dollar is still the most important and major reserve currency of the day , and we believe that that situation will continue for many years to come .
“ You may have heard comments , opinions from academic circles about the idea of establishing a super sovereign currency .
This is all , I believe , now a discussion among academics .
It is not the position of the Chinese government . ”
China ’s central bank head launched the debate last March when he said the SDR , the International Monetary Fund ’s unit of account , might one day displace the dollar .
The debate is highly sensitive in financial markets , which are wary of risks to U.S. asset values .
Bankers reckon China holds perhaps 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion in official currency reserves in the dollar .
Several emerging market countries have said they want to reconsider the dollar ’s role and see a more diversified international monetary system .
“ The dollar system or the system based on the dollar and euro have shown that they are flawed .
But I am a realist and I understand that today there is no alternative to the dollar or the European currency , ” Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said in an interview with Italian media .
“ There should be more reserve currencies .
So we consider that we need to think about the creation of regional reserve currencies . ”
STRONG DOLLAR MANTRA
European Central Bank Jean - Claude Trichet said it was important that the United States stayed committed to a strong currency .
“ On this issue , I am very , very clear .
I have just one message ...
It is extremely important that the United States of America ... has been ... saying that a strong dollar is in the interests of the United States of America , ” Trichet said .
“ I consider that extremely important and I welcome this declaration , ” he added .
France ’s Economy Minister Christine Lagarde told reporters at a conference : “ We should explore a better coordination of foreign - exchange policies , which would raise the question over the medium term of the balance of exchange rates and the role of currencies that have changed both as a result of the crisis and the role played by emerging market countries . ”
On Friday , Suresh Tendulkar , chairman of the Indian prime minister ’s economic advisory council , said the dollar ’s weight
in the basket of currencies that helps set the rate of India ’s partially convertible rupee currency may be reduced .
Up until now , the U.S. dollar had been considered the main reserve currency in India .
However , “ India may change , ” he said .
“ I think if you look at the global imbalances that were being talked about today between the surpluses ( of ) China and Japan and the deficits of the United States , I think that needs to be corrected .
That I think is clear ,
Tendulkar said at the conference in Aix - en - Provence , France .
Asked whether the U.S. dollar should be weaker , he said : “ I think it is necessary ... it should go down . ”
Asian Development Bank President Haruhiko Kuroda , however , said on Sunday it was important that global imbalances be unwound gradually .
Amazing Paper Craft Castle On the Ocean
I had the immense opportunity to see this wonderful paper craft art installation by a genius of the name of Wataru Itou , a young student of a major art university here in Tokyo .
The installation is hand made over four years of hard work , complete with electrical lights and a moving train , all made of paper !
Clearly , this man must have created one of the most stunning examples of Paper Craft in the world ?
At the exhibition you will also have the chance to see a video showing Mr. Itou at work in his studio , cutting and folding piece by piece .
The exhibition is called Umi no Ue no Oshiro ( A Castle On the Ocean ) .
It is exhibited at Uminohotaru , a place which in itself is a major attraction : a service area in the middle of the ocean , right between Tokyo City and Chiba Prefecture .
If you have n’t checked it out yet , use Google Earth for a close up of what is probably the weirdest parking lot in the world .
Well , it ’s more than a parking lot actually , but I am saving a more detailed description along with photos for another post .
For now , enjoy this wonderful work of art !
We all know why Starbucks puts boxes of breath mints close to the cash register .
Your morning latte can create a startling aroma in your mouth , strong enough to startle your co-workers too .
But intriguing new research from Tel Aviv University by renowned breath specialist Prof.
Mel Rosenberg of TAU 's Sackler Faculty of Medicine finds that a coffee extract can inhibit the bacteria that lead to bad breath .
New laboratory tests have shown that the extract prevents malodorous bacteria from making their presence felt - or smelt .
" Everybody thinks that coffee causes bad breath , " says Prof .
Rosenberg , " and it 's often true , because coffee , which has a dehydrating effect in the mouth , becomes potent when mixed with milk , and can ferment into smelly substances . "
But not always .
" Contrary to our expectations , we found some components in coffee that actually inhibit bad breath , " explains Prof. Rosenberg .
The findings were presented last month to members of the International Society for Breath Odour Research in Germany by Yael Gov , a researcher in Prof.
Rosenberg 's laboratory .
A " taster 's choice " for stopping bad bacteria
In the laboratory , the team monitored the bacterial odour production of coffee in saliva .
In the study , three different brands of coffee were tested : the Israeli brand Elite coffee , Landwer Turkish coffee , and Taster 's Choice .
Prof .
Rosenberg expected to demonstrate the malodor - causing effect of coffee in an in vitro saliva assay developed by Dr. Sarit Levitan in his laboratory .
To his surprise , the extracts had the opposite effect .
" The lesson we learned here is one of humility , " says Prof. Rosenberg .
" We expected coffee would cause bad breath , but there is something inside this magic brew that has the opposite effect . "
Prof .
Rosenberg would love to isolate the bacterial - inhibiting molecule in order to reap the biggest anti-bacterial benefits from coffee .
" It 's not the raw extract we will use , he says , " but an active material within it . "
His latest discovery could be the foundation for an entirely new class of mouthwash , breath mints and gum .
Purified coffee extract can be added to a breath mint to stop bacteria from forming , stopping bad breath at its source , instead of masking the smell with a mint flavor .
Prof .
Rosenberg is a successful scientist and inventor who has already developed a popular mouthwash sold widely in Europe , a pocket - based breath test , and an anti-odour chewing gum .
For more than 200 years , buried deep within Thomas Jefferson 's correspondence and papers , there lay a mysterious cipher -- a coded message that appears to have remained unsolved .
Until now .
The cryptic message was sent to President Jefferson in December 1801 by his friend and frequent correspondent , Robert Patterson , a mathematics professor at the University of Pennsylvania .
President Jefferson and Mr. Patterson were both officials at the American Philosophical Society -- a group that promoted scholarly research in the sciences and humanities -- and were enthusiasts of ciphers and other codes , regularly exchanging letters about them .
In this message , Mr. Patterson set out to show the president and primary author of the Declaration of Independence what he deemed to be a nearly flawless cipher .
" The art of secret writing , " or writing in cipher , has " engaged the attention both of the states - man & philosopher for many ages , " Mr. Patterson wrote .
But , he added , most ciphers fall " far short of perfection . "
To Mr. Patterson 's view , a perfect code had four properties :
It should be adaptable to all languages ; it should be simple to learn and memorize ; it should be easy to write and to read ; and most important of all , " it should be absolutely inscrutable to all unacquainted with the particular key or secret for decyphering . "
Mr. Patterson then included in the letter an example of a message in his cipher , one that would be so difficult to decode that it would " defy the united ingenuity of the whole human race , " he wrote .
Yeah , we 're all been - there - done - that with portable SNESs these days , but we 've never seen it done like this .
Marshall posted his creation , dubbed the " SUPERTENDO , " to Ben Heck 's forums , which seems to imply ( along with the looks ) that he took some queues from similar designs already floating around those parts .
What really sets this one apart , however , is the vacuum - formed chassis and the instant " make me an offer " move to a sale -- being owned by a major faceless media conglomerate ourselves , we like to see a guy who 's out for a buck .

UNIONTOWN , Pa. --
A western Pennsylvania teenager says her mother drugged her so that the mother 's boyfriend could get her pregnant .
Police say 32 - year - old Shana Brown , of Uniontown , wanted her 13 - year - old daughter to carry the child because she 's unable to have more children .
The daughter did n't become pregnant .
The daughter testified Tuesday at a preliminary hearing for the mother 's boyfriend , 40 - year - old Duane Calloway .
She says she was given alcohol and sleeping pills mixed in tea and soda several times .
Afterward , she says Calloway touched her inappropriately .
Brown waived her hearing on a charge of endangering the welfare of a child ; Calloway was held for trial on a charge of attempted rape .
Calloway 's attorney says he 's innocent .
Toys For Your Badass Baby
Think your baby boy is going to grow up to be as hard as Chuck “ Ice Man ” Liddell ?
Why not ensure that he becomes a badass by buying him some badass baby toys ?
If he lives through it , he ’ll live through anything .
All kidding aside , this is some pretty impressive fine art .
Forget the old folk tales about snakes hypnotizing their prey .
The tentacled snake from South East Asia has developed a more effective technique .
The small water snake has found a way to startle its prey so that the fish turn toward the snake 's head to flee instead of turning away .
In addition , the fish 's reaction is so predictable that the snake actually aims its strike at the position where the fish 's head will be instead of tracking its actual movement .
" I have n't been able to find reports of any other predators that exhibit a similar ability to influence and predict the future behavior of their prey , " says Kenneth Catania , associate professor of biological sciences at Vanderbilt University , who has used high - speed video to deconstruct the snake 's unusual hunting technique .
His observations are published this week in the online early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Catania , who is the recipient of a MacArthur " genius " award , studies the brains and behavior of species with extreme specializations .
He was attracted to the tentacled snake because it is the only snake that comes equipped with a pair of short tentacles on its nose and he was curious about their function .
" Before I begin a study on a new species , it is my practice to spend some time simply observing its basic behavior , " Catania explains .
The snake forms an unusual " J " shape with its head at the bottom of the " J " when it is fishing .
Then it remains completely motionless until a fish swims into the area near the hook of the " J . "
That is when the snake strikes .
The snakes ' motions take only a few hundredths of a second and are too fast for the human eye to follow .
However , its prey reacts even faster , in a few thousandths of a second .
In fact , fish are famous for the rapidity of their escape response and it has been extensively studied .
These studies have found that many fish have a special circuit in their brains that initiates the escape , which biologists call the " C - start . "
Fish ears sense the sound pressure on each side of their body .
When the ear on one side detects a disturbance , it sends a message to the fishes ' muscles causing its body to bend into a C - shape facing in the opposite direction so it can begin swimming away from danger as quickly as possible .
Catania is the first scientist to study this particular predator - prey interaction with the aid of a high - speed video camera .
When he began examining the movements of the snake and its prey in slow motion , he saw something peculiar .
When the fish that the snake targets turn to flee , most of them turn toward the snake 's head and many literally swim into its jaws !
In 120 trials with four different snakes , in fact , he discovered that an amazing 78 percent of the fish turned toward the snake 's head instead of turning away .
Next , the biologist noticed that the first part of its body that the snake moves is not its head .
Instead , it flexes a point midway down its body .
Using a sensitive hydrophone that he put in the aquarium , he confirmed that this body fake produces sound waves intense enough to trigger the fish 's C - start response .
Because these sound waves come from the side opposite the snake 's head , this reflex action drives the fish to turn and swim directly toward the snake 's mouth .
" Once the C - start begins , the fish can't turn back , " Catania says .
" The snake has found a way to use the fish 's escape reflex to its advantage . "
As he studied the snake 's actions even closer , he made an even more remarkable discovery .
When it strikes , the snake does n't aim for the fish 's initial position and then adjust its direction as the fish moves - the way most predators do .
Instead it heads directly for the location where it expects the fish 's head to be .
" The best evidence for this is the cases when the snake misses , " says Catania .
" Not all the targeted fish react with a C - start and the snake almost always misses those that do n't react reflexively . "
Catania 's next step will be to determine whether this predictive capability is hard - wired or learned .
To do so , he hopes to obtain some baby snakes that have just hatched and videotape their first efforts to catch prey .

As military " coups " go , the one this weekend in Honduras was strangely , well , democratic .
The military did n't oust President Manuel Zelaya on its own but instead followed an order of the Supreme Court .
It also quickly turned power over to the president of the Honduran Congress , a man from the same party as Mr. Zelaya .
The legislature and legal authorities all remain intact .
We mention these not so small details because they are being overlooked as the world , including the U.S. President , denounces tiny Honduras in a way that ...

Ten years ago , with yoga transforming into a ubiquitous pop culture phenomenon from a niche pursuit , yoga teachers banded together to create a voluntary online registry of schools meeting new standards for training instructors .
But that list  which now includes nearly 1,000 yoga schools nationwide , many of them tiny  is being put to a use for which it was never intended .
It is the key document in a crackdown that pits free - spirited yogis against lumbering state governments , which , unlike those they are trying to regulate , are not always known for their flexibility .
Citing laws that govern vocational schools , like those for hairdressers and truck drivers , regulators have begun to require licenses for yoga schools that train instructors , with all the fees , inspections and paperwork that entails .
While confrontations have played out differently in different states , threats of shutdowns and fines have , in some cases , been met with accusations of power grabs and religious infringement  disputes that seem far removed from the meditative world yoga calls to mind .
In April , New York State sent letters to about 80 schools warning them to suspend teacher training programs immediately or risk fines of up to $ 50,000 .
But yogis around the state joined in opposition , and the state has , for now , backed down .
At least two people have been killed as Honduran troops attempted to disperse supporters of ousted President Manuel Zelaya at Tegucigalpa airport .
The protesters had been hoping to welcome the Mr Zelaya on his return to the country but he was forced to divert his homecoming jet to Nicaragua after it was barred from landing in Tegucigalpa .
Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade apologized on air this morning for comments he made a few weeks back about how Swedish people have " pure genes , " while Americans do n't because they " marry everybody , " including " other species . "
That comment prompted UNITY , a group for journalists of color , to demand an apology from the Fox host .
And today he did .

India is debating whether the new TV show threatens the country 's moral values
By Jyotsna Singh
BBC News , Delhi
Have you ever had an affair with a married man ?
Have you ever enjoyed watching a male stripper take off his clothes at a party ?
Have you ever had surgery to physically enhance your appearance ?
These are just some of the questions on a popular TV talk show that have raised the hackles of politicians in India .
They have held animated debates in parliament , arguing whether the Indian version of the hit American show Moment of Truth threatens India 's " moral and cultural values " .
The show , called Sach Ka Saamna ( Face the Truth ) , was first aired two weeks ago , and is already one of the most - watched programmes on Indian television .
Some say it is possibly the most - watched show in the crowded market of reality TV .
The programme has been debated several times in the Indian parliament
But many of India 's politicians are much less enamoured with the show , which goads the participants to answer uncomfortably personal and sometimes embarrassing questions , in return for prize money .
The idea of discussing intimate personal details in public is completely new to Indians .
Little surprise then , that the show has become a huge talking point .
Over the last few days , the issue has consistently come up for debate in the national parliament .
The MPs said those taking part in the show were being asked " obscene questions " about their personal lives in front of their families .
Statutory warning
The former deputy speaker of the upper house of parliament , Najma Heptullah , told the BBC that the series must be taken off air at once .
" What purpose are we serving with this programme ? " she asks .
" If someone has cheated on his wife , why does n't he go and tell his wife ?
Why does he need to do that in public ?
" If a girl decides to become pregnant as a minor , it is her problem !
Why should that be said in public ? "
I would just like to say that not everyone has the courage to come and face the truth in front of the world , even if the lure is money or publicity
Show host Rajeev Khandelwal
Those supporting the show , which is broadcast at 2230 on the Star Plus channel , argue that it is on air well past primetime , and carries a statutory warning .
The viewers , they say , can always simply turn it off .
But politicians like Mrs Heptullah argue there is no escaping it .
" Blaring promotions for the programme are run across various channels throughout the day and night , " she says .
Mrs Heptullah is convinced the show is all about making big money and boosting television ratings .
' Voyeuristic '
The host of the show , Rajeev Khandelwal , disagrees .
On his blog he writes : " I would just like to say that not everyone has the courage to come and face the truth in front of the world , even if the lure is money or publicity .
I think the series should be stopped , because it talks about people 's private and personal lives too much
Jyotsna Chowdhary
" To reveal the truth about one 's personal life is not easy .
It hurts when people debate about the questions in the show related to their sexual lives , and ignore all the other questions which revolve around more sensitive aspects of one 's life .
" Are people voyeuristic or the contestants brazen ?
I leave it on your sensible minds to ponder over it . "
Mr Khandelwal says the contestants who have spoken about their relationships on the programme have told him that their relationships have deepened and become more meaningful .
' Ban it '
But opinions on Delhi 's streets about whether to ban the programme are divided .
" If somebody wants to speak out , and the public gets to know about it , what is wrong with that ? " says a banker , Sahil .
" I think the series should be stopped , because it talks about people 's private and personal lives too much , " a young student , Jyotsna Chowdhary , told the BBC .
Meanwhile , the government has sought an explanation from the television channel broadcasting the reality show .
The opposition has called for stronger regulation of broadcasters .
The controversy has sparked a new debate about government intervention in the media .
Ambika Soni wants to ensure that traditional values are not eroded All Indian TV channels are bound by a programming and advertising code , which analysts say is open to both harsh and lenient interpretations .
The federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting , Ambika Soni , told parliament : " I am a woman , a mother and a grandmother , and I am concerned about the issues , as all members are , and to see that the values we grew up with do not get eroded " .
But she added that there was strong sensitivity in the media against government control , and the government was evolving a consensus that could lead to the formation of an independent regulator .
Censorship fears
There are many in the media , as well ordinary people , who say the MPs need to focus more on the pressing issues of the country 's social and economic development , rather dwelling so much on the morality of TV shows .
Meanwhile , many experts say any move to gag the media must be resisted , even though there may be a need to take a look at TV shows that are beginning to test the boundaries of good taste .
Analyst Shailaja Bajpai wrote in the Indian Express newspaper : " No-one was in the least bit surprised when MPs raised questions about Sach Ka Saamna .
" The fact that the furore has given the show more free publicity than it could have paid for ( or deserved ) , is the only tangible result they have to show for their questions .
" Will our dreams and innermost desires , which we may or may not act upon , be censored too ? "

Conservatives pride themselves on being the vanguard for what is great about America : its values and liberties .
Problems , however , arise when one examines both conservative values and the methods they use to defend them .
Perhaps a closer inspection of both their values and methods is in order to verify the Conservatives ' self - proclamation .
First , what is a conservative ?
How do we distinguish a conservative from a liberal ?
A quick summary that I have seen conservatives use before can be found at click here
Conservative Beliefs vs Liberal Beliefs
Natural Law Positive Law
Established Institutions Progress
Liberty Over Equality Equality Over Liberty
Suspicion of Power Benevolent Government
Exceptionalism Human Perfectability
Individualism Community .
Of course the above list can be misinterpreted and false views of both Conservatives and Liberals can be easily arrived at by the reader unless one delves more deeply into the characteristics with which conservatives love to adorn themselves .
Natural Law
Belief in Natural Law , according to the above conservative website , is belief in both the existence of good and evil and that the source of all laws and liberties are from God or are Platonic , as opposed to originating with man .
Man might recognize these laws , such as in a just government , but the Conservative believes that these laws exist regardless of man 's recognition .
Here conservatives distinguish themselves from liberals by describing liberals as believing in progressive law .
The difference between the two can be seen in the absence / presence of the term from the Declaration of Independence : " self - evident . "
The liberal , according to the conservative website , believes that rights originate when they are recognized by the government .
Thus , according to many conservatives , liberals believe that man is the source of rights vs a higher authority .
This jeopardizes our rights because just as rights can easily come through man , they can easily be taken away by man .
Established Institutions
The next comparison consists of the Conservative trust in Established Institutions vs the Liberal pursuit of progress .
For conservatives , these Established Institutions already have name tags .
These institutions are the Constitution , the Bill of Rights , the Anglo - Saxon view of law and government , church and family .
Here , Established Institutions are , without explanation and justification , identified .
Do American conservatives wish to say that conservatives world wide hold to these institutions or just American conservatives .
And if the latter , are American conservatives the only ones who cling to the correct institutions while conservatives from other parts of the world and liberals are wrong ?
If so , the implications are both obvious and ominous .
The American conservative must not only be distinguished from all other conservatives , American conservatives must now unite for they are now engaged in a us vs the world battle for justice .
Here , liberals become an anathema to Conservatives because liberals see mankind 's hope in how well they can tinker with , tweak and even replace the institutions that have been given from on high .
Here , of course , the Conservative must show how secular institutions , like the Constitution and the Bill of Rights , can be considered as coming from on high .
The problem for the Conservative though is that the only sources for acceptable institutions are culturally and even racially defined : the American Christian religion , documents from the American founding fathers , and Anglo - Saxon tradition .
What is presupposed here is a cultural and even racial superiority .
Pointing out the latter will no doubt produce a defensive reaction .
But when established institutions are identified with an ethnicity , what other conclusions can be drawn ?
The Conservative belief in Established Institutions is a self - proclamation of cultural and ethnic superiority .
Of course , American Christian conservatives will use the Bible as their defense of Established Institutions .
They assume that their recognized Established secular Institutions are Biblical ones as well .
It is at this point that American Christian Conservatives feel pressured to draw close ties between the Bible and the work of our nation 's founding fathers .
The pressure becomes so great that obvious discrepancies between the two are denied .
This pressure also moves some conservatives to defend unconscionable institutions from the past such as slavery because such was seemingly endorsed by the Bible .
Liberty
The next Conservative vs Liberal value sound off comes on what to put the most precedence , liberty or equality .
Conservatives believe that , with the exception of equal rights and opportunity , one must choose between liberty and equality .
To choose equality is to limit freedom .
The problem here is that the forms of equality that the Conservative sees as threatening are vague .
It is acknowledged that equal standing before the law , regardless of wealth and nobility , are consistent with what the Founding Fathers promoted and thus a part of the Established Institutions .
So what equality do conservatives find so troublesome ?

MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) -- Cleveland Browns wide receiver Donte Stallworth will spend 30 days in jail for a DUI manslaughter that killed a construction worker in March under terms of a plea agreement , prosecutors said Tuesday .
The Cleveland Browns ' Donte Stallworth can continue to play football , but his driver 's license is revoked for life .
Stallworth , 28 , pleaded guilty in a Florida court Tuesday to killing Mario Reyes while driving under the influence of alcohol .
He began serving his sentence immediately , said Terry Chavez , spokeswoman for the Miami - Dade state attorney 's office .
With his mother , Donna Stallworth , at his side , Stallworth offered his " deepest condolences to the Reyes family . "
" Though I cannot bring back Mr. Reyes or ease his family 's pain , I can and will honor his memory by committing my time , my resources and my voice by educating this community about the dangers of drunk driving , " Stallworth said in court .
State attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle called the judgment " just " and said that Reyes ' family supported the plea agreement .
Stallworth cooperated with police and did not have a record of traffic violations or criminal convictions , she said in a news release .
" Although no sentence can ever restore Mr. Reyes to his family , the provisions of this plea will provide closure to them and appropriate punishment for Mr. Stallworth 's conduct and the effects of his actions that night , " she said .
Stallworth reached an " amicable " financial settlement with the Reyes family , his lawyer , Chris Lyons , told CNN sister network HLN .
He would not disclose the amount , but said the short jail term " had nothing to do with Donte Stallworth being a celebrity , a professional football player or money . "
" Everyone today thought it was a fair and just result , including the judge , " Lyons said .
Stallworth has shown " genuine remorse " and accepted responsibility for his actions , the lawyer said .
" He already had dedicated his life to serving the community outside the public eye , " he said .
" He is really looking forward to the enormous responsibility that he has to go out there around the country , giving public service announcements , speaking at high schools about this tragedy , so that people can learn from this and not have it happen again . "
After his release , Stallworth faces two years of house arrest , but he can still play professional football , Chavez said .
The Cleveland Browns declined comment .
Stallworth 's plea agreement also requires that he donate $ 2,500 to the activist group Mothers Against Drunk Driving .
He will be on probation for eight years and must submit to random drug testing and drug and alcohol counseling for the entirety of his probation , Chavez said .
His license to drive was revoked for life .
Stallworth was driving his black Bentley GT east on the MacArthur Causeway , which connects Miami to the South Beach area of Miami Beach , when he struck Reyes , according to a prosecutor 's statement .
Stallworth told the arriving officer that he was the driver of the car and said , " I hit the man lying in the road , " according to a court document .
Stallworth had been at a Miami Beach club earlier and had been drinking , according to court documents .
The veteran NFL player 's blood - alcohol level was 0.126 , Chavez said .
Florida 's legal limit is 0.08 .
Reyes suffered " critical head , chest and abdominal injuries " and died at a hospital , according to court documents .
All About Probation and House Arrest • Cleveland Browns • Donte ' Stallworth • Mothers Against Drunk Driving • Miami Beach
It 's considered the ultimate taboo for any woman .
In this day and age , to admit that you do n't want children is seen as practically the same as saying Adolf Hitler had a point .
It 's best to keep your beliefs to yourself .
After all , we live in a world where fertility and motherhood can practically elevate you to living sainthood - just ask Angelina Jolie .
But Cameron Diaz does n't quite see it that way and , while publicising her first movie role as a mother in My Sister 's Keeper , she defended those women who do n't want to have children , saying that there are enough people already on this planet and that we do n't need any more kids .
" I think women are afraid to say that they do n't want children because they 're going to get shunned , " the actress said in an interview with Cosmopolitan .
" But I think that 's changing too now .
I have more girlfriends who do n't have kids than those that do .
And honestly ?
We do n't need any more kids .
We have plenty of people on this planet . "
While there are lots of reasons to not want to procreate , not many people say it 's because children are n't eco-friendly .
But one woman who would agree with the actress is Toni Vernelli .
The British woman works for an environmental charity and says she was sterilised at the age of 27 in order to reduce her carbon footprint .
Having accidentally fallen pregnant 10 years earlier , she had begged the doctor who was performing the termination to sterilise her at the same time .
He refused , but that did n't stop her hunting for someone who was willing to perform the surgery .
Eventually , she found a surgeon who was willing to oblige .
" Having children is selfish .
It 's all about maintaining your genetic line at the expense of the planet , " said Toni .
" Every person who is born uses more food , more water , more land , more fossil fuels , more trees and produces more rubbish , more pollution , more greenhouse gases , and adds to the problem of over - population . "
This may be an extremist view , but lots of women are ambivalent about reproducing , especially those who put career ahead of family .
In 2006 , a report was published by the US Census Bureau which showed that 20 pc of American women from the ages of 40 to 44 do not have children -- double the level of 30 years ago .
The study also found that women with advanced degrees were more likely to be childless .
Of women aged 40 to 44 with graduate or professional degrees , 27 pc are childless , compared with 18 pc of women who did not continue their education beyond high school .
With the current recession , one would expect birth rates to follow the trends of past economic recessions and decrease further again .
For Orlaith Young ( 26 ) not wanting children has nothing to do with either environmental or economic factors .
" I knew about two or three years ago that I did n't want to have kids , " says Orlaith , a secondary school teacher from Greystones , Co Wicklow .
" I just do n't have a natural affinity with them and I would be too conscious I would n't raise them to have the social and moral capabilities that I 'd want them to have .
" I 'm not sure how to get the best out of them and I 'd be stressed about not having nice children .
" I do n't enjoy young kids and I 'm impatient with them .
I 'd prefer to be handed a teenager if anything , " Orlaith continues .
" Being a teacher probably has something to do with that but coming from a science background I 'm also aware of what can go wrong genetically , and the possibility of having a child with a disability really scares me -- I just would n't be able to cope . "
Orlaith says that the idea of adoption is more appealing , even though the thought of pregnancy and childbirth does n't bother her at all .
" I just would n't want to have to give up my life .
I 've no problem being an auntie or whatever but I just do n't want my own .
Having said that , if I met someone and became involved in a serious relationship with them and they desperately wanted kids I 'm not saying I would n't reconsider . "
However , for Charlie Lewis ( 29 ) her mind has been made up for as long as she can remember , and fortunately her partner Eoghan is in agreement .
" I 've always known I did n't want to have children but people always told me that that would change as I got older , " says Charlie , who works as a project manager in Dublin city .
" I do n't feel I 'd want to take on the responsibility ; it makes me nervous .
" Having seen my friends and cousins who have kids and observed what is involved , I would n't want the pressure of having to plan every little thing .
I 'm much more career - focused and I do n't want to take away from that . "
In contrast to Toni Vernelli 's beliefs , Charlie has had people tell her it is a selfish decision not to have kids .
" A lot of older women are shocked by my decision and have told me it is selfish , but I do n't take it personally .
I love other people 's kids , but I also love being able to hand them back .
" I come from a really close family and I 'm the only one out of all of us who does n't want children , but it 's just a personal choice , " says Charlie .
" My partner Eoghan feels the same , though I did n't know that until long after we 'd met .
We were together three years before I thought I had better broach the subject with him just in case he did want them .
" But he is very career - focused as well , and would rather concentrate on that as well as having the option to travel in later years without being tied down . "
So the choice to have children is just that -- a choice .
Yet for many childless women there is still the need to defend the decision not to have kids .
In Japan , for instance , childless couples are labelled ' parasites ' and accused of being unpatriotic .
In Germany and Russia , there have been discussions about introducing certain ' disadvantages ' for couples without children , and in Slovakia there has even been reference to the introduction of a ' childless tax ' .
And yet if you go to the other extreme and have a big family , you can also be considered selfish and in some cases sponging off society .
So apparently , unless you have 2.4 children , a husband who works in the bank and live in a solar - heated semi-D in the leafy suburbs with a hybrid Skoda parked in the driveway , you simply can't win .
And the final word goes to Cameron Diaz .
When asked if she wanted children , the actress replied : " I never say never .
I do n't know what 's going to happen .
I could end up adopting half a dozen kids , or I could end up being the next ' octomum ' -- who fricking knows ! "
Dear Mr. President ,
Wednesday evening we heard you address the nation on health care and the economy .
I was hoping to hear some tough answers to tough questions .
Instead we were treated to one hour of tap dancing on eggshells where it seemed your primary intent was not to break any eggs .
You spoke of the need for sacrifices but failed to mention any .
You said Medicare benefits would not be reduced and everyone would be covered .
Mr. President where are the sacrifices ?
By who ?
The press seemed concerned with a fear of rationed health care .
Some republicans have raised the issue as well .
Mr. President I am concerned there will be no rationing of health care .
It is axiomatic that there is unlimited demand for free services .
Here are some tougher questions I am sure everyone would like to know .
Will the plan cover a transplant procedure with a $ 50,000 cost for someone who is 80 years old with a life expectancy of two years ?
One year ?
Who decides ?
Or is everything free for everyone regardless of the odds of success ?
Will the plan cover fertility treatments ?
Abortion ?
Will the plan address issues that arose in the Terri Schiavo case ?
To what extent must doctors provide generics instead of prescription drugs ?

Robert Laszewski , a former insurance company executive who 's now a consultant to industry , contended doctors were " paid off " to support the House bill .

" The fact that the CBO has said the doc fix would add hundreds of billions of dollars to the cost of the bill makes clear how much it is worth to the docs . "

As you 'll see , we leaned on the conservative side here by only counting money that 's directly related to military activities .
We did n't , for instance , add in money for the Department of Veterans Affairs ( $ 55.9 billion ) , which would take the total to $ 836.3 billion ; or the rest of the Department of Homeland Security ( $ 54.5 billion ) , which would take it to $ 890.8 .
( The wider national security apparatus is n't included either — budgets for the intelligence services are classified . )
If we did include these extras , here ’s what the difference between the official budget and the real one would look like :

The yellow patch on the nose is a distinctive feature
A striking new species of lungless salamander has been found living in a small stream in the Appalachian foothills of the US .
The salamander is so distinct that it 's been classified within its own genus , a taxonomic grouping that usually includes a host of related species .
The creature breathes through its skin , and unusually for its kind , males and females have different colouration .
Such a distinct amphibian has not been found in the US for half a century .
The researchers who discovered the salamander describe it in the Journal of Zoology .
They have dubbed it the ' patch - nosed ' salamander after the yellow patch on the animal 's snout .
The tiny animal averages just 25 to 26 mm long .
They found so few of the animals that either it is highly secretive , or more likely it survives in such small , isolated numbers that it is already at risk of extinction .
The salamander fauna of the US has been intensively studied for well over a century , so the discovery of such a distinct form was completely unsuspected
Biologist Carlos Camp
" This animal is really a spectacular find , " says biologist Carlos Camp of Piedmont College in Demorest , Georgia , who led the team which described the new species .
" It is the first genus of amphibian , indeed of any four - footed vertebrate , discovered in the US in nearly 50 years . "
Around the world , there are approximately 500 species of salamander .
Two - thirds of these species are lungless , breathing entirely through their porous , moist skin .
The Appalachian Highlands of the southeastern US is a hot spot for lungless salamander diversity , with species occupying a variety of moist or wet environments including living in streams , underground , among the leaf litter of the forest floor , up cliffs and in trees .
" The salamander fauna of the US , particularly of the southern Appalachians , has been intensively studied for well over a century , so the discovery of such a distinct form was completely unsuspected , " says Carlos .
Striking differences
Two graduate students , Bill Peterman of the University of Missouri , Columbia and Joe Milanovich of the University of Georgia , Athens discovered the first example of the species , scientifically named Urspelerpes brucei .
They took the animal to Camp for identification .
" When we realised that it was something novel , we contacted a geneticist , Trip Lamb , of East Carolina University , Greenville and a bone specialist , David Wake of the University of California at Berkeley .
John Maerz , a professor at the University of Georgia , completed the research team , " says Carlos .
The team 's investigations revealed just how novel the salamander is .
A yellow male with stripes above a more muted female
" The genetic data revealed that this was far more unusual than any of us suspected , which is why we described it in its own genus , " says Camp .
But the amphibian also looks strikingly different to other species .
For a start , it has the smallest body size of any salamander in the US .
It is also the only lungless salamander in the US whose males have a different colour and pattern than females , a trait more characteristic of birds .
Males have a pair of distinct dark stripes running down the sides of the body and a yellow back .
Females lack stripes and are more muted in colour .
Males also have 15 vertebrae , one less than females .
Yet while most species of lungless salamander have male and females of differing sizes , those of Urspelerpes brucei are close to being equal in size .
Uniquely for such a small lungless salamander , Urspelerpes brucei has five toes , whereas most other small species have reduced that number to four .
The behaviour and lifestyle of the salamander remain a mystery .
The animal 's jaw and teeth structure suggest that it eats small , terrestrial prey such as insects caught using a projectile tongue as some other species of lungless salamander do .
So far , Camp 's team have recovered just eight adults , all from within or alongside a single stream .
Four were collected hiding under rocks and four in loose leaf litter .
Three were females , each carrying eggs .
The last new genus of amphibian living in the US to be described , in 1961 , was also a lungless salamander , the Red Hills Salamander of southern Alabama .

" Love the work and so excited to see where the current story - line is going , but the death of Fidgital made me wonder .
With the destruction of the robot factory way back when , are there now an absolutely finite set of intelligent robots ?
Does that mean every time one dies , there 's just one less in the world , until there 'll eventually be none left ?
That 's both kinda cool and kinda dark ... "
- Alexander
That is exactly the case !
With Unit 01 and the factory destroyed , and the tar from the personality - generating - core lost for good , no more AI robots are being produced .
You can actually see Fidgital and Pintsize opine about it in this comic .
If the implications of this reality on the future of robotkind are something you 'd like to see explored in future comics then I have good news for you .

" Have you ever given any thought to the “ voices ” that your characters have ?
Like what their voice would sound like in a cartoon , or something . "

This is not actually something I have thought much about , although you are not the first person to ask !
I do n't really have any strong feelings about how the characters should sound .
I think that would make it very interesting to cast an animated version !
It feels very wide open to me .
Fuzzy in particular feels like a character who could be taken in a lot of different directions .
That 's all for this week , team .

From the time of 1765 forward , the American people , in fits and starts , began moving closer and closer to breaking ties with Britain and declaring independence .
They grew increasingly angry at being dragged into [ or paying for ] the wars of the Crown .
The King had largely held a hands - off approach with the colonies , who largely learned the self - governance necessary to carve a new nation out of wilderness .
As the colonies became more prosperous , though , the King saw potential .
He saw the potential to tax them as Englishmen but without giving them the full rights and representation of those in the home country .
He tried to impose English hands - on governance upon a people who had learned to exist without such meddling .
And this meddling was NOT appreciated .
We focus , and rightly so , a lot of energy and time on the Declaration of Independence and July 4 , 1776 .
It is the watershed moment in our rise from loosely - joined colonies into a nation .
But there ’s more to the story .
For those who view today ’s America as the culmination of the vision of the founders , it is right to view Independence Day as a day of remembrance of things past .
For those of us who consider our current government ( being the establishment since the New Deal and only accelerated by GWB and BHO ) to be antithetical to the ideals that founded this nation and still rest latent within its people , it ’s instructive to look at this from a far wider perspective .
July 4 , 1776 , and the Declaration of Independence , was one of the most important steps in the American Revolution .
But it was only a step , and that step was squarely in the middle of the game , not the beginning .
In fact , it occurred over a year after armed hostilities erupted at Lexington and Concord , and the Battle of Bunker Hill took place the prior month .
In terms of our nation , the Declaration of Independence is important because it marks the point at which our hostilities against the British became a struggle for independence , rather than a struggle for reparation .
But in terms of the history of the struggle , the stage was truly set over the course of the prior decade .
There is not enough space to delve deeply into the history here .
For reference , I heartily recommend A Leap In The Dark by John Ferling , and The Ideological Origins of The American Revolution by Bernard Bailyn .
To summarize , one of the watershed moments of the lead - up was the Stamp Act of 1765 .
This was a tax on most paper products in use at the time , and it was a very visible and direct tax .
It hit many colonists close to home , and was a new tax to these shores .
The tax ignited protests a decade in advance of actual hostilities .
For many , these protests were some of their first concrete actions in opposition to policies of their government .
But it was just a tax .
Americans at the time considered it a piece of bad policy foisted upon them by the King , and when the King rescinded the tax , things simmered down .
There had not yet developed an adversarial relationship between the colonists and the Crown .
Over the next decade , though , a King who wanted to claim control over the colonies engaged in consistent escalation of his taxation and attempts to rein in what he considered improper actions of “ his subjects ” .
Throughout this decade , independence was never a foregone conclusion .
Many in the colonies were not opposed to British rule , they simply wanted a hand in direction of that rule .
Most people in the colonies viewed themselves as Englishmen first , citizens of their colony second , and Americans third .
There was a very strong emotional connection to the Crown and to the people — many of them family — of the home country .
The path to Independence was a jerking motion as the Crown bullied the populace , the populace resented the Crown , and all through that time voices towards independence helped frame the debate .
Samuel Adams was one of those key voices early on .
In 1765 , he was already advocating against Britain and — although difficult to speak out publicly for Independence — it is clear that he saw an American rift with Britain coming in the future .
During the ensuing decade , Samuel Adams was a key instigator and key voice in framing the debate for Independence .
He was instrumental during the “ quiet period ” of 1770 - 73 , when the British somewhat reduced their acts of encroachment on the colonies .
During this time , as anti-British sentiment waned , Samuel Adams was the key voice keeping the narrative of colonies vs. Crown in the minds of the people .
It was never ONLY what the Crown did that led to independence ; it was the voices of the rabble - rousers who saw the end game of subjugation to the crown who brought it to bear .
How did they bring it to bear ?
They changed the perception of the people .
Prior to the Stamp Act , most colonists thought of themselves as Englishmen and saw the Crown as their legitimate government .
Over that decade leading to July 4 , 1776 , that perception changed .
The colonists increasingly saw the Crown as an arbitrary government willing to completely abrogate their rights in order to achieve its own ends .
It saw the Crown treating the colonists in ways they believed it would never treat a true Englishman .
They , as a people , ceased to give the government their consent .
This was a decade - long ( and possibly extending farther back ) effort .
Few at the days of the first Stamp
Act protests were likely envisioning a war of Independence brewing .
Few are today .
In 2005 , the Supreme Court found in Kelo that Americans could have their homes seized , at will , for nearly anything a local government claimed a “ public use ” , including handing it to developers who will build private - use structures .
This hits every American in their homes .
It makes every American understand that the whim of the government can take their highest - value , most cherished possession and give it to someone they think will make better use of it .
Since 2005 , the United States Government has engaged in domestic wiretapping programs without judicial oversight , proving that the United States Government can listen in on your phone calls at the discretion of any civil - service bureaucrat who deems it necessary .
It has created a terrorist watch - list of over 1,000,000 names , without any clear discussion of who is on that list , why , or how to have your name removed .
If you ’re on that list , you can expect to be hassled endlessly if you choose to engage in mundane civil activities such as air travel .
During that time , it was learned that the United States Government has been engaged in “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” that — whether they ’re technically defined torture or not — curl your hair to think about .
Waterboarding is one that likely does n’t sound as bad as it feels , but I defy anyone to support a government who engages in crucifixion .
In late 2008 , in the midst of a financial crisis unlike any we ’ve seen since the Depression , the United States Government decided that it could take $ 700B and simply hand it out to banks — more accurately , force banks to take it — and do n’t have any real duty to the public regarding oversight of those funds .
In the same time , the Federal Reserve and United States Treasury have either used or promised guarantees to over $ 14T in assets — larger than the GDP of the nation .
Since the election of Barack Obama , the United States Government passed a $ 787B stimulus bill not supported by a majority of Americans .
The United States Government has de facto nationalized and illegally bankrupted two domestic automakers , rewriting the rules of bankruptcy in order to give out sweetheart deals to unions and the government .
Most recently , the House Of Representatives has passed an enormous 1200 - page Cap and Trade proposal ( hidden tax ) that included a 300 - page amendment added only hours before the final vote .
To believe that our “ representatives ” actually read this bill or its amendment is laughable .
It is likely that over the next several months , the United States Government will pass a bill speeding us down the road to the nationalization of the healthcare industry , and to pay for it , enact a VAT to give them yet another revenue stream to extract the fruits of our labor .
Throughout all this time , the United States Government pays lip service to the Constitution , but routinely acts contrary to both its letter and its spirit at every turn .
It is therefore defying even its own supreme blueprint .
If the United States Government is willing to act against the will of Americans , and if our “ representatives ” are willing to pass bills that they cannot and have not read — bills often giving law - making ability to unelected bureaucracies like the EPA , how can we really believe that we are a representative democracy ?
If the United States Government engages in barbaric acts such as crucifixion , how can we support it ?
If we have truly reached , as I believe , a point where our government views us not as citizens but as subjects , we must denounce the United States Government as illegitimate .
On this anniversary of the date of American Independence , it is right to celebrate .
It is right to remember the valiant and principled action of the Founding Fathers to take on the world ’s great superpower and assert their rights — many lost their lives in the effort .
We have a nation worth celebrating .
But in remembrance of those who we are celebrating , it is important to understand their significance in a historic context ( again , see the books recommended above ) .
It is important to remember that the principles they are fighting for are again in peril .
And it important to realize that in order for those principles to be recovered , we must tirelessly call the United States Government for what it is — illegitimate .
The time between the Stamp Act and the Treaty of Paris was 18 years .
Between the Stamp Act and the Declaration of Independence , it was only the efforts of those who were willing to call the actions of their government deplorable that ensured that the yoke of that government would be lifted .
It is now time for those of us who love our country and despise the United States Government to stand up and do the same .
The American people are an industrious people , and often have little time to devote to paying attention to the actions of our government .
They have a media more focused on the daily lives of TV celebrities than the outcome of legislation that will affect everyone ’s daily life .
They have been educated quite literally by the state to see the United States Government as a trusted friend and helpful assistant .
This must change , and it is the work of those of us who believe in liberty to keep the fires stoked and educate them to the truth .
This is not going to be a small job , and wo n’t happen quickly .
But if we do not continually work towards this goal , we are resigning ourselves to a future led by a government by the power brokers , of the power brokers , and for the power brokers .
Today is a remembrance of America ’s Independence Day .
It is also a day to remember that committed citizens , in the cause of freedom , can break the chains of the greatest superpower seen on earth and claim their rightful liberty .
It is a day to remember and celebrate those who did it before , but it ’s also a day to steel yourself — there ’s work to be done again .

UPDATE 2 : Welcome Carolina Sons Of Liberty readers !
Nokia is the worldwide king of cellphones .
But do n't tell that to U.S. customers .
Nokia 's market share in the United States is on the decline , down to 8 percent last year , from 15 percent two years ago .
" Nokia missed a number of handset trends in the last few years – thin phones , clamshells , touchscreen devices , applications , " says Ross Rubin , an analyst with the NPD Group .
" They have been pretty much out of everything . "
And that 's odd , given Nokia 's global dominance .
Apple 's iPhone may get talked about more and Research In Motion 's BlackBerry devices may be must - have executive jewelry , but four in 10 cellphones sold worldwide last year were made by Nokia .
Nokia sold 97 million phones in the first quarter of the year , nearly twice that of its closest competitor , Samsung .
But American customers are not finding much to love about Nokia .
It is n't that Nokia is uninterested in getting its phones into the hands of more American consumers .
The company has repeatedly said North America is a significant market .
And analysts agree that Nokia cannot afford to stay out of , especially , U.S .
" The danger is not so much that they will miss out on unit sales in the U.S. and get hurt , " says Michael Mace , who has worked at Palm and Apple and now runs his own strategy consulting firm , Rubicon Consulting .
" The danger is if innovations start to happen here first . "
And Nokia is already seeing that .
Apple 's App Store has changed how consumers view their phones and has given Apple a huge presence among independent developers of software for mobile phones .
Americans are also more willing to buy more expensive smartphones that hold the promise of greater profits for the handset makers , while cheaper feature phones dominate the market worldwide , says Mace .
" Nokia has a huge unit share but look at their share of profitability , " he says .
" Those two curves are running in opposite directions for them . "
Nokia declined to comment for this story citing the ' quiet period ' the company has to observe ahead of its earnings report July 17 .
But we polled four analysts and two industry experts to understand why Nokia phones get so little love in the U.S.
Here 's what they told us is troubling Nokia .
A weak brand
When was the last time you saw a Nokia commercial on TV or an ad in the paper ?
While the company 's rivals such as Apple , Palm and Research In Motion have been competing to get more airtime for their products , Nokia has chosen to be more low - key in its approach .
The result has been that the average American consumer does n't really lust for a Nokia phone .
That 's in contrast to how the company 's products are perceived in some of the biggest cellphone markets : India , China and Europe .
Nokia phones there have a cachet that is unimaginable for most U.S. consumers .
" In many countries if you have a Nokia phone it says something good about you , " says Mace .
" It says you are sophisticated , stylish and successful . "
Not so in the U.S. , where the company 's phones rank much lower in terms of their aspirational value .
" Using a Nokia phone here mostly means I am offbeat and not always in a good way , " Mace says .
In case of cellphones , a significant chunk of marketing support also stems from telecom carriers who take on the responsibility of promoting the handsets .
Without major carrier support , Nokia has been at a disadvantage .
Lack of focus on CDMA handsets
Nokia has bet big on the GSM standard for wireless communication , a move that had paid rich dividends in international markets .
But in the U.S. the battle between the two standards rages on , with Verizon and Sprint networks using the CDMA standard , while AT&T and T - Mobile use GSM .
" Nokia just does n't make good CDMA phones , so that right away cuts their addressable market in half , " says Dean Bubley , principal analyst with research firm Disruptive Analysis .
Glance through the Verizon website for phones offered in San Francisco and you can see just four Nokia phones available compared to 17 different models of Samsung and eight models of the BlackBerry .
Nokia has said it is focusing on getting more CDMA phones but some of the company 's latest devices , such as the Nokia E71 , phone remain stubbornly GSM - only .
Poor execution
Two months ago Nokia launched a revamped app store called Ovi that featured games , applications , podcasts and videos .
But the store got off to a rocky start , as users faced problems accessing it and downloading the programs .
Nokia blamed the " extraordinarily high spikes of traffic " for the performance issues .
Nokia also botched the introduction of its Nokia 5800 XpressMusic phones .
Nokia offered the 5800 phones for $ 400 as an unlocked and unsubsidized device in the U.S. through the company ’s stores .
But within hours of the launch , buyers reported crippling connectivity problems with the device .
The complaints forced Nokia to pull the U.S. version of the phone off its shelves and try to find a quick fix .
The two incidents have n't helped bolster Nokia 's image as a company whose phones should be on everyone 's must - have list .
Lack of carrier relationships
While Nokia sells some of its phones through telecom carriers , the company has often chosen to sell its handsets unsubsidized and unlocked .
While that may mean more freedom for consumers , it also translates into unusually large price tags .
For instance , the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic was priced at $ 400 for an unlocked phone .
The latest Nokia N97 costs $ 700 , which puts it out of the budget of most buyers .
" It 's a phone that most consumers will never see , " says Michael Gartenberg , technology strategist at analytics firm Interpret .
" It 's also a device that has gotten okay to mediocre reviews and that 's not of interest to consumers in the age of the iPhone and Palm Pre . "
Nokia phone prices are n't out of whack with what similar unsubsidized handsets from other carriers would cost .
But try telling that to the average consumer .
Most customers would rather pay $ 100 - $ 200 for a phone and sign up for a two - year contract .
But without being able to strike those deals with U.S. carriers , Nokia has been forced to offer its phones at full price to consumers .
Carriers view Nokia as a company that puts its own brand ahead of its telecom partners , says Bubley .
" Nokia puts a lot more stock in its own branding and marketing worldwide than other handset makers , " he says .
" In North America their unwillingness to play a secondary role to carriers has hurt them . "
Unusual design
Nokia phones are eye - catching but , unfortunately for the company , its devices do n't fit American standards of beauty .
" Their design values do n't mesh with what customers here want , " says Mace .
Since Motorola introduced the RAZR , Americans like their phones to be anorexic .
Most handset makers were quick to catch on to this trend – except Nokia , which was the last phone company to do a really thin phone .
" Nokia does n't like to do flip phones because European customers do n't want it , " says Rubin .
" And they have n't embraced the touchscreen trend either completely . "
Symbian
For years , Nokia was the biggest supporter of the Symbian operating system .
Last year the company put its money where its mouth is , and bought out its partners , making itself into Symbian sole owner .
Nokia eventually turned Symbian into a non-profit foundation .
But Symbian is now seen by industry experts as a bloated OS that offers little flexibility and is just not ready the social networking generation .
" Nokia does beautiful , detail - oriented hardware but they do n't nearly have the same design skills around software , " says Mace .
" Their software is too buggy , too hard to use and too awkward . "
An insignificant app store
Since Apple launched its app store on the iPhone 3G a year ago , customers have downloaded more than a billion apps .
The idea has been replicated by competitors ranging from Palm , RIM and Android .
A vibrant app store is a major selling point for many smartphone users , says Gartenberg .
And Nokia just has n't gotten it right there .
It is n't for want of trying .
Nokia relaunched its
Ovi app store in May and said it can accessed by about 50 million Nokia device owners worldwid .
The Ovi store had about 20,000 titles at launch , including both free and paid apps .
But here 's the catch for U.S. users : Alhough U.S. consumers can access and purchase content from the Ovi store those purchases will require a separate credit card transaction .
AT&T has said it will offer carrier billing so purchases from the store become a part of the monthly service bills later this year .
But there 's still no confirmation on when that will be available .
Meanwhile , compare the 20,000 or so apps in the Ovi store to the 55,000 or more apps on Apple 's apps store .

German ministers have today agreed to ban the production and distribution of all violent video games , with the law only having to go through parliament in the next few weeks .
According to german website Chip Online and supported by Spiegel Online
The country has been infamously hard on violent video games before now , but an outright ban would result in a huge loss for the video games industry in one of its most successful European countries .
The law would result in no Call of Duty , no God of War , no Crysis , no World of Warcraft , no BioShock , no Uncharted , and no Grand Theft Auto .
Moreover , since a ban on the production of violent games would also be included in the law , German studios , such as Crytek , would have to outsource development to other countries .
The law is hoped to come into effect before the country ’s federal elections in September .
The minister of the interior of Lower Saxony commented :
“ Violent games lower the inhibition level for real violence and spree killers have again and again played such before they did the crime . ”
Note the second part of that sentence : “ spree killers have again and again played such before they did the crime . ”
That ’s quite a statement ; one we expect they ’d like to support with the
German school shootings on March 11th , which were linked to Counterstrike and Far Cry 2 .
For the law to become a reality it must go through parliament in the next few weeks or months .
We ’ll keep you posted and hope the ministers are just blowing smoke .
[ UPDATE ] –
It has been pointed out that our translation of the minister of Lower Saxony ’s comment is not entirely accurate , where “ spree killers always played such games before they did the crime ” should be changed to either “ spree killers have again and again played such games . ”
We apologise for the mis-translation .
An editorial in this months 2009 AARP Bulletin repeats the same bromide heard almost nightly on the MSM news :
That there are currently 47 million Americans without health insurance .
The AARP editorial goes on to argue that this situation is disgraceful , that all Americans should have affordable health care choices ,  and that in terms of reform ,  the time to act is now . 
The sad tale of the 47 million uninsured is , perhaps , the most emotionally persuasive argument put forth for national health care reform .
But is the alleged number of uninsured reasonably accurate ?
Or is it , instead , a purposely misleading statistic designed to advance a specific reform agenda ?
The 47 million uninsured number is generated by an annual U.S. Census Bureau report .
However , that report also states that the 47 million uninsured includes roughly 10 million illegal aliens without health insurance .
Thus , if we subtract out the illegals , the number of uninsured American citizens without health insurance declines by more than 20 percent . . . to roughly 37 million .
But is it accurate to assume that even 37 million Americans cannot afford health insurance ?
Absolutely NOT .
Even Hillary Clinton during her presidential campaign once admitted that 25 % of the uninsured could afford health insurance but chose not to purchase it .
The Census Bureau reports that there are roughly 17 million people who make more than $ 50,000 per year and who , for whatever reason , decide not to carry health insurance .
In short , with two reasonable adjustments , the number of Americans who cannot afford health insurance has been reduced from 47 million to approximately 20 million .
But is the 20 million figure itself reasonably accurate ?
Probably not .
Individuals moving between jobs lose their employer - provided health insurance , and when they do the Census Bureau counts them as uninsured . 
Technically true .
Yet during normal economic times , roughly half of these individuals will re-acquire health insurance coverage with a new employer in about four months .
Finally , there are millions of adult Americans and children who have nearly free access to medical care benefits through Medicaid and other government programs who dont really need the direct cost of health insurance and who dont carry any .
Thus , with reasonable adjustments , there are in fact less than 10 million individuals who are so - called chronically uninsured .
( The Kaiser Family Foundation says the number could be as low as 8 million ) .
These are individuals who have been unemployed for over 2 years and / or people from households that are too poor to afford non-employer health insurance premiums and who , for whatever reason , have limited access to taxpayer - supported health services .
So lets grant that there are between 8 to 10 million Americans ( out of a total population of 307 million ) who cannot afford health insurance and that this situation may require a marginal public policy adjustment .
( Most states mandate expensive benefit coverage ; curtailing those mandates would lower the cost of health insurance . )
But whether that situation requires some massive , federal health care reform project with new regulations and mandates on health care providers , insurance companies , and drug manufacturers is entirely problematic .
Politicians and interest groups , eager to remake your medical world over to their liking , would do well to respect the Hippocratic oath administered to physicians :  First , do no harm . 

On the excellent if a little Apple - cheery blog Roughly Drafted , a recent post knocked the hype of the Palm Pre multitasking while illuminating how well the iPhone OS works .
The points made are very valid , and as a former Motorola Q user on Verizon ’s network I can attest to how annoying the EVDO voice / data management is .
But …
In the midst of the post , a small card is palmed , as if Ricky Jay flitted through the room :
Instead , the iPhone only multitasked things that made sense : users could surf the web while taking on the phone , or listen to music while playing games , but third party developers could n’t install their own background processes to sap performance and battery life or introduce unanticipated security issues .
Emphasis mine .

Oh sure , if you are really clever you can stream some stuff to the QuickTime player , if the link is on the web somewhere .
But then you ca n’t use Safari .
Blech .
I really never want to see the QuickTime player if at all possible ; I ’d much rather use a specific app .
The video highlights replay is the one part of the MLB At Bat app that breaks the paradigm of the application .
For the most part I agree with Apple — unrestricted third - party background apps would likely make iPhone users cry in pain .
In the two years I had my Q ( Windows Mobile Smartphone 5.0 ) I installed a dizzying array of apps that did ( or attempted to do ) random background things .
Nearly none of them actually did anything well , because the platform was just so limited .
WM5 was / is an execrable excuse for an operating system .
But it did let me multitask .
More to the point , it let me listen to audio streams in the background while I browsed the web .
It did n’t work all the time , because the amount of memory the Q has is laughable , but it tried .
I appreciated the trying .
So what I really want Apple to do is to open up the iPod App on iPhone for third - party apps to use .
With an API it would offer quite a lot to a third - party application :
Cover
Flow would be a nice paradigm for lots of the above apps ( next / prev station or podcast for example ) .
Pause / Play / Forward / Back controls , plus a screen image ( album artwork ) and some title text when the home key is double - clicked while the iPhone is locked .
The iPod App would provide a nice way to deal with a backgrounded media app ; users are already use to it .
Using the iPod App corrals the multitasking problem ; one app at a time is all the current interface would allow .
By adding an accessible API to the iPod App , Apple could enable third - party apps to naturally multitask without the pie fight that Windows Mobile deals with .
Most of the multitasking examples people give are better done with Push , really ; though sometimes I wish for Push to let me at a mini-app to respond to the push notification without exiting my current app .
But for background streaming of media , Apple falls short .
By de-scoping the problem , and only allowing for a single multitasked media app , Apple would fit true multitasking neatly in the iPhone user interface .
And I would stop missing my Motorola Q , even a little bit .
It is a bit depressing that nearly ever day while using my iPhone , It makes me miss my first generation Q .

On Op - Ed News , I had the pleasure of reading an Op - Ed titled " Is Texas Harboring Torture Decider ? "
The article was written by Ray McGovern , who as an author , has the background and insight to raise valid points that his career as an " Army infantry / intelligence officer and then a CIA analyst for 27 years " would tend to significantly raise the credibility of the author .
This is the beginning of his article , which I regard as a " must read " expose ' of President Bush and his cabal of treasonous participants .
( The title of this Op - Ed does not include the many names of public officials that should also be prosecuted and incarcerated , however , if we were to engage in a REAL effort to seek out the truth by appointing a Special Prosecutor - the evidence gleaned in such an investigation would incriminate a host of public and some private individuals that have been complicit in the illegal wiretapping of the American public , helped to start one - possibly two illegal wars , spat on international and domestic law in regard the Geneva Convention and our own rule of law in regard torture , and aided Corporate America through their banking schemes to aid in the bankruptcy and rape of the American economy .
There are enough potential defendants if a real investigation of what this nation has suffered through during the past eight years that it would take an entire prison to house those who have been complicit or aided and abetted those that effectively brought our economy to its knees .
Is Texas Harboring Torture Decider ? by Ray McGovern www.opednews.com

Seldom does a crime scene have so clear a smoking gun .
A two - page presidential memorandum of Feb. 7 , 2002 , leaves no room for uncertainty regarding the " decider " on torture .
His broad - stroke signature made torture official policy .
This should come as no surprise .
You see , the Feb. 7 , 2002 , memorandum has been posted on the Web since June 22 , 2004 , when then - White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales mistakenly released it , along with other White House memoranda .
The title seemed innocent enough " Humane Treatment of al Qaeda and Taliban Detainees " but in the body of the memo President George W. Bush authorized his senior aides to withhold Geneva Convention protections from suspected al - Qaeda and Taliban detainees .
Like Shakespeare , the media seem harshest on the lawyers , including Texans Gonzales and William J. Haynes II ( Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld 's lawyer ) , who later outdid themselves trying to make torture legal .
MUCH MORE
Unfortunately , the Bush family of criminals works like the well - oiled structure of some of our most infamous organized crime families .
Some or all of this would have never happened if the fascists that were outed by Smedley Butler in 1934 had been prosecuted instead of being allowed to go free as they plotted to take over our government in a failed coup attempt ; instead , Washington politics at that time released traitors that had attempted to overthrow our government to fine - tune their goal (s ) of overthrowing our Democratic Republic and turning towards fascism as a way of life for the American people .
Prescott Bush , who was a Senator representing Connecticut from 1952 until January 1963 .
( His ill - begotten fortunes were used to help him succeed and then gave him an undeserved sense of legitimacy . )
He was the father of the 41st President of the United States George H. W. Bush and the grandfather of 43rd President George W. Bush .
Prescott Bush made his fortunes aiding and abetting the Nazi's in prewar Germany , and even when Adolph Hitler became powerful and began invading other countries - Prescott Bush still engaged in activities that by all standards should be properly labeled as treason - and perhaps worst of all , aiding and abetting the deaths of untold thousands of Jews and other minorities who died while being enslaved to work in factories that Prescott Bush directly profited from ...
I found an article that exposes Prescott Bush 's role in profiting off of Nazi Germany and the excerpt that follows below is the last few paragraphs of an expose ' that leaves little doubt as to how the Bush 's became an American " Dynasty " that to this day , appears to believe that fascism should prevail in the U.S. - and GWB 's successful attempts at undermining the Constitution and the Rule of Law :
Heir to the Holocaust Prescott Bush , $ 1.5 million , and Auschwitz : how the Bush family wealth is linked to the holocaust by Toby Rogers , Clamor Magazine ( Which shut - down in 2006 . )
While the Enron scandal currently unfolds , another Bush family business scandal lurks beneath the shadows of history that may dwarf it .
It has been 60 years since one of the great money laundering scandals of the 20th century ended and only now are we beginning to see the true historical aspects of this important period of world history , a history that the remaining Holocaust survivors beg humanity to " never forget . "
Loftus believes history will view Prescott Bush as harshly as Thyssen .
" It is bad enough that the Bush family helped raise the money for Thyssen to give Hitler his start in the 1920s , but giving aid and comfort to the enemy in time of war is treason .
The Bush bank helped the Thyssens make the Nazi steel that killed Allied solders .
As bad as financing the Nazi war machine may seem , aiding and abetting the Holocaust was worse .
Thyssen 's coal mines used Jewish slaves as if they were disposable chemicals .
There are six million skeletons in the Thyssen family closet , and a myriad of criminal and historical questions to be answered about the Bush family 's complicity . "

OPP warn public of outdoor Marihuana Grow Ops danger
OPP News Release *********************
ORILLIA – The Ontario Provincial Police Drug Enforcement Section ( DES ) is alerting the public to the increasing dangers associated with outdoor marihuana grow operations .
OPP News Release
*********************
ORILLIA – The Ontario Provincial Police Drug Enforcement Section ( DES ) is alerting the public to the increasing dangers associated with outdoor marihuana grow operations .
During the summer months each year , persons involved in growing marihuana head into rural areas to grow and care for , in some cases , very large plots of marihuana plants .
Typically , these illicit crops are located in areas such as :
• Swamps
• Corn fields
• Wooded areas
• Along rivers , and
• Rural rental properties with large acreage .
Marihuana plants are bright green in colour and grow to between three and five feet in height .
Marihuana leaves have seven jagged fingers and the plants give off an odour similar to that of a skunk .
Common indicators of outdoor marihuana grows include :
1. Abandoned vehicles parked on side roads or trails .
2. People observed walking in remote areas for no apparent reason .
3 . Bags of fertilizer , planting trays or chemicals located in remote areas .
4 . Well - trampled trails in wooded or swamp areas .
5 . Cleared out areas in swamps , wooded area or corn fields .
6 . Numerous signs appear out of nowhere indicating “ No Trespassing . ”
Typically , marihuana crops will be harvested starting as early as late August up until the beginning of October .
During this time , there are numerous safety risks of which the public should be wary .
“ These risks include the potential presence of criminals , weapons and ammunition found on grow - op sites , and the potential for booby traps , rigged by the criminals growing these plants in an attempt to defend their illegal crops from other criminals known as ‘ pot pirates ’ , ” according to Vince Hawkes , Deputy Commissioner – OPP Investigations & Organized Crime Command .
All of these factors could lead to dangerous confrontations for unsuspecting , innocent people – including children – who just happen to be in the area of these illegal crops .
Another risk that the OPP want to highlight is to the environment .
These criminal operations usually involve the unregulated use of many chemicals and other environmentally - damaging products .
If you discover or suspect an outdoor marihuana grow operation :
1 . As soon as possible , call your local police or Crime Stoppers .
2 . Do not touch the marihuana plants due to potential chemical residue on the plants .
3 . If confronted by a marihuana grower , do not confront them .
Leave the area immediately and contact police .
4 . If possible and safe to do so , record any license plate information and notify police .
5 . In some cases , outdoor marihuana grows are guarded or protected by booby - traps .
If you discovered a crop of marijuana plants , do not enter the grow !
For your personal safety , turn around and immediately leave the area the same way you came in and immediately notify police .
The OPP Drug Enforcement Section will once again be out in full force this summer searching for and eradicating marihuana grow operations .
In 2008 , the OPP eradicated 108,161 marihuana plants across the province during an eight - week period .
Anyone with information in relation to marijuana grow operations are asked to contact the OPP at 1-888-310-1122 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS ( 8477 ) .

TPM Reader CM flags a couple of unequivocal statements on health care by Joe Lieberman during his 2006 campaign against Ned Lamont .
They ’re pretty interesting in light of Joe ’s low profile on this issue of late — well , until he announced his opposition to a public option yesterday :
July 6 , 2006 primary debate :
And what I ’m saying to the people of Connecticut , I can do more for you and your families to get something done to make health care affordable , to get universal health insurance , to make America energy independent , to save your jobs and create new ones .
That ’s what the Democratic Party is all about .
Sept. 21 , 2006 , during the general election campaign :
The pattern is inescapable : she takes disagreements personally , and swiftly deals vengeance on enemies , real or perceived .
The crowds begin streaming into the Evansville Auditorium and Convention Centre a couple of hours before the arrival of the “ special guest speaker ” at the Vanderburgh County Right to Life dinner on a soft Indiana spring evening — nearly 2,200 people in the banquet hall , 800 more in an adjacent auditorium watching the proceedings on a live video feed .
The menu is thick slices of roast pork and red velvet cake , washed down with pitchers of iced tea , and when Sarah Palin finally enters , escorted by a phalanx of sheriff ’s deputies and local police , she is mobbed .
The organizers of the dinner , billed as “ the largest pro-life banquet in the world , ” have courted Palin for weeks with care packages of locally made chocolates , doughnuts , barbecue , and pastries , and she has requited by choosing Evansville , a conservative stronghold in southern Indiana , as the site of her first public speech outside Alaska in 2009 .
Like Richard M. Nixon , who chose the coalfield town of Hyden , Kentucky , for his first post - resignation public appearance , Palin has come to a place where she is guaranteed a hero ’s reception .
She is not only a staunch foe of abortion but also the mother of a boy , Trig , who was born with Down syndrome just a few months before John McCain chose Palin as his running mate .
The souvenir program for this evening ’s dinner is full of displays for local politicians and businesses , attesting to their pro-life bona fides .
An ad for Hahn Realty Corporation reads , “ If you need commercial real estate , call Joe Kiefer !
Joe is pro-life and a proud supporter of the Vanderburgh County Right to Life . ”
As Palin makes her way slowly across the crowded ballroom — dressed all in black ; no red Naughty Monkey Double Dare pumps tonight — she is stopped every few inches by adoring fans .
She passes the press pen , where at least eight television cameras and a passel of reporters and photographers are corralled , and spots a reporter for a local community newspaper getting ready to take a happy snap with his pocket camera .
For a split second she stops , pauses , turns her head and shoulders just so , and smiles .
She holds the pose until she ’s sure the man has his shot and then moves on .
A few minutes later , the evening ’s nominal keynote speaker , the Republican Party ’s national chairman , Michael Steele , who has been reduced to a footnote in the proceedings , introduces the special guest speaker as “ the storm that is the honorable governor of the great state of Alaska , Sarah Palin ! ”
Just where that storm may be heading is one of the most intriguing issues in American politics today .
Palin is at once the sexiest and the riskiest brand in the Republican Party .
Her appeal to people in the party ( and in the country ) who share her convictions and resentments is profound .
The fascination is viral , and global .
Bill McAllister , until recently Palin ’s statehouse spokesman , says that he has fielded ( and declined ) interview requests from France , England , Italy , Switzerland , Israel , Germany , Bulgaria , “ and probably other countries I ’ve forgotten about . ”
( Palin , keeping her distance from most domestic media as well , also declined to talk to V.F. ) .
Whatever her political future , the emergence of Sarah Palin raises questions that will not soon go away .
What does it say about the nature of modern American politics that a public official who often seems proud of what she does not know is not only accepted but applauded ?
What does her prominence say about the importance of having ( or lacking ) a record of achievement in public life ?
Why did so many skilled veterans of the Republican Party — long regarded as the more adroit team in presidential politics — keep loyally working for her election even after they privately realized she was casual about the truth and totally unfit for the vice - presidency ?
Perhaps most painful , how could John McCain , one of the cagiest survivors in contemporary politics — with a fine appreciation of life ’s injustices and absurdities , a love for the sweep of history , and an overdeveloped sense of his own integrity and honor — ever have picked a person whose utter shortage of qualification for her proposed job all but disqualified him for his ?
In the aftermath of the November election , the conventional wisdom among Palin ’s supporters in the Republican establishment was that she should go home , keep her head down , show that she could govern effectively , and quietly educate herself about foreign and domestic policy with the help of a cadre of experienced advisers .
She has done none of this .
Rather , she has pursued an erratic course that , for her , may actually represent the closest thing there is to True North .
Her first trip to Washington since the election was to attend the dinner of the Alfalfa Club , an elite group of politicians and businesspeople whose sole function is an annual evening in honor of a plant that would “ do anything for a drink . ”
Some of her handlers first said she had accepted — though she then went on to decline — an invitation to speak at the annual June fund - raiser for the congressional Republicans .
She created a political - action committee — Sarahpac — with the help of John Coale , a prominent Democratic trial lawyer .
But just months into its existence the pac ’s chief fund - raiser , Becki Donatelli , a veteran of Republican campaigns , suddenly quit .
One person familiar with the situation told me that Donatelli could not stand dealing with Palin ’s political spokeswoman in Alaska , Meghan Stapleton , who has drawn withering fire from Palin friends and critics alike for being an ineffective adviser .
Also with Coale ’s help , Palin formed the grandiosely named Alaska Fund Trust , to defray a reported half million dollars in legal expenses arising from a slew of formal ethics complaints against her in her home state — prompting yet another formal complaint , that the fund itself constitutes an ethical breach .
Onetime supporters have become harsh critics .
Walter Hickel , 89 , a former two - term governor and interior secretary , and the grand old man of Alaska politics , who was co-chair of Palin ’s winning gubernatorial campaign , in 2006 , now washes his hands of her .
He told me simply , “ I do n’t give a damn what she does . ”
A remarkable phenomenon in probability theory is that of universality – that many seemingly unrelated probability distributions , which ostensibly involve large numbers of unknown parameters , can end up converging to a universal law that may only depend on a small handful of parameters .
One of the most famous examples of the universality phenomenon is the central limit theorem ; another rich source of examples comes from random matrix theory , which is one of the areas of my own research .
Analogous universality phenomena also show up in empirical distributions – the distributions of a statistic from a large population of “ real - world ” objects .
Examples include Benford ’s law , Zipf ’s law , and the Pareto distribution ( of which the Pareto principle or 80 - 20 law is a special case ) .
These laws govern the asymptotic distribution of many statistics which
( i ) take values as positive numbers ;
( ii ) range over many different orders of magnitude ;
( iiii ) arise from a complicated combination of largely independent factors ( with different samples of arising from different independent factors ) ; and
arising from different independent factors ) ; and ( iv ) have not been artificially rounded , truncated , or otherwise constrained in size .
Examples here include the population of countries or cities , the frequency of occurrence of words in a language , the mass of astronomical objects , or the net worth of individuals or corporations .
The laws are then as follows :
Benford ’s law : For , the proportion of whose first digit is is approximately .
Thus , for instance , should have a first digit of about of the time , but a first digit of only about of the time .
For , the proportion of whose first digit is is approximately .
Thus , for instance , should have a first digit of about of the time , but a first digit of only about of the time .
Zipf ’s law :
The largest value of should obey an approximate power law , i.e. it should be approximately for the first few and some parameters .
In many cases , is close to .
The largest value of should obey an approximate power law , i.e. it should be approximately for the first few and some parameters .
In many cases , is close to .
Pareto distribution :
The proportion of with at least digits ( before the decimal point ) , where is above the median number of digits , should obey an approximate exponential law , i.e. be approximately of the form for some .
Again , in many cases is close to .
Benford ’s law and Pareto distribution are stated here for base , which is what we are most familiar with , but the laws hold for any base ( after replacing all the occurrences of in the above laws with the new base , of course ) .
The laws tend to break down if the hypotheses ( i ) - ( iv ) are dropped .
For instance , if the statistic concentrates around its mean ( as opposed to being spread over many orders of magnitude ) , then the normal distribution tends to be a much better model ( as indicated by such results as the central limit theorem ) .
If instead the various samples of the statistics are highly correlated with each other , then other laws can arise ( for instance , the eigenvalues of a random matrix , as well as many empirically observed matrices , are correlated to each other , with the behaviour of the largest eigenvalues being governed by laws such as the Tracy - Widom law rather than Zipf ’s law , and the bulk distribution being governed by laws such as the semicircular law rather than the normal or Pareto distributions ) .
To illustrate these laws , let us take as a data set the populations of 235 countries and regions of the world in 2007 ( using the CIA world factbook ) ; I have put the raw data here .
This is a relatively small sample ( cf. my previous post ) , but is already enough to discern these laws in action .
For instance , here is how the data set tracks with Benford ’s law ( rounded to three significant figures ) :
Countries Number Benford prediction 1 Angola , Anguilla , Aruba , Bangladesh , Belgium , Botswana , Brazil , Burkina Faso , Cambodia , Cameroon , Chad , Chile , China , Christmas Island , Cook Islands , Cuba , Czech Republic , Ecuador , Estonia , Gabon , ( The ) Gambia , Greece , Guam , Guatemala , Guinea - Bissau , India , Japan , Kazakhstan , Kiribati , Malawi , Mali , Mauritius , Mexico , ( Federated States of ) Micronesia , Nauru , Netherlands , Niger , Nigeria , Niue , Pakistan , Portugal , Russia , Rwanda , Saint Lucia , Saint Vincent and the Grenadines , Senegal , Serbia , Swaziland , Syria , Timor - Leste ( East - Timor ) , Tokelau , Tonga , Trinidad and Tobago , Tunisia , Tuvalu , ( U.S. ) Virgin Islands , Wallis and Futuna , Zambia , Zimbabwe 59 ( ) 71 ( ) 2 Armenia , Australia , Barbados , British Virgin Islands , Cote d’Ivoire , French Polynesia , Ghana , Gibraltar , Indonesia , Iraq , Jamaica , ( North ) Korea , Kosovo , Kuwait , Latvia , Lesotho , Macedonia , Madagascar , Malaysia , Mayotte , Mongolia , Mozambique , Namibia , Nepal , Netherlands Antilles , New Caledonia Norfolk Island , Palau , Peru , Romania , Saint Martin , Samoa , San Marino , Sao Tome and Principe , Saudi Arabia , Slovenia , Sri Lanka , Svalbard , Taiwan , Turks and Caicos Islands , Uzbekistan , Vanuatu , Venezuela , Yemen 44 ( ) 41 ( ) 3 Afghanistan , Albania , Algeria , ( The ) Bahamas , Belize , Brunei , Canada , ( Rep. of the ) Congo , Falkland Islands ( Islas Malvinas ) , Iceland , Kenya , Lebanon , Liberia , Liechtenstein , Lithuania , Maldives , Mauritania , Monaco , Morocco , Oman , ( Occupied ) Palestinian Territory , Panama , Poland , Puerto Rico , Saint Kitts and Nevis , Uganda , United States of America , Uruguay , Western Sahara 29 ( ) 29 ( ) 4 Argentina , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Burma ( Myanmar ) , Cape Verde , Cayman Islands , Central African Republic , Colombia , Costa Rica , Croatia , Faroe Islands , Georgia , Ireland , ( South ) Korea , Luxembourg , Malta , Moldova , New Zealand , Norway , Pitcairn Islands , Singapore , South Africa , Spain , Sudan , Suriname , Tanzania , Ukraine , United Arab Emirates 27 ( ) 22 ( ) 5 ( Macao SAR ) China , Cocos Islands , Denmark , Djibouti , Eritrea , Finland , Greenland , Italy , Kyrgyzstan , Montserrat , Nicaragua , Papua New Guinea , Slovakia , Solomon Islands , Togo , Turkmenistan 16 ( ) 19 ( ) 6 American Samoa , Bermuda , Bhutan , ( Dem.

Here is how the same data tracks Zipf ’s law for the first twenty values of , with the parameters and ( selected by log - linear regression ) , again rounding to three significant figures :
Country Population Zipf prediction Deviation from prediction 1 China 1,330,000,000 1,280,000,000 2 India 1,150,000,000 626,000,000 3 USA 304,000,000 412,000,000 4 Indonesia 238,000,000 307,000,000 5 Brazil 196,000,000 244,000,000 6 Pakistan 173,000,000 202,000,000 7 Bangladesh 154,000,000 172,000,000 8 Nigeria 146,000,000 150,000,000 9 Russia 141,000,000 133,000,000 10 Japan 128,000,000 120,000,000 11 Mexico 110,000,000 108,000,000 12 Philippines 96,100,000 98,900,000 13 Vietnam 86,100,000 91,100,000 14 Ethiopia 82,600,000 84,400,000 15 Germany 82,400,000 78,600,000 16 Egypt 81,700,000 73,500,000 17 Turkey 71,900,000 69,100,000 18 Congo 66,500,000 65,100,000 19 Iran 65,900,000 61,600,000 20 Thailand 65,500,000 58,400,000
As one sees , Zipf ’s law is not particularly precise at the extreme edge of the statistics ( when is very small ) , but becomes reasonably accurate ( given the small sample size , and given that we are fitting twenty data points using only two parameters ) for moderate sizes of .
This data set has too few scales in base to illustrate the Pareto distribution effectively – over half of the country populations are either seven or eight digits in that base .
But if we instead work in base , then country populations range in a decent number of scales ( the majority of countries have population between and ) , and we begin to see the law emerge , where is now the number of digits in binary , the best - fit parameters are and :
Countries with binary digit populations Number Pareto prediction 31 China , India 2 1 30 ” 2 2 29 “ , United States of America 3 5 28 “ , Indonesia , Brazil , Pakistan , Bangladesh , Nigeria , Russia 9 8 27 “ , Japan , Mexico , Philippines , Vietnam , Ethiopia , Germany , Egypt , Turkey 17 15 26 “ , ( Dem. Rep. of the ) Congo , Iran , Thailand , France , United Kingdom , Italy , South Africa , ( South ) Korea , Burma ( Myanmar ) , Ukraine , Colombia , Spain , Argentina , Sudan , Tanzania , Poland , Kenya , Morocco , Algeria 36 27 25 “ , Canada , Afghanistan , Uganda , Nepal , Peru , Iraq , Saudi Arabia , Uzbekistan , Venezuela , Malaysia , ( North ) Korea , Ghana , Yemen , Taiwan , Romania , Mozambique , Sri Lanka , Australia , Cote d’Ivoire , Madagascar , Syria , Cameroon 58 49 24 “ , Netherlands , Chile , Kazakhstan , Burkina Faso , Cambodia , Malawi , Ecuador , Niger , Guatemala , Senegal , Angola , Mali , Zambia , Cuba , Zimbabwe , Greece , Portugal , Belgium , Tunisia , Czech Republic , Rwanda , Serbia , Chad , Hungary , Guinea , Belarus , Somalia , Dominican Republic , Bolivia , Sweden , Haiti , Burundi , Benin 91 88 23 “ , Austria , Azerbaijan , Honduras , Switzerland , Bulgaria , Tajikistan , Israel , El Salvador , ( Hong Kong SAR ) China , Paraguay , Laos , Sierra Leone , Jordan , Libya , Papua New Guinea , Togo , Nicaragua , Eritrea , Denmark , Slovakia , Kyrgyzstan , Finland , Turkmenistan , Norway , Georgia , United Arab Emirates , Singapore , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Central African Republic , Moldova , Costa Rica 123 159
Thus , with each new scale , the number of countries introduced increases by a factor of a little less than , on the average .
This approximate doubling of countries with each new scale begins to falter at about the population ( i.e. at around million ) , for the simple reason that one has begun to run out of countries .
( Note that the median - population country in this set , Singapore , has a population with binary digits . )
These laws are not merely interesting statistical curiosities ; for instance , Benford ’s law is often used to help detect fraudulent statistics ( such as those arising from accounting fraud ) , as many such statistics are invented by choosing digits at random , and will therefore deviate significantly from Benford ’s law .
( This is nicely discussed in Robert Matthews ’ New Scientist article “ The power of one “ ; this article can also be found on the web at a number of other places . )
In a somewhat analogous spirit , Zipf ’s law and the Pareto distribution can be used to mathematically test various models of real - world systems ( e.g. formation of astronomical objects , accumulation of wealth , population growth of countries , etc. ) , without necessarily having to fit all the parameters of that model with the actual data .
Being empirically observed phenomena rather than abstract mathematical facts , Benford ’s law , Zipf ’s law , and the Pareto distribution cannot be “ proved ” the same way a mathematical theorem can be proved .
However , one can still support these laws mathematically in a number of ways , for instance showing how these laws are compatible with each other , and with other plausible hypotheses on the source of the data .
In this post I would like to describe a number of ways ( both technical and non-technical ) in which one can do this ; these arguments do not fully explain these laws ( in particular , the empirical fact that the exponent in Zipf ’s law or the Pareto distribution is often close to is still quite a mysterious phenomenon ) , and do not always have the same universal range of applicability as these laws seem to have , but I hope that they do demonstrate that these laws are not completely arbitrary , and ought to have a satisfactory basis of mathematical support .
— 1 . Scale invariance —
One consistency check that is enjoyed by all of these laws is that of scale invariance – they are invariant under rescalings of the data ( for instance , by changing the units ) .
For example , suppose for sake of argument that the country populations of the world in 2007 obey Benford ’s law , thus for instance about of the countries have population with first digit , have population with first digit , and so forth .
Now , imagine that several decades in the future , say in 2067 , all of the countries in the world double their population , from to a new population .
( This makes the somewhat implausible assumption that growth rates are uniform across all countries ; I will talk about what happens when one omits this hypothesis later . )
To further simplify the experiment , suppose that no countries are created or dissolved during this time period .
What happens to Benford ’s law when passing from to ?
The key observation here , of course , is that the first digit of is linked to the first digit of .
If , for instance , the first digit of is , then the first digit of is either or ; conversely , if the first digit of is or , then the first digit of is .
As a consequence , the proportion of ‘s with first digit is equal to the proportion of ‘s with first digit , plus the proportion of ‘s with first digit .
This is consistent with Benford ’s law holding for both and , since
( or numerically , after rounding ) .
Indeed one can check the other digit ranges also and that conclude that Benford ’s law for is compatible with Benford ’s law for ; to pick a contrasting example , a uniformly distributed model in which each digit from to is the first digit of occurs with probability totally fails to be preserved under doubling .
One can be even more precise .
Observe ( through telescoping series ) that Benford ’s law implies that
for all integers , where the left - hand side denotes the proportion of data for which lies between and for some integer .
Suppose now that we generalise Benford ’s law to the continuous Benford ’s law , which asserts that ( 1 ) is true for all real numbers .
Then it is not hard to show that a statistic obeys the continuous Benford ’s law if and only if its dilate does , and similarly with replaced by any other constant growth factor .
( This is easiest seen by observing that ( 1 ) is equivalent to asserting that the fractional part of is uniformly distributed . )
In fact , the continuous Benford law is the only distribution for the quantities on the left - hand side of ( 1 ) with this scale - invariance property ; this fact is a special case of the general fact that Haar measures are unique ( see e.g. these lecture notes ) .
It is also easy to see that Zipf ’s law and the Pareto distribution also enjoy this sort of scale - invariance property , as long as one generalises the Pareto distribution
from integer to real , just as with Benford ’s law .
Once one does that , one can phrase the Pareto distribution law independently of any base as
for any much larger than the median value of , at which point the scale - invariance is easily seen .
One may object that the above thought - experiment was too idealised , because it assumed uniform growth rates for all the statistics at once .
What happens if there are non-uniform growth rates ?
To keep the computations simple , let us consider the following toy model , where we take the same 2007 population statistics as before , and assume that half of the countries ( the “ high - growth ” countries ) will experience a population doubling by 2067 , while the other half ( the “ zero - growth ” countries ) will keep their population constant , thus the 2067 population statistic is equal to half the time and half the time .
( We will assume that our sample sizes are large enough that the law of large numbers kicks in , and we will therefore ignore issues such as what happens to this “ half the time ” if the number of samples is odd . )
Furthermore , we make the plausible but crucial assumption that the event that a country is a high - growth or a zero - growth country is independent of the first digit of the 2007 population ; thus , for instance , a country whose population begins with is assumed to be just as likely to be high - growth as one whose population begins with .
Now let ’s have a look again at the proportion of countries whose 2067 population begins with either or .
There are exactly two ways in which a country can fall into this category : either it is a zero - growth country whose 2007 population also began with either or , or it was a high - growth country whose population in 2007 began with .
Since all countries have a probability of being high - growth regardless of the first digit of their population , we conclude the identity
which is once again compatible with Benford ’s law for since
More generally , it is not hard to show that if obeys the continuous Benford ’s law ( 1 ) , and one multiplies by some positive multiplier which is independent of the first digit of ( and , a fortiori , is independent of the fractional part of ) , one obtains another quantity which also obeys the continuous Benford ’s law .
( Indeed , we have already seen this to be the case when is a deterministic constant , and the case when is random then follows simply by conditioning to be fixed . )
In particular , we see an absorptive property of Benford ’s law : if obeys Benford ’s law , and is any positive statistic independent of , then the product also obeys Benford ’s law – even if did not obey this law .
Thus , if a statistic is the product of many independent factors , then it only requires a single factor to obey Benford ’s law in order for the whole product to obey the law also .
For instance , the population of a country is the product of its area and its population density .
Assuming that the population density of a country is independent of the size of that country ( which is not a completely reasonable assumption , but let us take it for the sake of argument ) , then we see that Benford ’s law for the population would follow if just one of the area or population density obeyed this law .
It is also clear that Benford ’s law is the only distribution with this absorptive property ( if there was another law with this property , what would happen if one multiplied a statistic with that law with an independent statistic with Benford ’s law ? ) .
Thus we begin to get a glimpse as to why Benford ’s law is universal for quantities which are the product of many separate factors , in a manner that no other law could be .
As an example : for any given number , the uniform distribution from to does not obey Benford ’s law ; for instance , if one picks a random number from to then each digit from to appears as the first digit with an equal probability of each .
However , if is not fixed , but instead obeys Benford ’s law , then a random number selected from to also obeys Benford ’s law ( ignoring for now the distinction between continuous and discrete distributions ) , as it can be viewed as the product of with an independent random number selected from between and .
Actually , one can say something even stronger than the absorption property .
Suppose that the continuous Benford ’s law ( 1 ) for a statistic did not hold exactly , but instead held with some accuracy , thus
for all .
Then it is not hard to see that any dilated statistic , such as , or more generally for any fixed deterministic , also obeys ( 5 ) with exactly the same accuracy .
But now suppose one uses a variable multiplier ; for instance , suppose one uses the model discussed earlier in which is equal to half the time and half the time .
Then the relationship between the distribution of the first digit of and the first digit of is given by formulae such as ( 4 ) .
Now , in the right - hand side of ( 4 ) , each of the two terms and differs from the Benford ’s law predictions of and respectively by at most .
Since the left - hand side of ( 4 ) is the average of these two terms , it also differs from the Benford law prediction by at most .
But the averaging opens up an opportunity for cancelling ; for instance , an overestimate of for could cancel an underestimate of for to produce a spot - on prediction for .
Thus we see that variable multipliers ( or variable growth rates ) not only preserve Benford ’s law , but in fact stabilise it by averaging out the errors .
In fact , if one started with a distribution which did not initially obey Benford ’s law , and then started applying some variable ( and independent ) growth rates to the various samples in the distribution , then under reasonable assumptions one can show that the resulting distribution will converge to Benford ’s law over time .
This helps explain the universality of Benford ’s law for statistics such as populations , for which the independent variable growth law is not so unreasonable ( at least , until the population hits some maximum capacity threshold ) .
Note that the independence property is crucial ; if for instance population growth always slowed down for some inexplicable reason to a crawl whenever the first digit of the population was , then there would be a noticeable deviation from Benford ’s law , particularly in digits and , due to this growth bottleneck .
But this is not a particularly plausible scenario ( being somewhat analogous to Maxwell ’s demon in thermodynamics ) .
The above analysis can also be carried over to some extent to the Pareto distribution and Zipf ’s law ; if a statistic obeys these laws approximately , then after multiplying by an independent variable , the product will obey the same laws with equal or higher accuracy , so long as is small compared to the number of scales that typically ranges over .
( One needs a restriction such as this because the Pareto distribution and Zipf ’s law must break down below the median . )
These laws are also stable under other multiplicative processes , for instance if some fraction of the samples in spontaneously split into two smaller pieces , or conversely if two samples in spontaneously merge into one ; as before , the key is that the occurrence of these events should be independent of the actual size of the objects being split .
If one considers a generalisation of the Pareto or Zipf law in which the exponent is not fixed , but varies with or , then the effect of these sorts of multiplicative changes is to blur and average together the various values of , thus “ flattening ” the curve over time and making the distribution approach Zipf ’s law and / or the Pareto distribution .
This helps explain why eventually becomes constant ; however , I do not have a good explanation as to why is often close to .
— 2 . Compatibility between laws —
Another mathematical line of support for Benford ’s law , Zipf ’s law , and the Pareto distribution are that the laws are highly compatible with each other .
For instance , Zipf ’s law and the Pareto distribution are formally equivalent : if there are samples of , then applying ( 3 ) with equal to the largest value of gives
which implies Zipf ’s law with .
Conversely one can deduce the Pareto distribution from Zipf ’s law .
These deductions are only formal in nature , because the Pareto distribution can only hold exactly for continuous distributions , whereas Zipf ’s law only makes sense for discrete distributions , but one can generate more rigorous variants of these deductions without much difficulty .
In some literature , Zipf ’s law is applied primarily near the extreme edge of the distribution ( e.g. the top of the sample space ) , whereas the Pareto distribution in regions closer to the bulk ( e.g. between the top and and top ) .
But this is mostly a difference of degree rather than of kind , though in some cases ( such as with the example of the 2007 country populations data set ) the exponent for the Pareto distribtion in the bulk can differ slightly from the exponent for Zipf ’s law at the extreme edge .
The relationship between Zipf ’s law or the Pareto distribution and Benford ’s law is more subtle .
For instance Benford ’s law predicts that the proportion of with initial digit should equal the proportion of with initial digit or .
But if one formally uses the Pareto distribution ( 3 ) to compare those between and , and those between and , it seems that the former is larger by a factor of , which upon summing by appears inconsistent with Benford ’s law ( unless is extremely large ) .
A similar inconsistency is revealed if one uses Zipf ’s law instead .
However , the fallacy here is that the Pareto distribution ( or Zipf ’s law ) does not apply on the entire range of , but only on the upper tail region when is significantly higher than the median ; it is a law for the outliers of only .
In contrast , Benford ’s law concerns the behaviour of typical values of ; the behaviour of the top is of negligible significance to Benford ’s law , though it is of prime importance for Zipf ’s law and the Pareto distribution .
Thus the two laws describe different components of the distribution and thus complement each other .
Roughly speaking , Benford ’s law asserts that the bulk distribution of is locally uniform at unit scales , while the Pareto distribution ( or Zipf ’s law ) asserts that the tail distribution of decays exponentially .
Note that Benford ’s law only describes the fine - scale behaviour of the bulk distribution ; the coarse - scale distribution can be a variety of distributions ( e.g. log- gaussian ) .

The first day of the CRTC 's network management hearing featured some interesting discussion from deep packet inspection providers Sandvine and Juniper as well as Canadian consumer groups .
A summary of the day , thanks to University of Ottawa student Frances Munn , is posted below .
There is additional coverage from the National Post liveblog , CBC.ca , and lots of posts on Twitter [ update : CRTC transcript ] .
While the Sandvine comment that an unmanaged network is not a neutral network captured the headline , I thought the more important part of the DPI provider discussion was Juniper 's focus on consumer - controlled prioritization .
This is not currently available in Canada , but the notion that consumers should choose how to prioritize the bandwidth they pay for would address many concerns .
It was the consumer presentation that did the most to link network management to the law and it also highlighted reason for great concern .
I think that the consumer groups rightly focused on who should bear the burden of demonstrating that DPI and other Internet traffic controls are consistent with current Canadian law .
The groups argued that these are prima facie violations of Section 36 of the Telecommunications
Act and that the onus therefore should fall on the carriers to show that there is a serious problem , the solution minimally impairs users ' rights , and is proportional to the harm .
Unfortunately , the questions that followed suggest that the CRTC Commissioners start these hearings having accepted the carriers ' claims that congestion is a problem and that inhibiting the use of deep packet inspection could result in increased consumer costs for Internet access .
This suggests that there is a steep mountain to climb in these hearings , leading me to believe that the issue will ultimately be a political one with pressure on the Conservatives to join with the Liberals and NDP in supporting net neutrality .
CRTC Net Neutrality Hearings , July 6 , 2009
Sandvine Incorporated
Opening remarks : Don Bowman , Chief Technology Officer
Sandvine is a Canadian company that provides technology for internet service providers .
Their primary argument was that congestion on the internet is inevitable and that an unmanaged network is not a neutral network .
Applications that require large amounts of bandwidth can slow down the internet for time - sensitive activities like VoIP and online gaming .
As such , they design technologies prioritizes traffic in times of congestion .
They argued that prioritization can serve several legitimate purposes such as scrubbing malicious traffic from networks and guaranteeing quality for emergency transmissions .
Prioritization is done through a variety of ways and through a variety of technologies .
As such , Sandvine argued that any new regulations for traffic management would quickly become outdated .
For instance , the policies for DSL and Cable would have to differ because DSL is not usually oversubscribed due to upstream use while the opposite is true for Cable .
Part of the problem is the difficulty of predicting networks over time .
Congestion occurs during peak times , but peak times cannot always be predicted due to unforeseen events such as Michael Jackson ’s death .
Sandvine also cautioned against a policy targeted at disproportionate users of bandwidth .
For example , both VoIP and online gaming do not use much bandwidth .
However , a policy that targets all disproportionate users would also hurt those using VoIP or other low bandwidth activities .
Instead , Sandvine advocated a policy that prioritizes time - sensitive applications that are not bandwidth intensive .
Therefore , even in times of congestion , the goal is to maintain their quality .
Sandvine briefly addressed the privacy concerns raised by traffic management .
They argued that the technologies do not raise privacy concerns because they do not read content such as email or video .
They pointed out that privacy issues depend on how the technology is used rather than the technology itself .
Finally , Sandvine argued that there is an understanding that some traffic management is necessary .
However , they argued against the imposition of absolute rules .
Since traffic management practices quickly become outdated , they submitted that each traffic management practice be judged individually at a moment in time .
Sandvine finished by implying that regulations were unnecessary .
They pointed to the small number of complaints and asked whether anything was broken that required a real - world need for new guidelines .
Questions
CRTC Chair von Finckenstein opened the questions by asking Sandvine to clarify what they meant by traffic management , and how their submission conformed to the objectives of the hearing .
In response , Sandvine argued that their submission was based on how to best manage internet traffic to create an equal space for everyone .
They claimed their main purpose is to manage congested internet traffic .
For instance , their technology will delay a live streaming video if there is a call attempting to go through the network .
Von Finckenstein then asked how voice and gaming can always be prioritized .
Sandvine described how VoIP packets are prioritized over other packets .
First , a service provider has to identify the VoIP packets .
All VoIP packets have similar qualities – they are low packet and use relatively little bandwidth .
When given priority , the idea is for the VoIP packets to precede non-voice packets .
Von Finckenstein pointed out that there has been some criticism levelled at congestion remedies and he wanted to know how advanced the technology was .
Sandvine said that the technology is improving over time and that Sandvine products are evolving to measure and detect congestion in a simple fashion .
Von Finckenstein followed up by inquiring into the cost of investing in these technologies .
Sandvine said it depended on the goals of the company .
Sandvine is a commercial business out to make a profit and so it designs its technologies to meet the demands of its customers .
Von Finckenstein asked about a system where users are charged extra for the excessive amount of bandwidth they use .
Sandvine said that this was an area of active research where the person pays for the amount of network usage they use .
However , Sandvine expressed scepticism that monthly usage charging could impact congestion .
An economic model that deviates from the simple flat rate 40 dollar / month model would have to have transparent and visible measures of when charges are and are not incurred .
Sandvine argued that it could become a powerful model in the long run , but that it would require a change in consumer understanding and acceptance .
For the most part , consumers do not have an understanding of the value of a byte , and so shifting to an economic model would require further consumer education .
On the privacy question , Von Finckenstein asked for a simple explanation on why the network requires any information on content to manage traffic .
He said he did not understand why they had to look into it or use it .
In response , Sandvine claimed to have no interest in the user ’s actual content – e.g. " Spiderman " or " a phone call to your niece . "
Sandvine did say that knowing how many people are engaged in an activity allows the operator to provide a better service .
Sandvine claimed it is useful to know the duration of the session , the amount of bandwidth used , and the number of people engaging in the activity .
Von Finckenstein finished his questioning by asking about the difference between wireless and non-wireless technologies .
Sandvine explained that wireless operators suffer from mobility issues .
For instance , wireless networks overloaded after Michael Jackson was taken to the hospital .
As such , Sandvine admitted that additional tools for wireless technology were likely necessary .
Leonard Katz proceeded with the questioning .
He opened by asking whether networks can design their technologies around predictable peaks .
Sandvine replied that long - term peaks are predictable , but stressed that events like Michael Jackson or the Olympics lead to congestion at unpredictable non-peak hours .
Leonard Katz then asked how network providers can turn Sandvine products into profits .
In response , Sandvine claimed that providers strive to maintain quality for all users .
Sandvine products help measure events that lead to diminished capacity so that they can protect users when the internet is congested .
Leonard Katz asked about how much the provider needs to know about his online activities – e.g. when Leonard Katz plays online games .
Sandvine said that measures are made in several ways , but that the technology has not reached a point where it can measure how long a single individual is playing a game and how much technology he is using .
However , Sandvine said that the technology could be heading that in direction .
Theoretically , the user could one day call their network provider and ask how much bandwidth they are using when they do a particular activity .
Katz pointed out that providers advertise their speeds " up to " a certain level when , in reality , the speed level is often below the advertised level .
He wanted to know if it would be possible for providers to advertise a service with a minimum guaranteed speed .
Sandvine replied that this was " absolutely " possible and that some businesses already had this guaranteed service .
Suzanne Lamarre , the Regional Commissioner for Quebec , opened her questioning by asking for a clarification on " malicious traffic " " and from whose perspective they were defining it .
In response , Sandvine claimed that they look at everything from the consumer 's perspective – e.g. spam or unsolicited pornography .
In addition to being unsolicited , he said that the " malicious " traffic can also have an economic or quality cost to an operator by slowing down the system .
Timothy Denton , the National Commissioner , inquired into the Sandvine position that " an unmanaged network is not a neutral network . "
In response , Sandvine claimed that when the internet was first created , users were on equal footing .
Over time , however , users have become self - interested and use more bandwidth than others .
Consequently , an unmanaged internet leads to some users being able to serve their interests at the cost of others .
Juniper Networks
Opening Remarks : Scott Stevens , Vice - President of Technology for Juniper Networks
Juniper focuses on building networks that are fast , reliable and secure .
In their submission , they made a differentiation between two methods of traffic controls called " White Listing " and " Black Listing . "
White Listing : Users that require a certain amount of " enhanced " treatment on a network .
E.g. when it comes to VoIP there is a higher priority given to 911 calls .
Black Listing : Specific users or applications are restricted from using the network .
E.g. malicious users that are blocked from accessing the network .
Juniper explained that there are several traffic management tools that can be used for traffic management :
1. Network Level Processing Controls :
These refer to how actual packets are controlled over the network .
They are " static " in nature and unable to respond to new network requirements .
2. Application Processing Controls ( DPI ) :
They are more dynamic and are used for security , to prevent malware and attacks , etc .
3. Policy Management Processing Controls :
They create communication links between the network and the customer or application and are used primarily for VoIP and video .
These tools give providers the ability to respond to new applications in dynamic ways .
The ability to interact with user experiences gives the network the flexibility to innovate and keep up with the innovation currently occurring in applications today .
In sum , they stressed that the ability to innovate and to interact with users is key to moving forward .
Fifteen years ago , the internet was primarily made up of file transfers and some email .
The types of applications running today are fundamentally different than the ones used fifteen years ago .
Applications like VoIP , gaming , and live streaming change the network and the way it is delivered to the customer .
Consequently , it is important that users are able to interact with the network .
Questions
Von Finckenstein opened by asking how dynamic controls can properly deal with congestion problems .
He wondered if , like Sandvine , Juniper believed the technology was still unable to deal with congestion problems .
Juniper responded that dealing with congestion can be the " weakest link " because you have to determine where it is and how to deal with it .
They stressed that strategies depend on where the congestion occurs .
Candice Molnar , the Regional Commissioner for Manitoba and Saskatchewan , asked about the consumption model as a form of managing traffic .
In response , Juniper said that consumption models are useful in dealing with the five percent of " heavy users " that take up 50 percent of internet traffic .
However , they added that the consumption model does not help in dealing with unexpected world events .
For instance , the internet became congested after Michael Jackson ’s death , but such congestion was not a predictable peak .
The congestion model is only useful when peaks can be predicted .
They also added that most heavy users are not aware that they are heavy users .
Molnar asked about using consumption models to manage all internet traffic on both off peak and peak hours .
Juniper argued that part of the problem in the consumption model is that consumers do not understand when peak and off peak hours occur .
For instance , consumers understand that phone calls are more expensive during the day .
However , consumers do not have such an understanding with regards to IP technology .
Molnar then asked for a clarification of the Black Listing and White Listing methods .
Specifically , she inquired about an " open garden " in White Listing application where a user prioritizes certain activities ( i.e. live streaming of news ) .
Juniper said that the idea is for a user to signal that they want an application prioritized – e.g. gaming or live streaming .
In this way , consumers are able to indicate what applications are most important to them .
Further , Juniper pointed out that while it is impossible to guarantee a certain amount of bandwidth , this system could allow providers to guarantee a certain application as an alternative form of a minimum guarantee .
For instance , if live streaming of news is guaranteed , another user in the household would find his or her traffic slowed down to guarantee the live streaming .
Juniper went on to clarify that while the technology exists , it is not widely deployed .
Juniper pointed out that , in some cases , service providers decide which applications to prioritize .
For instance , some providers have publicly stated that VoIP will take priority in times of congestion .
However , Juniper argues that this technology is static and that more dynamic options exist such as being able to indicate to the provider what sort of applications are valued to the individual users .
Juniper clarified that while the technology does exist , it has not been deployed in Canada yet .
In addition , they also pointed out that prioritizing cannot satisfy everyone .
For instance , if Scott Stevens prioritizes live streaming news , his kids will not have a good gaming experience .
Molnar changed the focus to deep packet inspection ( DPI ) .
She asked how it can be used to manage traffic – i.e. peer - to - peer downloading .
In response , Juniper claimed that it can be used in many different such as for security interests .
They called it a " broad " technology beyond regulating peer - to - peer .
Molnar shifted her question to privacy concerns .
She referred to DPI being used to " sniff " out traffic flows by observing what consumers are using and the amount consumed .
She asked what the purpose of this monitoring is .
In response , Juniper claimed that monitoring was important to the quality of the service .
Further , Juniper explained that it is important to identify the high bandwidth users .
If congestion is being delivered by a small number of users , taking action on a small number of users benefits everyone .
This way , Juniper can respond to a certain number of users rather than everyone at once .
Katz wondered if there were tools available to shift non real - time downloading to reduce congestion in networks .
Juniper argued that some consumption based models can shift when downloads are done .
However , Juniper pointed out that it does not address unexpected events .
It is possible to move people around to deal with predictable problems on a daily basis , but not the unexpected events .
Lamarre finished the questioning by asking at what point the privacy issue becomes a concern when these technologies are sold to their clients .
Juniper argued that their focus was not on obtaining information , but to protect users from malicious software .
Canadian Consumer Groups
The panel described themselves as representing the interests of Canadian consumers .
They argued that traffic management should be used to help consumers access the activities they would like over the Internet .
They submitted that where there is a conflict between providers and consumers , the priority should be in delivering content to the consumer .
They addressed some of the Commission ’s assumptions that it is necessary to violate some of the consumer rights under the Telecommunications
Act in order to protect the integrity of the network .
Further , they argued that it is up to the providers to justify interfering with the purpose of s. 36 , which prevents Canadian carriers from interfering with content except when the Commission approves otherwise .
They argued that all DPI and other Internet traffic controls are prima facie violations of s. 36 and should have to launch individual applications .
They went on to argue that none of the ISPs who presented fully explained their DPI levels and how they are carried out .
Since such understandings are key to evaluating how content is being impacted , they presented a three - part " test " with the burden of proof on the provider to show that the violation of s. 36 is necessary :
1 . There is a serious problem and a pressing need to address it .
2 . The solution minimally impairs the user ’s rights .
3 . The solution is proportional to the harm
Further , if the application is granted , the consumer should be fully informed of the impact on their content rights .
The panel argued that legitimate violations of s. 36 would protect the end users from harmful and unsolicited content such as malware and spam .
Further , the guidelines should treat all providers and consumers equally and protect the privacy and security of users .
In Canada , the Commission retains the right to regulate Internet traffic in a way that is not available in the United States .
As such , the panel urged them not to give up this authority .
In the U.S. , Obama and others have indicated their support for net neutrality .
In addition , bills have been passed in the U.S. that promote the equality of applications and provide notice to consumers .
The Consumer Groups reiterated that DPIs should only be used to protect users from unsolicited and malicious content .
They stressed that it is " totally unacceptable " when DPIs are used for a provider ’s financial gain - such as for advertising goals or targeting specific kinds of content .
Finally , the Consumer Groups addressed disclosure .
That is , whether the ISP has made its practices known to it costumers .
The Consumer Groups argued that such disclosure should be made prominently on the ISP ’s website .
Bell , for instance , has refused to indicate how its throttling policies are carried out .
The Consumer Groups seek information on the time of day when throttling is carried out and whether it could lead to extra billing for customers .
They also expressed concern when ISPs claim confidentiality over their DPI practices .
They argued that if DPI practices are used solely for trafficking reasons then there is no need for confidentiality .
For their final point , the Consumer Groups addressed privacy .
They argued that the policies are " highly invasive " and that DPIs look deeply into packets that reveal what websites are visited and for how long .
They argued that this clearly violates the Telecommunications goal of protecting the privacy of users .
ISPs do not get their customer ’s permission for this information nor do they make it clear that they are collecting this information .
Questions
Von Finckenstein opened the questioning by asking the Consumer Groups to clarify their position on DPIs and whether they are by themselves a violation of the Telecommunications Act .
He wanted to know why it was a privacy violation for ISPs to use DPI technology solely to manage their networks .
In response , the Consumer Groups argued that privacy violations occur even when the DPIs are only used to preserve the integrity of the network .
Further , they argued that the burden is on the ISPs to show that the congestion justifies the privacy violations .
The Consumer Groups argued that unregulated DPI use could lead to abuses of the system .
The Consumer Groups went on to explain that the burden of proof is key .
In the United States , the burden is on the carrier to prove that its actions are necessary .
In Canada , the Telecommunication Act stipulates that carriers must provide their services without discrimination .
Per the Consumer Groups , the problem is that carriers are not fully explaining how and why they are using this technology , which opens the door to possible abuses .
Von Finckenstein argued that he was not prepared to accept that using DPI technology is a violation of privacy in of itself , but moved on with the questioning .
Suzanne Lamarre proceeded with the questioning .
She asked about the pricing differentiations in services .
The Consumer Groups pointed out that the ability to tailor Internet prices to individual users currently exists .
For instance , under this type of scheme , gamers might have to pay an extra 30 dollars a month for service just for being gamers .
Lamarre pointed out that different pricing systems are in itself discriminatory and asked if the Consumer Groups were suggesting that everyone pay the same rate regardless of their usage .
In response , the Consumer Groups said it was not unreasonable to charge users extra for using a certain amount of bandwidth ( e.g. more than 200 ) .
However , they were concerned that that DPI technology might be used to charge users extra based on their activities rather than their actual usage .
For example , they pointed out that a gamer could be charged more simply for gaming even though he might not be using more bandwidth than someone who watches Youtube videos .
Lamarre went on to address the five percent " high end " users who use more bandwidth than others .
She asked whether it was fair for light users to in effect subsidize their usage .
The Consumer Groups reiterated that it was appropriate to charge for usage , but expressed concern that prices would go too high too quickly since ISPs remain an unregulated industry .
Further , Lamarre pointed out that it is difficult for users to know how much bandwidth they are actually using , and the Consumer Groups agreed that such information would be helpful for users .
Finally , Lamarre went on to address their three part test , comparing it to the Oakes test .
She asked whether s. 36 can be considered a " fundamental right " that deserves a high standard of Oakes protection .
The Consumer Groups argued that s. 36 – the right for content to pass without it being observed or changed – is a fundamental right that deserves a high standard of protection .
Katz opened his questioning by pointing out that operators strive to make a profit .
He criticized the Consumer Groups for hindering their ability to make money .
He argued that without the ability to preserve the integrity of the network , carriers will face higher costs , and consumers will have to pay more .
In response , the Consumer Groups claimed they have heard statements from Canadians saying that they would be willing to pay more for unhindered Internet access .
However , they doubted that prices would significantly increase in the near future .
Katz pressed the Consumer Groups to recognize that if the carriers ’ costs go up , so will the price of Internet usage for consumers .
As a result , demand will decrease and Canada will fall further behind the rest of the world .
The Consumer Group responded that they were not trying to create a blanket rule against carriers .
They pointed out that they were arguing against unjust discrimination , not no discrimination at all .
They said there should be a reason why a provider has to discriminate – such as to avoid prohibitive costs .
The Consumer Groups expressed concern with regards to what DPI practices were doing and the effects they were having .
They argued that the reason the burden of proof was so important was because it should fall on the provider to justify their actions .
They pointed out that one of the problems with consumption models was the lack of disclosure beforehand to give the consumer the choice to alter their behaviour .
The Consumer Groups expressed concern that providers are acting unilaterally and that the public lacks information on what is and is not necessary to protect the integrity of the network .
Timothy Denton ’s main concern was the notion that the CRTC should investigate whether or not carriers have made reasonable investments in preventing congestion .
He wondered whether the Consumer Groups were taking congestion seriously enough , and he expressed reluctance at second - guessing carriers with regards to the congestion issue .
In response , the Consumer Groups argued that DPI is not the only technology available for controlling congestion .
They pointed out that Telus is not using DPI and is doing fine .
Further , they argued carriers have a requirement to meet the needs of Canadians and to provide a reliable and affordable service .
Consequently , the CRTC has a responsibility to look at whether there is some shred of evidence that carriers are addressing their problems .
Denton finished his questions by admitting that the Consumer Groups made good points on both issues .
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy warns that a unilateral military strike on Iran by Israel would be an " absolute catastrophe . "
Sarkozy was speaking after a summit of the Group of Eight industrialized nations ( G8 ) in the central Italian city of L'Aquila on Thursday .
On Wednesday , the French president declared that major world powers in the G8 will give negotiations with Iran a chance until September .
He noted that Iran 's situation will be reviewed at a G20 meeting in Pittsburgh , western Pennsylvania , on September 24 and 25 , Reuters reported .
"
If there is no progress by then we will have to take decisions , " Sarkozy said .
Israel , which is considered as the only possessor of nuclear weapons in the Middle East , has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran 's nuclear facilities .
Tel Aviv alleges that Tehran is pursuing atomic bombs under the guise of a civilian nuclear program .
Iran , a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , rejects the claim saying that its nuclear program is solely aimed at generating electricity to meet its growing demand .
This optical and infrared image from the Digitized Sky Survey shows the crowded field around the micro-quasar GRS 1915 +105 ( GRS 1915 for short ) located near the plane of our Galaxy .
The inset shows a close - up of the Chandra image of GRS 1915 , one of the brightest X - ray sources in the Milky Way galaxy .
Supermassive black holes that pack the heft of billionsof suns have the capacity to regulate their energy during a tug - of - war with ahot radiation wind that blows in from their debris disks .
Now 10 years worth of observations from the Chandra X - rayObservatory have uncovered the first clear evidence of this mysteriousphenomenon occurring in a small black hole just 14 times the mass of the sun .
" The supermassiveblack hole has thousands of stars nearby , a whole galaxy of matter to pusharound , " said Joseph Nielson , an astrophysicist at the Harvard University .
" So it 's more like supermassive black holes have more opportunity toself - regulate . "
The difficult patient
Black holes are so powerful that matter and even lightcannot get out once trapped .
But around black holes , a flurry of activitycreates high - energy radiation — including radio waves and X - rays — that doesflow out into space .
Sometimes it all gets pretty messy , and some of the energycan be channeled into focused jets that shoot out in both direction along theaxis of the black hole 's rotation .
Chandra has kept an eye on a notoriously unpredictableblack hole that has 14 states of varying brightness , including a" heartbeat " state where periodic spikes in brightness resemble an EKGreading on a heart monitor .
Those unknown fluttering states have complicatedobservations of the GRS 1915+105 system for more than two decades , even thoughevery major ground and space observatory has taken a peek at one time oranother .
" These light curves are so bizarre that the blackhole has been described as ' pathological , ' " Nielson told SPACE.com " Sothe fact that we can see past all that , to the fundamental physics of winds andjets , is very exciting . "
Most black holes ordinarily have long periods of quietfollowed by occasional outbursts of jets and other activity , and so GRS 1915 is not unusual in that respect .
But the small and feisty black hole does stand outby having had active outbursts for 17 years .
On and off again
The black hole 's energyjet continually fights a seesaw battle with the hot radiation wind , asrevealed in Chandra 's X - ray observations .
That wind flows in from the hot innerregions of the dusty , gaseous accretion disk surrounding the black hole .
" The outer disk actually absorbs some of thatenergy , and essentially begins to evaporate , " Nielson said .
" As itflows away from the disk , it absorbs even more of that radiation and itsmomentum , until the wind attains speeds of 1000 km /s [ 621 mi/s ] or more . "
Evaporation of the outer disk deprives the black hole jetof the mass that serves as its fuel , and eventually chokes it off .
But the jetsstart up again .
How the jets start up again remains a mystery .
Scientists know more about possible mechanisms drivingthe hot wind , which can include factors beyond the thermal driving or X - rayheating in the case of GRS 1915 .
Magnetic fields can also drive such windsaround small black holes , also known as micro-quasars .
" So our paper kind of raises a new mystery : why do somemicro - quasars produce magnetically - driven winds and others producethermally - driven winds ? "
Nielson noted .
" Right now , we just do n' tknow the answer . "
An ongoing enigma
In any case , the jet appearances can also differ greatlyin terms of how long they keep going .
" Maybe it 's just for a few hours , but it could befor days or weeks , " Nielson noted .
" And some day , it will stopaltogether -- no jets , no winds , just a quiet accretion disk slowly feeding theblack hole . "
But for now , GRS 1915 continues to provide usefulinformation that researchers can apply to understanding its super - massive blackhole cousins , which can defy observation for timescale reasons .
An hour - long changein the small black hole would be equivalent to a timescale of 10,000 years in asuper - massive black hole , if the latter weighed a billion times the mass of thesun .
Much more Chandra data also remains for just this oneblack hole , and researchers have yet to analyze it all .
" It 's sort of like going back to see what 's on eachpuzzle piece , " Nielson said .
" Chandra is great for this sort ofthing , and we 've got lots of data to pore over . "
They say it is not over until the fat lady sings – now it turns out that it is not even over when the diva breaks a leg .
There cannot be a professional performer treading the boards with a better story about how they stuck to the rule that the show must go on than self - styled ' Yankee diva ' Joyce DiDonato , who will be appearing on stage tonight at the Royal Opera House in a new production of Rossini 's opera
Il barbiere di Siviglia ( The Barber of Seville ) .
It will not escape the attention of anyone in the audience that this will be – so far as is known – the first time a professional opera singer has performed the part of Rosina from a wheelchair .
They will also notice her leg is encased in plaster following an accident in front of last Saturday 's audience in Covent Garden .
DiDonato had just completed the solo " Una voce poco fa " early in Act 1 .
She walked to the edge of the stage and slipped , fell , and broke her calf bone .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But instead of giving way to the pain , she hauled herself up and carried on performing .
Her limp told the audience something was wrong , particularly when she next came on stage , with a walking stick .
In the interval , an official of the Royal Opera House announced she had sprained her ankle , but would continue anyway .
By the time she was whisked to hospital , after the final bow , she had been standing on her broken leg for nearly three hours to the horror of medical staff .
Time will tell whether there has been any permanent damage .
After four hours in accident and emergency , she felt strong enough to joke about it on her blog : " From here on out , I declare that no one ( please ! ) ever ever ever wish me again , in the American fashion ( despite it being Independence Day ) , to BREAK A LEG .
" I understand the good intention , but from here on out , wish me ' in the mouth of the wolf ' instead , ok ?
That 's far less likely to actually happen – although with my luck , you never know ! "
She was not the only one who roused the audience 's admiration that evening .
Act 2 of
Il barbiere includes a notoriously difficult aria , " Cessa di più resistere " , which is often left out .
The tenor , Juan Diego Flórez , playing Figaro , not only performed it like a virtuoso , but did so holding on to DiDonato to relieve the pressure on her throbbing leg .
" So far as I am aware , Rosina has never been performed in a wheelchair before , " a spokeswoman for the Royal Opera House said yesterday .
" There has probably been a wheelchair on stage as one of the props , but not with a leading member of the cast in it . "
On her blog , DiDonato defended the unusual innovation of a wheelchair - bound Rosina .
" There is no RULE that says Rosina might not have been suffering from a broken ankle , right ?
It could happen !! , " she wrote .
She went on : " I have to send out an INCREDIBLE debt of gratitude to my wonderful cast mates ( ha – CAST mates ! ) , as well as to the amazing staff of the Royal Opera House who took amazing care of me , and then to simply salute one of the very finest operatic experiences I have ever been a part of .
" Señor Florez sang an unbelievable ' Cessa di più resistere ' all the while being sure to help keep me on my feet . "
Aficionados will also know that Rosina is asked by one of the minor characters what is the matter , and replies , " E ' un granchio al piede " , a colloquial way of saying " I 've got cramp in my foot . "
You can bet she delivered that line with feeling .
HONG KONG / DETROIT ( Reuters ) - Yang Rong , a Chinese automobile tycoon who fled the country after being accused of economic crimes , is preparing to launch an ambitious plan to make clean - tech cars in the United States , said a source .
The former chairman of Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd , ranked by Forbes as China ’s third - richest man in 2001 , will announce a plan later this month to set up a company in the southern U.S. state of Alabama , said the source with direct knowledge of the plan .
Yang could not be immediately reached for comment .
Support for the plan had come from former U.S. Vice President Al Gore , one of the world ’s most visible environmental activists and now a partner at U.S. venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers , said the source , declining to be more specific .
A spokeswoman for Gore said he was not immediately available to comment .
Yang ’s plans to return to the auto industry after fleeing to the United States in late 2002 first emerged in various Chinese media reports , which did not provide details .
Now living in California , he has hired a former senior executive of top U.S. carmaker General Motors Corp to run the firm ’s daily operations , said the source .
The firm is also seeking financial support from the U.S. Department of Energy , which is in charge of a mega - sized fund to support environmentally friendly energy projects , the source said .
David Cole , chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor , Michigan , said such a venture could cost billions of dollars and would run headlong into tough competition .
“ Until there is more detail , it is really hard to know , ” Cole said .
“ But I would still say good luck , because it is a very formidable task , particularly in the competitive market that already exists , and will be very much developing around the so - called clean cars . ”
SWEET HOME ALABAMA
Yang will cooperate with the Alabama state government on the project , expected to create thousands of jobs in its initial phase , the source said , speaking on condition of anonymity as the source was not authorized to speak to the media .
“ The Alabama government definitely welcomes the plan as the new firm , which owns big land in the state , will build a plant there and hire local workers , ” the source said .
Alabama economic development officials had no comment .
Yang was China ’s most influential carmaker at one time as he helped transform Brilliance from a stagnant state - owned auto factory into a top maker of mini-vans in the country .
Brilliance later became a household brand and a manufacturing partner of German carmaker BMW in China .
Yang ’s new company will manufacture cars in Alabama , with plans to sell them nationwide , while it also seeks partners in China where the tycoon hopes to produce cars for local consumers , said the source .
“ All cars made in the U.S. will be sold in the U.S. and the firm will also make cars in China and sell cars to Chinese consumers , but key technologies will be definitely controlled by people in the U.S. , ” said the source .
However , the source acknowledged that Yang ’s politically sensitive background might lead to legal challenges for the firm ’s China plans because the government has not cleared his case .

When is lying illegal ?
That 's a fundamental question in any system of laws .
If you and I agree that you 'll give me a dollar , and in return I 'll give you two back later , we have a contract .
If I skip town , I have committed a crime : fraud .
It 's the most basic of crimes , and simply boils down to lying .
Of course , there are a thousand ways to lie and be nothing more than a cad .
If I tell you I 'm a lousy pool player , we bet a dollar on a game , and it turns out I 'm better than you , you 're a sucker , I 'm a con artist , and there 's been no crime .
Yes , I misrepresented myself , but it was a matter of judgment , not fact .
And there are plenty of cases where lying is a sanctioned risk .
If we play a poker tournament -- a legally constructed one , regulated by our fine system of government -- it 's not only acceptable to lie , it 's expected .
The card player who fails to lie effectively will almost always lose .
It 's a condition of the game .
Consider if you will , Eve Online .
Last , week , Dentara Rast -- a character in CCP 's Eve Online massively multiplayer online world -- pulled off an impressive stunt .
He ran a classic Ponzi scheme and walked off with 700 billion ISK ( in game money , and quite a lot of it ) .
Normally , this kind of in - game bravado would generate nothing but a confuse stare from someone not deep inside the Eve universe , and little more than scandal - of - the - week titillation and subsequent yawns there .
But I believe this case is more interesting than that .
I believe Dentara Rast committed fraud .
I believe he owes the IRS a lot of money .
Admittedly these are bold statements likely stuffed with straw , but they have deep implications , and bear argument .
The Scene of the Crime
Eve Online is a unique persistent world .
It 's the only successful , long term Science Fiction world .
Science Fiction is hard .
As our friends - in - spirit at 2d6 feet posited recently , it 's harder because of the details .
Fantasy worlds have extensive shorthand .
Toss me into a quasi - medieval setting , tell me there are elves and magic , and I 've got a whole library in my head to fill in the blanks .
But in a science fiction world , you need to tell me a LOT more .
Are there aliens ?
What do they look like ?
What 's the technology do ?
What does a spaceship look like , and how does it work ?
What are the moral codes and motivations ?
Is there money ?
It 's a real question .
The two largest competing SF universes have radically different answers .
Star Wars ' Han Solo works for cash .
We see him loading the Millennium Falcon with crates of the stuff .
His world is filled with the crimes of acquisition .
Star Trek 's James .
T Kirk lives in a universe that grew beyond the need for commerce .
It 's never explained in great detail , but some sort of vast communism or invisible spirit guides the known worlds of the Federation .
Eve takes the Star Wars route .
Money is n't only important , it 's everything .
Piracy and scheming drive most of the Player - vs - Player ( PVP ) interactions , and PvP is what Eve is all about .
Eve embraces capitalism in a way that goes far beyond the auction houses and crafting of World of Warcraft .
Eve embeds the idea of a corporation into the roots of the game .
A corporation , by definition , is an entity created to act like an individual person in a marketplace .
Anywhere from one to an infinite number of biological individuals create a commune of ownership , and drive that new fictional individual towards a common goal .
In Eve , corporations are formed , engage in exploration , exploitation and extermination in the pursuit of wealth for their members .
Thanks to the efforts of a dedicated community , corporations can create initial public offerings to grab new investors .
Most often these public corporations are formed to pool the capital required to purchase the blueprints for the games most powerful ships .
These blueprints can then be copied and sold , generating cash for dividends .
Shares can be traded on the open market , portfolios managed , speculations made .
This user - controlled market is entirely unregulated .
Eve is a pocket universe for students of unfettered capitalism .
As one would expect , there are good actors and bad actors .
And it 's the bad actors that are interesting .
Financial scams have an easy time of it in Eve .
Anything beyond a simple purchase involves a transfer of wealth between players .
Someone has to give a real person in - game cash to buy something -- in this case shares in a corporation .
And once that money 's sitting in the corporate account , the CEO can just transfer that wealth to an alternate character , and disappear .
There is no SEC to go after the bad guy .
There is no court in which to make an accusation and seek recompense .
CCP is well aware that they have created a world where bad actors can thrive .
Their own FAQ makes this clear :
" A scam is the act of obtaining goods from other players through misinformation , confusion , pressure or by taking advantage of basic trust .
Players enter into business dealings with others at their own risk and are strongly urged to exercise good judgment and common sense when trading .
Scams that relate to issues such as password scams or account theft scams are more serious and will result in an immediate ban . "
The Offense
But if you 're playing for fame , not just fortune , you need to put on a show .
This is where Dentara Rask made good theater .
His scheme was interesting , but unoriginal .
He ran the EVE Investment Bank , in which he promised a return on deposits .
And he delivered .
If you got in early , he paid you your return , and most likely , you reinvested .
It was , of course , just a Ponzi scheme .
Investors were paid out of the capital from new investors .
When the pyramid become too big to manage , he pulled back the curtain and proclaimed himself the victor .
He 'd amassed more than 700 billion ISK ( in game cash ) , perhaps 10 times the previous record for a market scam .
He gloated in the forums about his prowess .
He basked in the glory of hatred , even posting a video confession complete with I 'd - like - to - thank - the - academy antics .
He took out a bounty on his own head , so people would hunt him down .
The act of me writing about this plays further into the ego trip .
But there 's a catch .
What if he committed a real crime ?
If this was a " real world " scam , few would argue that this was fraud .
In the US ( and we do n't know where he lives ) he would mostly likely be guilty of racketeering under RICO .
The first argument against the fraud case is one of substance .
After all , this was imaginary money , right ?
Not really .
Eve ISK is a fungible asset .
While no regulated market exists for converting ISK into cash directly , there are markets available .
CCP sells 30 day time cards for 120 million ISK .
Time cards are available legally for $ 14 a piece .
So the implied value of an ISK is roughly $ 1.17E - 07 .
Put another way , that 700 billion ISK is worth 5,834 time cards , or $ 81,667 .
( A figure worthy of note , as it bumps the value up into the realm of the money laundering -- a swiss - army - knife - meets - sledgehammer of a law if ever there was one . )
The second argument is that somehow this path of conversion is illegal , and thus in itself not a crime .
This is spurious : fraud does not require the underlying transaction to be in legal goods .
If I bilk you on a drug deal , I still committed fraud , I 'll just never sue you for it .
The third argument is that according to the EULA for the game , CCP retains ownership of all in game assets .
Note that this is not a law , this is an agreement between CCP and an individual player , and I do n't believe it frankly matters what CCP claims , as long as the market exists to convert the in game assets into real world assets ( which it clearly does ) .
CCP can ban you for it , they could even sue you for copyright violation , but none of this matters to the fraud argument .
The last remaining argument is that of poker : implied consent .
Did the players who lost money to Dentara Rast enter into the transaction with an implied consent to be deceived as part of the game ?
Honestly , I do n't think there 's a clear cut answer .
Certainly , CCP admits that scams can happen as part of the game .
They denounce them in public forums , but they also make it clear that whether they do anything about them is a decision they will make on a case by case basis .
They have , in the past , made victims whole .
This is clearly different than a poker bluff -- I do n't believe that the Bellagio has ever given a penny back to a loser at their poker tables .
At least not me .
My opinion ( and no , I 'm not a lawyer ) -- there 's at least a case for fraud .
The Punishment
The second major issue here is taxation .
Taxing in - game earnings is n't remotely a new idea , and a bevy of academics are already front - running the IRS .
The logic is simple in concept ( if complex in application ) .
Dentara has acquired wealth – as clearly as Al Capone acquired wealth in his bank accounts and rum-running operations .
The IRS does n't particularly care if that wealth is US currency or not ( Topic 140 ) .
If I work for a company who pays me in gold bars or candy bars , I still got paid , and I still owe taxes .
Remember , the IRS did threaten to assess whomever caught McGuire 's 62nd home run ball , and it took the White House to calm them down .
The fact that this wealth , if converted into US dollars , would crash the real - world market for ISK or game time cards is also irrelevant -- just ask anyone who excercised a non-qualified stock options at the end of the dotcom boom .
The alternative minimum tax caused people to sell their houses to pay taxes on worthless stock .
Dentara 's only real defense would be one of recognition .
If he hangs onto the ISK , never converting them into a more tangible asset , he could argue that he had not yet realized any gain or income on which he could be taxed .
He would argue that -- at most -- he had a taxable gain on the difference between his investment ( the amount he has paid to CCP as an Eve Online customer ) and his return ( the $ 81,666 ) , and as a capital gain , it should n't be payable until the asset is sold .
He might win that argument .
And should he choose never to sell on the open market or convert into game time cards , he might avoid all taxes .
The reality is that the IRS has remained relatively silent on the issue of in - game earnings , but I do n't expect that to last long .
He might , in fact , owe the IRS $ 12,250 .
Or , if the IRS was feeling particularly frisky , they might see this as self - employment income and hit him up for $ 15,077 ( assuming he 's otherwise unemployed ) .
How are these two issues connected : fraud and taxation ?
While the IRS has so far declined to pursue virtual earnings , they 've been known to be spurred into action when faced with criminal activity outside the realm of tax evasion .
Frank Wilson only grabbed on to Al Capone 's leg after the FBI was unable to bring him down on prohibition charges .
If Dentara was actually pursued under RICO , the FBI might be inclined to use the tax - hammer once again , as rounding up injured parties to testify in a fraud case could be exceptionally difficult .
And once the FBI walks into the room , everyone pays attention -- not just Business Week and Terra Nova .
Imagine a world where this happens .
Where someone drops the dime on Dentara Rask ( hey , there is a 15 % bounty on tax evaders ) , and he has to cough up the dough .
Imagine the implications .
Whole genres of gaming now become taxable activities .
Does Blizzard establish two sets of servers : one where you can transfer accounts and assets , one where you can't ?
Does over - the - air television start generating an implied receipt of a good , and thus trigger a gift tax ?
Can a hacker who downs your server now be the subject of a class action suit for all those " workers " denied their place of employment ?
Do I owe someone money because I listen to Pandora all day long and have never paid a dime ?
And what if Dentara Rast is underage ?
Has CCP somehow violated child labor laws ?
It does n't really matter , the IRS will still want their pound of flesh .
The tax man must be paid .
The going rate in my neighborhood is $ 20 for a small front lawn by a entrepreneurial teenager .
Best case , this kid's got 612 lawns to go .
