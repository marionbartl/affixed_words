About three months ago , I started looking around for licensing components for the NHibernate Profiler .
I did n't care to write the feature myself , and I thought that for a small investment of money , I could get a ready made and useful component .
I looked around and finally ended up on XHEO 's site .
I heard about XHEO before , the feature set looked decent and the documentation was good .
I downloaded the trail and gave it a go .
Everything seemed good , so on the 26th Nov , I purchased the professional version .
Shortly after that , I released the private beta of NH Prof .
Almost immediately I got comments from users saying that the software will not work on their machines .
The common theme ?
All of them were running 64 bits platform .
I narrowed the issue down to the licensing component .
After I contacted support , I was told that yes , that is the case , and 64 bits is not supported .
It is even mentioned in the documentation , so I really have no cause for complaint .
Now , mentioning such a limitation in a footnote hidden deep in the documentation is not what I would call being open about your limitations , but we will let it go .
They had a workaround which I was n't really comfortable with , but it worked , so I just used that .
It would cause problems down the road ( it basically running in WOW64 mode , and I suspected it would cause issues relating to binding to 64 bits drivers with the Open Query Results features ) .
The only real way of fixing this was to by purchasing Ultimate Edition With Source .
At that point , I also started getting more requests regarding licensing .
That is when I encountered this beauty :
Yes , I need professional or better , but I have professional .
I guess someone put an > instead of >= .
Anyway , I was already in favor of buying the version that would let me run on x64 natively , so I decided to go ahead with this .
A major part of my decision to go ahead and buy the source version was that I kept getting errors like this one :
System .Windows.Markup.XamlParseException : Failed object initialization ( ISupportInitialize.EndInit ) .
The type initializer for ' < Module > ' threw an exception .
Error at object ' HibernatingRhinos.NHibernate.Profiler.Client.MainWindow ' in markup file ' HibernatingRhinos.NHibernate.Profiler.Client;component/mainwindow.xaml ' .
---> System.TypeInitializationException :
The type initializer for ' < Module > ' threw an exception .
---> System .AccessViolationException : Attempted to read or write protected memory .
This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt .

This is part of NH Prof 's production error reporting , so I know why the software crashed and can fix this .
If you follow closely , Licensing.LicenseManager .
AssertValidLicense , will call into XHEO 's licensing component , and in some cases , completely crash the system .
I figured that with the source version , I could fix that .
That was the point where I was told that if I wanted the source version , I also needed to deploy obfuscated assemblies .
And that this would jump the price by almost 1,000 $ .
I did n't mind deploying obfuscated assemblies that much , but I did mind the extra 1,000 $ .
Nevertheless , I decided that it was probably worth it to not have to worry about licensing .
That is when the real problems started .
According to the license agreement between me and XHEO ( which was signed by both parties , this is not your standard EULA ) , I can not use the source without obfuscating it .
That make sense , from their perspective .
Except ... the obfuscator that they sell does n't work .
Here are just a few of the errors that I got .
Complete system melt down :
Just simple errors :
Or producing software that cannot run .
I had spent quite some time with XHEO 's support , trying to resolve the issue .
First , I have to say that in general I have found them to be completely unresponsive , often letting multiple business days go by without so much as acknowledging that a message was received , much less that they are working on it .
This post is a copy of an email that I sent to them , and a good example of the kind of interaction that I had with them at that point .
After several days going back and forth with their support , they have been unable to make the software work on my machine , rendering my entire purchase useless .
That is when I dug into the signed contract that we had , and verified that I remembered correctly .
There are two sections which are particularly important :
What this basically says , is that if they do n't deliver a product that works , they should either provide one that works , or refund the money .
At that point , I was sick and tired of the whole thing and sent them an email , telling them that they have failed to provide me with a working copy , and that I would like to get a refund .
As per our signed contract .
This is the reply that I got :
At that point , I have to remind you .
I still was n't able to get the software to run without errors .
I replied , and got no response .
Replied again , several days letter , and got basically the same thing , replied to that again .
Was ignored .
Finally , I sat down and wrote this email .
I think you can tell how frustrated I am with the whole thing .
That got me talking with someone else .
Who was n't very helpful .
I cannot believe this .
To summarize :
I am out a lot of money .
I have a product that does n't work and support that is extremely non responsive and not really helpful when it is responding .
I have a company that thinks that " It works on my machine " means that it can ignore a crashing bug and total uselessness of their product for a paying customer .
I have a company that is ignoring a signed contract and refuse to honor it .
I have a huge amount of time invested into making this work , and not into actually producing good features for NH Prof .
I have a delayed launch for my software .
I just can't understand how they think that behaving in this manner to their client .
After this experience , I would strongly recommend to all and sundry to avoid them .
Report : Obama to nominate Chu , Jackson , Browner to energy team
The Associated Press is reporting that President - elect Barack Obama is set to nominate key members of his administration 's energy and environmental teams , including Nobel Prize in Physics winner Steven Chu :
A Chinese - American , Chu is a professor of physics and molecular and cell biology at the University of California - Berkeley and has been the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory since 2004 , where he has pushed aggressively for research into alternative energy as a way to combat global warming .
Obama is expected to make the announcements in the coming weeks .
Still unclear is whom Obama will tap for interior secretary .
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to reveal selections that have not been made public .
... Obama has selected a deputy mayor of Los Angeles to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality , transition officials said Wednesday .
Nancy Sutley is the first prominent member of the gay and lesbian community to earn a senior role in the Democrat 's new administration .
The senior Pentagon official in the Bush administration ’s system for prosecuting detainees said in a published interview that she had concluded that interrogators had tortured a Guantánamo detainee who has sometimes been described as “ the 20th hijacker ” in the 2001 terrorist attacks .
The public record of the Guantánamo interrogation of the detainee , Mohammed al - Qahtani , has long included what officials labeled abusive techniques , including exposure to extreme temperatures and isolation , but the Pentagon has resisted acknowledging that his treatment rose to the level of torture .
But the official , Susan J. Crawford , told Bob Woodward of The Washington Post that she had concluded that his treatment amounted to torture when she reviewed military charges against him last year .
In May she decided that the case could not be referred for trial but provided no explanation at the time .
“ His treatment met the legal definition of torture .
And that ’s why I did not refer the case ” for prosecution , Ms. Crawford was quoted as saying in an article published in The Post on Wednesday .
Worries Grow Over to European Banks
The worries over unpaid loans and expenses cross overseas , reports CNBC's David Faber
It might have been that he was walking pigeon - toed through Melbourne Airport that Customs officers plucked a man from the line and chose to search his bags .
Whatever sparked their suspicions , the man 's feathers were well and truly ruffled when , after his bags were thoroughly checked and items were seized , he was ordered to drop his pants .
An image of the passenger caught carrying two live pigeons .
Stuffed into the man 's tights , inside each leg , the officers found two live pigeons .
A multi-vitamin container holding two birds eggs was also seized along with a money belt containing plant seeds and undeclared samples of eggplant .
The 23 - year - old man , from Meadow Heights in Melbourne 's north , landed at Melbourne Airport on Sunday after flying from Dubai .
He was immediately handed over to Australian Quarantine and Inspection Services staff .
This time it ’s historian Matthew Dallek who is pulling made up history out of his hat and printing it up , in Politico .
Note that Hayek wrote his The Road to Serfdom for British publication and as a warning for the British people , and he never expected the book to be published in America .
It was a great surprise to Hayek when the book became a sensation in America .
The only brief mentions of Franklin Roosevelt in the book are positive references — including a quotation from Roosevelt presenting the case for saving classical liberalism by reforming it .
But here is Dallek ’s bit of partisan disinformation :
The Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek published the landmark “ The Road to Serfdom ” ( 1944 ) , in which he expressed his fear that federal expansion in FDR ’s era had put America on a path toward planned economies and political enslavement .
Academics typically have no shame in publishing such falsehoods about Hayek — the peer reviewed journals are chock full of disinformation about Hayek .
We ’ll see if Dallek is different from so many of his peers .
I ’ve written him a note calling attention to this factual error .
We ’ll see if Dallek posts a correction .
Now and again even historians like Dallek care more about presenting a truthful historical record than they do about their partisan agenda .
I ’m curioius to see were Dallek shakes out on this one .
UPDATE :
In the “ Foreward ” of the 1956 paperback edition Hayek writes the following :
“ The book was written in England during the war years and was designed almost exclusively for English readers ” .
This is exactly what Hayek tells us also in many different interviews .
There is almost no mention of the United States in the book .
Neither Franklin Roosevelt or the New Deal received any discussion .
Roosevelt is quoted a single time , as the opening title quotation for chapter one , titled “ The Abandoned Road ” .
The FDR quotation reads as follows :
“ A program whose basic thesis is , not that the system of free enterprise for profit has failed in this generation , but that it has not yet been tried . ”
Hayek was offering Roosevelt as a witness in support of his own project — the project of saving the market system through its reform .
In the late 1940s Hayek explicitly rejects “ laissez faire ” , advocates a re-thinking of the institutions of a free society , and embraces a reform agenda for classical liberalism .
Naively or not , while he lived in England in the 1930s and 1940s Hayek associated Roosevelt with this instinct , something Roosevelt advocated rhetorically , and in deed with such things as his financial and banking reforms .
FDA food inspections cut almost in half
47 percent fewer checks ; testing , staff down since '03
That 's not all that 's dropping at the FDA in terms of food safety .
The analysis also shows : ●
There are 12 percent fewer FDA employees in field offices who concentrate on food issues .●
Safety tests for U.S. - produced food have dropped nearly 75 percent , from 9,748 in 2003 to 2,455 last year , according to the agency 's own statistics .
After the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , the FDA , at the urging of Congress , increased the number of food inspectors and inspections amid fears that the nation 's food system was vulnerable to terrorists .
Inspectors and inspections spiked in 2003 , but both have fallen enough to erase the gains .
" The only difference is now it 's worse , because there are more inspections to do - more facilities - and more food coming into America , which requires more inspections , " said Tommy Thompson , who as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services pushed to increase the numbers .
He 's now part of a coalition lobbying to turn around several years of stagnant spending .
The Bush administration 's budget request for 2008 includes an additional $ 10.6 million for food safety at the FDA ; Thompson 's lobbying group said 10 times that increase is needed .
Even though the FDA increased its overall spending on food between 2003 and 2006 , those increases failed to keep pace with rising personnel costs .
" It 's not just outsiders like us who have been watching it for a while .
People who worked in the Bush administration are coming out and saying the agency is not working at its current resource levels .
It just can't manage the job , " said Caroline Smith DeWaal , director of food safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest , an advocacy group .
Members of Congress also have renewed the focus on the safety of the nation 's food supply amid highly publicized recalls sparked by food poisoning , including last year when E. coli was found to taint fresh spinach sold coast to coast .
That outbreak killed three people and sickened nearly 200 .
The latest big recall involves peanut butter believed tainted with salmonella , a bacterium found in feces that can cause severe diarrhea .
The outbreak has sickened at least 329 people in 41 states , including two cases in Pima County , federal health officials say .
Food safety experts say it would be impossible to know whether increased numbers of inspectors and inspections would have prevented the outbreak , linked to Peter Pan and Great Value brands made by ConAgra Foods Inc. , or other recent food poisoning scares .
The FDA had last inspected ConAgra 's peanut butter plant in Sylvester , Ga. , in February 2005 and had found no problems , agency spokesman Michael Herndon said .
Firms that produce high - risk foods more susceptible to contamination , such as fresh fruit and vegetables , are supposed to be inspected every year , unless they have a good safety record .
Then inspections are done every two or three years , Herndon said .
For other foods , the FDA rotates inspections , depending on resources .
FDA food inspectors look for filth , decomposition , adulteration with pesticides and industrial chemicals and the illegal use of color or food additives , according to the agency .
Inspectors also look for sources of possible contamination , such as flies .
For instance , inspectors are asked to count flies , as well as how often they land on a food product .
They 're also told to look for any open doors or damaged window screens that could allow the insects to flit back and forth between the product and , say , a toilet , floor drain or garbage can , according to agency documents .
The shrunken ranks of inspectors have left the nation once again vulnerable , especially to problems in imported food , Thompson and others said .
Doyle , whose center studies ways to improve food safety , called the nation 's growing appetite for imported foods the " coming threat .
" The United States last year imported about $ 10 billion more in food , feed and beverages than it exported , according to Census figures .
Even as imports grow in volume and diversity , the number of FDA inspections is shrinking : agency inspectors physically examined just 1.3 percent of food imports last year , about three - quarters as much as in 2003 .
The FDA , meanwhile , says it is concentrating its efforts on areas where the potential threat to the public 's health is greatest .
"
We 're applying resources to targeted areas .
So in a way , it 's not a matter of ' Are you inspecting 1 out of 100 or 10 out of 100 ? '
The real issue is if you can define risk .
Are you applying the 10 inspectors to the 10 areas of concern ?
Then it 's essentially you 're covering 100 percent of your problem , which is not covering 100 percent of the universe , " FDA commissioner Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach said .
FDA inspectors , for example , visited the ConAgra plant on Feb. 14 , a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told the agency it suspected the company 's peanut butter was the source of the outbreak .
For one member of Congress , that 's not good enough .
" We are reacting to crises rather than preventing or minimizing them , " said Rep. Rosa DeLauro , D - Conn. , chairwoman of the House subcommittee that oversees the FDA and its budget .
DeLauro said she worried food inspections were becoming a " stepchild " of the regulatory agency .
Von Eschenbach said the agency 's food safety system can be reactive but is still aggressive .
" What you saw with the spinach and certainly what you saw with the peanut butter , is when we see those signals we 're going to act to protect the public health , " von Eschenbach said .
Maybe the first victim of our ailing economy , the 2009 Langerado Music Festival has been cancelled , due to sluggish ticket sales .
Langerado co-promoter Ethan Schwartz puts it thus : " Langerado has always put the fan experience first .
Unfortunately , during these difficult economic times , and facing a first year in a new venue , it ’s become apparent that we cannot execute a production that lives up to the high standards of our past events .
Putting Langerado on hold was the toughest decision we have ever had to make .
We are very grateful for the support of the greater - Miami community and the music community during this difficult time . "
Bummer .
Among the bands scheduled to play Langerado this year were Death Cab for Cutie , Thievery Corporation , Snoop Dogg , Broken Social Scene , Deerhunter , Modest Mouse , and Public Enemy .
A Chinese bestseller entitled The Currency War describes how Jews are planning to rule the world by manipulating the international financial system .
The book is reportedly read in the highest government circles .
If so , this does not bode well for the international financial system , which relies on well - informed Chinese to help it recover from the current crisis .
Such conspiracy theories are not rare in Asia .
Japanese readers have shown a healthy appetite over the years for books such as To Watch Jews Is To See the World Clearly , The Next Ten Years : How to Get an Inside View of the Jewish Protocols , and I 'd Like to Apologise To the Japanese – A Jewish Elder 's Confession ( written by a Japanese author , of course , under the made - up name of Mordecai Mose ) .
All these books are variations of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , the Russian forgery first published in 1903 , which Japanese came across after defeating the Czar 's army in 1905 .
The Chinese picked up many modern western ideas from the Japanese .
Perhaps this is how Jewish conspiracy theories were passed on as well .
But Southeast Asians are not immune to this kind of nonsense either .
The former prime minister of Malaysia , Mahathir Bin Mohammed , has said that " the Jews rule the world by proxy .
They get others to fight and die for them . "
And a recent article in a leading Filipino business magazine explained how Jews had always controlled the countries they lived in , including the United States today .
In the case of Mahathir , a twisted kind of Muslim solidarity is probably at work .
But , unlike European or Russian antisemitism , the Asian variety has no religious roots .
No Chinese or Japanese has blamed Jews for killing their holy men or believed that their children 's blood ended up in Passover matzos .
In fact , few Chinese , Japanese , Malaysians , or Filipinos have ever seen a Jew , unless they have spent time abroad .
So what explains the remarkable appeal of Jewish conspiracy theories in Asia ?
The answer must be partly political .
Conspiracy theories thrive in relatively closed societies , where free access to news is limited and freedom of enquiry curtailed .
Japan is no longer such a closed society , yet even people with a short history of democracy are prone to believe that they are victims of unseen forces .
Precisely because Jews are relatively unknown , therefore mysterious , and in some way associated with the west , they become an obvious fixture of anti-western paranoia .
Such paranoia is widespread in Asia , where almost every country was at the mercy of western powers for several hundred years .
Japan was never formally colonised , but it , too , felt the west 's dominance , at least since the 1850s , when American ships laden with heavy guns forced the country to open its borders on western terms .
The common conflation of the US with Jews goes back to the late 19th century , when European reactionaries loathed America for being a rootless society based only on financial greed .
This perfectly matched the stereotype of the " rootless cosmopolitan " Jewish moneygrubber .
Hence the idea that Jews run America .
One of the great ironies of colonial history is the way in which colonised people adopted some of the very prejudices that justified colonial rule .
Antisemitism arrived with a whole package of European race theories that have persisted in Asia long after they fell out of fashion in the west .
In some ways , Chinese minorities in Southeast Asia have shared some of the hostility suffered by Jews in the west .
Excluded from many occupations , they , too , survived by clannishness and trade .
They , too , have been persecuted for not being " sons of the soil " .
And they , too , are thought to have superhuman powers when it comes to making money .
So when things go wrong , the Chinese are blamed , not just for being greedy capitalists , but also , again like the Jews , for being communists , since both capitalism and communism are associated with rootlessness and cosmopolitanism .
As well as being feared , the Chinese are admired for being cleverer than everybody else .
The same mixture of fear and awe is often evident in people 's views of the US , and , indeed , of the Jews .
Japanese antisemitism is a particularly interesting case .
Japan was able to defeat Russia in 1905 only after a Jewish banker in New York , Jacob Schiff , helped Japan by floating bonds .
So The Protocols of the Elders of Zion confirmed what the Japanese already suspected : Jews really did pull the strings of global finance .
But , instead of wishing to attack them , the Japanese , being a practical people , decided that they would be better off cultivating those clever , powerful Jews as friends .
As a result , during the second world war , even as the Germans were asking their Japanese allies to round up Jews and hand them over , dinners were held in Japanese - occupied Manchuria to celebrate Japanese - Jewish friendship .
Jewish refugees in Shanghai , though never comfortable , at least remained alive under Japanese protection .
This was good for the Jews of Shanghai .
But the very ideas that helped them to survive continue to muddle the thinking of people who really ought to know better by now .

For Sunday night services of The Wilderness , the high - vaulted ceiling of St. John ’s Episcopal Cathedral shimmers with purple and green light effects , like an indoor aurora borealis .
Below , dozens of candles flicker near icons in the dark nave .
Incense hangs in the air .
Congregants can choose to sit in a pew or on thick cushions at the foot of a simple altar .
A stringed Moroccan oud gives even traditional songs of praise an exotic twist , but there is also world music , chant and jazz .
“ We ’re using the cathedral in new ways , making it more inviting and even sensual , ” said the Rev. Peter Eaton .
“ It ’s meant to celebrate and bring alive all the human senses .
We think that , in metro Denver , there is nothing else like us . ”
Episocopal attendance has been dwindling at the national and diocesan level .
Eaton hopes
The Wilderness is the ticket for uninspired Protestants , disaffected Catholics and other spiritual seekers who want a more mystical and meditative feeling than what big - box churches or traditional Protestant services provide .
“ We have what everybody else is wanting , ” said Eaton , St. John ’s dean and rector .
“ We have the theological depth and breadth of a 2,000 - year - old spiritual tradition .
. . .
Yet we also have exploration of new language and religious experience . ”
The Wilderness is gaining disciples , roughly 100 so far .
Like many mainline Protestant denominations , the Episcopal Church has been been bleeding enrollment in Colorado and nationwide .
“ The Wilderness has been a revitalizing force at St. John ’s , ” said parishioner James Wall , a co-founder along with Sub - Dean Poulson Reed .
“ We ’re a passionate bunch . . . bringing new life into this stuffy , old building . ”
Swifter currents
The Wilderness is bishop - approved Episcopalianism , but it seeks to be somewhat unconventional — a mainstream church exploring some swifter , smaller religious currents .
The Wilderness is riding one evangelical trend — small niche Christian congregations called emergent churches — and bucking another — the megachurch .
The emergent church , a form of evangelism that took root in the U.S. in the 1990s , generally attempts to attract congregants 18 - 30 years old or some other constituency aloof to the institutional church .
Many of these boutique churches say they return to Christianity ’s early roots .
Many incorporate elements of mysticism and social activism .
Each seeks to offer something different from what ’s already out there .
The Wilderness service , Eaton said , offers ancient tradition , classical liturgy , rich musical heritage , sensual setting — all this and wide - open minds .
“ We ’re trying to explore new ways of worshiping , ” he said .
The “ sermon ” is sometimes a sermon , sometimes a conversation , and sometimes a short film or a slide show .
After church , the congregation adjourns to a nearby pub to continue the discussion .
When The Wilderness was launched in late 2007 , there was concern among some parishioners about using one of the oldest churches in Denver for something of an experiment .
“ Some called us the New Age service , ” Wall said .
“ Others predicted we ’d be gone in a year . ”
Yet the congregation , which fluctuates between attendance of 85 and 130 for most of the 6 p.m.
Sunday services , is larger in its second year than two of the cathedral ’s four Sunday morning services , which together draw 750 to 800 .
“ We ’re bringing new people into the cathedral , ” Wall said .
But The Wilderness is not trying to grow a huge congregation , Eaton said .
“ We do n’t actually think this is going to be everybody ’s thing , ” Eaton said .
“ One size does not fit all anymore .
We have to be open , nimble and flexible . ”
Yet The Wilderness has attracted all age groups .
“ It ’s really different , ” 23 - year - old Reggie White said .
“ It ’s really contemporary , yet calm and collected .
I love the music .
I feel God here more than any other place . ”
Break from Catholicism
Maria and Charlie Girsch , who renewed their 40 - year - old marriage vows here Feb. 8 , enjoyed nearly lifelong membership in the Catholic Church .
They still love many facets of the faith , yet struggle with issues such as priest celibacy , the role of women in the church , the treatment of gays and papal authority .
“ We ’re still Catholic enough to want a Eucharistic experience , ” Charlie Girsch said .
“ The Wilderness preserves what we love about Catholicism .
I think we have found a safe harbor for wounded , roaming Catholics . ”
In Colorado , at least a couple dozen emergent churches , such as Scum of the Earth , Pathways and The Next Level Church , try to provide a niche for postmodern Christians .
The best guess for the number of national communities is several hundred .
The movement is hard to quantify because it is not at all institutional , although some congregations are affiliated with traditional denominations or given space at a church or megachurch .
“ We purposely do not track numbers , ” movement leader Tony Jones said .
“ That ’s one of the sins of the modern church — an emphasis on numeric growth over spiritual growth . ”
Jones , national coordinator of the Emergent Village online network , is not certain highly structured denominations , such as the Episcopal Church , can really offer an emergent community in the true sense of the movement .
“ You can start with some edgy worship , but you really have to push deeper than that , ” Jones said .
“ It ’s a mistake that ’ emergent ’ is about changing worship .
It ’s about changing the ethos of an entire church .
They do n’t really have the freedom to do that . ”
According to a 2008 survey by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life , 28 percent of American adults have left the faith in which they were raised in favor of another religion or no religion at all .
The primary beneficiaries of the fluid faithful have been evangelical churches , many nondenominational .
“ In the mainline denominations , ” Eaton said , “ we have always compared our church life to megachurches , asking , ‘ Why are n’t we growing like megachurches ? ’
“ We did n’t want to keep giving people more of the same , but we did n’t want to sell out to the evangelical culture of praise bands and auditoriums . ”
Besides losing members to evangelical churches , the Colorado Episcopal Diocese , which has about 30,000 members , has had at least 16 congregations either leave the diocese or form outside the diocese to affiliate instead with conservative Anglicans .
The number of Americans who said they attended church at least once a week was 39 percent in 2008 , Pew reported .
In 1970 , that figure was 38 percent .
Yet the number of people who seldom or never attend church has climbed sharply in the same four decades , from 12 percent to 27 percent .
Competition is stiff for these unaffiliated souls .
In a nation where denominational loyalty has been on the wane for decades , filling hearts and pews requires savvy market research and good salesmanship , wrote University of Florida advertising professor James Twitchell in the 2007 book “ Shopping for God : How Christianity Went From in Your Heart to in Your Face . ”
Wilderness founders do not express such a businesslike perspective , although they admit to doing market research by visiting emergent churches .
“ We were undercover Episcopalians , ” Wall said .
“ We checked out some of the more trendy churches . ”
But The Wilderness is not just good marketing ; it ’s good religion , Eaton said .
“ People are getting tired of a service that is all contemporary music and no theological depth , ” he said .
“ We look back , and we also look forward .
We understand the power of ritual .
We also want to be proclaiming the Gospel afresh in each generation . ”

Originally , due to an editing error , it incorrectly stated that attendance at the parish had been dwindling .
In fact , it is enrollment in the Episcopal Church at the national and diocesan level that has been declining .
Talk about timely .
We asked you this morning if gay sex stings are inherently homophobic and now , news is coming out of Dallas that Jermaine Donnell Jakes , the 29 year old son of T.D. Jakes of Potter ’s House , a homophobic megachurch pastor who has declared homosexuality “ brokenness ” and declared that he would never hire a sexually active gay person ” was arrested for publicly exposing himself to police officers in a a gay sex sting in Dallas ’ Kiest Park .
The Dallas Voice writes about the January 3rd arrest :
According to an arrest affidavit , the detectives were conducting an investigation into citizen complaints of sexual activity when they observed Jakes and several other unknown males park their vehicles in the lot east of the park at 2106 W. Kiest Blvd .
The detectives followed Jakes into a wooded area , where he approached them with his penis exposed through his unzipped pants , the affidavit states .
Jakes masturbated for several seconds while making eye contact with one of the detectives .
Jakes made no attempt to conceal his penis despite people walking and jogging on a trail nearby , the affidavit states .
According to court records , Jermaine Jakes listed his place of employment as T.D. Jakes Ministries .
Jakes was released at the scene after being detained .
T.D. Jakes is the founder of the Potters House , a 30,000 - member church in South Dallas .
A vocal opponent of same - sex marriage , he ’s been criticized by HIV / AIDS activists for undermining prevention of the disease by stigmatizing homosexuality and drug use .
On same - sex marriage , Jakes once told USA Today : “ To date , I have not seen scriptural authority that allows me to stand on behalf of God and say I now pronounce you husband and husband , and wife and wife .
This is an issue the government is undecided about .
The Bible is not . ”
Jermaine Jakes ’ attorney , Faith Johnson , issued a written statement this week .
“ We are aware of potential allegations involving Jermaine Jakes and are undertaking our own investigation of these allegations at this time , ” the statement said .
“ Given an apparent government investigation , we have no further comment at this time . ”

At least four top officials of Toronto 's SickKids Foundation have left the charity – including the highly paid president – creating a leadership gulf the agency says it hopes to fill as soon as possible .
Michael O'Mahoney , an American hired five years ago as president of the foundation – the fundraising arm of the Hospital for Sick Children – will attend divinity school to pursue his goal of becoming a deacon in the Roman Catholic Church , board chair Patsy Anderson said yesterday .
He will continue to live in Canada and stay on as a paid consultant of the foundation .
His exit follows that of at least three other senior officials who have left the charity in recent months .
" It would be a very real misrepresentation to say ( conditions at the foundation ) are chaotic , " Anderson said .
" ( O' Mahoney ) is a terrific guy .
We had a great run with Mike . "
Anderson said O'Mahoney doubled the size of the foundation 's revenues in his time at the helm .
A Star review of salaries at the foundation shows they have been growing steadily under O'Mahoney , with wages that are unusual in the Canadian charity world .
Its top 10 officials ( including the president ) earned more than $ 2.8 million in salary and benefits last year , according to the most recent information available .
The year before , the top 10 earned $ 2.2 million .
In the year ending March 31 , 2008 , O'Mahoney , 51 , was paid $ 624,103 in salary and benefits , more than the president of the Hospital for Sick Children itself .
Among the five vice - presidents of the foundation in that same year , one was paid more than $ 500,000 ; the others between $ 200,000 and $ 250,000 .
Another five executives listed as directors ( in such areas as marketing ) were paid between $ 124,000 and $ 160,000 .
Anderson defended the salaries , saying SickKids Foundation has a more " complex " business model than similar sized charities that pay executives far less .
The president of World Vision Canada , for example , earns a salary of roughly $ 175,000 .
Though thousands of volunteers , who are committed to helping sick children , raise money in schools , walkathons and other ventures , Anderson said the myriad of " business lines " the foundation executives manage requires them to hire an elite group of fundraising professionals to oversee the various programs .
Beyond senior executives , the foundation now has 85 employees making more than $ 50,000 , up from 33 at that level just two years before .
Anderson says the board has no plans to rein in salaries .
" Our philosophy is we hire for excellence in fundraising and marketing , " she said .
O'Mahoney did not respond to interview requests .
His last day on the job falls at the end of January .
Prior to joining SickKids , he had fundraising posts at charities in Washington and Philadelphia .
Usually , the only way for the public to obtain charity salaries is to ask the charity itself .
Most charities wo n't divulge this information .
( World Vision takes the position that donors deserve to know ) .

However , charities that do business in the United States must disclose salaries , and since SickKids falls into that category , the Star was able to obtain the information .
The figures in this story relating to SickKids Foundation salaries are in U.S. dollars .
Depending on when the money was paid , and given fluctuating currency rates , the amount in Canadian dollars will be higher or lower .
Anderson said O'Mahoney doubled the foundation 's donated revenue in his five years , from $ 45 million to just under $ 100 million in the most recent year .
But the Star found expenses are also increasing , and some of the paid fundraising initiatives deliver less than 50 cents on the dollar .
The foundation 's overall administration expenses soared to $ 6 million annually , three times what they were five years ago , according to statements filed with Canada 's charity regulator .
In addition to executive fundraisers , the charity uses a series of paid fundraising firms to conduct direct mail , street and other campaigns .
Last year , the foundation reported to the charity regulator that one campaign raised $ 8.3 million , but $ 4.7 million was retained by the professional fundraisers , meaning each donated dollar ended up as 44 cents .
In stories published in 2007 , the Star found that SickKids Foundation was using commission - based fundraisers .
O'Mahoney said he ordered the discredited technique , which the regulator does not approve of , but dropped it after the Star brought it to his attention .
Anderson said they have hired an executive search firm to find a replacement for O'Mahoney .
Others who have left include the vice - president of strategic communications and the vice - president of strategic partnerships .
O'Mahoney will be paid as a consultant to help the foundation grow its international strategy for fundraising , Anderson said .

Why do some people get lung cancer  even if they never smoke ?
New research suggests eating a lot of processed foods containing inorganic phosphates could be the explanation .
What 's more , the study also suggests that dietary changes to avoid these chemical additives may play an important role in lung cancer treatment .
In research just published in the January issue of , published by the American Thoracic Society , scientists from Seoul National University conclude that a diet high in inorganic phosphates , which are found in a host of processed foods including meats , cheeses , beverages , and bakery products , might spur the growth of lung cancer .
The researchers also suggest the food additive may contribute to the development of malignancies in people predisposed to lung cancer .
Myung - Haing Cho , D.V.M. , Ph.D. , and his colleagues studied mice with lung cancer tumors for four weeks .
The rodents were randomly assigned to eat a diet of either 0.5 or 1.0 percent phosphate , a range roughly equivalent to what 's found in most modern human diets that contain processed foods .
At the end of the study period , the animals ' lung tissues were analyzed to see what effects the inorganic phosphates had on tumors .
" Our results clearly demonstrated that the diet higher in inorganic phosphates caused an increase in the size of the tumors and stimulated growth of the tumors , " Dr. Cho said in a statement to the press .
" Our study indicates that increased intake of inorganic phosphates strongly stimulates lung cancer development in mice , and suggests that dietary regulation of inorganic phosphates may be critical for lung cancer treatment as well as prevention .
" According to the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) , lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer deaths worldwide .
The American Thoracic Society points out that over 75 percent of lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancers ( NSCLC ) and have an average overall 5 - year survival rate of only about 14 percent .
Previous research has shown that about 90 percent of NSCLC appear to be activated by specific signaling pathways in lung tissue .
The new study by Dr. Cho and his research team found that high amounts of dietary inorganic phosphates actually stimulate those same cancer - triggering pathways .
In a statement to the media , John Heffner , M.D. , past president of the American Thoracic Society , pointed out that this kind of research in animals can reveal the complex interactions between host factors and the environment that can result in human cancer .
" We know that only some patients who smoke develop lung cancer but the reasons for this varying risk are unknown .
This study now provides a rationale for funding case - control studies in humans to determine the potential role of dietary phosphates in promoting cancer , " Dr. Heffner stated .
While living organisms need a moderate level of phosphate , the use of inorganic phosphates as a food additive to increase water retention and improve food texture artificially has soared over the past decade .
That means the average American diet is loaded with excess amounts of phosphates .
" In the 1990s , phosphorous - containing food additives contributed an estimated 470 mg per day to the average daily adult diet .
However , phosphates are currently being added much more frequently to a large number of processed foods , including meats , cheeses , beverages , and bakery products .
As a result , depending on individual food choices , phosphorous intake could be increased by as much as 1000 mg per day , " Dr. Cho explained in the media statement .
"
The results of this study suggest that dietary regulation of inorganic phosphates has a place in lung cancer treatment , and our eventual goal is to collect sufficient information to accurately assess the risk of these phosphates , " he said .

When ‘ cond - it ’ expands and produces an ‘ if - it ’ expression , the ‘ if - it ’ is marked by the macro expander as coming from a macro .
That means its lexical context is different from the ‘ it ’ variables in the branches .
That means that the ‘ it ’ variable binding produced by ‘ if - it ’ does not capture the ‘ it ’ references in the branches .

On Tuesday , April 16 , approximately 700 indigenous representatives occupied the Brazilian House of Representatives in a last - ditch effort to stop the nomination process for the Special Committee on PEC 215 .
Indigenous peoples throughout the country consider the proposal to be a great threat to the security of their rights , because it would hand down from the federal government to the National Congress the authority to approve the demarcation of traditional lands and ratify areas that have already been approved .
In an attempt to stop the occupation , police forces used tasers on at least one person , injuring the Executive Secretary of CIMI , Cleber Buzatto .
The editor of CIMI ’s publication Porantim , Renato Santana , who photographed the demonstration , was also beaten by several police officers , had his glasses destroyed and was dragged into the Legislature ’s café .
According to CIMI , Buzatto and Santana both filed a complaint in the police station of the Legislative Chamber .
Several Indigenous delegates also reported being physically assaulted by the security guards of the House .
After standing their ground for approximately 50 minutes , the President of the House of Representatives , Henrique Alves , proposed an immediate meeting between the parliamentarians and indigenous leaders , prompting the movement to vacate the House .
A proposal soon followed in which the parliament would take no action whatever in relation to PEC 215 for a period of 45 days , however that was wholly rejected by the indigenous leaders .
Cacique Marcos Xukuru of Pernambuco , commented , “ They were in a position of giving a concrete decision for us .
The answer given is simply a ploy for us to return to our states and in 40 days make the nominations to compose the Special Committee . ”
As the day rolled on , 45 days turned into six months and a table for negotiations was added to discuss all existing legislative proposals and executive orders that threaten indigenous rights .
Under the new proposal , says CIMI , “ this negotiation group will be divided equally , that is , its formation will have the same number of parliamentarians ( of different titles , including those linked to the ‘ ruralista ’ caucus of agribusiness ) and of indigenous leaders . ”
Following the action , on the morning of April 17 , the group of indigenous delegates held a special assembly to assess the occupation and the actions that took place the day before .
All in all , the day was considered to be quite successful , even if the indigenous leaders had initially hoped to extinguish the committee altogether .
Saulo Feitosa , Adjunct Secretary of CIMI , commented ,
“ The evaluation was quite positive .
And the proposal made by Parliamentarians last night was considered an important step toward ensuring indigenous rights [… ]
“ We now need to know what the practical conditions are going to be , for example , on parity , the number of participants in this negotiation and those who [ are ] going to fund the return of indigenous leaders to Brasilia so that the conversation actually takes place . ”

As a rule , we may assume that any statute containing the word “ emergency ” in its title , preamble , or statement of purposes is a bad law .
If you want an apt example , consider the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 , which the president signed into law on Friday , October 3 , 2008 , soon after its approval by the House of Representatives .
Back in 1828 , opponents of the tariff bill enacted in that year felt such outrage that they dubbed the law the Tariff of Abominations .
With this precedent in mind , we might well refer to the bill just enacted as the Bailout of Abominations .
Only four days earlier , the House had decisively voted down a proposed bailout bill put forward by the administration and congressional leaders of both parties .
It seems that the people ’s denunciations of this bill had got their representatives ’ attention , at least for a day .
The flood of phone calls and e-mails to congressional offices was said to have run more than 90 percent in opposition to a financial bailout .
Never let it be said , however , that a bad bill ―a bill so egregious that even the general public sees through its flimflam ―ca n’t be made worse .
Sure enough , in the days after the bill ’s initial defeat , its managers took the monstrosity that had failed on Monday and made it even uglier .
Their purpose , of course , was to buy off the bill ’s opponents in Congress by sweetening it with all sorts of more or less unrelated provisions intended to channel benefits to the opponents ’ constituents and supporters .
In short , in Washington last week , business went on as usual : Congress is the name ; corruption is the game .
So , when this granddaddy of all bailouts was put up for a vote on Friday , many members of Congress suddenly realized how desperately the public interest required its passage , and it was passed by a wide margin .
In the future , when you want to use that famous quotation “ the public be damned , ” you can forget about citing William Vanderbilt and substitute the 110th Congress , which will go down in history as a gang that looked the people squarely in the eyes and said “ screw you . ”
On Tuesday , September 30 , the day after the first attempt to pass a bailout bill failed in the House , the Gallup Organization conducted a national opinion survey in which people were asked : “ What do you think Congress should do now ? ”
Of the 1,021 adult respondents , 14 percent selected “ not pass any bill addressing this matter , ” 57 percent selected “ start over and come up with a new plan , ” and 10 percent had no opinion .
Only 20 percent preferred that Congress “ pass a bill similar to the one that was defeated . ”
Democrats and Republicans in the poll expressed almost identical views on this matter .
Naturally , Congress quickly decided to do what only 20 percent of the people preferred .
In the two weeks from the bill ’s initial formulation to its ultimate enactment , it grew from three pages to 451 pages .
Such statutes are difficult to comprehend in any event , but this one is so extensive that one would have to spend a long time studying it in order to gain a full understanding of its provisions .
Certain things are clear , however .
First , the amount of money involved is huge : $ 700 billion for the purchase of private assets in the Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) .
Second , the discretion granted the secretary of the Treasury in his implementation of the statutory provisions is extraordinarily unrestrained .
The secretary has effectively been transformed into a financial czar with authority that would have made the old Soviet commissars pale with envy .
You can learn a great deal by pausing the read the definitions at the beginning of a statute .
Thus , in this case , Section 3 ( 9 ) states :
The term u2018u2018troubled assets ” means — ( A ) residential or commercial mortgages and any securities , obligations , or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages , that in each case was originated or issued on or before March 14 , 2008 , the purchase of which the Secretary determines promotes financial market stability ; and ( B ) any other financial instrument that the Secretary , after consultation with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , determines the purchase of which is necessary to promote financial market stability , but only upon transmittal of such determination , in writing , to the appropriate committees of Congress .
Forgive me if I read this passage to mean that under the TARP , the secretary may buy any financial asset whatsoever , regardless of whether it is a mortgage or a mortgage - related security , as signified by the words “ any other financial instrument . ”
And he may purchase the asset from any financial firm operating in the United States .
Which firms are eligible to participate in the bailout ?
Section 3 ( 5 ) tells us :
The term u2018u2018 financial institution ” means any institution , including , but not limited to , any bank , savings association , credit union , security broker or dealer , or insurance company , established and regulated under the laws of the United States or any State , territory , or possession of the United States , the District of Columbia , Commonwealth of Puerto Rico , Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands , Guam , American Samoa , or the United States Virgin Islands , and having significant operations in the United States , but excluding any central bank of , or institution owned by , a foreign government .
If the secretary can’t find all of his friends , relatives , former colleagues , and political co-conspirators among the managers and owners of this expansively defined class of firms , then he ’s not looking very hard .
Whoopee !
Hank Paulson ’s ship has finally come in , as no man ’s ship has ever come in before .
Now he really is the Master of the Universe .
Take heart , though , because Section 108 provides : “ The Secretary shall issue regulations or guidelines necessary to address and manage or to prohibit conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with the administration and execution of the authorities provided under this Act . ”
There ’ll be no Teapot Dome scandals here , my friends .
None at all .
After firms have been lined up to administer the TARP , Old Hank will be watching those contractors like a hawk .
Even if Paulson unexpectedly turns out to be as pure as driven snow , however , the amount of confusion that he has been empowered to inject into the world ’s financial markets defies comprehension .
With $ 700 billion to throw here , there , and everywhere , for good reason or no reason , with no real accountability and no bottom line ―if he ca n’t make himself the God of Chaos by exercising these powers , then nobody on this planet can create chaos .
The potential for malinvestments , general misallocation of resources , and sheer financial tomfoolery confounds the mind .
Not even the Archangel Gabriel deserves to have so much power placed at his disposal .
But not to worry .
The statute also provides for creation of a Financial Stability Oversight Board to oversee the secretary as he exercises his new authority .
And who , you ask , will compose this board ?
It will include the chairman of the Fed , the director of the Federal Home Finance Agency , the chairman of the SEC , the secretary of Housing and Urban Development , and ―mirabile dictu ―the Treasury secretary himself .
Bully .
If a man ca n’t effectively monitor himself , whom can he monitor ?
( Freudians will have a field day with this provision . )
Of course , we can count on Ben Bernanke and the other members of the oversight board to make certain that everything is on the up and up .
After all , the idea that a HUD secretary , an official widely recognized as the Sultan of Real - Estate Swindles , might compromise himself ―well , it ’s simply unthinkable .
Besides , the law also provides for more oversight and audits ( Section 116 ) , studies and reports ( Section 117 ) , judicial reviews ( Section 119 ) , special inspectors general ( Section 121 ) , congressional oversight ( Section 125 ) , terminations of authority ( Section 120 ) , and so forth than you can shake a stick at .
So we can be certain that the entire program will be cleaner than squeaky clean from its alpha to its omega .
How could politics possibly intrude ?
We all know , for example , that the Department of Defense , whose dealings are replete with the same sorts of oversight , inspections , reports , audits , and so forth , has never been known to engage in any shady deals or political skullduggery .
By the bye , the law also provides for raising the national debt ceiling from $ 10 trillion to $ 11.3 trillion .
That ’s okay , though , because many of us will be dead before the full weight of this enormous additional burden drops on the taxpayers .
As I always advise elderly farmers : “ Hell ’s bells , Farmer John , just eat the damned seed corn .
You ai n’t gonna live long enough to see next year ’s harvest anyhow . ”
As if we were n’t already more than enamored with this bailout legislation , Congress has taken pains to assure us that the whole business is a sure winner for us taxpayers .
Section 134 of the act states :
Upon the expiration of the 5 - year period beginning upon the date of the enactment of this Act , the Director of the Office of Management and Budget , in consultation with the Director of the Congressional Budget Office , shall submit a report to the Congress on the net amount within the Troubled Asset Relief Program under this Act .
In any case where there is a shortfall , the President shall submit a legislative proposal that recoups from the financial industry an amount equal to the shortfall in order to ensure that the Troubled Asset Relief Program does not add to the deficit or national debt .
So you see : this bailout wo n’t cost you a dime in the long run .
Unless , that is , the bankers and other looters have enough clout with Congress in five years to have this provision overturned .
But who can imagine that these ne ’er - do - wells will ever have that much influence ?
Moreover , to make sure that your interests are fully protected , the government will take an ownership position in every financial firm that sells “ troubled assets ” to the government under the TARP .
The act ’s Section 113 , engagingly titled “ Minimization of Long - Term Costs and Maximization of Benefits for Taxpayers , ” provides , subject to certain stated exceptions :
The Secretary may not purchase , or make any commitment to purchase , any troubled asset under the authority of this Act , unless the Secretary receives from the financial institution from which such assets are to be purchased — ( A ) in the case of a financial institution , the securities of which are traded on a national securities exchange , a warrant giving the right to the Secretary to receive nonvoting common stock or preferred stock in such financial institution , or voting stock with respect to which , the Secretary agrees not to exercise voting power , as the Secretary determines appropriate ; or ( B ) in the case of any financial institution other than one described in subparagraph ( A ) , a warrant for common or preferred stock , or a senior debt instrument from such financial institution .

Haskell ( even with the GHC extensions ) seems pretty stable , but the greater GHC platform seems pretty unstable .
I ’ve already written about how we ’re [ sorta ] missing a vital part of the tool chain ( it was broken when I tried to build it using 6.10 the other day ) , but in this post I ’ll focus on Haskell ’s libraries ( especially user generated ones ) .
After fairly heavy usage of Haskell over the past few months , I exit 2008 thinking that , while Haskell is a wonderful language , the library situation with GHC prevents GHC from being more heavily used .
Unless you ’re writing completely custom software , it can be very difficult to try a piece of Haskell software .
One of the reasons Rails is so successful is that it Just Installs and the tutorials are Just That Easy .
OTOH , when I start to install a new package in GHC , I never quite know what will happen .
Here are some problems I ’ve had with Haskell ’s libraries over the past few months / years along with possible fixes for those issues :
Hackage !=
Haskell Library Repository : Hackage does n’t necessarily contain the latest and greatest versions of a library .
For example , harp on Hackage is V0.2 , but harp on code.haskell.org is V0.4 .
This could most easily be fixed by automating the pulling of code from repos .
Since harp is located at code.haskell.org/hsp/harp , Hackage could automatically pull code and build packages from there .
The Hackage team has put together a great system .
It seems fair that they have T.O.S. which keeps Hackage usable and clean .
Part of the TOS would be that a package maintainer : keep the package up to date in Hackage ; respond to e-mails ; notify the Hackage team if the maintainer is abandoning the package .
6.10 ‘ base ’ Library Reorg : the base library reorg looks good , but it changes around a lot of the … er … basic libraries of the system .
Not sure of a fix here .
Seems like a nice reorg and if base were n’t reorged , I ’d probably be bitching about the need to reorg base …
Here ’s to hoping we do n’t go through another base reorg any time soon .
Bit-rotted Libraries : Libraries exist in Hackage which wo n’t build and which will probably never build .
For example , HaskellDB is an awe - inspiring library … that has n’t built since 6.6 and just is n’t going to build any time soon .
As a newbie looking for a database library , HaskellDB would be the obvious first place to look and trying to use it would produce serious frustration ( it certainly did for me ) .
It ’s nice to have a historical reference to HaskellDB in Hackage , but the package should n’t be listed as currently usable .
Maybe it ’d be sufficient to default to filtering by the latest GHC version .
Given
Don ’s post , it might not be too difficult to script weekly library builds and auto - email library maintainers about their library being broken .
After a few missed e-mails , the library could be shifted to another maintainer or , at worst , deprecated .
Gripe about git as much as you like , but GitHub has done a great job of building an environment for ‘ social coding ’ .
Using something like GitHub would make it easy to : allow those - who - want - to - work - on - a - library to do so ; move a package to a new library maintainer ; provide a consistent location from which Hackage could pull code .
FWIW , Rails has gone this direction …
Summary
Haskell is an awesome language .
I ’m a big fan ( as evinced by Turbinado ) .
Working with Haskell has forced me to think about coding in a new way and has seriously improved my coding ability .
However , Haskell has also proved enormously frustrating as I try to put together a project which depends on many libraries .
A great way to increase the visibility and usage of Haskell is to make it easy to develop and build complex software in Haskell .
Naturally , that requires a robust set of user libraries and that seems to require Hackage .
So let ’s make 2009 the Year of Hackage .
Updates
Over on reddit , Don suggests we make “ 2009 : the year distros start supporting the platform ” .
enauv replies that “ [ GHC is ] too radical and changes too quickly for platforms to truly support it . ”
I tend to agree with enauv , so much so that this post was originally titled “ 2009 : GHC 6.10 LTS ? ” because GHC ( the overall platform ) does tend to change too quickly for distros to support it effectively .
Maybe GHC needs to migrate GHC to Long Term Support and move bleeding edge stuff to GHC 7.0 ?

This post is written by a practicioner and not by an academic .
I understand that Haskell is an ‘ academic ’ language , but Haskell has gotten popular enough that it ’s no longer ‘ academic ’ and that ’s the greatest compliment a language could receive .

How am I going to solve the library dependency problem in Turbinado ?
I ’m going to bundle all libraries on which Turbinado depends into Turbinado .
Not a solution I like , but it ’s one that works …
Parents group Common Sense Media has issued a public warning against Grand Theft Auto IV expansion The Lost and Damned , decrying the game 's full - frontal nudity alongside the series ' trademark violence and profanity .
" The Lost and Damned is laden with mature content and should be kept away – far away – from children , " says the TLaD review found on the non -profit group 's website .
" It is even more controversial than its predecessors because this game has full frontal male nudity , " the description adds , referencing a cutscene found in the expansion .
Though the Common Sense Media site explicitly warns against the game 's violence and sexuality , the review avoids any hint of shrieking hysteria by admitting that the game is " a fun ride worth considering " for those not appalled by the mature content .
As an aside , it 's interesting that the group continually refers to TLaD 's nudity as " full - frontal male nudity . "
Perhaps they would have been less incensed had developer Rockstar Games opted to push the boundaries of virtual morality using a pretty girl instead of an oversexed , middle - aged gent .

While , for the average end user , spam has become less of a problem over recent years as spam filters get better at what they do and simply remove much of it from sight , that does n't mean that spam volumes are actually reducing .
In fact , the opposite is true and the actual amount of spam flowing through the Internet is still ridiculously high .
What 's more , the spammers are becoming increasingly adept at adapting to ongoing trends and exploiting them to get their often unsavoury message across .
According to the latest Internet Threats Trend Report for Q1 2010 to be published by Commtouch Labs , spammers are now well and truly using the familiar to inspire end user action .
Indeed , by using the most familiar of Internet names the spammers are able to give a deceptive legitimacy to billions of emails they send .
So , for example , you 'll find that between five and ten percent of all spam by volume would appear to have originated from some Gmail account or other .
That does not , however , mean that the same volume actually emanates from Gmail .
The message style of Gmail , along with Facebook and PayPal rather commonly , is copied and templated by the spammers , including those with both malware and phishing payloads , in an attempt to use familiarity to bypass human common sense and automated filtering alike .
By downplaying the more ' phishy ' elements of an email , and playing up the average Gmail message construction instead , spammers hope to evade detection until it is too late .
“ Spammers and cybercriminals use experimentation to reach their goals , ” said Asaf Greiner , Commtouch vice president , products .
“ They are always testing new techniques to lure their victims , from using familiar formats and domains to creating entirely new ways to entice action . ”
Commtouch ’s quarterly trend report is based on the analysis of more than two billion email messages as well as the GlobalView URL database within the company ’s cloud - based global detection and classification centres .
Reported global spam levels are based on Internet email traffic as measured from unfiltered data streams , not including internal corporate traffic .
Therefore global spam levels will differ from the quantities reaching end user inboxes , due to several possible layers of filtering .

SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) -
Along the mountainous spine of Vietnam grow ancient conifers whose tree rings tell of droughts lasting more than a generation that helped push civilizations toward collapse , a climate change conference heard on Tuesday .

Research by scientists from the United States and Japan has revealed a record of drought in Indochina that goes back more than 700 years by studying tree ring core samples from Fokienia hodginsii , a rare species that lives in Vietnam ’s cloud forests .
What the samples show are two lengthy droughts between the late 1300s early 1400s , around the time the vast and wealthy Angkor civilization in modern - day Cambodia collapsed .
“ There was a very significant multi-decadal drought in the early 1400s with the worst drought year being 1417 , ” said Brendan Buckley of the Tree Ring Laboratory at the Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory in the United States .
Another major drought lasting at least 30 years hit in the mid-18th century , said Buckley , speaking by telephone from the sidelines of the conference in Dalat , southern Vietnam , that is focusing on climate variability along the Mekong River basin .
“ All of the kingdoms in Southeast Asia collapsed , in Thailand , Vietnam and Laos between 1750 - 80 , ” he said .
Buckley teamed up with Masaki Sano and Tatsuo Sweda of Ehime University of Japan to study the tree rings of Fokienia .
The research is helping unravel the complexity of the annual monsoon that usually begins during March - May and on which millions rely to grow crops , particularly rice in the Mekong Delta .
It could also help understand how climate change could affect the densely populated region and its economies .
Buckley said the chronology constructed from the tree rings showed a strong correlation between dry spells and the El Nino weather pattern that typically brings drought to Southeast Asia and eastern Australia .
CAUSE A MYSTERY
But what caused the much longer periods of drought was a mystery , although it could possibly be linked to a recently discovered multi-decadal switch of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific .
Buckley said the chronology was built from cores from 36 conifer trees found in a national park near Dalat .
“ It ’s an amazing site , really , so it ’s a real breakthrough in tropical tree ring studies , ” he said , adding that a lot of the sites where the tree is found in Vietnam are being logged .
“ Fokienia is an exceptional tree species because of the way it grows and responds to drought , ” he said , adding the data was corroborated with a lot of historical records , such as ancient lanna palm leaf texts from Thailand and accounts of foreign merchants , plus tree - ring data from teak trees in Thailand .
“ What the Fokienia trees are most keenly tuned into is the length of the monsoon .
Longer the monsoon , the trees grow more . ”
Dan Penny , part of a separate project investigating the collapse of Angkor , said drought was likely to be have been one of many reasons for the collapse of the city , which covered about 1,000 square kilometers and was the most extensive of its kind .
“ There ’s no doubt that it was a contributory factor , ” he told Reuters from the conference .
Angkor was built around irrigation channels and was heavily focused on growing rice , he explained , but said evidence suggested the city was already in decline by the time the drought hit .
Buckley said the tree -ring data painted an awful scenario for the region , particularly the Mekong Delta , where sea levels are predicted to rise a meter or more in coming decades .
“ When you measure the sea level rises that have already taken place across the Mekong Delta , it ’s really scary , ” he said .
“ There ’s a real threat right there .
Picture that with a major drought that lasts 30 years in the area and you can imagine the kind of chaos that could easily lead to some significant turmoil and societal collapse . ”

All they want is your money and your personal information so that they can market to you .
The posts on Craigslist by young “ women ” seeking NSA sex , and asking for a picture are just a bunch of gay troll pic collectors .
This is especially true if the post uses common gay lexicon like “ hole ” as in “ fuck my hole ” or seeks “ masculine ” men , or uses the word cock ( except in the context of “ Do n’t send a cock shot . ” )

More women are accepted and attend college .
More degrees are awarded to women than men .
Women outlive men .
More men commit suicide .
Men are twice as likely to be victims of violence , including murder .
If you consider sexual assaults in prisons , twice as many men are raped as women ( society thinks prison rape is funny ) .

Statically , women are happier than men .
The myth that girls are being cheated by are educational system is belied by the fact that schools are bastions of femininity , mostly run by and taught by women .
Girls outperform boys in school .
It is the boys in school getting fucked over , and prescribed ritalin for being boys .

It ’s been a classic argument in the GNU / Linux VS Windows debates that people do n’t switch to the former because there are no games for it .
And there are no games for GNU / Linux because developers do n’t think there ’s a market for it to justify the cost .
And there ’s no market to justify the cost because gamers do n’t switch to it .
It ’s a vicious cycle from which it ’s extremely difficult to get out of .
To do that , it would need one side to do the first step .
Either gamers need to switch and start being vocal on wanting their games native for their OS ( ie platform agnostic ) or game developers need to show good faith and port or code their games for it from the get go and then see that the effort was worth it .
Well ,
To my delight ,
It seems that some developers did decide to attempt the later .
The lately popular World of Goo has finally been ported to GNU / Linux .
This is exciting news and the kind of thing that gamers on linux need to show support for if we want to provide incentive for this kind of thing to continue .
The developers at the moment are curious about the results of this move and I ’d like to think we wo n’t disappoint .
To tell the truth I have n’t played the game but I certainly have heard a lot about it .
It seems to involve very innovative gameplay and I was tempted to purchase it through steam .
One thing stopped me of course , which was the fact that I would have to boot my whole computer if I wanted to enjoy it .
This is , incidentally , something that happens quite often and affects my game purchase decisions .
I ’ve ended up only purchasing :
Games that are very cheap and I do n’t feel like wasting a lot of money
If I do n’t play them until the next time I happen to boot into windows
Games that I really , really , really want to play .
The ones that I ’ve known for months that I would be playing when they came out .
Needless to say those are few and far between .
Games that run natively on my OS of choice .
It goes without saying that I do not get much of those but when I do , I do n’t lose the chance to purchase them and thus have something to do play when bored without the annoying reboot .
Case in point : I ’ve already bough both the On the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness episodes and I will continue buying them in the future , because they are fun , cheap and most importantly , play natively .
The one thing that annoys me even more on this issue is how much resistance windows users display on this .
It ’s as if when game companies have a platform agnostic code then they are afraid that the performance on windows will drop .
I honestly do n’t know where this hostility comes from but it generally translates into mouthfuls of FUD and negativity on any kind of suggestion .
Incidentally very recently I had just such a discussion in a Demigod forum thread ( one of the games that I really really want to play ) .
The discussion started simply on the fact that Steam is and the Source engine are probably going to be ported to GNU / Linux and an appeal to Stardock and Impulse to do the same .
There were a lot of good suggestions and arguments on both sides and the very positive thing that Stardock devs actually took part and put forth their thoughts .
For example :
As a part - time linux user myself , I ’ve come to accept the fact that linux is not destined to be a gaming OS .
Until either developers abandon DirectX , or someone figures out a 100 % painless DX port for linux , you wo n’t see a big move on linux games .
Why ?
Because transitioning from a DX based engine to an OGL one is not in the least bit trivial .
iD can do it because I believe their games are done in OpenGL to begin with , so getting it to run on Linux is a much simpler task for them ( by comparison ) .
UnrealEngine is built for both DX and OGL .
To get developers porting games to linux , there has to be a guarantee on the return on investment .
If it takes 1 full time developer a year to port some game , then that game has to at least sell enough copies to cover the cost .
To make it actually worth the time though it would have to make a lot more money than the cost to develop , otherwise it ’s a better value to have that developer work on the Windows version which is a better financial bet .
The platform needs a few big - name champions to make it viable , but in a market where a big - name game can cost in the millions of dollars to develop , that ’s a risk not many companies are generally willing to take .
In the end of course , Stardock was n’t convinced .
I was nevertheless surprised at the amount of negativity displayed by simple users , occasionaly without any obvious reasoning other than that they did n’t like GNU / Linux .
One of my main arguments in this thread was that the GNU / Linux gaming market is severely under - estimated at every turn .
I truly believe that there are enough of us who not only are gamers but are willing to support those who extend a hand .
And now is the time to put our money where our mouths are .
Purchasing the World of Goo in non-trivial number will not only show its developers that it ’s worth coding their future games for our OS as well , but it will certainly turn the heads of other publishers if they smell that there is a potential market once the WoG guys speak about the ( hopefully positive ) results .
To get Games for Linux ( no TM yet ) we need to reach a tipping point , either on the side of Gamers which will convince the Publishers that there is a market , or on the side of Publishers which will allow enough gamers to try the OS out without much gaming withdrawal .
Lets hope that the results for the WoG experiment will be another small push towards that point .
Now go and read what Helios has to say about this .
You also get a nice interview with the developers about the challenges they faced on the port ( technical or not ) , as well as a little bonus offer 😉

A couple of Danish gamers indulging in some light PlayStation shoot - 'em - up action were on Saturday night treated to a visit by uniformed blokes carrying real guns after concerned neighbours called in the cops .
As far as we can make out from this report , two young men from Valby near Copenhagen were giving it some stick on a large flatscreen telly with the volume cranked up , prompting residents in their apartment block to suspect someone had been shot .
Cue rapid SWAT intervention , with the area sealed off and heavily - armed officers using megaphones to order the pair to surrender .
The two apparently came quietly , and suffered nothing more than a temporary cuffing while police ascertained that the only danger posed was to the neighbourhood 's peace and quiet .
John Hansen of Copenhagen police explained that officers never ignore a report of gunfire , even though many alerts turn out to be fireworks or other false alarms " as tonight 's incident demonstrates " . ®
Ancient city discovered deep in Amazonian rainforest linked to the legendary white - skinned Cloud People of Peru
A lost city discovered deep in the Amazon rainforest could unlock the secrets of a legendary tribe .
Little is known about the Cloud People of Peru , an ancient , white - skinned civilisation wiped out by disease and war in the 16th century .
But now archaeologists have uncovered a fortified citadel in a remote mountainous area of Peru known for its isolated natural beauty .
An ancient Chachapoyas village located close to the area where the lost city was found
It is thought this settlement may finally help historians unlock the secrets of the ' white warriors of the clouds ' .
The tribe had white skin and blonde hair - features which intrigue historians , as there is no known European ancestry in the region , where most inhabitants are darker skinned .
The citadel is tucked away in one of the most far - flung areas of the Amazon .
It sits at the edge of a chasm which the tribe may have used as a lookout to spy on enemies .
The area where the lost city was discovered by a team of archaeologists
The Chachapoyas , also called the Warriors of the Clouds , were an Andean people living in the cloud forests of the Amazonian region of present - day Peru
The main encampment is made up of circular stone houses overgrown by jungle over 12 acres , according to archaeologist Benedict Goicochea Perez .
Rock paintings cover some of the fortifications and next to the dwellings are platforms believed to have been used to grind seeds and plants for food and medicine .
The Cloud People once commanded a vast kingdom stretching across the Andes to the fringes of Peru 's northern Amazon jungle , before it was conquered by the Incas .
The city was found in Amazonian rainforest in northern Peru
A mummy of a baby from the Chachapoyas culture
Named because they lived in rainforests filled with cloud - like mist , the tribe later sided with the Spanish - colonialists to defeat the Incas .
But they were killed by epidemics of European diseases , such as measles and smallpox .
Much of their way of life , dating back to the ninth century , was also destroyed by pillaging , leaving little for archaeologists to examine .
Remains have been found before but scientists have high hopes of the latest find , made by an expedition to the Jamalca district in Peru's Utcubamba province , about 500 miles north - east of the capital , Lima .
Until recently , much of what was known about the lost civilisation was from Inca legends .
Even the name they called themselves is unknown .
The term Chachapoyas , or ' Cloud People ' , was given to them by the Incas .
Their culture is best known for the Kuellap fortress on the top of a mountain in Utcubamba , which can only be compared in scale to the Incas ' Machu Picchu retreat , built hundreds of years later .
Two years ago , archaeologists found an underground burial vault inside a cave with five mummies , two intact with skin and hair .
Chachapoyas chronicler Pedro Cieza de Leon wrote of the tribe : ' They are the whitest and most handsome of all the people that I have seen , and their wives were so beautiful that because of their gentleness , many of them deserved to be the Incas ' wives and to also be taken to the Sun Temple .
' The women and their husbands always dressed in woollen clothes and in their heads they wear their llautos [ a woollen turban ] , which are a sign they wear to be known everywhere . '
Secret civilisation : a map of the region where the settlement was found
The Chachapoyas ' territory was located in the northern regions of the Andes in present - day Peru .
It encompassed the triangular region formed by the confluence of the Maranon and Utcubamba rivers , in the zone of Bagua , up to the basin of the Abiseo river .
The Maranon 's size and the mountainous terrain meant the region was relatively isolated .
Three stone artifacts from a 13,000 - thousand - year - old Clovis - era cache unearthed recently in the city limits of Boulder , Colo . are shown by University of Colorado at Boulder anthropology Professor Douglas Bamforth and Boulder resident Patrick Mahaffy , who owns the property where the cache was found .
Two of the more than 80 implements in the cache were shown to have protein residue from now - extinct North American camels and horses .
Stone tools found in Boulder , Colorado were used to butcher camels and horses 13,000 years ago , before the beasts became extinct in the region .
A new biochemical analysis of a rare Clovis - era stone tools was done at the University of Colorado at Boulder .
It is the first study to identify protein residue from extinct camels on North American stone tools and only the second to identify horse protein residue on a Clovis - age tool , said CU - Boulder Anthropology Professor Douglas Bamforth , who led the work .
The Clovis culture is believed by many archaeologists to coincide with the time the first Americans arrived on the continent from Asia via the Bering Land Bridge , about 13,000 to 13,500 years ago , Bamforth said .
Other tools tested positive for sheep and bear protein residue .
Big American beasts
Dozens of species of North American mammals went extinct by the end of the Pleistocene , including American camels , American horses , woolly mammoth , saber - toothed cats , woolly rhinos and giant ground sloths .
While some scientists speculate ice - age mammals disappeared as a result of overhunting , climate change or even catastrophic comet impact , the reasons are still unresolved , in Bamforth view .
The Mahaffy Cache , named for the owner of the property on which it was found , consists of 83 stone implements ranging from salad plate - sized , elegantly crafted bifacial knives and a unique tool resembling a double - bitted axe to small blades and flint scraps .
Discovered in May 2008 by Brant Turney — head of a landscaping crew working on the Mahaffy property — the cache was unearthed with a shovel under about 18 inches of soil and was packed tightly into a hole about the size of a large shoebox .
It appeared to have been untouched for thousands of years , Bamforth said .
The site appears to be on the edge of an ancient drainage that ran northeast from Boulder 's foothills , said Bamforth .
Climatic evidence indicates the Boulder area was cooler and wetter in the late Pleistocene and receding glaciers would have been prominent along the Front Range of Colorado , he said .
" The idea that these Clovis - age tools essentially fell out of someone 's yard in Boulder is astonishing , " he said .
" But the evidence I 've seen gives me no reason to believe the cache has been disturbed since the items were placed there for storage about 13,000 years ago . "
All 83 artifacts were shipped to the anthropology Professor Robert Yohe of the Laboratory of Archaeological Science at California State , Bakersfield for protein residue tests that were funded by Mahaffy .
The protein residue on the artifacts was tested against various animal anti-sera , a procedure similar to standard allergy tests and which can narrow positive reactions down to specific mammalian families , but not to genera or species .
" I was somewhat surprised to find mammal protein residues on these tools , in part because we initially suspected that the Mahaffy Cache might be ritualistic rather than a utilitarian , " said anthropology Yohe said .
" There are so few Clovis - age tool caches that have been discovered that we really do n't know very much about them . "
About the people
The artifacts were buried in a coarse , sandy sediment overlain by dark , clay - like soil and appear to have been cached on the edge of an ancient stream .
" It looks like someone gathered together some of their most spectacular tools and other ordinary scraps of potentially useful material and stuck them all into a small hole in the ground , fully expecting to come back at a later date and retrieve them , " Bamforth said .
The type of people who buried the Mahaffy Cache " lived in small groups and forged relationships over large areas , " Bamforth figures .
" I 'm skeptical that they wandered widely , and they may have been bound together by a larger human network . "
A single individual could have easily carried all of the Mahaffy Cache tools a significant distance , he said .
One of the tools , a stunning , oval - shaped bifacial knife that had been sharpened all the way around , is almost exactly the same shape , size and width of an obsidian knife found in a Clovis cache known as the Fenn Cache from south of Yellowstone National Park , said Bamforth .
" Except for the raw material , they are almost identical , " he said .
" I would n't stake my reputation on it , but I could almost imagine the same person making both tools . "
" There is a magic to these artifacts , " said Mahaffy , the landowner .
" One of the things you do n't get from just looking at them is how incredible they feel in your hand -- they are almost ergonomically perfect and you can feel how they were used .
It is a wonderful connection to the people who shared this same land a long , long time ago . "
Mahaffy said the artifacts will likely wind up in a museum except for a few of the smaller pieces , which will be reburied at the cache site .
How Depressions Work
On Capitol Hill sit many powerful people — Congressmen , Senators , Justices — but also numerous others who do the daily work of keeping government running .
And , like anyone with such a weighty responsibility , they sometimes want a break : a chance to see a movie or eat out with their spouse .
Kids always make these things difficult , so in the late 1950s someone thought of starting a Capitol Hill Babysitting Coop .
The idea was simple : a bunch of families would get together and dole out scrip — little fake money — amongst themselves .
Anytime you wanted to go out , you could just hire another family in the coop to watch your kids : one piece of scrip per hour .
Later , of course , you ’d earn the money back by watching someone else ’s kids .
It was a brilliant system and much beloved , until sometime in the 1970s .
See , when people left the babysitting coop , they got to keep the balance of their scrip .
And so , over the years , the amount of scrip in circulation fell .
Soon scrip was in short supply and people begun hoarding theirs for fear of losing it forever .
There were few opportunities to babysit ( and thus earn scrip ) so people did n’t want to lose the scrip they had by paying it to a sitter .
Which , of course , meant even fewer babysitting opportunities , making more people want to hoard their scrip , and on and on in a downward spiral .
Since the coop consisted largely of lawmakers and lawyers , they attempted a legislative solution to the crisis , requiring everyone go out at least once every six months .
The proposal just made things worse .
Eventually , someone tried the idea of handing out more scrip to everyone , and soon , the coop ’s delicate balance was restored .
In the 2000s , house prices started rising and everyone started sinking their money into them .
Average people would buy houses and mortgage them , banks would buy mortgages , investors would buy mortgage derivatives from banks , and so on .
Pundits published books with titles like Why the Real Estate Boom Will Not Bust and many people just assumed housing prices would go up forever .
At the peak of it , we had roughly $ 80 trillion in global financial assets .
Of course , it was clear to anyone who looked closely that this could n’t go on forever — and that when it stopped , it would bring a lot down with it .
And , sure enough , today housing prices are almost back to their usual level and we now have only $ 60 trillion .
Just like people taking scrip out of the babysitting coop , an enormous amount of money has been taken out of the economy .
So naturally people want to hold on to what ’s left .
So they do n’t spend their money , which means there ’s less employment opportunities , which means more people want to hold on to their money , and on and on in a downward spiral .
Normally when this happens , as in a recession , the government has an easy solution : lower interest rates .
What happens is the country ’s leading bankers meet at the Federal Reserve and vote to lower interest rates .
Let ’s say they decide to lower them ( as they ’ve done a lot lately ) .
Then the Federal Reserve Bank in New York starts buying up Treasury Bills ( government IOUs ) for cash , injecting money into the economy .
This allows banks to lend out more money , lowering the interest rate at which money is lent out , and thus encouraging people to start spending again .
( Later , when the economy is doing well , they ’ll raise the rates again , pulling money out and making sure things do n’t get out of hand . )
But this is n’t simply a recession .
The Fed ’s lowered the interest rate to zero — zero !
they ’re giving money away — and unemployment just keeps rising .
Losing a quarter of global financial assets hurts .
But now the Fed has a problem : it ca n’t lower the interest rate anymore .
Interest rates do n’t go any lower than zero .
Which means , as J. M. Keynes foresaw back during the first Great Depression , we need another way of getting money into the economy .
This is n’t rocket science —
Keynes suggested stuffing bills into bottles and burying them down mineshafts ; Milton Friedman once proposed tossing cash out of helicopters .
But as long as the government is spending money , we might as well spend it on something useful .
And thus , fiscal stimulus .
We spend the money to build roads and trains and high - speed Internet connections .
We give away health care and hand out welfare checks and mail people tax rebates .
We do whatever it takes to get more money into the economy .
Which people then turn around and spend on all the things they normally start spending money on and the engine of capitalism once again start to turn .
Keynes ’ genius came in seeing that the Depression was n’t a moral problem .
We ’re not being punished for our exuberance or our stinginess , just as the folks on Capitol Hill were n’t at fault for not wanting to go out .
In both cases , the problem was n’t legislative , but merely technical : there just was n’t enough money to go around .
And the technical problem has a technical solution : print more money .
The moralists insist it ’s irresponsible for us to just print more money .
After all , they say , debt got us into this mess ; is more debt really going to get us out ?
This is what they told FDR , causing him to hit the break on a recovery that was pulling us out of the Great Depression .
This is what they told Japan , ending their recovery and plunging the country into a “ lost decade ” of unemployment .
It ’s not irresponsible to spend money ; it ’s irresponsible not to .
Factories are lying idle , people are sitting at home unemployed , and our economy is slowing .
We can spend money to make use of it all , or we can just continue downward spiral .
The choice is ours .

An intensive four - day program for children who 've been brainwashed by one parent into hating another is showing signs of success , with more than 80 per cent repairing their relationship with an alienated mother or father , according to new research presented by its lead clinician .
The results , made public yesterday and currently undergoing scientific peer review , show that 17 out of 21 children who have completed the program after being removed from the grip of a " toxic " parent forged good relationships with the other parent that continue more than two years later .
" I think part of it is the children are relieved ; they never really wanted to be soldiers in this war between their parents , " Richard Warshak , a University of Texas psychologist who runs the program , told lawyers attending the Ontario Bar Association 's annual conference yesterday .
Warshak 's work was cited last month in a Toronto judge 's ruling that stripped a mother of custody of her three daughters after the woman spent more than a decade trying to poison them against their father .
Now in custody of their father , a vascular surgeon , the girls , ages 9 to 14 , were expected to fly to Texas to take part in Warshak 's program .
The mother was ordered to pick up the tab .
Warshak wo n't say how much the program costs but does call it " expensive " – equal to 1 1/ 2 to two years of conventional therapy .
The program was established in the early 1990s at the request of the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children .
The goal at first was to reunite abducted children with their families but the program now focuses on helping " severely alienated children " adjust to court orders requiring them to live with a parent they 've been taught to reject or fear .
Through videos and workshops , two therapists help children understand how it 's possible to develop unrealistically negative views of other people , Warshak said .
Although 130 children have completed the program , Warshak 's research looked only at the 11 families he has treated himself .
Seven of the alienated parents were mothers ; four were fathers .
Warshak said the program gives children a " face - saving " way to reconnect with parents .
" We do n't require them to apologize for past behaviour or admit they were really mean . "

Among them is Peter Jaffe , a psychologist in London , Ont. , who has labelled the program " quackery . "

AP : Obama budget moves toward universal healthcare Associated Press
Published : Thursday February 26 , 2009
Print This Email This WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is sending Congress a " hard choices " budget that would boost taxes on the wealthy and curtail Medicare payments to insurance companies and hospitals to make way for a $ 634 billion down payment on universal health care .
Obama 's first budget , which will top $ 3 trillion , predicts the deficit for this year will soar to a whopping $ 1.75 trillion , according to administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity before the public unveiling of the budget Thursday .
The huge deficit reflects the massive spending being undertaken to battle a severe recession and the worst financial crisis in seven decades .
As part of the effort to end the financial crisis , the administration will propose boosting the deficit by an additional $ 250 billion this year , enough to support as much as $ 750 billion in increased spending under the government 's financial rescue program .
That would more than double the $ 700 billion bailout effort passed by Congress last October .
Obama , in a morning briefing , spoke of " hard choices that lie ahead . "
He called his budget " an honest accounting of where we are and where we intend to go . "
One administration official called the request for additional bailout resources a " placeholder " in advance of a determination by the Treasury Department of what will actually be needed .
The spending blueprint Obama is sending Congress is a 140 - page outline , with the complete details scheduled to come in mid to late April , when the new administration sends up the massive budget books that will flesh out the plan .
However , the submission of the bare budget outline was certain to set off fierce debate in Congress over Obama 's spending and tax priorities .
The document includes additional requests for the current year and Obama 's proposals for the 2010 budget year , which begins Oct. 1 .
The budget balances efforts to fulfill Obama 's campaign pledges to deliver tax cuts to the middle class , expand health care coverage and combat the economic crisis with an effort to keep an exploding deficit over the next few years from becoming a permanent drag on the economy .
However , Republicans assailed the budget for the tax increases and some Democrats worried that Obama was not doing enough to get the deficit under control .
" I would give him good marks as a beginning , but we have to do a lot more to take on this long - term debt buildup , " said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad , D - N.D .
Republicans zeroed in on the tax increases to fund half of Obama 's health care expansion .
" Everyone agrees that all Americans deserve access to affordable health care , but is increasing taxes during an economic recession , especially on small businesses , the right way to accomplish that goal ? " asked House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio .
The $ 634 billion down payment on expanding health care coverage would come from a $ 318 billion increase over 10 years in taxes on the wealthy , defined as couples making more than $ 250,000 per year and individuals making more than $ 200,000 .
The tax increase would occur by reducing the benefit the wealthy get on tax deductions .
As one example , taxpayers in the current top tax bracket of 35 percent would see their tax deduction for every $ 1 given to charity drop from 35 cents to 28 cents .
The other half of the down payment on Obama 's drive toward universal health care â $ 318 billion â would come from curtailing payments to hospitals and insurance companies under Medicare and drug payments under Medicaid .
To meet his pledge of tax cuts for the middle class , the president wants to make permanent the $ 400 annual tax cut due to start showing up in workers ' paychecks in April as part of the $ 787 billion stimulus package just passed by Congress .
Obama 's budget also extends the middle class tax cuts passed by the Bush administration in 2001 and 2003 .
Those cuts were due to expire at the end of 2010 .
If Congress approves Obama 's recommendations , the Bush tax cuts would only expire for couples making more than $ 250,000 per year .
The cost of the stimulus bill and the increased bailout support would push the deficit for this year to $ 1.75 trillion , a level â as a percentage of the economy â not seen since World War II .
The deficit is expected to remain around $ 1 trillion for the next two years before starting to decline to $ 533 billion in 2013 , according to budget projections .
Obama 's plan proposes achieving $ 634 billion in savings on projected health care spending and diverting those resources to expanding coverage for uninsured Americans .
The $ 634 billion represents a little more than half the money that would be needed to extend health insurance to all of the 48 million Americans now uninsured .
Americans now spend a total of $ 2.4 trillion a year on health care .
Obama also will ask for an additional $ 75 billion to cover the costs of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through September , the end of the current budget year .
That would be on top of the $ 40 billion already appropriated by Congress , the administration official said .
The administration will also ask for $ 130 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan in 2010 and will budget the costs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan at $ 50 billion annually over the next several years .
Obama 's budget proposal would effectively raise income taxes and curb tax deductions on couples making more than $ 250,000 a year , beginning in 2011 .
By not extending former President George W. Bush 's tax cuts for such wealthier filers , Obama would allow the marginal rate on household incomes above $ 250,000 to rise from 35 percent to 39.6 percent .
The plan also contains a contentious proposal to raise hundreds of billions of dollars by auctioning off permits to exceed carbon emissions caps , which Obama wants to impose on users of fossil fuels to address global warming .
Some of the revenues from the pollution permits would be used to extend the " Making Work Pay " tax credit of $ 400 for individuals and $ 800 for couples beyond 2010 , as provided in the just - passed economic stimulus bill .
About half of what officials characterized as a $ 634 billion " down payment " toward health care coverage for every American would come from cuts in Medicare .
That is sure to incite battles with doctors , hospitals , health insurance companies and drug manufacturers .
Some of the Medicare savings would come from scaling back payments to private insurance plans that serve older Americans , which many analysts believe to be inflated .
Other proposals include charging upper - income beneficiaries a higher premium for Medicare 's prescription drug coverage .
To raise the other half , Obama wants to reduce the rate by which wealthier people can cut their taxes through deductions for mortgage interest , charitable contributions , local taxes and other expenses to 28 cents on the dollar , rather than the 35 cents they can claim now .
Even more money would be raised if the top rate reverts to 39.6 percent , as Obama wants .
Sen . Max Baucus , D - Mont. , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , called Obama 's proposal to tax the wealthy to finance health care reform a starting point .
But he wants to also examine taxing some of health insurance benefits provided by employers â an idea rejected by Obama in last year 's presidential campaign .
Budget documents provided to The Associated Press show that Obama will not lay out a detailed blueprint for a health care overhaul , but a set of broad policy principles and some specific ideas for how to raise a big chunk of the money .
Obama 's promise to phase out direct payments to farming operations with revenues above $ 500,000 a year is sure to cause concerns among rural Democrats .
Even after all those difficult choices , cutting about $ 2 trillion from the budget over 10 years , Obama 's budget still would feature huge deficits .
The $ 1.75 trillion deficit projected for this year would represent 12.3 percent of the gross domestic product , double the previous post - war record of 6 percent in 1983 , when Ronald Reagan was president , and the highest level since the deficit totaled 21.5 percent of GDP in 1945 , at the end of World War II .
At $ 533 billion , the deficit in 2013 will be about 3 percent of the size of the economy , a level that administration officials said would be manageable .

Whatever its other legacies , the Bush administration will be remembered for its contemptible disregard for the law in the post - 9/11 war on terrorism .
From the wiretapping of Americans without a court order to the waterboarding of suspected terrorists to the refusal to abide by the requirements of the Geneva Convention , many of the administration ’s policies can fairly be described as lawless .
But were they also criminal ?
Should officials , including Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld , be put on trial , either in a court of law or in a forum like South Africa ’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission ?
As the Bush administration nears its end , calls for such a reckoning are coming from civil libertarians and some supporters of President - elect Barack Obama .
Some even argue that President Bush should be indicted .
This editorial page has been uncompromising in its criticism of the Bush administration ’s flouting of international and domestic law .
The administration was wrong to evade courts in seeking warrantless surveillance of Americans , wrong to establish the Guantanamo Bay detention center , heinous in its acceptance of torture .
But we are wary of either the criminal prosecution of administration officials or some South - Africa - style process .
The former model is reminiscent of the Watergate scandal , in which several officials -- including President Nixon -- broke identifiable criminal statutes by obstructing the investigation of a burglary motivated by partisan politics .
From there , of course , Watergate expanded into a web of criminal violations , from break - ins to the use of the IRS to punish political enemies of the Nixon White House .
It ’s conceivable that individuals in the Bush administration violated criminal law .
But if they did so as part of a post - 9/11 response to terrorism , it would be all but impossible to prosecute them successfully .
Besides , the scandal of the Bush administration was n’t a matter of individual , politically motivated violations of law .
Rather , it was a systemic failure to take seriously the spirit as well as the letter of this country ’s commitment to the humane treatment of prisoners or the privacy rights of Americans secured by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA .
That ’s a failure in which Congress must share culpability with the administration .
It was the administration that , with the help of compliant legal counsel , rationalized the use of “ enhanced ” interrogation techniques such as waterboarding , sleep deprivation , humiliation and the use of dogs to intimidate prisoners of war and suspected terrorists .
But , as the vice president argued recently , Congress at first either acquiesced in , or offered muted objections to , the administration ’s policies .
That the failures were collective rather than individual makes them no less appalling , but it does suggest that a criminal prosecution will not remedy them .
Likewise , it was the administration that arrogated to itself the power to create a bargain - basement judicial system to try detainees at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , a policy that fortunately was nullified by the U.S. Supreme Court .
But it was Congress , once it took responsibility for establishing procedures for military commissions , that voted to strip from detainees the right to challenge their confinement by seeking the ancient writ of habeas corpus .
Here too it was left to the Supreme Court to uphold timeless principles of justice .
These lapses , however , tell only part of the story .
This country ’s system of checks and balances -- which we would define broadly to include a free press -- responded , albeit belatedly , to some of the administration ’s excesses .
This is why the analogy to the apartheid regime in South Africa is fatally flawed .
In enacting anti-torture provisions in the 2005 Detainee Treatment Act , Congress seemed to have ended waterboarding , though it wrongly perpetuated a double standard under which the CIA could use harsher interrogation methods than the armed services .
After the New York Times exposed the National Security Agency ’s secret surveillance program , Congress passed a new version of FISA that , while imperfect , reined in spying on Americans and increased judicial oversight .
Those actions may not have gone far enough , but they suggest a system of accountability , however imperfect .
Even within the Bush administration , political appointees such as former Atty .
Gen. John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III pushed back against the administration ’s most blatant attempts to circumvent the law .
Support for the rule of law also came from courageous Justice Department lawyers such as Jack Goldsmith , who rescinded a torture - friendly legal opinion supplied by a predecessor .
The Bush administration ’s lawlessness calls for a serious reckoning , one that already has begun with a scathing report by the Senate Armed Services Committee about the role played by Rumsfeld and other officials in the spread of abusive interrogation techniques .
That ’s welcome and appropriate -- and a vindication of American institutions designed to investigate the misconduct of public officials .
Further congressional investigation of the administration ’s spying program is also in order .
But as enticing as many find the idea of putting Rumsfeld or Cheney in the dock , neither a show trial nor a truth commission would be the right way to expunge or atone for the abuses of this administration .
Thankfully , those who sanctioned them will soon be history .

My father was a child of the Great Depression .
Born in Newark , New Jersey , in 1921 to Italian immigrant parents , he experienced the economic crisis head - on .
He took a job working in an eyeglass factory in the city ’s Ironbound section in 1934 , at age 13 , combining his wages with those of his father , mother , and six siblings to make a single - family income .
When I was growing up , he spoke often of his memories of breadlines , tent cities , and government - issued clothing .
At Christmas , he would tell my brother and me how his parents , unable to afford new toys , had wrapped the same toy steam shovel , year after year , and placed it for him under the tree .
In my extended family , my uncles occupied a pecking order based on who had grown up in the roughest economic circumstances .
My Uncle Walter , who went on to earn a master ’s degree in chemical engineering and eventually became a senior executive at Colgate - Palmolive , came out on top — not because of his academic or career achievements , but because he grew up with the hardest lot .

My father ’s experiences were broadly shared throughout the country .
Although times were perhaps worst in the declining rural areas of the Dust Bowl , every region suffered , and the residents of small towns and big cities alike breathed in the same uncertainty and distress .
The Great Depression was a national crisis — and in many ways a nationalizing event .
The entire country , it seemed , tuned in to President Roosevelt ’s fireside chats .
The current economic crisis is unlikely to result in the same kind of shared experience .
To be sure , the economic contraction is causing pain just about everywhere .
In October , less than a month after the financial markets began to melt down , Moody ’s Economy.com * published an assessment of recent economic activity within 381 U.S. metropolitan areas .
Three hundred and two were already in deep recession , and 64 more were at risk .
Only 15 areas were still expanding .
Notable among them were the oil - and natural - resource - rich regions of Texas and Oklahoma , buoyed by energy prices that have since fallen ; and the Greater Washington , D.C. , region , where government bailouts , the nationalization of financial companies , and fiscal expansion are creating work for lawyers , lobbyists , political scientists , and government contractors .

CEOs , Bankers Used Corporate Credit Cards for Sex , Says New York Madam Wall Street exposed as convicted escort boss reveals client list of 9,800 .
February 6 , 2009  --
Wall street lawyers , investment bankers , CEOs and media executives often used corporate credit cards to pay for $ 2,000 an hour prostitutes , according to the madam who ran one of New York 's biggest and most expensive escort services until it was busted last year .
But prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney 's office chose not to pursue any of the corporate titans , says Kristin Davis , who pleaded guilty last year to charges of running a prostitution business that used more than a hundred women .
" They showed no interest , " said Davis in an interview for broadcast Friday on the ABC News program 20/20 .
" Some of these guys , I was invoicing on corporate credit cards , " she said .
" I was writing up monthly bills for computer consulting , construction expenses , all of these things , I was invoicing them monthly so they could get it by their accountants , " Davis said .
A spokesperson said district attorney Robert Morgenthau had " no comment " on the handling of Davis ' case or her allegations .
Davis provided ABC
News with a print - out of her computerized client list , the same one she says that was offered to the district attorney .
The document shows Davis kept meticulous notes about her clients , their credit card numbers and mobile phone numbers .

The Clients
Among the names ABC News was able to confirm on the list :
a vice president of NBC Universal
the part owner of a Major League Baseball team who " loves Kelsey "
the CEO of one of the country 's largest private equity firms who met " Cameron " at the Peninsula Hotel
a major New York real estate developer who , according to the list , " will come to the door wearing women 's panties , " and who spent nearly $ 100,000
a partner at the Wall Street law firm Cravath Swaine Moore " looking for a party girl to come fully equipped " and spent a total of $ 20,000
an investment banker from Lehman Brothers who saw " Kelsey and Keely together " and later saw " Aria and Skyler at the same time "
an investment banker at JP Morgan Securities who " loves Brooke " and spent $ 41,600
an investment banker at Goldman Sachs who " only wanted all - American girls " and spent $ 27,000
a managing director from Merrill Lynch who saw " Lana " using the name " Nataly "
a managing director from Deutsche Bank " who called about seeing Nataly again "
A spokesman for JP Morgan said the company is looking into the matter .
Manhattan Madam Says Clients Had Payments Disguised
Some of the men contacted by ABC News denied they used their corporate cards , and ABC News could not independently confirm if the credit card numbers listed were corporate accounts .
Watch the story tonight on 20/20 at 10 p.m. ET
Davis says one CEO ordered her to send him invoices for " roof repair on a warehouse " to disguise the payment for prostitutes from corporate funds .
" That is fraud , " said former New York prosecutor Sid Baumgarten , who told 20 / 20 the district attorney should have investigated the men .
" Not necessarily just for the patronizing but for the use of these business records and credit cards to see what kind of fraud or tax fraud was being used .
And if so , that is a major offense , " Baumgarten said .
When ABC News contacted that CEO , he said he used his corporate card to pay for the escort service to entertain clients , but that there was no sex involved .
Brought Down After Revelation of Client #
9
Davis operated her escort service as a prostitution conglomerate , with five different " brands " over a four year period , each with its own " price point " and websites .
At the high end was an escort service called Carlyle Trust , mimicking the name , but not connected in any way , to a prestigious investment firm .
Davis said she recruited top fashion models who charged up to $ 2,000 an hour for clients of Carlyle Trust .
Her lower cost services charged $ 400 an hour for a " body rub , " she said .
The " best little whorehouse on Wall Street " was located just a few blocks from the New York Stock Exchange , in apartment 3A at 136 William Street .
Davis operated three other " in-call " locations in the mid-town area of Manhattan .
The escort business took in as much as $ 200,000 a week , Davis estimated .
But it came to a screeching halt last year in the crackdown that followed the revelation that then - New York Governor Eliot Spitzer was client # 9 of a rival escort service .
In a book to be released Feb. 6 , " Manhattan Madam , " Davis claims Spitzer had earlier been a client of her service but was banned because of his aggressive behavior trying to get girls to have unprotected sex with him .
Manhattan psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert , who works with many Wall Street clients , told ABC News that many of his clients who patronize escort services are accustomed to high risks and high stakes on the job , and seeing a prostitute , especially if one is married , provides the same rush .
" You 're playing with fire ... it's part of the culture of Wall Street .
A lot of drugs , cocaine use , fast times , sex - - it 's part of the culture . "
Alpert said people also use adult sexual service as a way to cope with stress in much the same way that one may use alcohol or drugs .
" It 's a way to escape , " said Alpert , adding that " A lot of clients I see tell me they simply want someone to speak to , someone to listen to them . "
Treatment Not Fair , Madam Says
In a plea arrangement , Davis pleaded guilty to promoting prostitution and was sentenced to three - months time served .
She forfeited about $ 500,000 in profits as part of the deal , according to court documents .

" I , as the proprietor of a business get arrested and lose everything , when no one that was frequenting my business , spending $ 200,000 , $ 300,000 a year , has been punished in any way or even looked into . "
Patricia Pileggi , a defense attorney who has represented a Madam , said that targeting the Madam and not the clients does nothing to deter prostitution .
" The DA 's office has some ability to prosecute the clients , " said Pileggi .
" If there 's a real interest in deterring this kind of conduct you do n't simply target the Madam , you make an effort to target the clients as well . "
Pileggi added that there is a provision for the different degrees of culpability in the NY statutes : " [ Davis ] was prosecuted for a felony and the clients would be guilty of misdemeanors . "
She says she has not yet decided whether to release the full client list to the public .

Tuesday 's strikes came on the 11th day of an Israeli military offensive in Gaza .
Israel says the offensive is aimed at stopping Hamas from firing rockets into southern Israel .
The Israel Defense Forces said a mortar - firing operation and a pair of prominent Hamas operatives -- Imad Abu Askhar and Hassan Abu Askhar -- were at the occupied school hit Tuesday .
The two were among the Hamas militants killed in the strike , an IDF statement said .
" This is not the first time that Hamas terrorists have used Palestinian civilians as human shields and has exploited their deaths for the benefit of the international media , " an Israeli statement read .
" Israel will continue to treat as valuable the lives of all Palestinian civilians and refuses to devalue the lives of Gaza residents in the manner of Hamas . "

An embassy building is an ambassador for the country it represents .
Ideally it should be gracious , well mannered and welcoming .
It should offer something of the culture of its home country while nodding appreciatively to that of its host .
It need not be old - fashioned , but nor should it attempt to be " cool " .
Passing fads are just that .
What embassy architecture really should n't be , is like the new US embassy in Baghdad .
Opened this week , this monster of a modern fortress designed by Berger Devine Yaeger , has been described by at least one US commentator as the " imperial mother ship dropping into Baghdad . "
It could , I suppose , be seen as a latter - day , Wild East - version of a 7th Cavalry fort , with the Iraqis playing the role of Native Americans .
Whatever it might be in our imaginations , it spells " undiplomatic " in the kind of rough and ready capital letters found stencilled on to the side of tanks , armoured cars and military trucks .
And given that this vast compound – 10 times bigger than the UN complex in Manhattan and comprising over 20 buildings – has been built for the most part by humbly - paid " guest " workers from Bangladesh , the Philippines and elsewhere , it looks and feels like the work of a regime battling for first place with the galactic empire itself .
The Baghdad embassy is a very long way indeed , in time , space and political culture from the US embassies of the 1950s and 60s .
Designed at the height of the cold war , these were nevertheless fine , civilised buildings by modern architects .
Walter Gropius , founding director of the Bauhaus school of architecture , designed the US embassy all light and grace in Athens ; Richard Neutra , best known for his glamorous modern houses on the Californian coast , was responsible for the US consulate in Karachi ; Eero Saarinen , of JFK airport 's TWA - terminal fame , shaped the controversial and soon - to - be - replaced US embassy in London ; while John Johansen designed the dramatic US embassy in Dublin .
The east African embassy bombings of 1998 and the infamous events of September 11 encouraged the US to rebuild its embassies and consulates as castles .
While other countries have had to think hard , too , about terrorism , there have been alternatives to the 21st - century 7th Cavalry look .
Take the new British embassy in Sana'a , by Design Engine Architects .
Set in the Yemeni highlands against the stunning backdrop of the Jebel Nuqum and Jebel Aiban mountains , it is a brave attempt to shape a building that is secure , good to look at and that , while clearly of our times , nods intelligently to local design traditions and the powerful , mud-coloured landscape it hunkers down on .
This thoughtful British building is , however , quietly upstaged by the particularly fine Royal Netherlands embassy in Addis Ababa .
Designed by Dick van Gameren and Bjarne Mastenbroek , it has been dug into the earth like the famous Ethiopian rock churches at Lalibela .
Its rough - hewn , reddish concrete walls are at once part - and - parcel of the landscape and powerful modern architecture in their own right .
The roof , modelled on an abstraction of the Dutch polder landscape , has watercourses helping to keep the building cool while delighting the wandering eye .
Here is a building designed to be secure and yet as far in terms of character from the new US embassy in Baghdad as Addis Ababa itself is from Amsterdam .
Many of the best new embassy buildings fit into their host cities happily while offering something a little different to local design .
Two contrasting examples from the 1970s show how this has been done .
Arne Jacobsen 's Royal Danish embassy in London 's Sloane Street [ 1977 ] is a highly popular design if the capital 's annual Open House weekend is anything to go by .
Here is a showcase of some of the best of late 20th - century Danish design and an institution that , as yet , feels no need to abandon central London in favour of a fortified campus in the suburbs ( as the new US embassy in London will be when complete somewhere between 2012 and 2016 ) .
Basil Spence 's British embassy in Rome , is a second example of how to build in a slightly exotic - yet diplomatic - fashion in a great foreign city .
As the debonair Spence told the Daily Mail , " I have as a neighbour on this site , a building by Michelangelo , setting an embarrassingly high standard for any architect to meet . "
The embassy , is a thing of well - crafted travertine , oak and yellow marble , raised on " piloti " [ modern concrete columns ] .
With its rooms and corridors shaded from the Roman sun , it remains a powerful yet sensitive work by an underrated British architect .
Perhaps , though , the most intriguing embassies of all are those shoehorned into existing buildings .
Who today would ever guess that the Nazi German embassy in London was housed at 8 - 9 Carlton House Terrace , an elegant building by John Nash , today home to the Royal Society ?
Ultimately , though , as both the German experience in the 1940s and British - American involvement in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East prove , foreign policy and intelligent diplomacy count , in the long term , for more than guns .
The world is unlikely to be one , in which people of all classes , creeds , colours and gun calibres dance to music at charming embassy balls .
Even so , the new US embassy in Iraq , and its future sibling in London , look like one thing , and one thing only : the architecture of failed diplomacy .
Large lobsters are usually too big to get caught in traps A lobster believed to be some 140 years old is to be freed from the confines of a tank at a New York restaurant .
George the giant lobster , weighing 9kg ( 20 lb ) , will be returned to the ocean , from where he was caught two weeks ago .
The crustacean was bought for $ 100 ( £ 66 ) by the City Crab and Seafood and quickly adopted as its mascot , posing for pictures with restaurant patrons .
But animal rights group Peta sought the lobster 's release , and will now put it back into the waters off Maine .
It will enter the ocean in the waters around Kennebunkport , where lobster trapping is banned .
George was originally caught off Newfoundland , Canada , and has spent about 10 days in the tank at City Crab and Seafood .
These intriguing animals do n't deserve to be confined to tiny tanks or boiled alive
Ingrid Newkirk
Peta
The approximate age of a lobster can be deduced from its weight .
Restaurant manager Keith Valenti said there was never any intent to harm the lobster , and the decision to keep it in the tank was made to offer customers a little something extra .
" We bought a big lobster , started taking pictures with kids and it worked out real well , " Mr Valenti told Reuters news agency .
But it was a " no brainer " , he added , to agree to the request to return George to the ocean .
" We never intended him to be sold , just draw attention to the restaurant , and he did . "
Ingrid Newkirk , of Peta ( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ) praised the decision .
" We applaud the folks at City Crab and Seafood for their compassionate decision to allow this noble old - timer to live out his days in freedom and peace .
" We hope that their kind gesture serves as an example that these intriguing animals do n't deserve to be confined to tiny tanks or boiled alive . "

Marijuana use appears to have decreased among most European and North American adolescents between 2002 and 2006 , and those who went out with friends on fewer evenings of the week were less likely to report using the drug , according to a report in the February issue of Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine , one of the JAMA / Archives journals .
" Cannabis [ marijuana ] use among young people is a serious public health concern , " the authors write as background information in the article .
Recent evidence links marijuana use to motor vehicle accidents , injuries , inflammatory and cancerous changes in the airways and mental health problems , including depression .
Long - term detrimental effects include poor academic performance and failure to complete schooling , impeding development and hampering future career opportunities .
" One factor that may help explain why adolescents engage in cannabis use is association with cannabis - using peers , which can increase the availability of cannabis and socially influence use , " the authors write .
To investigate this link and also trends in marijuana use over time , Emmanuel Kuntsche , Ph.D. , of the Swiss Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and Drugs Problems , Lausanne , and colleagues analyzed data from 93,297 15 - year - old students who participated in the Health Behavior in School - Aged Children study .
Participants in 31 countries ( mostly in Europe and North America ) were surveyed in 2002 and again in 2006 about marijuana use and the number of evenings per week they usually spend out with their friends , among other topics .
During the four - year study period , marijuana use decreased in most of the countries , with the most significant declines in England , Portugal , Switzerland , Slovenia and Canada .
Increases were observed in Estonia , Lithuania , and Malta and among Russian girls .
The number of evenings out with friends also declined in most countries during the same time period , although there was a wide range in averages , from about one evening per week for Portuguese girls to more than three evenings per week among boys and girls in the Ukraine , Russia , Scotland , Estonia and Spain .
" The more frequently adolescents reported going out with their friends in the evenings , the more likely they were to report using cannabis , " the authors write .
" This link was consistent for boys and girls and across survey years .
Across countries , changes in the mean [ average ] frequency of evenings spent out were strongly linked to changes in cannabis use . "
Besides a decline in evenings out with friends , potential reasons for the decline in marijuana use include prevention efforts , availability or changes in teen preferences .
It is more difficult to pinpoint factors behind the decline in evenings out , the authors note .
New forms of communication , such as e-mail and text messaging , may have replaced some face - to - face interactions , or that the high rate of marijuana use in 2002 may have increased parental concerns about substance use and made access to the drug and evenings out more difficult .

" This overview of trends in 31 countries and regions provides policy makers with important information on the prevalence and amount of change in cannabis use among boys and girls in their countries , " the authors write .
" There is a great need to learn more about the nature of evenings out with friends and related factors that might explain changes in adolescent cannabis use over time .
Because there are many benefits to adolescent social interaction , it is important to determine how best to foster it without unduly increasing exposure opportunities for cannabis use . "
This study was supported by the Swiss Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and Drug Problems and a grant from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health .
Editorial : Reducing Social Time for Teens Not an Ideal Prevention Method
" What we have gained from this well - designed international study is further convincing evidence that unsupervised social time is a critical ingredient for cannabis use for many young people , " write John E. Schulenberg , Ph.D. , and Patrick M. O'Malley , Ph.D. , of the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , in an accompanying editorial .
" This might lead some to suggest a simple intervention of reducing unsupervised time with friends by , for example , increasing structured time with friends , increasing school and work time or increasing alone time , " the authors write .
" However , this strategy may have unintended consequences for many adolescents .
An important part of adolescence is exploring and forming friendships , having bonding experiences and finding a safe haven with friends away from adult supervision . "
" Thus , rather than trying to reduce socializing with friends , a more complicated but possibly more successful approach to intervention would help young people find activities together that do not promote marijuana use , " they conclude .

FLOTUS duds get backlash
FLOTUS 's inaugural outfits sent designers to their drafting tables to design knockoffs and droves went to J.Crew to get those snazzy leather green gloves .
But not everyone is happy with her choices .
The Black Artists Association is chiding FLOTUS for not choosing any African - American designers .
They will send a letter to FLOTUS 's office and appeal to her to include items from black designers in her wardrobe .
BAA Cofounder Amnau Eele , who was a former runway model told Women 's Wear Daily :

" It 's fine and good if you want to be all ' Kumbaya ' and ' We Are the World ' by representing all different countries .
But if you are going to have Isabel Toledo do the inauguration dress , and Jason
Wu do the evening gown , why not have Kevan Hall , B Michael , Stephen Burrows or any of the other black designers do something too ? "
Wu did n't find out Michelle O. was wearing his dress until he saw her on television Tuesday night .
And aides said FLOTUS did n't even decide until hours before her big night .

The cause of the blaze at the 40 - story Mandarin Oriental is not known and there were no reports of injuries , according to CNN staff members who were at the scene .
The fire began about 9 p.m. and continued to burn an hour later .
A plume of flames shot from the top of the structure as the fire quickly spread .
i Reporter Jean de Villeneuve lives about 200 yards ( 200 meters ) from the fire and said she watched it for about an hour before firefighters got it under control .
De Villeneuve , who is originally from France , said she was surprised at how close spectators were allowed to get before authorities established a perimeter .
" I looked and saw the huge tower full of fire , and there were hundreds of Chinese down near my apartment taking pictures , " she said .
" If this had been the United States , you would think a perimeter would be secured , but there was nothing like that . "
Watch flames devour the hotel »
De Villeneuve said she and others were able to get within 60 yards of the fire .
The state - run Xinhua news agency reported that more than 1,000 people in the area were evacuated , " traffic controls were imposed " on a major highway and authorities temporarily stopped subway service on a line serving the area .
" Snow - like ashes fell as far as [ half a mile ] from the building and smoke eclipsed the full moon , " Xinhua reported of the blaze in the capital 's central business district .

i Reporter Fred Rice , a British national who lives in Beijing , said " the top of the building was exploding . "
" We were n't sure if it was gas canisters or what .
It was a spectacular sight for sure , " he said .
i Reporter Stephen Chaytor said he was walking home from work when he saw the fire .
Watch the hotel burn »
" It was spreading incredibly fast .
It was obvious that there was a lot of debris on site -- that debris ignited very quickly , " Chaytor said .
" Fire took control of building [ and ] within less than 13 minutes , it went from small flames to being totally engulfed in flames . "
He said a crowd of onlookers gathered around the scene , as well as fire and emergency crews who worked to control the blaze .
" There was a quiet concern for people that may be involved , working in the building or close to construction site , " he said .
iReport.com : Are you there ?
The fire reached past the 30th floor , but did not spread to any adjacent buildings .
The hotel is next to a newly constructed tower for China Central Television ( CCTV ) , but no one has moved into that building either .
The blaze erupted in the final hours of the Chinese Lunar New Year celebration as people set off fireworks across the city .
Xinhua reported that Beijing residents were supposed to stop selling and lighting fireworks by midnight .
iReporter de Villeneuve said she suspects many people in the city were trying to use whatever remaining fireworks they had before the deadline .
" We have been seeing fireworks for the past two weeks .
I have to say this is quite a surprise , " she said .
iReport.com : Eyewitnesses worried ' building might topple '
i Reporter Rice said he was watching fireworks nearby when he noticed that fireworks were being set off near the buildings .
" Then we looked closer and saw the flames come from the top of the building , " Rice said .
" Soon became apparent that the building was on fire . "
The modern , angular building was a sign of Beijing 's recent transformation and modernization .
It had been scheduled to open late last year , but the opening was postponed until this year , though most of the building had been constructed .
According to its Web site , the Mandarin Oriental - Beijing is the flagship property in China for the Mandarin Oriental hotel chain .
The tower stands more than 500 feet high and contains 241 rooms , Xinhua reported .

Just follow these useful tips to organize an unforgettable trip .
Create a Budget Before a Trip
First of all , it ’s necessary to consider all possible expenses and costs to expect during the trip .
Just add up all of them and compare the final price with your current financial situation .
In case if this kind of vacation is too expensive for you , you ’re always welcome to choose an appropriate funding option .
The best way to cover all your South Africa travel expenses is to get a vacation loan .
The most important thing to consider is that such type of loan is a form of debt .
This means it could impact your finances .
That ’s why it ’s necessary to understand the conditions and terms before the final agreement .
Besides the vacation loan no credit check , there are a lot of options , such as using rewards points , credit cards , or personal loans for last - minute vacations .
In most cases , lenders do n’t require a hard credit check and provide you with the fastest process of getting the funds you need for your journey .
Think of Accommodation
The prices of accommodation depend on the city you ’re going to stay in .
For example , a one - bedroom apartment in Oranjezicht will cost about $ 40 per person .
Such apartments usually have a decent kitchen that lets you avoid costly expenses on visiting cafes and restaurants and save money by cooking your own meal .
Consider that the most significant spending of the trip to South Africa is going to be the safari .
But no worries – there are multiple various options for a South African safari .
You ’re welcome to choose between high - cost luxury lodges to budget public campsites .
For example , a night in Naledi Bushcamp , located in the Kruger area , will cost you about $ 202 .
Despite the fact it ’s quite an expensive place to stay in even for a night , the price includes all the meals and different activities to choose from .
Otherwise , a night in a budget campsite will cost you no more than $ 50 .
So , if you are a fan of luxury lifestyle even during journeys , then it ’s better to pay more for a comfortable place .
Find a Better Way of Transportation
Honestly , each South African town is easy to get around .
So , you do n’t need to take a taxi or bus and consider walking instead of it .
But if you still prefer getting a taxi or renting a car , then expect to spend about $ 25 for a ride .
Fortunately , Uber is indeed cheap .
You ’ll pay no more than $ 10 in total for three shortish rides around such a city as Cape Town .
You are also welcome to take a sightseeing bus to go to different places , whose price is about $ 19 for a one - way ticket .
Just for the record , most tourists choose this option of getting around more than any other way .
In case if you want to travel between various towns , you ’re able to take an overnight train .
It will cost you approximately $ 215 , including all meals .
And be sure that you ’ll be provided with as much food as you ’re able to eat .
One of the cheapest tickets you ’ll be able to acquire when traveling to Pietermaritzburg .
The capital of KwaZulu - Natal is the home of Gandhi and the Comrades Marathon , as it ’s the starting point of the annual race .
Try Different Activities
When traveling to South Africa on a budget , you can consider yourself a lucky one – you ’ve chosen the right place to have a good time with no much money in your pocket .
Most of the activities in the country are free .
You might always consider walking along the coast , making a romantic evening with your partner at the V&A Waterfront , staring and examining an exceptional Cape Dutch architecture instead of visiting night clubs and spending a lot of money at a bar .
Fortunately for foreign culture and history amateurs , most museums are free as well .
Even if it ’s not , it will cost you not more than $ 1.50 .
For such nature lovers as a famous South African naturalist Eugene Marais , it ’s better to visit the astonishing Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens and pay only $ 4 for the entry or go to Kruger National Park .
Just for the record , this park is considered one of the largest game reserves in Africa .
If the weather is good , you should definitely visit Cape Town ’s biggest attractions – the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway and take the boat trip to Robben Island .
The standard price of these activities is estimated at $ 40 .
So , it ’s totally affordable for you if you ’re bound to a small budget .
You ’re also welcome to take private wine tours to Franschhoek and Stellenbosch ( including wine tastings ) , self - guided road trips to Cape Point , and the Chapman ’s Peak Drive , etc .
Eat and Drink for Cheap
In South Africa , you ’re able to have fantastic and inexpensive meals at the same time .
It ’s better to choose one or two meals to be cooked on your own and make one meal a lunch out .
Regardless of your requirements and eating habits , you might spend about $ 80 in case if you ’re going to visit some food shops and a local wine store .
A simple lunch out in a local café will cost you from $ 14 to $ 30 , depending on the extent of your hunger .
When going out for some cocktails , make sure you have not less than $ 30 .
It ’s possible that you ’ll spend about $ 25 passing by such places as Camps Bay and Sea Point and buying some delicious and unusual drinks .
Get Closer to the Mysteries of Africa
Africa possesses a lot of fascinating ancient places that are still little explored and embraced by mystery .
There are plenty of ancient artifacts and hidden traces of gone vast kingdoms across all the continent .
And South Africa is n’t an exemption .
The mystery of The Lydenburg Heads – these terracotta masks are considered as the earliest and unique sculptures found in South Africa .
The masks are officially dated back to 500 AD and have been found by a young boy who collected them from pieces .
The Lost Ancient City in The Kalahari Desert – a sizeable sandy savannah extends more than 900 thousand square kilometers , covering Botswana , Namibia , and South Africa .
People believe the ruins of ancient cities , built by an ancient civilization , lie right beneath the Kalahari Desert sands .
Bottom Line
If South Africa is already included in your wish list of the ultimate travel destinations , but you ’re on a tight budget at the same time , give preference to visiting this country as a matter of priority .
It will let you get the “ traveling ball rolling ” .
And also , it will help you understand that sometimes a journey can be fulfilled even on the lowest budget .

The DEA has rejected yet another petition seeking to remove marijuana from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ) , this one from Iowa - based marijuana reformer Carl Olsen .
It is only the latest petition rejection by the agency in a glacially - paced struggle to reschedule marijuana that has been going on since 1972 .
marijuana plants
But Olsen and other advocates of the rescheduling tactic say that is to be expected , and the rejection is only the opening phase of this particular battle , not the end of the line .
And while Olsen heads to federal court to challenge the DEA ruling , another petition to reschedule marijuana is still in process , as it has been for the past six years .
Richard Nixon was just beginning his second term in office when the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) filed the first rescheduling petition .
It took 22 years and numerous court challenges before the DEA finally rejected that petition .
In the meantime , the DEA rescheduled marijuana 's primary psychoactive ingredient , THC , as a Schedule II drug in 1985 and loosened controls over THC even further by rescheduling it to Schedule III in 1999 .
That allows doctors to prescribe Marinol , but not marijuana .
Another rescheduling petition , filed by Olsen in 1992 , was rejected years later , as was a 1995 petition submitted by former NORML head , researcher , and professor of public policy Jon Gettman .
In 2002 , Gettman , in association with a long list of supporters , submitted yet another Cannabis Rescheduling Petition , which remains pending .
Under the CSA , he argues , substances must meet several criteria to be placed in Schedule I , the most restrictive schedule .
The substance must have a high potential for abuse , it must have " no currently accepted medical use " in the US , and there must be a lack of accepted safety for use of the substance .
Both the Olsen petition that was rejected last month ( although the decision was not published until this week ) and the pending Gettman petition argue that marijuana no longer qualifies to be placed in Schedule I because it does have " currently accepted medical use " in the US , citing in particular the ever - growing number of states that have legalized its medicinal use .
But the two petitions differ in the way they seek to remedy the situation , and it is this difference that accounts for the vastly different pace at which they have been handled by the DEA .
While the Gettman petition is still awaiting a ruling six years after it was filed , Olsen 's petition was only filed this year .
The Gettman petition seeks to reschedule marijuana through the administrative process , the Olsen petition argues that the issue is a matter of statutory law .
Under the CSA , if marijuana is found to have " currently accepted medical use , " it can not be Schedule I .
" I filed in May , filed a federal lawsuit in September , and got a ruling December , " said Olsen .
" The DEA has never moved that fast on a petition in its history , and by denying the petition , it is avoiding the possibility of having to deal with it again because now it will instead go back to the court of appeals . "
Olsen 's petition was not a request , but a demand that DEA recognize the reality that marijuana cannot be a Schedule I drug , he said .
" I did n't ask for anything ; I demanded that they comply with the law .
It 's not a Schedule I drug , and they are breaking the law by keeping it there , " he said .
" The statute says it can't be a Schedule I drug if it has accepted medical use , and 13 states say it has accepted medical use .
Does n't that mean anything ? "
Not according to the DEA it does n't .
" Your petition and notice rest on your contention that federal drug law gives states the authority to determine , for purposes of the CSA , whether a drug has a ' currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States , ' and that marijuana has such a currently accepted medical use because 12 states have passed laws relating to the use of marijuana for medical purposes , " wrote DEA Deputy Administrator Michele Leonhart in denying the petition .
Leonhart cited the Raich medical marijuana case in arguing that marijuana has no " accepted medical use " because the federal government does n't recognize it , and even quoted from the decision : " The Supremacy Clause unambiguously provides that if there is any conflict between federal and state law , federal law shall prevail , " and " Congress expressly found that [ marijuana ] has no acceptable medical uses . "
Leonhart also quickly disposed of additional arguments presented by Olsen , summarizing her position by finding that " the existence of state legislation is not relevant to a scheduling determination . "
Thus , " there is no statutory basis for DEA to grant your petition to initiate proceedings to reschedule marijuana .
Nor is there any basis to initiate any action based on your August 5th notice .
The Petitioner 's request is denied . "
Now , it will be up to the federal courts to decide who is right .
" The court has to rule on my complaint to enjoin the DEA from enforcing Schedule I , " said Olsen .
" If they rule in my favor , the DEA cannot claim it is a Schedule I drug ; it will have to remove it from Schedule I . "
In either case , the losing side will appeal .
Look for a resolution of the Olsen case some time in the not - so - near future .
That 's just how Olsen planned it , said Gettman .
" I was n't surprised at the DEA decision , and I do n't think Carl was either , " he said .
" The whole point of his petition was to get this into federal court , and to do that , he had to be rejected administratively .
This is really the beginning of Carl 's legal challenge rather than the end . "
Gettman credited Olsen with breaking new ground with the petition and even for inspiring Gettman himself to get involved with rescheduling .
" Carl 's arguments greatly clarify and build on state - level recognition of medical use , and set the stage for greater attention to this matter , " he said .
" And I have to say that Carl 's activity and pioneering efforts are one of the things that inspired me to file the 1995 petition in the first place . "
Meanwhile , Gettman 's petition is still pending , although it has already moved through several stages of a lengthy bureaucratic process involving the DEA , the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food & Drug Administration ( FDA ) .
" The last time we got a status report from FDA , they were nearing the end of their review , " Gettman reported .
He is no hurry right now , he said .
" We have deliberately decided not to pressure the government to complete the review .
We would prefer to deal with the next administration instead of the current one , " he explained .
" Regardless of how the election turned out , we would have new personnel overseeing the process , and we think a fresh perspective would be beneficial . "
Even if the FDA were to come down with a favorable review , there are many steps between that and actually rescheduling marijuana , and even then , the fight over marijuana will still be underway , said Gettman .
" Rescheduling will not make medical marijuana available right away and it is not the end of deciding marijuana 's regulatory status , it 's the beginning , " he said .
" But it would change the regulatory environment and make it easier for states to accelerate the pace of reform , as well as make it easier for human studies to get under way and for companies to develop marijuana as a medical substance .
Schedule I status discourages companies from doing that . "
NORML founder Keith Stroup , who was in on the original 1972 rescheduling effort applauds Gettman 's and Olsen 's efforts , but said he has lost faith in ever gaining redress through that process .
" I just do n't believe anymore that the rulemaking process is ever going to work in our favor , " he said .
" We 've been trying since 1973 , and I think we 're going to have to win this the old - fashioned way , through the legislative process or voter initiatives .
I just do n't think the people in those agencies have the principled courage to do the right thing , " Stroup added .
" Still , I 'm pleased that Carl and Jon continue to pursue these avenues , " he said .
" It 's to our advantage to put pressure on the system wherever we can . "

The weak pound makes it more expensive to travel abroad Concerns about the UK banking sector have further undermined the pound , with the currency sliding below $ 1.40 .
Sterling also hit a record low against the Japanese currency at 127.47 yen .
Against the dollar , it reached $ 1.386 , its lowest level since 2001 .
Some analysts suggested a fresh bail - out for the banking industry had prompted a sell - off of the pound .
And record losses at Royal Bank of Scotland had shaken the UK 's financial infrastructure , another said .
RBS shares fell 11 % , having plunged 67 % on Monday after the bank had predicted further losses .
Other banks also suffered with Lloyds TSB closing down by 31 % on Tuesday , with Barclays shares 17 % lower .
The prediction by RBS that it would see Britain 's biggest ever corporate loss was " shattering news " said David Buik of BGC Partners .
" [ It ] shook the rafters of the City of London as well as the UK's entire financial infrastructure " , he said .
UK risk
The government 's second attempt to bolster the UK's banking sector included an insurance scheme to cover bad debts held by banks and a £ 50bn fund to allow the Bank of England to lend money directly to businesses .
Investors fear that the cost of the banking bail - out could weaken the UK 's national finances and hurt sterling - which has fallen sharply since last summer , when a pound was worth $ 2 . POUND STERLING v UNITED STATES DOLLAR : 20 January 2009 * All Times GMT
Unusually , markets now rate the debt from some blue - chip companies as better risks than UK government debt .
" Investors are concerned about the cost of the government [ bail - out ] measures and the implications they might have , with escalating borrowing and the possible doubling of Britain 's debt ratio , " said Neil Mackinnon , chief economist at ECU Group .
" There is mounting market talk that Britain 's credit rating will be downgraded , " he added .
There 's a link between the perceived weakness of the banks and a fall in sterling
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert 's blog " There is no doubt that long - term investors see a risk in our UK government debt , more risk than the likes of BP and Unilever , " Max King , a market strategist at Investec told BBC News .
However , analysts at Barclays said that the actions the government were taking could help support the pound in the longer term .
" Over the medium term , the more proactive stance by UK authorities , especially relative to the euro area , should be positive for the UK economy and sterling , " Barclays said .
The pound weakened against the euro , with one euro worth 92.3 pence - undoing much of its recent gains against the currency .

Начальная рублевая стоимость корзины валют определена на уровне 960 белорусских рублей , что соответствует величине образующих ее двусторонних обменных курсов .
После объявления вечером 1 января нового курса белорусского рубля 2 и 3 января жител и Белоруссии потратили на стояние в очередях в магазинах .
В тех магазинах , где не было переоценки и которые не были закрыты , народ толпится возле импортных холодильников , стиральных машин и бытовых товаров .
" Вчера и позавчера тут было столпотворение !
За день мы продавали почти по полсотни холодильников .
В среднем на одном холодильнике люди смогли сэкономить 200 долларов " , - сказал РИА Новости продавец одного Минского ГУМа .
По ее словам , люди скупали все - электрические чайники , СВЧ - печи , пылесосы , утюги .
Покупатели толпились практически во всех отделах ГУМа .
Нешуточный ажиотаж на бытовую технику наблюдался и еще в одном крупном столичном магазине - в Торговом доме " На Немиге " , где во многие отделы даже пришлось выделить дополнительных продавцов-консультантов .
" Справиться с таким потоком людей очень сложно .
Мы не успеваем всех обслужить .
Сметают все иностранные холодильники и стиральные машины , а на отечественные товары вообще никто не смотрит " , - сказала старший продавец магазина .
Колебания курса белорусского рубля по отношению к каждой из валют ( доллар , евро и российский рубль ) будут происходить за счет взаимных изменений этих иностранных валют , обещает пресс - служба Национального банка Белоруссии .

" Международный валютный фонд рекомендова л Национальному банку снизить курс белорусского рубля , но от них не было рекомендаций по тактике , тактику нам никто не навязывал .
Мы самостоятельно выбрали сценарий одномоментного снижения курса " , - сказал представитель Нацбанка Анатолий Дроздов .
Дроздов сообщил , что " юридическ и решение о снижении курса нацвалюты было принято правление м
Нацбанка по согласованию с президентом Белоруссии " .
По его словам " ускорени я инфляционны х процессов в связи с резко проведенным снижением курса белорусского рубля , так как для роста инфляции у нас нет внутренних причин , а с другой стороны мы наблюдаем снижение цен на импорт - нефть , металлы , готовую продукцию и так далее " .
В связи с этим " пока прогноз по инфляции на 2009 год 9 - 11 % за год мы не пересматриваем " , сказал представитель Нацбанка Белоруссии .
При этом он напомнил , что с 8 января 2009 года ставка рефинансирования по решени ю
Нацбанка увеличена до 14 % с 12 % годовых при прогнозе к концу 2009 года 10 - 12 % годовых .
" Ставка рефинансирования будет зависеть от инфляции " , - сказал он .

" В первый день торгов нового 2009 года на белорусской валютно - фондовой бирже курс белорусского рубля по отношению к корзине иностранных валют , состоящий из доллара , евро и российского рубля , укрепился на 0,55 % с 960 белорусских рублей до 954,75 белорусских рублей " , - отмечалось в пресс - релизе Нацбанка Белоруссии .
Spore Patch v1.01 Released
The update is said to fix some bugs , address some community complaints , and implement a few new cheat codes in the recently released evolution simulator .
It is not yet known if this patch provides the promised DRM loosening .
The complete patch notes follow :
Meet Hoover and Sawyer , the two tawny frogmouth chicks hatched just last month at SeaWorld , Orlando .
Often confused with owls , the tawny frogmouth is weaker and , frankly , lazier than most owls and is native to Australia , Tasmania and New Guinea .
Well camouflaged , tawny frogmouths are so named because of their ridiculously wide beaks , already readily apparent on tiny Hoover and Sawyer .
ORLANDO , FL ( FEB 18 , 2009 ) -- BIRDS OF A FEATHER GROW UP TOGETHER -- Already showing the large , frog - like mouths that give the species its name , Hoover ( L ) and Sawyer ( R ) are tawny frogmouth chicks that were hatched at SeaWorld Orlando last month .
Until recently , the population of tawny frogmouths in North American zoos was facing extinction and breeding programs were largely unsuccessful .
SeaWorld worked with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to develop a breeding program to help sustain the species ' growth .
And , the program is showing early success -- in less than a year , six chicks have been hatched and all are now thriving at the park .
Frogmouths are native to the forested savannas and open woodlands of Australia .
When fully grown , the insect - eating birds will be between 9 and 21 inches tall .

Fawning host and panel angrily proclaim end of Nader ’s career , imply Nader is a racist , for failing to worship president elect
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , November 5 , 2008
A Fox News host and his panel angrily proclaimed that Ralph Nader ’s career was finished after the Independent Party candidate dared to criticize Barack Obama ’s record of toadying up to corporate interests , as top liberal websites applauded Fox News for their aggressive defense of the president elect .
The corporate media ’s frightening obsession with maintaining Obama ’s messianic complex now apparently extends to the so - called “ right - wing ” Fox News , who have eagerly picked up the baton and are right behind the mindless fervor of Obamamania – acting in lock step with the establishment left .
In the interview with Nader aired last night , Fox host Shepard Smith feigned phony righteousness in his reaction to Nader ’s assertion that Obama could prove to be an “ Uncle Tom ” for the corporations rather than an “ Uncle Sam ” for the people .
Smith ’s fake indignation , including a theatrical long pause before moronically remarking “ really … .
Ralph Nader …. what was that ? ” looked about as genuine as a three dollar bill but was deliciously hilarious in its irony .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ Uncle Tom ” is a is a pejorative for a black person who is perceived by others as behaving in a subservient manner to White American authority figures , or as seeking ingratiation with them by way of unnecessary accommodation .
“ It ’s very simple – he has gone along with corporate power from the moment he entered politics in the state senate , voted for the Wall Street bailout , supports an expanded military budget that is desired by the military - industrial complex , ” said Nader , adding that Obama had toadied up to global corporations who had hijacked America with no allegiance to the country .
Smith was essentially implying that Nader , perhaps unsurpassed as America ’s foremost advocate for minorities and black people , was a racist because he dared to question the cult status of Obama .
Nader stood up to Smith ’s smear tactics and said he would not be bullied , which left the host open - mouthed .
One of Smith ’s panel , with similar phony indignation , commented , “ That was the end of his career right there , that ’s it , there ’s no way that anybody gonna take him seriously after that , it ’s just so offensive . ”
What ’s even more gut - wrenching is that the establishment liberal left website , Crooks and Liars , applauded Fox News for taking Nader to task , writing “ Good on Shepard Smith ” .
That ’s right – the fatuously hypocritical liberal left , after eight years of railing against Fox News for its Bush worship , is now applauding Fox News for its smears against Nader because Nader had the temerity not to immediately bow down and worship the new messiah .
I guess it ’s all just a dose of the new “ change ” that we ’ve been told to expect – Fox News and the establishment left in alliance smearing people as racists for criticizing our new great leader – Barack “ The Messiah ” Obama – and pointing him out for what he is – a corporate shill and a servant of the elite .

Congress of South African Trade Unions and Palestine Solidarity Committee ( South Africa )
[ See http://links.org.au/node/888 for more background information . ]
February 6 , 2009 -- The Congress of South African Trade Union ( COSATU ) is pleased to announce that its members , dock workers belonging to the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union ( SATAWU ) , achieved a victory last night when they stood firm by their decision not to offload the Johanna Russ , a ship that was carrying Israeli goods to South Africa .
This , despite threats to COSATU members from sections of the pro-Israel lobby , and despite severe provocation .
The Johanna Russ , flying an Antigua flag , is owned by M. Dizengoff and Co. , an established " pioneer of the modern era of shipping business in the Middle East " and shipping agent for the ironically named Zim Israel Navigation Company .
( Ironic because , last year , the same SATAWU members refused to offload the Chinese ship An Yue Jiang , which was carrying arms and ammunition destined for Robert Mugabe 's army . )
The workers ' action last night took place despite attempted subterfuge on the part of the owners of the shipping company .
There was an attempt to confound the plan by arriving earlier than originally scheduled , which was February 8 .
Dates for the berthing of the Johanna Russ were changed constantly .
Yesterday morning , SATAWU members were told that the ship would dock this morning ( Friday , February 6 ) at 02:00 .
Thanks to the vigilance of the dock workers , SATAWU discovered that the ship had docked on Wednesday morning ( February 4 , 2009 ) and was due to be offloaded last night at 21:00 .
But the vigilant workers were on guard and immediately they realised that it had docked , they refused to handle it , despite pressure from management .
SATAWU members maintained their refusal to offload the ship and also attempted to ensure that scab labour would not be used .
A few hours after berthing , at 23:00 , the Johanna Russ sneaked out of the Durban Harbour .
From the beginning of this action , COSATU workers remained resolute about their position and were convinced that , following the recent Israeli massacres in Gaza , they would take determined action against Israel .
Israel 's terror included flagrant breaches of international law , the bombing of densely populated neighbourhoods , the illegal deployment of chemical white phosphorous , and attacks on schools , ambulances , relief agencies , hospitals , universities and places of worship .
COSATU has now decided to intensify its efforts in support of the struggles of the Palestinian people .
The workers ' victory in Durban yesterday spurs COSATU members on to more determined action in order to isolate the apartheid state of Israel .
Other COSATU unions are currently in discussions about how they might also give effect to COSATU 's resolutions on boycotts , divestment and sanctions against Israel , including a refusal to handle Israeli goods , and continuing pressure on our government to sever diplomatic and trade relations with Israel .
The momentum against apartheid Israel has become an irresistible force .
We are proud to stand with the millions around the world who say ``Enough is enough ' ' .
They are doing what we asked them to do when we faced the apartheid regime in our own country .
COSATU and the Palestine Solidarity Committee call on all people of conscience to join us in boycotting Israeli products and institutions until a just , democratic state , with equal rights for all comes into existence in Palestine .
This is just the beginning of a solidarity campaign which will continue until the demands of the Palestinian people have been won .
For more information , call : Randall Howard ( Satawu General Secretary ) - 082 564 6298 ; Patrick Craven ( COSATU ) - 082 821 7456 ; Melissa Hoole ( PSC ) - 073 906 0017 ; Bongani Masuku ( COSATU ) - 079 499 6419 ; Salim Vally ( PSC ) - 082 802 5936 ; Na'eem Jeenah ( PSC ) - 084 574 2674 .

Mr Leopold is not in contact with other people , his lawyer says Police are hunting a " dangerously radioactive " London college principal who skipped bail shortly before facing trial on child pornography charges .
" Chronically ill " Thomas Leopold , 42 , head of a tutorial college in Harrow , Middlesex , was given large doses of radiation for a thyroid condition .
He then drove on to a ferry heading for Rosslare in County Wexford , Irish Republic , and has not been seen since .
Mr Leopold faces five charges of allegedly downloading illegal images .
His doctor confirmed he is dangerous , in terms of radioactivity , for a period of six weeks after treatment
Jeannie Mackay , defending Jeannie Mackay , defending , said her client , who was in " chronic poor health " , was on his own and " was n't in contact with others " .
She told Southwark Crown Court : " His doctor confirmed he is dangerous , in terms of radioactivity , for a period of six weeks after treatment . "
Judge John Price , who issued a warrant for his arrest , said : " Please warn officers that when he is arrested he might be radioactive .
This is not a joke . "
He accused Mr Leopold of " doing everything to make it as difficult as he can to let the trial go ahead " .
A Scotland Yard spokesman said : " We would appeal for anyone who knows his whereabouts to contact police . "
Radiation card Mr Leopold , a former banker from Hammersmith , west London , faces five charges of making and possessing child pornography after downloading a library of the forbidden material in 2006 .
Nick Mather , prosecuting , explained the defendant 's trial was eventually rescheduled for 9 February this year .
But four days before the hearing he drove on to a ferry at Fishguard , South Wales .
Although stopped and questioned by Special Branch officers at the time , they released him after he showed them his radiation card and insisted his bail conditions had been changed so he could visit his mother in Ireland .

" And death will be our darling and fear will be our name . "
" Terrorism is not an enemy .
It can not be defeated .
It 's a tactic .
It 's about as sensible to say we declare war on night attacks and expect we 're going to win that war .
We 're not going to win the war on terrorism . "
But the " war on terrorism " rubric -- increasingly shortened to the even vaguer " war on terror " -- kept holding enormous promise for a warfare state of mind .
Early on , the writer Joan Didion saw the blotting of the horizon and said so :
" We had seen , most importantly , the insistent use of Sept. 11 to justify the reconception of America 's correct role in the world as one of initiating and waging virtually perpetual war . "
There , in one sentence , an essayist and novelist had captured the essence of a historical moment that vast numbers of journalists had refused to recognize -- or , at least , had refused to publicly acknowledge .
Didion put to shame the array of self - important and widely lauded journalists at the likes of the New York Times , the Washington Post , PBS and National Public Radio .
The new U.S. " war on terror " was rhetorically bent on dismissing the concept of peacetime as a fatuous mirage .
Now , in early 2009 , we 're entering what could be called Endless War 2.0 , while the new president 's escalation of warfare in Afghanistan makes the rounds of the media trade shows , preening the newest applications of technological might and domestic political acquiescence .
And now , although repression of open debate has greatly dissipated since the first months after 9/11 , the narrow range of political discourse on Afghanistan is essential to the Obama administration 's reported plan to double U.S. troop deployments in that country within a year .
" This war , if it proliferates over the next decade , could prove worse in one respect than any conflict we have yet experienced , " Norman Mailer wrote in his book " Why Are We at War ? " six years ago :
" It is that we will never know just what we are fighting for .
It is not enough to say we are against terrorism .
Of course we are .
In America , who is not ?
But terrorism compared to more conventional kinds of war is formless , and it is hard to feel righteous when in combat with a void ... "
Anticipating futility and destruction that would be enormous and endless , Norman Mailer told an interviewer in late 2002 :
" This war is so unbalanced in so many ways , so much power on one side , so much true hatred on the other , so much technology for us , so much potential terrorism on the other , that the damages can not be estimated .
It is bad to enter a war that offers no clear avenue to conclusion .
...
There will always be someone left to act as a terrorist . "
And there will always be plenty of rationales for continuing to send out the patrols and launch the missiles and drop the bombs in Afghanistan , just as there have been in Iraq , just has there were in Vietnam and Laos .
Those countries , with very different histories , had the misfortune to share a singular enemy , the most powerful military force on the planet .
It may be profoundly true that we are not red states and blue states , that we are the United States of America -- but what that really means is still very much up for grabs .
Even the greatest rhetoric is just that .
And while the clock ticks , the deployment orders are going through channels .
Now , on Capitol Hill and at the White House , convenience masquerades as realism about " the war on terror . "
Too big to fail .
A beast too awesome and immortal not to feed .
And death will be our darling .
And fear will be our name .
- Norman Solomon , ( " Why Are We Still At War ? , " Common Dreams , 2.3.2009 .

Then as now came the lessons that taught with unfathomable violence once and for all that unauthorized violence must be crushed by superior violence .
The U.S. war effort in Afghanistan owes itself to the enduringchasing a holy grail of victory that can never be .
Early into the second year of the Afghanistan war , in November 2002 , a retired U.S. Army general , William Odom , appeared on C - SPAN's " Washington Journal " program and told viewers :
And yet , instead of dismissing VaR as worthless , most of the experts I talked to defended it .
The issue , it seemed to me , was less what VaR did and did not do , but how you thought about it .
Taleb says that because VaR did n’t measure the 1 percent , it was worse than useless — it was downright harmful .
But most of the risk experts said there was a great deal to be said for being able to manage risk 99 percent of the time , however imperfectly , even though it meant you could n’t account for the last 1 percent .
“ If you say that all risk is unknowable , ” Gregg Berman said , “ you do n’t have the basis of any sort of a bet or a trade .
You can not buy and sell anything unless you have some idea of the expectation of how it will move . ”
In other words , if you spend all your time thinking about black swans , you ’ll be so risk averse you ’ll never do a trade .
Brown put it this way : “ NT ” — that is how he refers to Nassim Nicholas Taleb — “ says that 1 percent will dominate your outcomes .
I think the other 99 percent does matter .
There are things you can do to control your risk .
To not use VaR is to say that I wo n’t care about the 99 percent , in which case you wo n’t have a business .
That is true even though you know the fate of the firm is going to be determined by some huge event .
When you think about disasters , all you can rely on is the disasters of the past .
And yet you know that it will be different in the future .
How do you plan for that ? ”
One risk - model critic , Richard Bookstaber , a hedge - fund risk manager and author of “ A Demon of Our Own Design , ” ranted about VaR for a half - hour over dinner one night .
Then he finally said , “ If you put a gun to my head and asked me what my firm ’s risk was , I would use VaR . ”
VaR may have been a flawed number , but it was the best number anyone had come up with .
Of course , the experts I was speaking to were , well , experts .
They had a deep understanding of risk modeling and all its inherent limitations .
They thought about it all the time .
Brown even thought VaR was good when the numbers seemed “ off , ” or when it started to “ miss ” on a regular basis — it either meant that there was something wrong with the way VaR was being calculated , or it meant the market was no longer acting “ normally . ”
Either way , he said , it told you something useful .
“ When I teach it , ” Christopher Donohue , the managing director of the research group at the Global Association of Risk Professionals , said , “ I immediately go into the shortcomings .
You ca n’t calculate a VaR number and think you know everything you need .
On a day - to - day basis I do n’t care so much that the VaR is 42 .
I care about where it was yesterday and where it is going tomorrow .
What direction is the risk going ? ”
Then he added , “ That is probably another danger : because we put a dollar number to it , they attach a meaning to it . ”
By “ they , ” Donohue meant everyone who was n’t a risk manager or a risk expert .
There were the investors who saw the VaR numbers in the annual reports but did n’t pay them the least bit of attention .
There were the regulators who slept soundly in the knowledge that , thanks to VaR , they had the whole risk thing under control .
There were the boards who heard a VaR number once or twice a year and thought it sounded good .
There were chief executives like O’Neal and Prince .
There was everyone , really , who , over time , forgot that the VaR number was only meant to describe what happened 99 percent of the time .
That $ 50 million was n’t just the most you could lose 99 percent of the time .
It was the least you could lose 1 percent of the time .
In the bubble , with easy profits being made and risk having been transformed into mathematical conceit , the real meaning of risk had been forgotten .
Instead of scrutinizing VaR for signs of impending trouble , they took comfort in a number and doubled down , putting more money at risk in the expectation of bigger gains .
“ It has to do with the human condition , ” said one former risk manager .
“ People like to have one number they can believe in . ”
Brown told me : “ You absolutely could see it coming .
You could see the risks rising .
However , in the two years before the crisis hit , instead of preparing for it , the opposite took place to an extreme degree .
The real trouble we got into today is because of things that took place in the two years before , when the risk measures were saying that things were getting bad . ”
When Sir Basil Spence designed Coventry Cathedral in 1956 , his architectural vision was about a resurrection of faith – and the city 's fabric , which had experienced something like the fires of hell on the night of 14 November 1940 , when a Luftwaffe incendiary raid left St Michael 's Cathedral and swathes of the city centre in ruins .
Nearly 70 years on , resurrection is still on the agenda here .
This time it 's called urban regeneration , in a metropolis where postwar experiments in city planning produced Britain 's first shopping precinct , and the infamously hazardous switchback ride otherwise known as the inner ring road .
The opening of the new £ 11.5 m extension to the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum , designed by architects Pringle Richards Sharratt , is the latest chapter in the transformation of key sites in the city centre .
The Belgrade Theatre extension by Stanton Williams is a quietly graphic abstraction of surfaces and colours ; the Lower Precinct shopping centre by Michael Aukett Architects is relatively clean limbed ; Arup Associates is designing an engineering and computing faculty at Coventry University ; and MacCormac Jamieson Prichard – which designed the BBC 's new building in Portland Place , London – has transformed the three - hectare site that connects Coventry Cathedral with the Transport Museum , injecting the city with its most significant public art since the vivid creations of John Piper , Graham Sutherland , Jacob Epstein and John Hutton ( not to mention engineer Ove Arup 's beautifully tapered ferroconcrete pillars ) gave the new cathedral an extraordinary grace .
The revived Herbert gallery and museum treads an interesting line between the past and the future on a site that has taken its architects and the planning department of Coventry City Council more than five years to unlock .
The new building is shoe - horned between part of Coventry University 's city - centre campus , and the segment of originally medieval streets in which lie the remains of St Michael 's , and Spence 's cathedral .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The gridshell roof of the Herbert – a cap doffed , so to speak , to the cathedral 's marvellous roof structure – rises and falls like a languidly breaking wave over the museum 's new arcade and history centre , its fine , gutterless edge stopping a few metres short of a line of rust - patinated Cor - Ten steel panels that jut up along the edge of Bayley Lane .
Public art ?
Not at all .
Public history , and a key part of the vision of John Pringle , an architect whose approach to the design of the new Herbert has conflated hi-tech details with impressions of place , and time .
Mind you , there 's been consternation about the panels : " Do n't forget , " said Pringle , " this is a town where rust signifies that something 's gone badly wrong ! "
But those steel panels mark , very precisely , the procession of medieval building plots that once stood in Bayley Lane ; William Coton , a mercer , was one of its inhabitants ; a century before him , on the same site , lived one Robert Allesley , a girdler .
Fifteen metres and five centuries away , in the Herbert 's new arcade , stands a Victorian Jaquard loom whose ectoplasmic splays of thread and bolus hooks prefigure Coventry 's 20th - century rise as Britain 's greatest car manufacturer , machine - tool maker and producer of new - fangled white goods .
The passage of time is palpable here , and even more potent in the preserved remains of the gothic Hammer House of Horror vaults of one of the medieval buildings preserved under the Herbert 's forecourt .
If you follow the edge of the row of panels , they take the eye , on one side , to the cathedral ; and , on the Herbert side , to The Enfolding , a charmingly modest statue by Jean Parker dedicated to peace , reconciliation and the announcement , for some reason , of the artist 's BA Hons status .
But never mind that : 60 metres beyond her artwork lies pure , buttock - clenching architectural schizophrenia : the ludicrously overscaled proscenium arch bolted on to the facade of Coventry University 's gateway building succeeds only in accentuating the very thing it 's supposed to hide – an out - and - out minger of a building from the 1960s .
Pringle 's architecture is also , in part , a bolt - on whose design risks two things : structural overstatement and a blurring of what architects would refer to as its typology .
If you encounter a big , columned classical facade in a large town or city , the typology in question will be Important Civic Building ; if you wander through parts of Shoreditch and Hoxton in London , the typology of the big tough four - square brick buildings will be 19th - century industrial .
Viewed from the entrance of Spence 's cathedral , the typology of the new addition to the Herbert seems uncertain .
The form does n't send an obvious message about its art or historical function .
Yet it is this uncertainty which highlights the key thing about this building – the way it creates a processional space .
The big arcade linking the new galleries and the museum is full of light ; it feels utterly open - handed , a public extension not just of the Herbert but of the university 's central plaza and the precincts of the cathedral .
It 's a place rather than simply a building , and one where the architect and the landscape designer , Edward Hutchison , have managed an even more significant kind of blurring , a segue between indoor and outdoor , and between one kind of activity and another .
There 's a relaxed vibe about it .
" When we first examined the site , looking from the cathedral , the space leaked away into a car park , " said Pringle .
" Projects like this must add something to the public realm .
Our proposal to demolish an existing wing of the Herbert , to create something that faced Bayley Lane and the cathedral , was controversial .
But the planners , and the city planner John McGuigan in particular , were open - minded enough to take on board something that could add something that was distinctive and valuable to this part of the city . "
The arcade connects the core of the original museum and gallery spaces with the new galleries ; and here , Pringle has created calmly luminous volumes by using white , quartz - mixed concrete .
His treatment of details signals his early career with Hopkins Architects , whose fusion of hi-tech structures and brilliantly crafted connections – particularly between timber and steel – have become an almost unchallenged trademark .
We see the Hopkins imprint on the details of the diagrid roof , and on the super - svelte staircase that rises up the side of the gallery 's arcade wall .
But in an unexpected move , Pringle has twisted the structural grid just at the point where the arcade 's roof swoops down to become the roof of the history and archive centre , so that its timber beams pick up the alignment of those Cor - Ten medieval markers .
This admirable transition is one for architectural anoraks .
Everything 's at stake : changes of scale , materiality , thrust , threshold , detail .
It could have been an architectural train - crash .
It is n't .
But these are design niceties .
The architecture 's most significant contribution is in the way it has added something humane and civil to yet another moment of urban and cultural resurrection in Coventry .
The arcade will no doubt come to feature on Coventry postcards ; it may even win Pringle Richards Sharratt an award or two , and interest the ghost of Ove Arup .
What really matters , though , is that the new architecture of the Herbert works as a piece of urban connective tissue .
Not the sexiest of phrases , to be sure , but one that Coventry , coolly and without fuss , is taking very seriously .
What is the most expensive car in the world ?
I guess whatever anyone is willing to pay for it .
Admittedly , that ’s an amibiguous concept , I mean some guy sold Obama ’s 2005 Chrysler 300c on eBay for $ 100,000 .
Does n’t mean everyone ’s Chrysler is worth that much .
And somehow I ’m reminded of the car Homer designed for his brother in The Simpsons .
But we ’ll ignore all that and instead focus on MSRPs and actual costs to buy from a dealer .
Granted , not all of these cars are currently in production .
But most of them were recently on the market , giving one a fair idea of price .
Now , I ’m going to go out on a limb here and guess none of our readers actually own any of these ten cars .
Hell , with this economy you might not be able to afford your current car .
But a man can dream , and most men dream about owning a car with some flash .
And let ’s face it , if you had the money and the opportunity , you will definitely spend a small fraction of your cash on a nice car .
It ’s just that the super wealthy can own the flashiest supercars without much of a dent in their wallet .
So with that in mind , here are ten of the most ridiculously expensive cars out there .
Maybe one day you ’ll have one or two in your garage .
1. Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4
Cost : $ 1,500,000
Dubbed the fastest production car in the world ( although that title is debated ) , it ’s also the most expensive .
It ’s named after French racing driver Pierre Veyron , who won the twenty four hours of Le Mans in 1939 .
Handcrafted in Molsheim , France by Bugatti , a Volkswagen subsidiary , the car is powered by an awesome 8.0 - liter , sixteen - cylinder , quad - turbo engine that puts out 736 - kilowatt ( 1,001 PS ; 987 hp ) and can reach 408.47 km/h ( 253.81 mph ) .
Production started in 2005 and continues to this day , with about 300 Coupes and 150 Grand Sport Targas ( 450 units total ) made so far .
2. Enzo Ferrari
Cost : $ 1,000,000
Ferrari stopped producing the the Enzo in 2004 , but until the Millechili is released , it ’s Ferrari ’s most expensive model .
And the name Ferrari brings to mind Formula
One racing , so we could n’t ignore it on this rundown .
Named after the company ’s late founder , the car remains one of the most powerful production cars in the world .
Fewer than 400 were made , and prospective owners had to apply to Ferrari for the privilege of buying one .
It was built using Formula One technology , such as a carbon - fiber body , and also used technologies not allowed in F1 , such as active aerodynamics and traction control .
The Enzo ’s V12 engine is the first of a new generation for Ferrari and the car can accelerate to 60 mph ( 97 km/h ) in 3.14 seconds with a top speed of around 368 kilometers per hour ( 227 mph ) .
3. McLaren F1
Cost : $ 1,000,000
Like the Enzo , another car long out of production , but it ’s a classic .
Made from 1992 –1998 , 107 were produced in a variety of body styles .
And it was the fastest production car ever built , at least until it was surpassed in 2005 by the Koenigsegg CCR ( and then the Bugatti Veyron a few months later ) .
It sports a 6.0 liter BMW engine that can reach 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) in 3.1 seconds and reportedly has achieved a top speed of 240.14 mph ( 386.5 km / h ) .
The car incorporated many world firsts for a road car : a fully carbon fiber monocoque structure , fully active fan - assisted ground effect aerodynamics , and a central driving position with two offset rear passenger seats .
4. Koenigsegg CCX
Cost : $ 545,568
Back to realm of currently produced models is the Koenigsegg CCX .
The Swedish car manufacturer makes this supercar , with the CCX an abbreviation for Competition Coupe X . The X ( being the Roman numeral for ten ) commemorates the 10th anniversary of the first CC vehicle .
Koenigsegg spent a lot of development time to cast their own V8 that could drink US - grade , 91 octane fuel , yet still run at a high compression ratio .
Despite all the regulatory changes , the CCX is still one of the world ’s fastest supercars .
It can accelerate from 0 – 62 mph ( 100 km /h ) in 3.2 seconds with a top speed of 259 mph ( 417 km / h ) .
5. Lamborghini Reventón
Cost : $ 1,284,674 ( or One Million Euros )
The new Lamborghini Reventón is latest supercar for the super rich .
Based on the Murciélago , the exterior of the Reventón is said to be inspired by the F - 22 Raptor fighter jet and other fast airplanes .
The official press release states that only 20 cars will be released to the public , eleven of which will be U.S. bound ( further reports indicate the total number will eventually reach 100 ) .
The engine hood is made of glass laminate with open ventilation slits offering a glimpse at the large 6.5 - liter V12 engine .
The Reventón delivers 650 horsepower and 487 pound - feet of torque .
It accelerates to 100 km/h ( 62 mph ) in the same time as the Murciélago LP640 ( 3.4 seconds ) and is capable of reaching a maximum speed of over 340 km/h ( 210 mph ) .
6. Porsche Carrera GT
Cost : $ 440,000
As Porsche cotinues in its quest to develop a “ Bugatti Veyron killer ” , the Carrera GT remains the company ’s top released supercar .
With its V10 engine providing more than 600 horsepower , and withan array of cutting edge technologies including a ceramic composite clutch and brakes beneath its carbon - reinforced body , the Porsche Carrera GT utilizes the undiluted qualities of a genuine race car in a production car .
Reaching top speeds of up to 205 mph ( 330 km /h ) , the car can also accelerate from a standing start to 62 mph ( 100 km /h ) in only 3.9 seconds .
Production halted in 2006 , with only 1,270 units produced making the car unique for any owner .
To comprehend how much development goes into these vehicles , Porsche claims that over 75 technology patents have been filed as a result of the Carrera GT .
7. Pagani Zonda C12 F
Cost : $ 667,321
The Zonda C12 F debuted at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show as the latest version of the Pagani Zonda and was built as a tribute to five - time world champion Juan Manuel Fangio .
With production proceeding at roughly 10 cars per year , the Zonda remains a rare vehicle , with only 95 built as of September 2008 .
It is one of the fastest supercars ever made , built using Pagani ’s extensive experience in carbon fiber construction .
The C12 F model is the most extensive re-engineering of the Pagani car yet , though it shares much with its predecessors including the 7.3 L V12 .
Power is increased to 602 PS ( 594 hp / 443 kW ) with a special club sport model .
The company promises a 3.5 second sprint to 62 mph ( 100 km/h ) , a top speed over 215 mph ( 346 km / h ) .
The top speed can be further tweaked by adjusting the aerodynamic settings .
8. Saleen S7 Twin Turbo
Cost : $ 555,000
Lest we forget about American produced supercars , we present you the Saleen S7 Twin Turbo .
If you are a true American patriot , you can be proud to show off this car .
Hand - built in limited - productions , the high - performance automobile was jointly developed by Saleen and several others .
The S7 debuted on August 19 , 2000 at the Monterey Historic Races , and was replaced in 2005 by the S7 Twin Turbo .
The Twin Turbo features a more powerful engine system featuring 750 horsepower ( 760 PS / 559 kW ) and the top speed to an estimated 250 mph ( 402 km /h ) , reaching 0 - 60 in 3.2 seconds .
9. SSC Ultimate Aero TT
Cost : $ 654,400
Staying with the theme of American - built cars , the SSC Aero TT is the brainchild of Jerod Shelby and a supercar built by Shelby Super Cars in order to rival the Bugatti Veyron .
Designed over a period of seven years , the styling includes the use of flip doors similar to the ones found on the Ferrari Enzo among others .
The design uses carbon fiber and titanium extensively throughout the car , keeping the weight down and allowing top speeds of over 250 mph ( 400 km / h ) .
On September 13 , 2007 in West Richland , Washington the car reached 255.83 mph ( 411.707 km/h ) , and was subsequently verified by Guinness World Records as the world ’s fastest production car .
If top speed is n’t enough , it can go from 0 - 60 mph time of just 2.78 seconds .
10 . LeBlanc Mirabeau
Cost : $ 645,084
The Leblanc Mirabeau , from Swiss manufacturer Wysstec GmbH and Leblanc cars , is the closest you ’ll ever get to a race car for the street .
The fact that it is street legal is almost unbelievable .
To reach that race car feeling the car interior is optimized for maximum speed and acceleration , and the exterior is extremely lightweight .
It is constructed of Kevlar , carbon fiber , and assorted unobtanium .
The engine outputs about 700 horsepower from a 4700 cc supercharged engine , which comes from Koenigsegg ’s V8 , the same engine found in the CCR .
The Mirabeau has a top speed of 370 km/h ( 229.9 mph ) .
OTTAWA–The main contenders to replace Stéphane Dion as Liberal leader are putting the pressure on him to make way for a new chief early in the new year , rather than waiting until May as previously planned .
Michael Ignatieff and Bob Rae have both made it clear they believe the party needs a new and permanent leader by January .
That 's when Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's minority Conservative government has promised to bring down a budget .
The Liberals will then have to decide whether to vote against it , a move that would precipitate either another election or a renewed call for Gov. Gen .
Michaelle Jean to let the Liberals form a coalition cabinet with the NDP and govern with the tacit support of the Bloc Quebecois as the silent partner in a three - way deal .
" I think that Mr. Dion has to consider his options , " Ignatieff told CTV's Question Period on Sunday .
" There 's an emerging feeling in the caucus that , given the importance of this ( budget ) vote in late January , it would be appropriate to have a permanent leader in place .
The caucus is considering various options about how to do that . "
Rae agreed the parliamentary crisis over the last week has changed the political landscape and forced the Liberals to speed up the leadership decision that had been scheduled to take place at a convention in Vancouver in May .
Former cabinet minister John Manley suggested , in an opinion piece published Saturday , that the party executive and parliamentary caucus should choose at least an interim leader as soon as possible .
But Rae said a closed - door decision by those bodies – both of which are top - heavy with Ignatieff supporters – would n't be the right way to choose a permanent leader .
" I think there 's going to be a problem if some people decide that they can somehow anoint themselves as the people who are going to force this issue in that way , " Rae told CTV .
" I think there would be a tremendous reaction in the party against that kind of approach . "
Rae suggested instead that an accelerated leadership race , including televised debates and a vote by rank - and - file members , could be organized with the goal of installing the winner " by the middle or third week of January . "
If Dion should decide to step down before then , he said , it would be all right for caucus and the executive to select an interim leader to fill in while the process runs its course .
Although Dion negotiated the power - sharing deal with the NDP and the Bloc that brought the Harper government to the brink of a non-confidence vote , the prime minister dodged the bullet by persuading the Governor General last week to let him suspend Parliament for seven weeks .
He has also mounted a massive public relations campaign , including anti-Dion television and radio ads , contending that a leader whose party captured just 25 per cent of the vote in the Oct. 14 election does n't have a legitimate mandate to govern .

Many Liberals acknowledge privately that Dion 's continued presence as the public face of the party has complicated efforts to sell the idea of an alternative coalition government .
They point , as an example , to the embarrassing communications snafu last week in which Dion 's team was an hour late delivering a videotape to broadcast outlets offering the Liberal response to a televised address by Harper .

Evolution and Creationism in England
During the first week of February , 2009 , on the occasion of Charles Darwin ’s 200th birthday celebrations at various locals around England ( including his birthplace city of Shrewsbury — see photo montage below ) , my hosts Andrew Kelly ( a science writer who authored a gorgeous coffee - table book entitled Darwin : For the Love of Science ) and Bruce Hood ( a University of Bristol cognitive psychologist and author of the forthcoming book Supersense ) , arranged for a visit to Noah ’s Ark Zoo Farm in Bristol , run by a kindly creationist gentleman named Anthony Bush .
( Yes , in addition to being a zoo for the public to tour , it is a working farm . )
Bush ’s warmth and good cheer were appreciated on this blistering cold snowy day , one of the worst witnessed in the UK in decades .
As we started our tour Mr. Bush made it clear to me that he did not to be confused with those “ loonie American creationists ” who think that the earth is only 6,000 years old .
No , no , the Earth is much older than that , he proclaimed .
“ How old do you think it is ? ” I queried .
“ Oh , I ’ve worked it out to be around 100,000 years old , with Adam and Eve at around 21,000 years old . ”
No , indeed , there was no confusing Mr. Bush with those nutty American creationists !
And what was happening between those two time spans ?
If I understood Mr. Bush correctly , he believes that between the creation at 100,000 years ago and Adam and Eve 21,000 years ago , there was the pre-Adamite period during which the dinosaurs roamed .
What about all the geological evidence for a much older Earth , I pressed on ?
All those strata of , say , sandstone , which was once loose sand compressed into solid rock over immense periods of time — how could that possibly happen over thousands instead of millions of years ?
Those strata are laid down every season , like tree - rings , he explained .
Interesting analogy , since we can see trees growing from year to year , but where on earth can we see sand being compressed into stone each year ?
The conversation turned most passionate for Mr. Bush when we arrived at the primate cages , featuring marmosets and gibbons .
Standing next to a poster display of the differences between apes and humans ( implying that humans are not apes , which we are ) , Mr. Bush seemed particularly interested ( obsessed really ) in the sexual differences between us , insisting that humans are the only primates that copulate in the missionary position ( he waxed poetic about how the angle of the vagina and the slant of the penis are perfectly positioned for proper penetration ( say that three times ! ) for producing the orgasm , which God created to keep us together in pair bonds ( he offered no explanation for why women get multiples and men only one , and I was n’t about to ask ) .
He added that we are the only primate to have orgasms .
I told him about bonobos , whom Frans deWaal describes as a very sexual primate indeed , including copulating in the missionary position and apparently experiencing orgasms ( and if not then they sure seem to be having as good a time as we do during sex ) .
Mr. Bush offered no acknowledgement of this fact , but after more sex talk along these lines I finally said something like “ you sure are into sex , ” to which he responded “ what do you expect , I ’m a man ? ”
To which I rejoined : “ yes , well , Darwinism explains that nicely , thank you . ”
If you want to read more about the Noah ’s Ark Zoo Farm , go to : http://www.noahsarkzoofarm.co.uk/
I have n’t any idea how influential Anthony Bush ’s Noah ’s Ark Zoo Farm is on the school children who are taken there on field trips , but I was most disturbed by the results of a survey just released there ( the “ Rescuing Darwin Survey ” conducted by the polling agency ComRes on behalf of the Theos thinktank ) that was given to me by my hosts to prepare me for my talk on evolution and creationism , indicating that half of British adults do not believe in evolution , with at least 22 percent preferring creationism or intelligent design as an explanation for how the world came about .
In fact , according to this survey , only 25 percent of Britons said that they believe Darwin ’s theory of evolution is “ definitely true , ” while another quarter reported that they think it is “ probably true . ”
These results mirror those found in most surveys of American ’s attitudes about evolution , although ours are slightly worse .
In England , according to this recent survey , fully half of the 2,060 people questioned were either strongly opposed to the theory of evolution , or confused about it .
There are even some Young Earth Creationists in the UK , as the survey found that around 10 percent of Britons believe that God created the world some time in the last 10,000 years .
There are only three movies in the category , but the competition should be fierce .
Should the Oscar go to the Dark Knight , Iron Man or the Curious Case of Benjamin Button ?

Quiz : All about the Russian GP
I ’ve been thinking about linear classifiers , and while it ’s well known how to convert naive Bayes ( multinomial ) classifiers into linear models ( just treat log p( cat ) as intercept , and log p( word|cat ) as dimensions ) , it ’s less well known how to do this with higher - order n- grams .
One use is an n -gram language - model based search engine implemented on top of a vector - based retrieval engine ( I ’m not sure Lucene ’s scoring ’s flexible enough for this ) .
Well , it turns out to be easy if you use interpolated smoothing like Witten - Bell .
In the bigram case , the smoothed estimate is :
p( a|b ) = lam ( b ) * p'( a|b ) + ( 1 - lam ( b ) ) p( a ) p( a ) = lam ( ) * p'( a ) + ( 1 - lam ( ) ) unif
where lam ( b ) in [ 0,1 ] is the interpolation coefficient for context b and lam ( ) is the interpolation coefficient for the empty n- gram .
p'( a|b ) and p'(a ) are maximum likelihood estimates , and unif is the uniform probability of a token .
For Witten - Bell smoothing , interpolation is defined as :
lam ( b ) = count ( b , _ ) / ( count ( b , _ ) + 1 )
where count ( b , _ ) is the number of times the token b is seen before another token in training , making lam ( b ) increase with the number of training instances .
Let count [ X ] be the count for n- gram X ( where the length may be 0 , 1 or 2 ) .
For instance , the vector “ John likes John ” has counts for the following dimensions :
[ ] : 3 [ John ] : 2 [ likes ] : 1 [ John , likes ] : 1 [ likes , John ] : 1
Then define coefficient vector beta , with dimensions for all of the n-grams seen in training ( after pruning ) :
beta [ ] = log lam ( ) + log unif beta [ a ] = log p( a ) - beta [ ] beta[ a , b] = log p( b|a ) - beta [ a ]
If we look at the contribution from terms in our example , and sum , we see how it works , assuming all bigrams have been seen in training other than [ likes , John ] .
[ ] : 3 3 * beta [ ] = 3 * ( log lam ( ) + log unif ) [ John ] : 2 2 * beta [ John ] = 2 * ( log p( john ) - beta[ ] ) [ likes ] : 1 1 * beta[ likes ] = 1 * ( log p( likes ) - beta [ ] ) [ John , likes ] : 1 1 * beta [ John , likes ] = 1 * ( log p(likes|John ) - beta [ John ] ) [ likes , John ] : 1 1 * beta[ likes , John ] = 0
Doing the sums leaves us with the log estimate :
log p ( [ John , likes , John ] ) = log p( John ) + log p( likes|John ) + log lam ( likes ) + log p( John )
It ’s no problem extending this to higher order n- grams .
Many other kinds of interpolated smoothing will work , too .

The film studio Red Eagle Entertainment is making a big bet today as it announces it is starting a video game publishing studio , Red Eagle Games , which will make games based on the epic fantasy “ Wheel of Time ” novels by Robert Jordan , VentureBeat has learned .
The books have sold more than 44 million copies worldwide and Malibu , Calif . - based Red Eagle Entertainment has the rights to making films , TV shows and games based on the property .
At least one major motion picture , based on the first novel “ The Eye of the World , ” is in the works .
There are 11 novels in the series ( with a 12th coming from a new writer since Jordan , whose real name was James Oliver Rigney , passed away in 2007 ) .
The series is known for its detailed imaginary world , large cast of characters and an edgy “ Lord of the Rings ” meets “ Road Warrior ” blend of fantasy and sci-fi .
Former IBM executives Rick Selvage and Larry Mondragon are producers at Red Eagle Entertainment , a film company they started in 2003 after obtaining the series rights .
News recently leaked that Universal will make the movie based on Red Eagle Entertainment ’s rights on a $ 150 million budget , though no formal announcement has been made .
Selvage said in an interview that the game company will make a series of games that will be co-launched with the movies .
In addition , Red Eagle Games will make a massively multiplayer online game based on the Wheel of Time universe .
“ We ’ve got a huge running start with this property , ” Selvage said .
“ We expect to have a game based on every movie , and we expect no less than three movies , though that depends on how well each does . ”
Between the films and the games , the companies are expecting to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the entertainment property .
While the movie financing is in place , Selvage said he is just beginning the process of raising money for the game studio .
That could prove difficult , but he said he has already received an enthusiastic reaction , largely because the rights to the series are considered so valuable .
While the twin movie and game approach is risky , it reflects a growing trend in the industry .
Video games have become so lucrative that movie companies have become loathe to give up the rights for games based on their properties to game companies .
Instead , Disney and Warner Bros. have stepped up game production .
Electronic
Arts is also moving in the same direction , greenlighting media such as TV shows or comics based on its original game properties .
Radar Group , a start - up that came out of stealth earlier this year , also wants to make games and movies based on the same properties simultaneously .
The path is fraught with peril .
EA backed out of making games based on licensed properties because the results were boring gamers .
And both movies and games are a hit or miss business .
While the rewards of doing both are higher , so are the consequences of failure .
Brash Entertainment raised hundreds of millions of dollars to make games based on movies , but a number of the titles have fallen flat and it recently laid off some developers .
Selvage ( left ) said he is aware of the risks and he believes that most games based on movies fail because they are made in too short a time and there is n’t enough cooperation with the movie studio .
Red Eagle games is planning to release its titles on all major platforms : the consoles , personal computers , handhelds and wireless devices .
The first Wheel of Time book debuted in 1990 and later titles have consistently appeared on The New York Times Bestseller list .
The final book , being penned by writer Brandon Sanderson using notes and a partial draft by Jordan , will be published in the fall of 2009 .
The books are in 24 languages and there are tens of thousands of fan web sites .
Selvage , who formerly was general manager of IBM ’s global media and entertainment businesses , said the project is more than five years in the making .
Mondragon ( left ) spent 20 years in attorney roles at IBM .
The company has identified key game developers for the launch and plans to hire staff in the coming months .
“ We want to hire the rock stars , ” Selvage said .
This is the first in a series of articles that seeks to provide the intelligent layman with sufficient knowledge of sound economic theory to enable him to understand what must be done to overcome the present financial crisis and return to the path of economic progress and prosperity .
A disastrous economic confusion , one that is shared almost universally , both by laymen and by professional economists alike , is the belief that falling prices constitute deflation and thus must be feared and , if possible , prevented .
The front - page , lead article of The New York Times of last November 1 provides a typical example of this confusion .
It declares :
As dozens of countries slip deeper into financial distress , a new threat may be gathering force within the American economy — the prospect that goods will pile up waiting for buyers and prices will fall , suffocating fresh investment and worsening joblessness for months or even years .
The word for this is deflation , or declining prices , a term that gives economists chills .
Deflation accompanied the Depression of the 1930s .
Persistently falling prices also were at the heart of Japan ’s so - called lost decade after the catastrophic collapse of its real estate bubble at the end of the 1980s — a period in which some experts now find parallels to the American predicament .
Contrary to The Times and so many others , deflation is not falling prices but a decrease in the quantity of money and / or volume of spending in the economic system .
To say the same thing in different words , deflation is a general fall in demand .
Falling prices are a consequence of deflation , not the phenomenon itself .

A sermon from Fr. Charles Dinkler , RIP
God , who at sundry times and in diverse manners , spake in time past unto the fathers by the Prophets , hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son whom he hath appointed heir of all things , by whom also he made the world . ”
Hebrews 1:1-2 .
Everyone knows that a Christian has to stay on the straight and narrow way .
One thing this means is that if he finds himself falling off the horse on one side , he must not overcompensate by getting back on the horse and then falling off on the other side .
The same is true of theology .
In the first 1000 years of Christianity , more time was spent defending the humanity of Jesus Christ than his divinity .
Influenced by the pagan world and its sensibilities , many then could never conceive of God actually becoming a man .
The flesh was too fallen , low , mortal , undivine , ungodly for there ever to be union betwixt the two .
Nestorious taught - amongst other egregious and grievous errors - that the Son of God “ passed through Mary as water through a pipe . ”
He meant that she was merely a conduit .
Jesus took nothing of her , nothing of her nature .
He and she were not in any way consubstantial - i.e. ,
He was not in any way , shape , or form of the same nature as she was .
The Church during the Christmas and Epiphany holidays takes special care to dispute this heresy .
The feast we celebrate , the hymns we sing , the evidence we hear all rebut it .
They keep his divinity in union with his humanity .
St. Paul says in Hebrews that Christ was made of a woman .
“ When the fullness of time was come , God sent forth his son , made of a woman , made under the law , to redeem them that were under the law , that we might receive the adoption of sons . ”
He is made of her , he takes something of her nature , just as a merely human baby takes on his mother ’s nature .
And the Word became flesh .
It says “ became ” .
Not “ posed as ” or “ pretended to be ” or “ projected an image that looked like ” flesh .
He actually became flesh .
He actually became a human like us .
Whatever there was of humanity , he became it .
He took it all on .
He became in every way like us , except for one thing : sin .
Sin is not of our human essence .
It is the destructor of our essence .
It is an addition to our humanity - or more accurately , a subtraction of it .
We are less , not more , human when we sin .
Christ became human , he did all of this , without ever ceasing to be God .
Take the hymn we sing at the Christmas liturgy , Hymn No. 20 : Of The Father ’s Love Begotten .
This hymn comes down to us from Prudentius in the 5th Century .
Christians have been singing it for 1500 years .
The first verse nails down Christ ’s divinity .
The opening words are : “ Of the Father ’s love begotten / Ere the worlds began to be . ”
Look at that word “ begotten ” .
That means that he partakes of everything the father partakes .
He is “ the express image of the father . ”
As C. S. Lewis notes , beavers beget beavers , dogs beget dogs , god begets god .
Whatever is begotten is of the same nature as what begat it .
“ Ere the worlds began to be . ”
Before one iota of creation came into being , God the Son existed .
“ For by him were all things created , that are in heaven and that are in earth , visible and invisible , whether they be thrones , or dominions , or principalities , or powers ; all things were created by him , and for him :
And he is before all things , and by him all things consist . ”
Colossians 1:16 - 17 .
The last gospel reminds us of this every week :
All things were made by Him , and without Him was not anything made that was made .
It applies as well to everything that shall be made in the future .
Because all things are made for him .
Everything that comes into existence is equally subject to him , equally made by him .
He is very god of very god .
He truly is the Son of the Living God .
The second verse of the hymn nails down Christ ’s humanity .
O that birth forever blessed
When the Virgin , full of grace
By the Holy Ghost conceiving
Bare the savior of our race
And the babe , the world ’s redeemer
First revealed his sacred face .
He was conceived by God the Holy Ghost .
So God is involved in all of this .
God , who is the Father of His only - begotten Son before all time , remains His Father now in His Incarnation .
This is truly an act of God .
But it is not an act of God alone .
Mary is a participant .
By the Holy Ghost overshadowing her , Mary conceived .
It is a virginal - but real -- conception .
It entails real growth and development .
She is his mother .
Christ is a real partaker of her nature , which is our nature , though she is more pure and blessed .
He is really divine , and really human .
Some might say “ Bully for him .
But what does all this abstract theological speculation have to do with me ? ”
To put the question theologically , who cares if the Arians went around saying “ there was a time when He was not ” ?
Who cares if the Nestorians believed Christ to be divine , but not fully , completely , absolutely human .
So what if He did pass through Mary as water through a pipe ?
Is n’t that better , since he therefore is uncontaminated by her humanity ?
No .
The Fathers have a saying : “ What is not joined to God is not saved . ”
If our humanity is not made one with God through the incarnation , then our humanity is not saved .
Our salvation is not merely by thinking good thoughts , or having some kind of bodiless mind - link with God .
That might have been sufficient if God had created us as unfleshly , disincorporate minds , floating around freely anywhere we choose .
But that ’s not how we ’re made .
We are flesh and blood .
And the way we ’re made was good .
God has chosen to redeem our life .
He redeemed all of it : body , soul , spirit , humanity , human nature , the cosmos .
Christ takes all of it on .
He consecrates all life anew .
He hallows every moment of it from conception to death .
Everything .
Are we conceived ?
So is He .
Did we dwell in our mother ’s womb for 9 months ?
So does He .
Did we undergo birth ?
He was born too , just the way we are .
If , as some new age psychologists say , people are messed up by birth trauma , he redeems that too .
He whom the heavens and the earth and the universe cannot contain is contained and constrained to dwell for 9 months in the womb .
This is genuine birth .
This is not some pagan god pretending to be a baby in a manger .
This is not like those stories of the Zeus posing as a human for some sneaky or amorous purpose .
Our god does it for real :
He really becomes a human embryo and from there - like us - is born , grows up , and dies .
It ’s not a case of “ I was a teenage Messiah ” .
Or “ My time as a baby miracle worker . ”
His humanity remains his forever .
Remember the words from another Christmas hymn , Hark the Herald Angels Sing : “ Mild he lays his glory by ” .
Does this mean he ceases to be God ?
No .
Not for one moment does he cease to be God .
He retains the fullness of his divinity , but he lays it aside , he voluntarily forgoes it .
He willingly forsakes the heavens and his godly prerogatives and power and glory and dominion - all for our sakes .
Note the well - balanced theology in the hymn : “ Offspring of the Virgin ’s womb ” -- he has her human nature .
“ Veiled in flesh the Godhead see ” - - he remains God .
Then the two points are put together : “ Hail the incarnate Deity ” .
He was “ pleased as man with man to dwell ” .
What does it mean to dwell as a man , as a human ?
When we ’re babies do we get hungry and need to be fed by our parents ?
Yes , and so does he .
Do we need our nappies changed ?
So did he .
Do we have to obey and be subject to our parents ?
He does that too .
Do we grow in wisdom and stature - at least in stature ?
St. Luke tells us explicitly that He grew in wisdom and stature .
Every aspect of our life , our humanity is joined to Him who at all times remains God and at all times since the incarnation is man , fully and completely .
Our job is to continue in this union forever and ever , even through and beyond death .
So at this holiday time , we sing : Mild he lays his glory by , born that man no more may die .
Born to raise the sons of earth .
Born to give them second birth .

When you 're waiting it out in the tanker , there 's nothing productive you can do , so one may as well take some snaps .
Almost all my snaps were taken enroute from one location to another from within the cabin .
The few I took outside were when we were taking a quick breather ( ie. shoving water and staminade down our throats ) .
That 's why we have very few action shots of us at work .
EDIT : the crew protection system on the newer tankers is fantastic - basically sprays are located around the outside .
You set the pump to minimum pressure and it provides a dripping curtain of water over the whole outside .
Our tanker has 3750 L of water , the reserve is 750L ( ie 3000L for ff ) - we never use that 750L for fire - fighting , it provides about 5 min of crew protection ( drips not sprays , otherwise the spray would evaporate and not stick to the truck ) .
President Colom awarded Guatemala 's highest honour to Fidel Castro
President Alvaro Colom of Guatemala has apologised to Cuba for his country 's role in the failed US - backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in 1961 .
The CIA used Guatemalan territory to train Cuban exiles before their disastrous invasion which was quickly defeated by Cuban forces .
" It was not us , but it was our land , " President Colom said in Cuba .
His visit is the fifth by a regional leader in 2009 and supports calls for the end of the US trade embargo .
President Colom 's apology was greeted with sustained applause at the University of Havana .
He said he was apologising now as a gesture of solidarity and a sign that times had changed .
" Cuba deserves its own destiny , a destiny that you all built with this revolution of 50 years .
Defend it like you have always done . "
About 1,500 Cuban exiles trained in Guatemala with US advisors , before invading the island to overthrow Fidel Castro 's communist government .
The invasion ended after less than three days , with about 100 invaders killed and more than 1,000 captured by Cuban forces .
During his visit to Cuba , President Colom is decorating the former Cuban leader with Guatemala 's highest honour , the order of the Quetzal , for the many Cuban doctors who have worked in poor communities across the continent .

Postmaster General John E. Potter recently warned that economic times are so dire that the U.S. Postal Service may end mail delivery one day a week and freeze executive salaries .
But his personal fortunes are nonetheless rising thanks to 40 percent in pay raises since 2006 , a $ 135,000 bonus last year and several perks usually reserved for corporate CEOs .
The changes , approved by the Postal Board of Governors and contained in a little - noticed regulatory filing in December , brought Mr. Potter ’s total compensation and retirement benefits to more than $ 800,000 in 2008 .
That is more than double the salary for President Obama .
The new compensation package , much of it deferred to later years , goes beyond a newly beefed - up salary , now $ 263,575 , that Congress arranged for him as part of a 2006 law to make top postal salaries more competitive with those in the private sector .
At least four other postal officials got more than a quarter - million dollars in total compensation in 2008 , according to Postal Service records reviewed by The Washington Times .
Lawmakers , already trying to limit compensation of Wall Street executives , have taken notice of Mr. Potter ’s good fortune when the Postal Service is posting nearly $ 3 billion a year in losses and now wants to raise the price of a stamp by 2 cents .
The House Oversight and Government Reform federal workforce , Postal Service and the District of Columbia subcommittee “ will investigate during this Congress , ” said Marcus A. Williams , a spokesman for the panel that oversees the Postal Service .
Outside analysts also said Mr. Potter ’s recent vow to freeze postal executive salaries at 2008 levels means little when several got such generous compensation packages .
“ It ’s easy to freeze your pay when salaries were running as hot as a dragster the previous year , ” said Pete Sepp , vice president of the National Taxpayers Union , a nonpartisan groups that monitors spending of the government and its spinoff agencies like the Postal Service .
“ There is something to be said for attractive compensation .
But at the same time , the Postal Service has a government guaranteed monopoly on the delivery of first - class mail , and UPS and FedEx do n’t have that .
Because of that , there is a fundamental difference in the Postal Service ’s business model and that of package delivery firms . ”
In informing the Postal Regulatory Commission of its change , the Postal Board of Governors said it added deferred compensation because federal law made it difficult to pay Mr. Potter “ even close to a level of comparability with similarly situated individuals in the private sector . ”
By comparison , Frederick W. Smith , chief executive officer for FedEx , received $ 10.9 million in total compensation last year and $ 17 million in 2007 , according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings .
Gerald J. McKiernan , a spokesman for the Postal Service , said the board of governors has the authority to award extra money through deferred compensation and that key congressional offices were advised of the changes .
Under federal rules , top postal officials can earn up to 120 percent the salary of the vice president of the United States , which was $ 221,100 in 2008 .
The deferred compensation - such as bonuses , perks and substantial retirement fund contributions - are designed to augment that pay , according to postal records .
Mr. Potter is n’t the only Postal Service official to benefit .
Deputy Postmaster Patrick Donahoe got $ 600,026 in total compensation in 2008 ; Anthony J. Vegliante , chief of human resources , received $ 482,820 ; and at least two other postal executives got over a quarter - million dollars each , according to Postal Service records .
For the officers , enhancements to the value of their pensions totaled almost as much as their base salaries , which were under the federal pay caps .
Mr. Potter ’s compensation also included perks usually reserved for corporate executives , like $ 69,253 in security .
He and other top postal officers are eligible for perks such as life insurance premiums , parking , spousal travel and airline club membership , the records show .
The board of governors also disclosed that it awarded Mr. Potter $ 135,041 in “ pay - for - performance ” and incentive payments for his “ effective leadership during the difficult economic challenges of 2008 . ”
Details about Mr. Potter ’s compensation , as well as pay packages for other top postal executives , were disclosed in a Dec. 10 filing with the Postal Regulatory Commission by the board of governors .
The filing came about six weeks before Mr. Potter told Congress that the Postal Service reported a net loss of $ 2.8 billion during fiscal 2008 .
In his congressional testimony , Mr. Potter said the Postal Service ’s financial outlook remains so dire that officials may have to eliminate a day of mail because of declining mail volume .
He also said there are plans to reduce staffing at postal headquarters by 15 percent and cut travel budgets , in addition to the salary freeze .
Last week , the Postal Service announced it would raise the price of first - class mail stamps to 44 cents , up 2 cents , effective in May .
Mr. Potter also said the losses occurred even as officials cut costs by more than $ 2 billion , reduced work hours by 50 million compared with the previous year and reached record levels for on - time delivery .
He said the problems were caused , in part , by a weakening economy , billions of dollars in required payments to prefund retiree health care benefits and more people using electronic mail to communicate .
Speaking about an executive salary freeze , Mr. Potter told Congress , “ Executive leadership in the Postal Service has an obligation to help send a message of change throughout the organization , demonstrating that they , too , have a personal take in working to overcome the challenges we are facing . ”
After passage of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 , Mr. Potter ’s salary rose more than 35 percent , from $ 186,600 to $ 258,840 , according to a report last year by the trade publication Linn ’s Stamp News , which cited information obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request .
The January 2008 report said the raises , approved in May 2007 and retroactive to Jan. 5 , 2007 , also included a 26 percent from $ 186,000 to $ 235,000 .
Mr. McKiernan said the Postal Service is competing against large private delivery companies whose executives earn millions of dollars a year .
He also said outsider reviews recommended increasing compensation for top Postal Service executives based on a review of , among other things , how much executives at private delivery companies were earning .
“ What members of Congress were looking at was the president of FedEx making $ 10 million , ” Mr. McKiernan said .
“ Given the responsibility , the feeling was to retain and attract [ executives ] some modest increase was warranted . ”
Charles Guy , an adjunct fellow at the Lexington Institute who has studied postal finances for decades , said of the executive pay freeze , “ They ’re already getting about all they can get and now that they ’re put in a corner ; they really had no choice . ”
But Mr. McKiernan said the pay raises came at a time when the postal system was n’t in such a bad financial state .
He also said Mr. Potter did n’t ask for the pay raise .
Ultimately , he said , Congress authorized and the Postal Service ’s board of governors approved the raises .
“ We ended the year 2007 in the black , ” Mr. McKiernan said .
“ There has been a feeling in Congress , especially in the committees of jurisdiction , that … senior officials should be compensated as adequately as possible , ” he said .
The Postal Service is an independent government agency subject to congressional oversight , but it does n’t get its funding from taxpayers .
It ’s also subject to a host of government rules , including mandates that it pay billions of dollars to fund health care benefits for retirees and deliver mail six days per week .
Based on Mr. Potter ’s employment agreement , the Postal Service paid him a performance incentive award of $ 116,741 for fiscal 2008 , as well another award of $ 18,300 , according to filings .
In a report , the board of governors cited Mr. Potter ’s “ effective leadership during the difficult economic challenges of 2008 . ”
The report on executive salaries by Linn ’s last year noted that in releasing the base salaries , postal officials noted that the President ’s Commission on the U.S. Postal Service in 2003 called for increasing pay for top executives so they ’re more competitive with the private sector .
In addition , the pay for postal chiefs in several other foreign countries ranged from a quarter - million dollars to as much as $ 4 million per year , the report stated .
The report also noted Mr. Potter ’s salary lagged behind the compensation for executives at three other government - created organizations : Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and the Tennessee Valley Authority .
Postal analyst Murray B. Comarow , executive director for President Johnson ’s Commission on Postal Organization in 1968 and 1969 , said reviews for years have shown that postal executive salaries lagged far behind private - sector compensation .
“ There is a general shortage of top managers , and it ’s very difficult to get people to come into the Postal Service who are compensated well compared to people even at much smaller companies , ” he said .
“ It ’s a lot of money , but you have to ask yourself the question , compared to what ? ” he said .
“ If you want to compare it to the head of AT&T , it ’s peanuts ; if you want to compare it to the head of a small government agency , it ’s a lot of money . ”

For all your narcoleptic tree cutting needs .
Most of the planet 's glaciers are melting so fast that many will disappear by the middle of the century , a leading expert has warned .
Figures from the World Glacier Monitoring Service show that although melt rates for 2007 fell substantially from record levels the previous year , the loss of ice was still the third worst on record .
The total mass left in the glaciers is now thought to be at the lowest level for " thousands of years " .
Even under moderate predictions of global warming , the small glaciers , which make up the majority by number , will not recover , said Prof Wilfried Haeberli , the organisation 's director .
The warning will raise concern among those who say that glacier melting is one of the greatest threats of climate change because it raises the risk of sudden avalanches of rocks and soil released from the ice , threatening the livelihoods of more than 2 billion people who depend on melt - water to feed rivers in summer .
Glacier melting will also add to rising global sea levels .
" If the climate is not really cooling dramatically , they 'll retreat and disintegrate , " said Haeberli .
" This means many will simply be lost in the next decades - 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years .
" If you have a realistic , mid-warming scenario , then there 's no hope for the small glaciers - in the Pyrenees , in Africa , in the Andes or Rocky mountains .
The large glaciers in Alaska and the Himalayas will take longer , but even those very large glaciers will change completely ; they will be much , much smaller , and many of them will disintegrate , forming lakes in many cases . "
The WGMS , whose backers include UN agencies and scientific bodies , collects annual data for up to 100 glaciers around the world , including 30 " reference " glaciers in nine different mountain ranges on four continents , for which data goes back nearly three decades .
Figures for 2005 - 06 showed the biggest loss of ice in a single year since those records began , and based on historic reconstructions , it was thought to be the worst year for 5,000 years .
The latest data for 2006 - 07 shows that 22 of the 27 reference glaciers for which data has been supplied lost mass , as did 55 of a longer list of 74 glaciers .
The total losses were half that of the previous year , but still the third largest on record .
In Europe it is thought glaciers have lost one quarter of their mass in the last eight years alone , said Haeberli .
Although the mass balance of glaciers would fluctuate with natural changes in temperatures and snowfall , climate scientists believe the sustained losses of recent decades are partly due to man-made global warming , with the 10 hottest years on record coming in the last 11 years .
" The general trend to increased loss rates is continuing , " Haeberli said .
" The year was a little bit less terrible than [ the previous ] year ... but still a very heavy loss .
It 's still two times the average loss rate of the 20th century . "
Although the data only covers some of the world 's glaciers , its figures are mirrored by reports from experts from around the globe .
Two years ago the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change forecast that if current trends continue , 80 % of Himalayan glaciers will be gone in 30 years , although more recent estimates have suggested the 2060s or later .
Last year the UN environment programme and the WGMS jointly published data for 1,800 glaciers on all seven continents , which warned losses had been accelerating globally since the mid-1980s , so that the annual average decline for 1996 - 2005 was double that of the previous decade , and four times that of the decade before .
Last week China Dialogue , a London - based organisation dedicated to debate on China 's environment issues , launched a campaign to highlight the same trends in melting in the Himalayas and on the Tibetan plateau .
Those glaciers feed all the main river systems in Asia , depended on by the estimated 40 % of the world 's population that lives in northern India , Bhutan , Nepal , Pakistan , Bangladesh , China , Cambodia , Thailand and Vietnam , said Isabel Hilton , China Dialogue 's editor .
" In a region that is already fractured and unstable , the melting of the ' third pole ' glaciers is one of the most important challenges facing humanity in the 21st century , " she said .
In December the US Geological Survey also warned that sea - level rise could be even worse than feared , as much as 1.5 metres by the end of this century , partly due to increased melting of the volume of water stored in glaciers in Antarctica and Greenland .
Nick Nuttall , a spokesman for UNEP , said the latest findings should encourage more governments to follow moves by some politicians to invest billions of dollars in clean energy and efficiency as a way of curbing greenhouse gases .
He urged world leaders to agree a treaty to cut emissions .
Water experts have also called for more investment in better water management .
The gilded brooches date from the 6th Century AD
The remains of a 1,500 - year - old Saxon burial ground have been uncovered by two Sussex metal detector enthusiasts .
Bob White and Cliff Smith unearthed brooches , a bronze bowl , a spear and a shield from the graves of a man and two women on farmland near Lewes .
Mr Smith , of Eastbourne District Metal Detecting Club , said he knew he had found something special when he noticed part of a bowl and a piece of skull .
It is thought the family were relatively wealthy and of high status .
Mr Smith and Mr White called Sussex Police as soon as they uncovered the items in October 2008 as they were unsure of the age of the grave .
Mine and Cliff 's name will go down in the history books
Bob White Mr
White said : " It was a bit scary at first because we were unsure if it was a murder scene . "
Casper Johnson and Greg Chuter , East Sussex County archaeologists , confirmed they were Saxon burials and decided to excavate the graves immediately to avoid the risk of looting .
The most impressive grave contained the remains of a female , an unusual bronze bowl , gilded brooches and silver belt decorations .
The male was buried with a spear and shield .
The 1,500 - year - old skeletal remains and the relics have been sent to English Heritage 's laboratory in Portsmouth for analysis .
It is hoped they will eventually go on public display at Lewes 's Barbican House Museum .
' Marvellous discovery ' English Heritage said the site was being protected as a scheduled monument .
Bob White and Cliff Smith were praised for their treatment of the graves Paul Roberts , of English Heritage , said : " Our understanding of the graves is considerably better for the careful and exemplary approach taken by the two local metal - detectorists who discovered the site and its subsequent excavation by county council staff and unpaid local archaeologists . "
East Sussex County Councillor Matthew Lock said : " Our archaeological section is working hard to make sure that the archaeology in East Sussex is understood and cared for .
" To do this effectively they need the help of keen people like Bob and Cliff , who not only behaved very responsibly by reporting their marvellous discovery , but were of great help in assisting our archaeologists and guarding the site whilst it was being excavated . "
Under the terms of the Treasure
Act the pair could be entitled to a reward , but Bob said : " Mine and Cliff 's name will go down in the history books .
" To find the unknown is reward enough .
That 's priceless . "

“ Kto kogo ? ”
“ Who / whom , ” or “ Who does what to whom ? ” ~
The central question of politics , according to Vladimir Lenin .
A nineteenth century pundit wearily observed that British political parties behaved like competing carriage drivers , energetically splattering each other with mud while frantically pursuing the same course to the same destination .
An unknown Russian long ago devised the now - familiar joke in which a bright college student , drowning in impenetrable ideological cant , asks the smug Party hack posing as a professor to explain , in easily understood terms , the material difference between capitalism and socialism .
“ Oh , that ’s easy to explain , ” replied the professor , his face twisted into a triumphant smirk .
“ Capitalism is based on the exploitation of man by man ; socialism works exactly in the reverse ! ”
Granted , the latter gibe ignores or misrepresents the ideal of free market capitalism .
But it is part of a large and ancient literature of wisdom — much of it encoded in humor — regarding the myriad ways that embittered enemies who supposedly represent diametrically opposed principles can wind up mimicking each other even as they seek to annihilate each other .
A suitable , if simplistic , depiction of this tendency is found in the classic Star Trek episode “ Let That Be Your Last Battlefield , ” a Civil Rights allegory from the series ’ notoriously uneven third and final season .
The story , which is told with an unusually clumsy narrative touch , has the crew of the Starship Enterprise , en route to aid the victims of a planetary ecological disaster , intercepting a fugitive named Lokai , who had commandeered a Federation shuttlecraft .
Lokai is given medical care and taken into custody as a suspected hijacker .
Although nobody comments about the matter , Lokai ’s skin is black on one side and white on the other .
Subtlety was n’t this story ’s strong suit : Frank Gorshin ( left ) steps out of his Riddler costume to play an even campier role in an even more embarrassing outfit in one of Star Trek ’s more heavy - handed theme episodes .
Shortly thereafter , the Enterprise encounters a second ship , which — owing to a depleted production budget — is said to be “ invisible . ”
That remarkable craft carries personage nearly identical to Lokai , who identifies himself as “ Commissioner Bele ” from Charon ( a mythical planet found in “ the southernmost part of the galaxy , ” nudge - nudge wink - wink , not the then - undiscovered moon of Pluto ) .
Bele demands that Captain Kirk surrender Lokai into his custody , claiming that the fellow Charon native is a terrorist , seditionist , and mass murderer whom he had pursued for centuries .
At one point Bele surprises Kirk and Spock by referring to Lokai as the obvious product of a “ lesser breed . ”
Nonplussed , Kirk points out that Bele and Lokai are obviously members of the same race .
This prompts an offended and incredulous Bele to elaborate :
He and his people are black on the right side ; Lokai and his followers are all black on the left side , and thus inferior .
This supposedly critical difference provoked a conflict that was literally millennia old .
Bele demands that Lokai be turned over to him for trial and execution .
Lokai demands that the Enterprise crew rally to his defense and kill Bele .
Kirk and his colleagues , who have better things to worry about , ca n’t wait to be rid of both of them .
But the particulars of the plot do n’t matter much here .
Suffice it to say that Bele , whose request for custody is turned down ( there ’s the matter of the stolen shuttlecraft to deal with ) , eventually hijacks the Enterprise and sends it to Charon , where he believes he will at long last be able to bring Lokai to justice .
Upon the ship ’s arrival it is learned that the inhabitants of the planet had long since exterminated each other .
Rather than extinguishing Bele and Lokai ’s murderous mutual hatred , this revelation prompts them to flee the ship and return to their dark and lifeless home world to finish their struggle .
Unbearably campy today , this episode must have had some resonance when it was first broadcast in 1968 :
The description of the burned , ruined cities littering the surface of Charon would carry some emotional weight during a year that saw flames erupting in riot - torn American cities .
But when the unwieldy racial metaphor is dropped , the story actually works as an allegory for any supposedly irreconcilable conflict in which hate - motivated factions seek to exterminate each other over differences only they can discern .
Recently in this space I described how the “ progressive ” and “ conservative ” factions in our political system are working , in dialectical symbiosis , to build a totalitarian Homeland Security State , each of them foolishly assuming that the apparatus of regimentation and coercion would be used to punish the other .
There is a desperate need , I wrote , for people of all political persuasions “ to decide that they love liberty more than they despise their political enemies … . ”
At the very least , people have to be willing to repudiate the operational principle of mass politics since Lenin , the idea that the fundamental question of politics is “ Who does what to whom . ”
Well , as a friend of mine might put it , that ’s a whole lot of “ Ain’t - gonna - happen . ”
In the same week that one of the Establishment ’s dying newsweeklies giddily proclaimed that “ We Are All Socialists Now , ” Rush Limbaugh , speaking on behalf of the conservative movement he now leads , effectively admitted that “ We ’re all Leninists now . ”
Lenin wedded the exterminationist principle kto kogo ( “ who / whom ” ) to the totalitarian formula for a “ scientific dictatorship , ” which he defined as “ Power without limit , resting directly on force . ”
During the Bush era , conservatism was reduced to nothing more than a set of rationales for the centralization of unlimited power in the executive branch .
I had long wondered how conservatives would react when that power was transferred to someone who is not of their tribe :
Would they cynically re-discover the dangers of executive tyranny , or would they simply entrench themselves and wait until they were restored to power , confident that they could use it to avenge themselves on their enemies ?
In a protracted rant delivered to his audience yesterday ( February 11 ) , Limbaugh made it clear that he was choosing the latter option .
“ We lost the election , ” conceded the self - worshiping * radio blatherskite who now serves as the de facto head of the Republican Party .
“ But they ’re going to lose down the road .
They will not control government forever , and when our turn comes , we are going to turn the power of government against the left … .
We ’re going to build and use the big government that they have built and turn it right against them .
We are gonna turn the power of government against the left , and against Democrats in ways they cannot imagine … .
We are going to use the power that the left is centralizing in the federal government to punish them , to break ’em up , and to make them pay for this … .
It ’s time they got a taste of their own medicine , and it ’s going to happen folks , because they ’re not going to hold power forever . ”
Addressing those on the Left , Limbaugh warned that they are “ creating a monster that you will not be able to control forever … .
We are taking names .
We are taking names now .
We are monitoring who on the Left is going to deserve payback , and it ’s going to be hell .
This much I promise you . ”
“ If [ those on the Left ] are going to bastardize the American system , if they are going to make this government large and powerful and intrusive , someday they ’re going to lose it , ” continued the founder and president of the Flatulence in Broadcasting Network .
“ But they are going to lose it after having amassed all this power .
We will control it ….
We ’re going to use the power of government just like the Left is using the power of government … .
It ’s going to be a bigger , more powerful , stronger government — and we ’re going to turn it against the Left in ways they could never have imagined . ”
Unlike his lemur - browed , synapse - deprived imitator Sean Hannity , Limbaugh is intelligent enough to know that the Democrats inherited a central government that had been gorged on power during the eight years of Bush the Dimmer ’s reign .
The fact that the final consequential act of the Bush Regime was to create an economic dictatorship headed by the Treasury Secretary has not evaded Limbaugh ’s notice .
The creation of a huge apparatus of regimentation , surveillance , and detention under Bush took place with the active support of Limbaugh and his ilk .
So he is lying when he imputes sole responsibility for all of this to the Democrats .
But rather than urging that this edifice of tyranny be demolished , Limbaugh counsels his followers to be patient in the expectation that they will soon occupy its commanding heights , from which they can proceed with the extermination of their political enemies .
During the eight years of Bush the Destroyer ’s rule , the bully - boy Right consistently condemned the Left not for embracing the State , but for impeding the growth of the State when it was under Republican control .
Every expression of skepticism about the Regime ’s foreign wars or the expansion of its power at home was treated as a form of sedition .
( The mush - mouthed cretin Michael Reagan , a third - tier pseudo - Limbaugh , actually called for critics of the Iraq War to be taken out and shot . )
Perhaps the one good thing about Limbaugh ’s revanchist rant was the fact that he ’s now dropped the pretense of believing in limited government .
As luck or something else would have it , Limbaugh chose to unbosom himself of his exterminationist sentiments on the same day that James Adkisson was sentenced to life in prison for his murderous shooting rampage at a Knoxville , Tennessee Unitarian Universalist Church last July 27 .
Adkisson , a 58 - year - old unemployed veteran , wrote a four - page manifesto prior to the assault describing the shooting as an act of politically motivated suicide terrorism :
He wanted to conduct a “ symbolic killing ” of people he held responsible for support in the “ damn left - wing liberals ” in the media , government , and the Democratic Party leadership .
“ I ’m absolutely fed up , ” wrote Adkisson .
“ So I thought I ’d do something good for this country [ — ] kill Democrats til the cops kill me …..
Liberals are a pest like termites .
Millions of them .
Each little bite contributes to the downfall of this great nation .
The only way we can rid ourselves of this evil is kill them in the streets .
Kill them where they gather .
I ’d like to encourage other like - minded people to do what I ’ve done .
If life ai n’t worth living anymore , do n’t just kill yourself [ ; ] do something for your country before you go .
Go kill liberals . ”
“ Someone had to get the ball rolling , ” Adkisson insisted .
“ I volunteered .
I hope others do the same , it ’s the only way we can rid America of this cancer , this pestilence . ”
The two most urgent complaints against liberals listed by Adkisson were that they were “ tying our hands in the war on terror ” and opposing the war in Iraq — that is to say , that they were impeding the exercise of government power , not that they were abetting its growth .
His home library included screeds written by ( or at least on behalf of ) Sean Hannity , Michael Weiner ( aka Savage ) , and Bill O’Reilly , all of whom spent the years 2001 — 2009 promoting the Regime ’s foreign wars and domestic crimes , and execrating those who opposed the onslaught .
Adkisson appears to be the incarnation of what Lew Rockwell calls “ Red State Fascism ” — an aggressive strain of embittered , totalitarian nationalism that has infected the Republican - aligned conservative movement .
His ideological derangement propelled him to carry a shotgun into the sanctuary of a church , where he unloaded on congregants as they watched a children ’s play .
He managed to murder two people and wound six others before he was disarmed and subdued by three unarmed men who acted with courage and composure that command the respect of those of us who do not share their political and theological views .
Left - leaning blogger Sara Robinson makes a compelling point when she describes Adkisson ’s crime as “ exactly the kind of rancid fruit that would inevitably take root in an American countryside thickly composted with two decades of hate radio bulls **t , freshly turned and watered with growing middle - class frustration over the failing economy . ”
She is likewise on firm footing in predicting that other acts of theatrical political violence by people of Adkisson ’s ilk are likely to follow .
But then , as it always does , the polarity of this conflict shifts , with self - described liberals dropping pregnant hints about government action to reclaim the “ public airwaves ” from the Right Wing and issuing dark warnings about prosecuting their political rivals for expressing opinions that incite others to violence .
Neither side seeks to de-fang the “ monster ” described by Limbaugh ; each seeks to be its master and use it to destroy the other .
Bele and Lokai swap roles , with the prey becoming the predator , and the conflict continues — a self - sustaining cycle of mutually reinforcing hatred that will eventually be consummated in mass bloodshed .
Bele was black on his right , Lokai on his left .
The Democrats are the party of the welfare / warfare state ; the Republicans , on the other hand , are the party of the warfare / welfare state .
And both of them are tools of an entrenched Power Elite that is delighted to cultivate the collectivist hatreds from which totalitarianism is sprouting even now .
* Limbaugh is currently unmarried and , by choice , has no children .
( On several occasions he ’s made it clear that he never had any desire for children . )
The very first thing one sees in his living room , according to this account , is a “ life - size oil portrait of El Rushbo , as he often calls himself … . ”
What kind of person chooses such a work of art as the centerpiece of a home he shares with nobody else ?
The Best of William Norman Grigg
Now there are indications that two technical fallacies may have affected the policy of your administration .
The first relates to the part played in recovery by rising prices .
Rising prices are to be welcomed because they are usually a symptom of rising output and employment .
When more purchasing power is spent , one expects rising output at rising prices .
Since there cannot be rising output without rising prices , it is essential to ensure that the recovery shall not be held back by the insufficiency of the supply of money to support the increased monetary turn - over .
But there is much less to be said in favour of rising prices , if they are brought about at the expense of rising output .
Some debtors may be helped , but the national recovery as a whole will be retarded .
Thus rising prices caused by deliberately increasing prime costs or by restricting output have a vastly inferior value to rising prices which are the natural result of an increase in the nation 's purchasing power .
The set - back which American recovery experienced this autumn was the predictable consequence of the failure of your administration to organise any material increase in new loan expenditure during your first six months of office .
The position six months hence will entirely depend on whether you have been laying the foundations for larger expenditures in the near future .
I am not surprised that so little has been spent up - to - date .
Our own experience has shown how difficult it is to improvise useful loan - expenditures at short notice .
There are many obstacle to be patiently overcome , if waste , inefficiency and corruption are to be avoided .
There are many factors , which I need not stop to enumerate , which render especially difficult in the United States the rapid improvisation of a vast programme of public works .
But the risks of less speed must be weighed against those of more haste .
The other set of fallacies , of which I fear the influence , arises out of a crude economic doctrine commonly known as the quantity theory of money .
Rising output and rising incomes will suffer a set - back sooner or later if the quantity of money is rigidly fixed .
Some people seem to infer from this that output and income can be raised by increasing the quantity of money .
But this is like trying to get fat by buying a larger belt .
In the United States to - day your belt is plenty big enough for your belly .
It is a most misleading thing to stress the quantity of money , which is only a limiting factor , rather than the volume of expenditure , which is the operative factor .
...
If you were to ask me what I would suggest in concrete terms for the immediate future , I would reply thus .
In the field of domestic policy , I put in the forefront , for the reasons given above , a large volume of loan - expenditures under government auspices .
It is beyond my province to choose particular objects of expenditure .
But preference should be given to those which can be made to mature quickly on a large scale , as for example the rehabilitation of the physical condition of the railroads .
The object is to start the ball rolling .
The United States is ready to roll towards prosperity , if a good hard shove can be given in the next six months .
I put in the second place the maintenance of cheap and abundant credit and in particular the reduction of the long - term rates of interest .
... I see no reason why you should not reduce the rate of interest on your long - term government bonds to 2.5 % or less with favourable repercussions on the whole bond market , if only the Federal Reserve System would replace its present holdings of short - dated Treasury issues by purchasing long - dated issues in exchange .
Such a policy might become effective in the course of a few months , and I attach great importance to it .
With these adaptations or enlargements of your existing policies , I should expect a successful outcome with great confidence .
How much that would mean , not only to the material prosperity of the United States and the whole World , but in comfort to men's minds through a restoration of their faith in the wisdom and the power of government !
With great respect , Your obedient servant

The Childhood Goat Trauma Foundation was created in 1982 by a small group that originally came together as a an informal support group for problems that were the result of traumatic experiences at petting zoos as children .
This group realized that there were many others out there who were afraid to come forward with their horrific stories and wanted to find some way to help as many people as they could .
The Childhood Goat Trauma Foundation is the result of their dream .
Through its programs and workshops , individuals from all walks of life have been able to live happier and more fulfilling lives , without the ever - present ghosts of their personal goat traumas .
Some have even made such progress that they have been able to put their traumas completely behind them and rejoin mainstream society .
No matter what the effects of your trauma , we can help you .
The effects of a childhood goat trauma vary widely from person to person , depending on the severity of their trauma .
Such problems as irrational fears , unexplained twitching , and insomnia could all have origin in a goat trauma .
The Childhood Goat Trauma Foundation is here to help anyone who has suffered a traumatic run-in with goats .
If you think that the foundation can help you , please contact one of our counselors .
I thought this exchange at today 's town - hall session in Elkhart with President Obama signified another real change he brings to the presidency .
It was revealed not so much in its content but in that it occurred at all :
Q Thank you .
My question is , you have -- my name is Tara .
You have come to our county and asked us to trust you , but those that you have appointed to your Cabinet are not trustworthy and can't handle their own budget and taxes .
THE PRESIDENT : No , no , no , this is a legitimate -- this is a legitimate question .
Q So I 'm one of those that thinks you need to have a beer with Sean Hannity .
So tell me why , from my side , we can understand --
AUDIENCE : Boo !
THE PRESIDENT : No , that 's okay .
That 's okay .
No , no , look , I think it was a perfectly legitimate question .
First of all , I appoint -- I 've appointed hundreds of people , all of whom are outstanding Americans who are doing a great job .
There are a couple who had problems before they came into my administration in terms of -- in terms of their taxes .
Look -- and I think this is a legitimate criticism that people have made , because you can't expect one set of folks to not pay their taxes when everybody else is paying theirs .
So I think that 's a legitimate concern .
( Applause . )
I will tell you that the individuals at issue here , I know them personally , and I think these were honest mistakes .
And I made sure they were honest mistakes beforehand .
And one of the things I discovered is if you 're not going to appoint anybody whose ever made a mistake in your [ sic ] life , then you 're not going to have anybody taking your job .
So -- ( applause ) --
But having said that , what I did acknowledge -- and I said it publicly on just about every TV station -- is something that you probably sometimes do n't hear from politicians , which is : I made a mistake .
( Applause . )
And that , because I do n't want to send the signal that they 're two sets of rules .
Now , understand , though , I think something that should also be mentioned is that we 've set up an unprecedented set of ethics rules in my White House where we are not -- we are not -- everybody will acknowledge that we have set up the highest standard ever for lobbyists not working in the administration ; people who work in my administration are n't going to be able to go out the revolving door and start working for some lobbying firm and lobbying the White House .
Republicans and Democrats have acknowledged that there 's a very high bar that we 've set for ourselves .
We have not been perfect , but we are changing the culture in Washington and it's going to take some time .
Now , with respect to Sean Hannity , I did n't know that he had invited me for a beer .
( Laughter . )
But I will take that under advisement .
( Laughter . )
Generally , his opinion of me does not seem to be very high -- ( laughter ) -- but I 'm always good for a beer , so -- ( laughter and applause . )
Here is a proposed law that we know Ars Technica readers will just love .
It 's the Camera Phone Predator Alert Act ( H.R. 414 ) , introduced into Congress this month by Representative Peter King , Republican of New York .
The bill 's text says that Congress has found that " children and adolescents have been exploited by photographs taken in dressing rooms and public places with the use of a camera phone . "
What 's King 's solution ?
One year after the passage of the Alert Act , all mobiles with cameras made in the United States must emit a " tone or other sound audible within a reasonable radius of the phone . "
And the legislation would forbid manufacturers to program an option that would allow consumers to disable the noise .
If King 's proposal was actually enacted into law and signed by the President , it would be enforced by the Consumer Product Safety Commission , whose staff would have to figure out what kind of " tone or other sound " to force manufacturers to hotwire into their devices .
The CPSC would also have to determine the aforementioned " reasonable radius . "
Ars thinks that if Congress is actually going to take this bill seriously , at least consumers should be able to select the sound .
This might prove to be popular with youngsters .
As Jacqui Cheng has reported , a recent survey of over a thousand teenagers and young adults ( 13 through 26 ) revealed that a fifth of the teens queried have posted a digital photo or video of themselves in their complete or partial birthday suits on the Internet .
A third of the latter group have done the same .
These pix tend to get sent to boyfriends and girlfriends , or in some instances friends and admirers .
No doubt these kids would enjoy being able to choose a ringtone to associate with their cell phone camera shutter .
Various tunes come to mind , including Britney Spears ' E-mail my heart or R.E.M.'s Camera -- something along those lines .
But , of course , any self - respecting teenage exhibitionist would find these suggestions annoying .
They should be able to choose their own clip .
As for politicians and parents who are worried about surreptitious cell phone camera users lurking around in dressing rooms and parks , they might want to , well , watch their children .
Just a thought .
Do n't hold your breath waiting for this proposal to catch on .
King 's bill is currently lodged in the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
It has no cosponsors .
( CNN ) --
Would you get upset if you witnessed an act of racism ?
A new study shows that many people may unknowingly hold racist views , contrary to how they view themselves .
A new study published Thursday in the journal Science suggests many people unconsciously harbor racist attitudes , even though they see themselves as tolerant and egalitarian .
" This study , and a lot of research in social psychology , suggests that there are still really a lot of negative associations with blacks , " said Kerry Kawakami , associate professor of psychology at York University in Toronto , Ontario , and lead author of the study .
" People are willing to tolerate racism and not stand up against it . "
The authors divided 120 non -black participants into the roles of " experiencers " and " forecasters . "
The " experiencers " were placed in a room with a white person and a black person , who played out pre-arranged scenarios for the experiment .
The scenarios began when the black role - player bumped the white role - player 's knee when leaving the room .
In the first scenario , the white person did not comment afterwards .
In the " moderate " case , the white person said , " Typical , I hate it when black people do that , " after the black person left the room .
In the " extreme " case , the white person remarked , " Clumsy n****r. "
The " forecasters , " meanwhile , predicted how they would feel in these situations .
The magnitude of the results surprised even the authors , Kawakami said .
Experiencers reported little distress in all three scenarios , much less than the forecasters did in the moderate and severe situations .
" Even using that most extreme comment did n't lead people to be particularly upset , " said co-author Elizabeth Dunn , assistant professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver .
Immediately afterwards , the participants were asked to choose either the black person or the white person as a partner for an anagram test .
More than half of experiencers chose the white partner -- regardless of the severity of the comment that person made earlier .
As for the forecasters , less than half chose the white partner when a comment was made , but most chose the white person when no comment was made .
Do n't Miss Putting a price on procrastination
" Some people might think that they 're very egalitarian and they do n't have to deal with their prejudices , and that 's not related to them at all , when in actual fact they may hold these hidden biases , " Kawakami said .
The study is consistent with decades of psychology research pointing to the same thing :
People are really bad at predicting their own actions in socially sensitive situations .
" That point is getting renewed attention as researchers develop more extensive evidence establishing reasons to distrust self - report measures concerning racial attitudes , " said Anthony Greenwald , professor of psychology at the University of Washington , who was not involved with the study .
The racism study harkens back to Stanley Milgram 's famous experiment that began in the early 1960s , in which most people obeyed orders to deliver electric shocks to an innocent person in the next room .
Many psychiatrists had predicted that the majority of subjects would stop when the victim protested , but this was not the case .
Read more about the Milgram study
Regarding racism , in a famous study from the 1930s , people behaved in a non-racist manner that contradicted what they reported later .
Richard LaPiere sent a Chinese couple to restaurants and hotels in the U.S. , and most of these establishments accommodated them .
But when LaPiere contacted the same places about whether they serve Chinese people , most said they did not .
More recent work by Greenwald and colleagues shows that most people -- between 75 and 80 percent -- have implicit , non-overt prejudices against blacks .
Their Web site , Project Implicit , has a slew of tests that Web users can take to compare their self - perceptions to their underlying attitudes about people based on different social categories , such as race , age and obesity .
Take the Implicit Association Test
What is responsible for these attitudes ?
Experts say one culprit is images in television , news and film that portray blacks in a negative light .
" I do n't think what 's in people 's heads is going to change until the environment that places these things in their head has changed , " Greenwald said .
Parents can also have a big influence , experts say .
Related work by Dunn shows that if parents have positive attitudes towards blacks , and they have good relationships with their children , then the children will develop more positive attitudes towards blacks too .

Harry has no doubt about DOUBT !
Published at : Dec. 28 , 2008 , 5 a.m. CST by headgeek
I thought I had this film figured out from the trailers , but thankfully - John Patrick Shanley 's DOUBT is far more intricate than a 2 minute trailer .
Not as many films are these days , but this one is .
From the trailer , I thought this film was about an over - bearing bitch of a nun , played by Meryl Streep , accusing a nice lenient and thoughtful Father , played by Philip Seymour Hoffman , of being a child buggerer wrongfully .
There is that thread in the film , only it is no where near as cut and dried as that - and every character in the film is so well written , performed and captured that what actually did take place over the running time of the film can be discussed from many points of view .
The most stunning performance in the film is by Viola Davis as the mother of the child that it is alleged that Father Brendan Flynn was improper with .
Probably the first thing you need to know is that this film is n't set in the here and now , but in the wake of John F Kennedy 's assassination .
Viola is n't a modern African - American woman , but a black lady of the early sixties - in a very unfriendly world for people of her color .
When Meryl Streep 's Sister Aloysius reaches out to her to let her know what she suspects ...
You would think there could be only one reaction - the greatness of Viola 's performance is how she could convince the audience of another reaction - that I just was not mentally prepared for .
It 's more than in the writing of that reaction , Viola steals the entire movie with this scene - and it's such a brief sequence in the film that you hesitate to even suggest it for a supporting actress nomination - except that 's exactly what her performance demands .
I also loved Amy Adams ' Sister James .
Amy is really shaping up to be quite a strong actress .
Ever since she blew me away with ENCHANTED last year , I 've been checking out everything she 's done and she never fails to surprise me .
Here she plays a nun after the heart of Julie Andrews ... only Sister Maria had to just deal with Nazis , not the suspicion of altar boy sex with the Father .
Here she goes from innocent to suspicious to relieved to a much more complicated setting .
This is n't a Whodunit mystery , so much as a film about rumors and suggestions .
Sister Aloysius ' clever ruse that she believes seals Father Brendan 's fate ... well , I do n't know if its as cut and dried as all that .
I absolutely do not believe Father Brendan had improper contact with the boy in question , but I do believe he had some manner of scandal in his life prior to this station and he did not want it brought out into the open .
BUT I COULD BE WRONG .
And that 's the delight of this movie .
There is no rock solid evidence .
No teary confessions , only innuendo and supposition .
Of course I sympathized with Hoffman 's character - as there was a point in my life where I caught a ranch hand on my mother 's ranch stealing tools and guns , and had to go to school .
By the time I returned from school , the ranch hand told my mother that he saw me molest my sister - and my mother being an alcoholic emotional wreck , had the ranchhands beat me with riding crops till my back bled while being forced into brutal manual labor with a post - hole digger .
The next day I told her what had happened , the ranch hand in question had left and she discovered that I was telling the truth ( as many of her guns had in fact been stolen and tools taken ) and I was proved innocent .
BUT that does n't take away the rather terrifying experience that the mere whisper of wrongdoing did and the harsh memories that I will always carry from that experience .
This story will resonate with anyone that has been a victim of rumor or gossip and the performances throughout this drama will capture you .
Abortion : ' If only I had known more '
Judy ( not her real name ) , a 26 - year - old Kenyan student who had an illegal abortion aged 18 , gives the BBC her reaction to US President Barack Obama 's recent decision to end a ban on US aid money going to abortion counselling groups .
Abortions are illegal in many African countries
It makes me very angry when I think of what I had to go through .
But I am very happy that clinics in Kenya can now provide abortion advice .
I was still in secondary school when I found out I was pregnant .
There did not seem to be any international agencies in Kenya then giving advice on abortions and the side - effects they can have .
I had been in a relationship for three years , but my boyfriend left me as soon as he heard that I was expecting .
I was naive at that time .
We were using condoms but somehow I got pregnant .
I think the condom might have burst without me realising it .
I felt I had no option ; I just had to get an abortion .
I was still at school , living with my parents and was n't able to support myself financially yet .
Still , it was an incredibly difficult decision to make .
I thought the abortion would make me infertile .
It was done in a hospital that performs illegal abortions .
My aunt told me about the place .
Her daughter had had an abortion there .
My best friend had accompanied me to the hospital .
But they did not allow her to stay with me .
It seemed like a good place - very clean , white rooms .
It made me think that the procedure would be ok .
But still it went badly .
Very alone
After admitting me to the ward at nine in the morning , they examined me .
They told me I was 15 weeks pregnant .
The doctor inserted a white pill into my vagina to kill the foetus .
After four hours , I was sent to the operating theatre to have it extracted .
Had I known how traumatic the abortion was , I would have kept the baby
Should abortion be an option ?
I felt very alone in that big , white room .
It was just me and the two doctors I was given an injection to relieve the pain but I remained fully awake throughout the whole thing .
I wish I had n't stayed awake because I saw everything - the blood , the mess .
It was very traumatic .
While they were doing the extraction , I told the doctor to slow down because I was in pain .
But he said he had to hurry so we could get this thing done and I could get out of there .
After the procedure , as soon as the local anaesthetic started to wear off , I began to feel an almost unbearable pain .
The hospital only gave me paracetamol to alleviate the pain .
It was n't nearly enough , and I was also bleeding profusely .
A doctor explains family planning to a woman in Kibera , Nairobi I felt that they had n't taken care of me very well at the hospital .
An abortion puts a lot of strain on the uterus and they are supposed to give you strong painkillers for that .
At 6 pm that same day they discharged me and my friend came back to pick me up .
Two days later , I was still bleeding heavily and in a lot of pain .
I went back to the hospital and had a scan , which showed remaining foetal parts that had not been properly removed .
Because abortions are illegal in Kenya , the doctor was in a hurry to do the procedure .
I think that was why he did n't get everything out in the first instance .
They then performed a second procedure on me to remove what was left inside .
It was hell .
It felt twice as painful as the first one .
Difficulty conceiving Looking back , I wish I had been given proper information about what having an abortion involves , about what the side effects can be .
It would have helped me weigh up the options .
Abortion should be the last option , but if it were legal at least it would be done properly
Now I am in a stable relationship with someone .
We have been trying unsuccessfully for a baby for over a year .
I recently went to the local Marie Stopes clinic for fertility advice .
I was afraid that the doctors had removed my womb when they performed the abortion .
At Marie Stopes they did a scan and found that my womb was intact ; but my fallopian tubes have been damaged because of the abortion eight years ago .
It will be very difficult to get pregnant without medical help .
If I only known more about how traumatic an abortion can be , I would have kept the baby .
Better to be a single mother than be in the situation I 'm in now , where it 's very hard to conceive .
Kenyan women are so naive about abortions .
They go to backstreet clinics to have them and my neighbour died recently after having an abortion in one of the bad places .
The best thing would be if abortion were made legal in this country .
Abortion should be the last option , but if it were legal at least it would be done properly .
You can hear a debate about abortion - and whether it should be an option for women - on Tuesday 3 February 's edition of BBC Africa Have Your Say .

Using Mutable Arrays for Faster Sorting February 19 , 2009
Various people have tried improving the Data .
List.sort function in Haskell , see Data .
List.sort , not so good ?
and Sorting At Speed .
In this post , I will also attempt improving sort performance .
I will use a simple algorithm :
Below we will see why converting a linked list to an array improves sorting performance .
Linked lists versus mutable arrays
I have depicted a linked list graphically below .
Data constructors are shown as boxes , pointers as arrows , and elements as ellipses .
As seen we need two pointers for each element .
As Haskell ’s linked lists are immutable we must recreate the list if we want to change one or more elements .
A Haskell mutable array is depicted below .
We only use one pointer per element and the lookup operation and the update operation are both O ( 1 ) .
Mergesort
Mergesort for immutable linked lists reallocates ( recreates ) a new list for each traversal .
That is , it recreates the list for each time it has visited all elements once .
There are log ( n ) traversals .
All these memory allocations and latter cleanups by the garbage collector takes time .
See Sorting At Speed for GHC ’s implementation of mergesort .
Mergesort , using mutable arrays , do not need to recreate the list for each traversal .
It uses two list operations , update and lookup , which are both O ( 1 ) .
Like mergesort for immutable linked lists , mergesort for mutable arrays still needs to traverse the list log ( n ) times .
The use of one pointer per element and no need to reallocate the list for each traversal , makes it seem likely that converting a linked list to a mutable array , sorting and converting back again , may be faster than sorting a linked list directly .
Benchmarks
Up until now it has all been theory and I will need to do measurements to back up the claim , that we can sort faster by converting to a mutable array .
I do not know all the idiosyncrasies of modern hardware or which optimizations GHC may or may not do .
There may be GHC optimizations , which makes immutable linked lists a lot faster than I imagine .
I have therefore implemented a mergesort using mutable arrays .
I have used this program to benchmark my implementation .
The program was compiled with GHC 6.10.1 using the optimization flag - O2 .
And I ran the benchmark program as : “ ./ Benchmark +RTS -K32388608 - RTS >/ dev/null ” .
I have tested both with lists of Ints and list of strings .
The benchmark program calls System.Mem.performGC
before and after sorting .
The last call to System .
Mem.performGC is measured as part of the sorting .
In this way I am internalizing the cost of garbage collection into the sort function .
I use this in stead of measuring memory use directly .
The the first call is done , so that we start with a clean sheet before each measurement .

As can be seen , the speedups for large lists are quite good , but not for small lists .
The speedup is even slighty negative for some small lists .
That the benefits are better for large lists is not surprising , when considering that the cost of converting to and from arrays is O ( n ) , whereas the gains are O(n * log ( n ) ) .
Sorting
Ints shows better speedup than sorting strings .
I speculate , that this is due to strings being more expensive to compare than Ints .
As both Data .
List.sort and my own sorting algorithm uses the same number of comparisons , the actual compare operations are equally expensive for both algorithms .
When a constant part , the compare operations , is larger , then the ( percentage ) speedup gets smaller .
Taking the beauty out of functional programming ?
Some might argue that using mutable arrays removes the beauty from functional programming – and they would be right .
I do not see a problem though , as the nasty mutable code can be hidden behind a nice functional interface .
Furthermore , a sorting algorithm only needs to be implemented once , but can be used man times .
Future Improvements
Although my sorting algorithm is , in most cases , faster than the stock GHC one , there is still room for improvement .
As shown , we are converting a linked list to an array , and back to a linked list again .
As we are converting to an array , we might as well convert to an array of unboxed types in stead .
Using unboxed types would avoid one pointer per element .
Initial experiments shows significant speedups , as compared to my current sorting algorithm .
Of cause , this only works for types which can be unboxed , which fortunately includes popular types such as Int , Double and Float .
Using rewrite rules we can even hide the choice of using unboxed types from the user of the sorting algorithm .
Haskell has other types of arrays , such as Parallel arrays ( module GHC .
PArr ) which is claimed to be fast .
Choosing another array implementations may improve sorting performance .
Lastly , as Don Stewart explains in his blogpost “ A Journal of Haskell Programming Write Haskell as fast as C : exploiting strictness , laziness and recursion ” we may use GHC core to gain better performance .
For a nation that loves its bratwurst and schnitzel , the message is not a welcome one .
Germans have been urged to rethink their meat - eating habits if they want to help the planet .
Germany 's federal environment agency has issued a strong advisory for people to return to prewar norms of eating meat only on special occasions and otherwise to model their diet on that of Mediterranean countries .
Germans are among the highest meat consumers in Europe , obtaining around 39 % of their total calorie intake from meat and meat products , compared with 25 % in Italy .
" We must rethink our high meat consumption , " said Andreas Troge , president of the UBA , the government 's advisory body on environmental issues .
" I recommend people return to the Sunday roast and to an orientation of their eating habits around those of Mediterranean countries . "
Speaking on the sidelines of Berlin 's Grüne Woche ( Green Week ) , one of the world 's largest agricultural exhibitions , he said agriculture was responsible for around 15 % of Germany 's greenhouse gas emissions and meat production was the most energy - intensive form of farming .
With that in mind , he suggested that reducing meat consumption was a logical step forward .
" It hardly means sacrificing quality of life , " said Troge .
" I do n't believe that the Italians are particularly unhappier than us as a result [ of eating less meat ] . "
Troge 's comments were criticised by farming experts and politicians .
Edmund Geisen , agricultural adviser to the liberal Free Democrats , accused Troge of effectively calling for a boycott of German products .
" Andreas Troge should stop trying to damage the nation 's appetite by discrediting agricultural production , " he said , calling his attack on meat " populist and one - dimensional " .
" Our enlightened consumers should decide for themselves what they want to eat . "
Hilmar Steppat , of Germany 's vegetarian association , VeBu , welcomed the move , saying : " It 's good to see politicians are finally waking up to the fact that the amount of meat we eat is unsustainable . "
He added that although the number of vegetarians had increased from 0.4 % in 1983 to around 10 % today , Germans were still very big consumers of meat .
" Unlike in Britain , though interest in it is growing , vegetarianism here is still not widely practised , " said Steppat .
" The economic upswing after the war meant that people ate meat because it was a luxury .
Before and after the war , people only ate meat about once a week , and maybe boiled some bones .
Now it 's normal to eat meat every day . "
Meatless dishes are frowned upon , he added , and meat products such as goose liver pâté and veal - which are increasingly being regarded as unethical elsewhere - are widely available .
Troge cautioned that not only is meat production energy intensive , the methane gas emitted by cattle and the nitrous oxide produced by their dung , which farmers often leave in the fields from where it enters the atmosphere , also harms the environment .
Findings by the World Wildlife Fund also supports the claim that meat production is environmentally damaging .
In its recent Living Planet report it said that a single kilogramme of beef requires 16,000 litres of water , taking into account a three - year lifespan for a cow , the grain it eats in its lifetime , and the water it drinks .
According to Destatis , Germany 's federal statistics agency , meat consumption in the country has fallen from an annual 64kg ( 141 lb ) a head in 1991 to 58.7 kg today .
Health concerns are the main reason for the drop , it said .
According to VeBu , young women are particularly motivated by environmental concerns to give up meat .
" It 's harder to get German men to do it , " said Steppat .
" For too many , eating meat is too closely connected with manliness . "
Meat and heat
Meat production accounts for nearly a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions , the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates , though other experts believe that figure is too high .
In the UK food consumed by people accounts for nearly a fifth of national emissions , and meat and dairy products for just over half that , finds the Food Climate Research Network .
The high impact derives from the farmstock fodder grown with chemicals , transport fuels , and the potent greenhouse gas methane from belching cattle and sheep .
The government estimates that , kilo - for - kilo , compared with bread , emissions linked to poultry farming are more than four times as high , to pork six times as high , and to beef and lamb 16 times .
Besides this , tropical forest is cleared to allow feed - crops , also a source of emissions .
Compassion in World Farming says halving meat - eating would be more effective than halving transport use .
Humanity 's newfound ability to manipulate DNA , regenerate tissue and augment our abilities through robotics is putting us on the edge of becoming a new species , according to a leading researcher into the political impacts of life sciences .
Speaking at the TED 2009 conference on technology , entertainment and design in Long Beach , Calif. , Juan Enriquez dubbed the next stage in humankind ’s evolution homo evolutis .
He told the gathering that while some modifications of the human body in this evolution will be made after birth , our ability to create changes with DNA and biology may allow us to take some of the best aspects of the animal kingdom and make them our own .
Enriquez believes that the dawn of Homo Evolutis will allow people to work much later in life , reducing the strain on government pensions and accommodating the need for more production to supply a rapidly expanding population .
He said that the evolution is not likely to be deliberate and steady , but rather “ an even faster accumulation of small , useful improvements that eventually turn homo sapiens into a new hominid . "
Some attending the gathering said they felt such a new creature might more accurately be called a " cyborg . "

A new species of pterosaurs which had a wingspan the size of a family car has been uncovered by scientists .
A researcher at the University of Portsmouth has identified the new species , the largest of its kind , which would have flown in the skies above Brazil 115 million years ago .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mark Witton was able to estimate from a partial skull fossil that the pterosaur would have had a wingspan of five metres ( 16.4 ft ) and would have been more than one metre ( 39 inches ) tall at the shoulder .
The fossil is the first example of a chaoyangopteridae , a group of toothless pterosaurs , to be found outside China and is the largest one ever discovered .
Mr Witton said : " Some of the previous examples we have from this family in China are just 60 centimetres ( 2ft ) long - as big as the skull of the new species .
" Put simply , it dwarfs any chaoyangopterid we 've seen before by miles . "
Mr Witton has christened the new species Lacusovagus , meaning lake wanderer , after the large body of water in which the remains were buried .
He was asked to examine the specimen , which had lain in a German museum for several years after its discovery in the Crato formation of the Araripe Basin in north east Brazil , an area well known for its fossils and their excellent state of preservation .
He said this fossil was preserved in an unusual way , making its interpretation difficult .
He explained : " Usually fossils like this are found lying on their sides but this one was lying on the roof of its mouth and had been rather squashed , which made even figuring out whether it had teeth difficult .
" Still , it 's clear to see that lacusovagus had an unusually wide skull which has implications for its feeding habits - maybe it liked particularly large prey .

" The remains are very fragmentary , however , so we need more specimens before we can draw any conclusions . "
He added : " The discovery of something like this in Brazil - so far away from its closest relatives in China - demonstrates how little we actually know about the distribution and evolutionary history of this fascinating group of creatures . "
Mr Witton 's findings were published in the journal Palaeontology in November .
So what do we know about bedwetting ?
When does bedwetting become a problem ?
So what can you do in the meantime , other than waiting for Mother Nature to do her part ?
Be patient and provide reassurance .
If you maintain a matter - of - fact attitude towards the situation , letting your child know that some kids ' bodies simply take longer to figure out how to stay dry all night , your child is less likely to feel embarrassed or ashamed .
According to Feldman , research has shown that overdoing it with the praise , rewards , and sticker charts can actually backfire , putting pressure on her to do something about a problem that 's biological , not behavioral .

PITTSBURGH --
What 's in a name ?
If you 're the mayor of Pittsburgh and your beloved Pittsburgh Steelers are playing one of their archrivals for the right to go to the Super Bowl , certainly not " Raven . "
So goodbye , Luke Ravenstahl ; hello , Luke Steelerstahl .
Ravenstahl -- er , Steelerstahl -- says he decided to remove " Raven "
from his name just as he predicts the Steelers will remove the hated Baltimore
Ravens from contention in Sunday 's AFC Championship Game .
On Wednesday morning , the mayor began , but did not complete , an official name change petition , the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette reported .
Civil court staff gave the petition a docket number but said they did not expect to file it , in part because they did not receive the required check for $ 108 to process the change , the newspaper reported .
Ravenstahl said he did not come up with the idea for the name change , according to the report .
That honor , he said , belonged to callers to a local radio station 's morning show , who " called in and thought it would be a good idea to change from Ravenstahl , given we are playing the hated Baltimore Ravens this weekend , to Steelerstahl .
" As soon as I heard it , I thought it was a great idea . "
Ravenstahl will keep the name at least through Sunday .
Coincidentally , " stahl " is German for steel .

Cult Canadian comedy troupe The Kids In The Hall are returning to TV .
The five - strong sketch team , whose original series ran North America in the late Eighties and early Nineties , are to make eight new episodes for Canadian broadcaster CBC next year .
And the show , tentatively titled Death Comes to Town , has been inspired by The League of Gentlemen .
Star Dave Foley said : ‘ It 'll be an eight - episode arc with a narrative running through it .
We will play all the characters but it wo n't be sketch , it 'll be a single narrative mini-series .
‘ Probably the closest thing to it will probably be something like The League of Gentlemen , which I think was brilliant .
So I hope it will be close to that . ’
The team , who have previously been compared to Monty Python , have been off the air since 1994 ; although they reunited this year for a live comeback tour following the success of an appearance at Montreal ’s Just For Laughs festival .
The Kids are also considering a movie , despite the slating their 1996 film Brain Candy received .
‘ We 're still talking about doing a feature as well , but first we have to wait ' til everyone who ever saw Brain Candy is dead , ’ Foley added .
Here are a couple of sketches from the original series :

Actress Samantha Morton said she would never work for the BBC again if the corporation failed to show the emergency appeal for help .
The 31 - year - old Golden Globe winner and Oscar nominee led a string of celebrities who criticised the BBC 's decision at a central London fund raiser for the British aid agency Medical Aid for Palestinians ( Map ) last night .
The Longford actress said she was embarrassed to earn money from a corporation that would take such a " horrific " and " disgusting " decision .
She said she wanted to know how the appeal by the Disasters Emergency Committee ( DEC ) was different to Comic Relief or Children in Need .
" I 'm shocked and appalled , " she said .
" I 've worked for the BBC since I was a small child .
As a public service they 've got it very wrong .
" I 'm not as articulate about this as I would like to be because I 'm so appalled .
" I will never work for the BBC again unless they change their mind . "
She went on : " It 's very , very wrong .
It 's not a political message .
It 's about raising money for children who are dying .
" I 'm proud to have worked for the BBC ; I 'm proud to be British ; I 'm proud we even have the BBC .
" But I need them to explain this decision .
I reserve the right never to work for that company again if I feel that I 'm too embarrassed to support them or earn money from them . "
The actress was speaking at a high profile £ 150 - a - head charity dinner organised by Map at the Marriott Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane in central London .
The BBC declined to comment on her remarks .
Former BBC journalist Rageh Omaar said he thought director general Mark Thompson had " panicked politically " and misjudged what people would think .
He said Mr Thompson had made his situation worse by not reversing his decision .
" If he changes his mind now it will be even more disastrous , " Mr Omaar said .
" It would be even more pathetic to climb down at this stage .
I do n't think he will " .
The journalist also said that the chairman of the BBC Trust Sir Michael Lyons had accused the International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander of " exerting political pressure " by urging the BBC to change its mind .
" It 's not political pressure , it 's moral pressure , " Mr Omaar said .
" He does not seem to be able to make the distinction . "
Mr Omaar added that the BBC 's decision was " incomprehensible " and one for which he could see no justification .
Comedian Bill Bailey added that the corporation was showing " moral cowardice " and was " hopelessly out of touch " .
Mr Bailey , who regularly appears on the BBC , questioned whether the recent scandals over phone-ins and telephone voting had influenced the corporation 's decision .
" They might have thought , ' We need to watch our step here ' , " he said .
" If that 's true , all those scandals are utterly irrelevant when compared with not assisting in a humanitarian crisis .
" It 's completely wrong . "
Asked whether he thought the BBC would reverse its decision , he said : " The longer they leave it , the worse it gets .
" It smacks of arrogance .
It comes across not as a public broadcaster but as the jittery PR firm of a multi-national that has dodgy interests around the world . "
He said that , at best , the BBC was " hopelessly misguided " .
Earlier , writer and comedian Alexei Sayle , 56 , said the BBC had been " caught in a trap of its own making " .
He said the corporation 's decision had actually helped the Palestinian cause in some ways .
" People do n't really think about the Israeli propaganda machine , which is swift and remorseless and well connected .
" They ( the BBC ) have done us a favour in that they 've shown that at work . "
He added : " But they got it wrong on this one and should reverse it . "
Other celebrities at last night 's event included Yusuf Islam , formerly known as Cat Stevens , Juliet Stevenson and Julia Sawalha .

MEXICO CITY , Mexico ( CNN ) --
A vicious turf war between drug cartels and Mexican authorities that has left as many as 4,300 dead so far this year may have caused a breach in the internal security systems of Interpol , the international police organization .
A member of the Federal Investigative Agency participates in an narcotics operation .
Interpol , which is based in France , announced Wednesday it is sending a team of investigators to Mexico to investigate the possibility that its communications systems and databases are not being used for legitimate law enforcement purposes .
The prospect was raised after the arrest of the top official working with the agency in the country .
Ricardo Gutierrez Vargas , director for International Police Affairs at Mexico's Federal Investigative Agency and the head of Mexico's Interpol office , was placed under house arrest Sunday , the attorney general 's office said Tuesday .
More than 30 officials have been arrested since July in connection with the anti-corruption Operation Limpieza , an ongoing investigation into information leaks by law enforcement officials to drug traffickers , said Niverda Amado , a government press secretary in Mexico City .
Gutierrez can be held for up to 40 days while authorities " obtain sufficient evidence to determine his probable responsibility , " the attorney general 's office said in a news release .
Rodolfo de la Guardia Garcia , a former top official at the Federal Investigative Agency , also is under 40 - day house arrest .
He was arrested October 29 .
Mexico's Interpol office , or National Central Bureau , is staffed and run by the Federal Investigative Agency .
Mexican officials did not offer specifics on their investigation other than to say that Operation Limpieza , which means " Operation Cleanup , " is aimed " against public servants who give reserved information to people not authorized to have it . "
Do n't Miss
Interpol said in a news release Wednesday it needs to make sure the agency 's information remains secure .
" As Mexico 's attorney general 's office has a duty to ensure that Interpol 's communications system and databases are being used for legitimate law enforcement purposes and in compliance with Interpol 's rules , Interpol is immediately dispatching a team of general secretariat staff to Mexico , " Interpol said .
" The purpose of their mission is to meet with relevant Mexican authorities in order to establish if there are any allegations of improper use of Interpol 's systems by any Mexican law enforcement official . "
After the investigation , Interpol said , the agency will determine whether proper security steps have been taken .
" An assessment can then be made of the procedures put in place by the attorney general 's office , which is responsible for the Interpol office in Mexico , to ensure that Interpol 's rules and regulations are being followed , " the agency said .
The arrests came amid " a war of master proportions " between authorities and narcotics traffickers that has left more than 4,300 dead so far this year , according to the Council on Hemispheric Affairs , an independent research and information organization .
By comparison , the council said in a report Tuesday , there were 2,700 drug- related deaths in 2007 .
" Homegrown drug cartels operating from both within and outside the country are engaging in a vicious turf war to seize control of major trafficking corridors while engaging in almost open warfare against the mobilized forces of the state , " the council says about what it calls " narco - fueled crime . "
Mexican leaders have been trying to tamp down the violence by tightening controls on money - laundering and cracking down on corruption among local and municipal police forces infiltrated by drug traffickers .
It may not be enough .
" Due to pervasive corruption at the highest levels of the Mexican government , and the almost effortless infiltration of the porous security forces by the cartel , an ultimate victory by the state is far from certain , " the Hemispheric Council concludes .
Drug trafficking in Mexico is a $ 20 billion - to $ 50 billion - a - year industry , as much as the nation earns from tourism or remittances from Mexicans living in the United States , said Robert Pastor , a former national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and now a professor of international relations at American University in Washington .
He has been studying Latin America for more than four decades .
" This is a huge industry with an extraordinary capacity to corrupt and intimidate the country .
And they 're doing both right now , " said Pastor , also a former director of the Carter Center 's Latin American and Caribbean Program .
The drug cartels are paying some Mexican officials bribes of $ 150,000 to $ 450,000 a month , authorities have said .
The payment is far beyond the per capita income of $ 12,500 a year in Mexico , where one of every seven Mexicans lives in poverty , according to the CIA World Factbook .
Pastor believes that Mexican President Felipe Calderon , who took office in December 2006 , made a correct assessment that he needs to fight the drug cartels as hard as he can .
" You have to obviously escalate the cost of violating the law , " he said .
The United States also could help more , he said .
" There are 7,600 gun shops within 50 miles of the Mexican border , and they 're selling primarily to drug lords , " Pastor said .
" We are part of this problem and we have n't been significantly supportive . "
And while the war may never be completely won , the government can make vast gains , as happened in Colombia , he said .
Pastor was in Mexico giving a speech last week when Colombian President Alvaro Uribe met with Mexico 's Calderon .
Mexicans were quite taken with Uribe 's message on how to fight drug traffickers , Pastor said .
The first step that Uribe took , he said , was to take the fight to the paramilitary forces , the drug traffickers and the leftist guerrillas known as FARC , who often work in collaboration with the traffickers .
Also , Pastor said , Colombian officials " used money the same way that the narcotraffickers do -- to bribe people .
And there 's a lot more security on the streets and everywhere else , so people feel safer . "
Despite the gains , he said , the ultimate answer may have to come from the political arena , not from law enforcement .
" There 's no easy solution to it unless you put an end to the criminalization drugs , and that 's not going to happen , " Pastor said .
CNN 's Arthur Brice contributed to this report .

Israel 's rightwing opposition leader , Benjamin Netanyahu , who leads the polls before next week 's parliamentary elections , warned today against giving up any occupied territory to the Palestinians , saying it would be " grabbed by extremists " .
Under Netanyahu , leader of the Likud party , Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are likely to grow more rapidly , putting Israel at odds with the new US administration .
In a speech , Netanyahu said that rather than peace talks with the Palestinians about giving up territory , he favoured economic development – a plan of " economic peace " .
He has stopped short of endorsing a two - state solution that would see the creation of an independent Palestinian state .
It is a stance that is likely to draw criticism from Washington , particularly from new Middle East envoy George Mitchell , who wrote a report in 2001 explicitly calling for a halt to all settlement growth .
Since then the Jewish settler population has increased significantly until today it stands at nearly 500,000 settlers in the West Bank and east Jerusalem .
Netanyahu has said he will not be bound by current prime minister Ehud Olmert 's commitment to withdraw from some West Bank settlements and from large parts of the occupied territory as a whole .
" I will not keep Olmert 's commitments to withdraw and I wo n't evacuate settlements , " Netanyahu was quoted as saying last week in the Ha'aretz newspaper .
" Those understandings are invalid and unimportant . "
Netanyahu is opposed to territorial withdrawals , even from the Golan Heights , captured by Israel from Syria during the 1967 war .
Others , including members of the current Kadima - led government , have said they would give up sovereignty over the Golan Heights in return for a peace deal with Syria .
Last month Netanyahu said there were other " models " for the Palestinians short of complete sovereignty .
His comments come at a time of growing assertiveness from the settler movement .
None of the leading election candidates have taken a strong position against the settlers .
Even Tzipi Livni , head of Kadima , who favours the creation of a Palestinian state as long as Israel 's interests are met , said she believes in " maintaining maximum settlers and places that we hold dear such as Jerusalem " .
There is frequent evidence of continued settlement expansion , despite the latest year - long round of peace talks .
Under the US road map , which remains the basis of peace negotiations , Israel is committed to halting all settlement growth .
All settlements are illegal under international law .
Yesterday , Ha'aretz reported that defence minister Ehud Barak had agreed to approve a new settlement in return for the evacuation of Migron , a settlement of 45 families which even the Israeli government regards as illegal .
Evidence of the approval emerged in an affidavit submitted on Monday to the Israeli high court .
A plan is being considered for 1,400 housing units at the new settlement .
In January last year , Olmert committed himself to evacuating settlers from Migron within six months , though it now appears that no one will leave the settlement for at least another two or three years .
It has also emerged that Israel has spent more than 200 m shekels ( £ 35 m ) in the past two years preparing infrastructure to build thousands of homes between east Jerusalem and Ma'ale Adumim , one of the largest settlement blocs on the West Bank .
A police base was built on the site in May last year and , according to Ha'aretz , much more building is expected in the area .
The defence ministry told the paper it regarded Ma'ale Adumim as " an inalienable part of Jerusalem and the state of Israel in any permanent settlement " .
A secret Israeli government database on settlement construction that was leaked last week to an Israeli human rights group showed that in three - quarters of all West Bank settlements some construction had taken place without proper permits .
It showed more than 30 settlements were built at least in part on privately owned Palestinian land .
Michael Sfard , the lawyer for the Yesh Din rights group , said it amounted to a " severe indictment " of Israel 's military and government .
The group plans to use the information to file lawsuits on behalf of Palestinians .
The testimony of Brandon Neely
The Guantanamo Testimonials Project
( NaturalNews ) Specialist Brandon Neely , a member of the U.S. Army , witnessed horrifying events at Guantanamo Bay : Beatings , sexual abuse , prisoner humiliation , forced medication , torture ... and many of these acts were carried out byand medical personnel .
In December of 2008 , Spc. Brandon
Neely found the courage to share his story with the Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas ( CSHRA ) .
His interview , which was recorded and transcribed , is now posted in full at the University of California Davis website ( http://humanrights.ucdavis.edu/projects/the-... ) .
( Note , this link does NOT work under Firefox browsers , for some unexplained reason .
It works under IE and Chrome . )
What follows are excerpts from that interview , focusing specifically on abuses of Gitmo prisoners by doctors and other medical personnel .
Be warned : Some of these descriptions are quite graphic and disturbing .
It is notable that this information only came out after the removal of the Bush Administration from Washington .
And the fact that these events were taking place at all , being led by American medical professionals , says a lot about the utter lack of ethics in both the U.S. Army and the medical profession as a whole .
If a doctor could engage in the sexual abuse and torture of another human being at Gitmo , what does that say about the lack of ethical training for doctors in general ?
How could a professional member of an industry that claims to " do no harm " engage in the outright torture and abuse of a patient placed under his care ?
That these events took place while about half of all Americans continued to support Bush and Guantanamo Bay also says something else about the American people :
Thisof the Nazi Germany era was eerily reflected in America 's " War on Terror " and in television shows like , which sensationalize and justify the routine torture of human beings .
When I was writing about Guantanamo Bay in 2006 - 2008 , I was heavily criticized by Bush defenders who insisted the U.S. never tortured anyone .
All those Gitmo prisoners were really just " on vacation " at a holiday resort , they said !
Free room and board , too !
The ability of war fanatics to justify the abuse and torture of fellow human beings has never ceased to astonish me .
I continue to believe that Bush Administration officials are guilty of war crimes and should be investigated , prosecuted and punished for their role in approving the use of such torture techniques in direct violation of the Geneva Convention .
With its actions in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay , America can no longer claim any " moral high ground " on international conflicts .
( Actually , the same has been true since the Vietnam War , but that 's a different story ... )
As this testimony reveals , America is really a war mongering , imperialist nation full of violent military zealots who think nothing of human rights or international law .
You see this bullying attitude in the military AND in law enforcement , too , where police brutality against unarmed citizens is routine in many cities .
But read this testimony yourself , and then ask yourself :
Are these the actions of a free , upstanding nation fighting for " freedom " with God on its side ?
As James
Yee describes " IRFing " : Now , here is the testimony of Brandon Neely : When an IRFing took place a camera was supposed to be present to capture the IRFing .
Every time I witnessed an IRFing a camera was present , but one of two things would happen : ( 1 ) the camera would never be turned on , or ( 2 ) the camera would be on , but pointed straight at the ground .
In the incident on Bravo Block I spoke about I found out through talking to people and hearing them joke that the video of the incident was destroyed .
When new detainees arrived to the camp , a detainee on Alpha Block began to yell so loudly that you could hear him all over camp .
Every time we would take a new detainee to Alpha Block he would get even louder .
Eventually , the IRF team was called in to restrain this detainee .
You could always tell when someone got IRFed , as the detainees throughout the camp would start chanting and screaming .
So I could tell when the detainee on Alpha Block was IRFed that day .
By the time the IRF team was coming off the block and I was walking back towards Alpha Block I noticed a couple of the guys had blood on their arms , hands , and uniforms .
They were washing their hands with water .
The detainee was escorted off the block to medical , where he was given stitches for multiple lacerations to his head .
Later that day I came back on the block and saw the cage this detainee was IRFed in .
The cement floor was a dull red color from the blood .
You could tell at one point before it was washed out that there was a lot of blood on the floor of that cage .
From what I recall , IRFings did n't happen all that often .
Especially once the ICRC came to the camp .
There were other IRFings , but nothing like these I have mentioned .
These are probably the most brutal that I can remember from when I was there .
But I am only talking about the times I was on camp grounds .
I am sure IRFings happened on other shifts .
I do n't believe the IRF team was used for the right reasons at all .
At least the people on the team used it for the wrong reasons .
It was their way to beat up on someone who was smaller and weaker than them .
I have often wondered why you would need 5 healthy , grown men , in riot gear , to go take a down a detainee who was most likely underweight and very weak .
I do know that shackles were put on very tight in some cases , really depending on who put them on .
You are taught to leave enough room for a finger to go between the cuff and the part you cuff up .
I know many detainees , when they arrived , were bleeding or had bruises from the handcuffs or leg shackles .
And some could not even walk -- the leg shackles were so tight .
Yes : some soldiers did place the cuffs and leg shackles overly tight .
On the blocks detainees would be hog -tied for punishment and left that way for hours .
Sometimes 2 hours , sometimes 4 hours , all depending on when they felt like releasing them from that position , as the call to release them came from the OIC .
I know that detainees could not refuse medication or it would be forced upon them as I stated in previous incidents .
The detainees knew they would be IRFed if they refused , so many of them just took the medications so they would not be IRFed .
And I know this since I was told this many times from some of the detainees there .
I talked about the detainee who came to Camp X - Ray wounded from a .50 caliber .
His bicep had attached to his forearm due to the fact his arm was in the sling for so long .
I escorted this detainee to medical a couple times for physical therapy as he could not bend his arm down at all .
On one occasion , when I escorted him there the medic began to massage the area that was attached and he keep rubbing harder and harder to the point the detainee started to cry and squirm all over the bed .
The medic stopped massaging and started to stretch the detainee 's arm down a little at a time .
You could tell this was very painful and uncomfortable for him .
The medic said " You really want to watch him scream . "
Then he stretched the arm all the way down until it was straight out on the bed .
The detainee started screaming loud and crying .
The medic finally put his arm back up and did it again .
And then he said he was finished with the physical therapy .
The whole time the medic just laughed at what he was doing .
We then escorted the detainee back to his cage .
I witnessed the " physical therapy " sessions a couple of times , and never had it went the way I described it above .
Usually they would just massage the area for a bit , then stretch the arm a little bit just to the point it got uncomfortable to him .
But the medic that did this therapy was not the same one that I saw before .
I did not witness any forced feedings other than the one I described [ see the Ensure incident ] .
But it was done especially during a hunger strike .
After so many days they would be escorted to medical and fed through a tube or put on a IV .
I know this from talking to people who would talk about it .
And during a hunger strike the medics would always say if they do n't [ eat ] after -- 30 days I believe it was -- they would just force - feed them .
I am not totally sure of the time frame for forced feedings , but I remember hearing 30 days somewhere in there .
I do n't .
At least that I witnessed .
At Camp X - Ray we had a medical facility , but it was more a clinic than anything .
If a detainee had anything serious , or surgery , they would be taken to the Hospital , and I never worked there as far as guarding detainees .
The in - processing changed a bit , especially once Delta block was finished .
The detainees were still taken off the bus and placed in the holding pin , but instead of walking way to the back of the camp , directly across the holding area was an open spot of the camp where a big tent was put up .
And this became the new in - processing area .
Now , when they were taken out of the holding area , the escort team would take them to this tent where they would go through the same in - processing , except now there was a doctor who would check their rectum area ( we were told the rectal exam was to check for any kind of weapons that could be hidden there ; we were told that , in Afghanistan , a grenade had been found in the rectum of a detainee ) .
So an escorting MP would pull the detainee 's pants down and the doctor would instruct the detainee to lean over the table .
Then , with a surgical glove on his hand , the doctor shoved his finger in the rectum of the detainee .
Both times I witnessed this I never once saw any kind of lubrication used ; they did not use the lube that was on the table to perform this .
This exam was not done in any gentle manner whatsoever .
It seemed to me that the doctor just reached back and shoved his finger as hard as he could in the rectum of the detainee .
I witnessed this twice with my own eyes ( at this time I was working blocks more ) .
But I heard it talked about many times from other soldiers .
Even when I was not witness to these exams , but was still within earshot of the tent they were performed in , I could hear the detainees scream and cry out during the exam .
I even remember one detainee coming out of the tent after this looking like he was in tears .
I know through talking with other people who witnessed this that the doctor would make little smart comments before he did the exam like " this wo n't hurt ; it will only take a minute , " in a very sarcastic manner .
And that sometimes the doctor would even be laughing .
Also , each detainee was searched when he left his cage and when he returned to his cage .
In the process of searching or patting - down the detainee we were taught a technique which we called the " credit card swipe " .
You would take your hand put all your fingers straight together and go straight up the backside of a person .
If this was done the correct way just a quick swipe it really was no big deal , but some people took it to the extreme , and would do it so hard -- in effect just hitting the detainee in the private area to cause pain .
You can read the full testimony of Brandon Neely here : http://humanrights.ucdavis.edu/projects/the-...
The testimony of Brandon Neely is only a small part of the testimonies from dozens of lawyers , prisoners , FBI agents , soldiers and medical personnel .
See more testimony here :
It is worth noting that there arewho claim all this testimony is fictitious , and that no torture ever took place at Gitmo , and that NaturalNews has invented all this ( there is no such thing as the Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas , they insist ) .
These people are as stupid as they come .
Dumber than the Flat Earth Society , and yet more dangerous than Nazi party supporters .
War - mongering zealots who would main , torture or kill another human being under the flag of " patriotism .
" Make no mistake :
We live in a dangerous world , and a good deal of that danger comes from fanatics who continue to operate in the U.S. military .

Despite those changes , fast foods menus remain dichotomous :
Healthy choices reside next to triple - stacked burgers and extra large fries .
We 've rounded up 11 of the worst foods we 've seen this year .
Stay far , far away from the foods listed below , and instead select from the plentiful healthy choices at each of the restaurants included in this article .
Starbucks Signature Hot Chocolates
Yeah , yeah , yeah , we know you need your caffeine fix .
And yes , we know , Starbucks is delicious .
But these Signature Hot Chocolates are drinkable desserts , plain and simple .
The no-frills version has 430 calories , which has more than three times as many calories as a grande skinny Caffè Latte and almost twice as many calories as a skinny Caffè Mocha .

Wendy's Gourmet Mushroom Swiss Burger
Wendy 's worked hard to class itself up in 2008 , giving its namesake a tuxedo in ads and stressing the freshness and " gourmet " items on its menu .
The home of the fresh - never - frozen - burger earned a respectable B rating on its
Then Wendy 's came out with this :
" A 1/4 lb. of fresh , hot 'n juicy beef , topped with natural Swiss cheese , sautéed Portabella mushroom blend , hickory smoked bacon , a savory peppercorn sauce , crisp lettuce and red , ripe tomato . "
Gourmet and gourmand are n't synonymous , Wendy's .
This burger would be better named the " Glutton Mushroom Swiss Burger . "

Burger King Mushroom Swiss Steakhouse Burger
Wendy's , we take back what we said .
Yours is not the worst mushroom Swiss burger to show up on fast food menus this year .
That award goes to Burger King , which relied on Simon & Garfunkel style warbling ballads to sell its upgraded burger :
" Flame - grilled Angus beef , tender mushrooms , warm , melted Swiss cheese , * crispy onions , golden corn dusted bun .
(* Processed and pasteurized cheese ) "
Burger King does n't mess around with lettuce and tomato on this burger and nixes the bacon , too .
I 'm not really sure where those extra 220 calories come from , but they 're certainly not helping you reach your five a day vegetable and fruit quota !
Maybe , instead of naming each of these burgers to our list , we should have just named " Mushroom - Swiss fast food burgers " the worst food trend of 2008 .

Romano's Macaroni Grill
Seared Sea Scallops salad
Why bother even calling this a salad ?
Could we ask restaurants to have a calorie and fat limit for the salad section ?
I 'd like to be able to order salads without worrying I 'm consuming an entire day 's worth of protein and fat .
Judging from the Macaroni Grill menu , it 's impossible to create a salad with more than lettuce and dressing for under 500 calories .
Macaroni Grill flunked the
" Seared sea scallops , tender leaves of spinach , arugula , feta cheese , crispy prosciutto , toasted walnuts and Parmesan crisps with light citrus dressing . "
Psst … vegetables and lean protein taste good .
You do n’t need to douse them in fat for us to eat them .

Butterscotch Rocks Pancakes at IHOP
That IHOP does n't provide nutritional info should be enough reason to skip breakfast .
Most of the foods gracing the pages of its large glossy menu are desserts masquerading as breakfast and have more toppings than a banana split !
We shook our heads at the " stuffed " French toast , dropped our jaws at the coffee cake pancakes and finally threw down our forks at the Butterscotch Rocks pancakes :
" Four fluffy buttermilk pancakes filled with pecans , granola and butterscotch chips , then topped with whipped topping and drizzled with caramel sauce . "
Needless to say , these pancakes did n't find their way onto the " IHOP for Me " healthier section of the menu .
This dish seems to be the winner of a " how many sweet - and - sugary - toppings - can - we - cram - onto - a - stack - of - pancakes " contest !
We conservatively estimated the nutritional content of these pancakes based on menu description .
1,310 calories

A standard 4 " pancake has just 80 calories and 3 grams of fat ; however , IHOP 's flapjacks would dwarf your homemade ones .

KFC Original Recipe Fully Loaded Box Meal

Nothing healthy comes in a carbohydrate bowl !
Taco Bell has taken the edible food vessel one step further .
Their " Fully Loaded Nachos , " which are already a big pile of greasy chips with " double the seasoned beef , fiesta salsa , guacamole , hearty beans , three cheese blend and nacho cheese sauce , " are served in a giant fried tortilla .

Olive Garden Chicken & Shrimp Carbonara
Carbonara pasta is essentially bacon - and - egg pasta .
Delicious , yes .
Healthy , no .
The simple dish is traditionally made with " egg , pancetta ( Italian unsmoked bacon ) , black pepper , and parmesan or pecorino " cheese .
Olive Garden 's version " combines chicken and shrimp with bucatini pasta in a pancetta and parmesan cream sauce . "
It 's then " baked and topped with seasoned breadcrumbs . "
UPDATE : Olive Garden now lists nutrition info !
( Score one for the Olive Garden !
Thank you ! )
However , we now know that this pasta has 1,440 calories , 88 g and 3,000 mg sodium !
Olive Garden does n't release its nutritional info , but this dish is rumored to have upwards of 1,400 calories .
Picture fettuccini alfredo-- an Italian fat bomb on its own -- with bacon and breadcrumbs , plus shrimp and chicken .
The photo on the Olive Garden website shows pasta swimming in sauce , so this clearly is a high - calorie dish .
Maybe someday Italian food in America will no longer be drowning in butter , cream and cheese .
Plenty of traditional dishes contain those rich ingredients , but Italians have learned a word that 's been lost in translation : moderazione , or moderation .
Jack in the Box Egg Nog Shake
Jack must have been knocked in his noggin before he came up with this eggnog shake .
Egg nog , that delicious yet caloric holiday beverage chock full of eggs , sugar and cream , is blended with ice cream for a seasonal treat .
That 's almost an entire day 's calories in a glass .

Chili's Texas Cheese Fries with Jalapeno Ranch dressing
Whose idea was cheese fries ?
They 're delicious , sure , but really , did we need to top deep - fried potatoes with greasy melted cheese and bacon and dip them in dressed - up mayonnaise ?
No , we did not .
Now they 're a staple at chain restaurants , who try to one - up each other with signature ranch dressings , extra toppings and , ultimately , more fat .

Fast food and chain restaurants have evolved significantly over the last few years .
Burgers , fries and sodas are still the status quo for many diners , but those who seek healthier foods have plenty of options , from fruit and yogurt parfaits and baked potatoes , to apples cut like fries and grilled chicken .
Trans fats have been reduced and eliminated ; lowfat milk , fresh fruits and vegetables grace the menus at even the most ubiquitous roadside eateries ; and more companies are disclosing nutritional information .

about this card
On Wednesdays I typically post an older card that you might not have seen , and then I spend the afternoon writing letters to the International Olympic Committee demanding they introduce Competitive Humming into the London Olympics .
It wo n't work , but at least the person who opens their mail will have a really weird day .
It was August 27 of 2007 ( my birthday ) when columnist John C. Dvorak warned against the dangers of things such as “ cloud computing ” , “ software as service ” , “ Web 3.0 ” and the many abbreviations that in these years are trying to catch the attention of the public and sell as new what is the most old fashioned computing architecture ever existed .
Then Dvorak used as an example the crash of the servers for the authentication of Microsoft Windows with the Windows Genuine Advantage ( WGA ) tool , a crash that could have had catastrophic consequences on a huge amount of systems .
Despite the time passed , unfortunately , those potential consequences continue to hang over as a sword of Damocles on all the naive people which uncritically ( and often enthusiastically ) embrace the overwhelming majority of the web - based services designed as replacements for the corresponding applications to run locally .
In these months and years , in fact , the situation have done anything but worsen , and the increase of the user base for the manifold galaxy of cloud computing has highlighted the absolute unreliability of the Internet , as it has been designed in the Sixties , as the base platform on which permanently host applications , data and more generally the digital life of users , firms and organizations of any kind .
Internet is unreliable , transient , impermanent by definition , and the clearer evidence of such established fact comes just from the behaviour of a corporation , Google , that has made networking and the worldwide network the foundation of its enormous advertising business and its own existence .
A series of events piled in a few days is useful as a manifest alarm bell on the excess of hype that by cloud computing could cause a new crash in the IT , explosive now more than ever when the economy is in full recession .
The abuses and the inadequacies of Google
Mountain View is spending many of its energies on the convergence between remote applications and the digital ecosystem of users and companies , and just in the days when the Microsoft servers crashed CEO Eric Schmidt was evangelizing the crowd of Seoul Digital Forum pleasantly talking about the new digital world of cloud computing , or “ Web 3.0 ” as suggested by the audience , of an infrastructural model “ very different from the mainframe era , very different from the current PC industry “ .
In the model conceived by Schmidt the applications run on any device , by a thin client or inside a web browser , are fast , secure , reliable , resolve problems and facilitate the life to users and firms .
In the real interconnected world however , here and now , a simple extra punctuation mark , a slash ( “ / ” ) at the wrong place is enough for Google to end identifying as potentially harmful any single result of any search of its search engine .
The accident , occurred on January 31 , lasted only an hour and the situation came back to normal after the cause of the problem was identified in a simple human error .
And what if theoretically such an error , always possible because employees are n’t machines and sooner or later they make a mistake , would have conditioned not the web search but the productivity suite Google Docs , making temporarily unreachable the projects of companies that already use it as a job tool for their business ?
What if the information stored on remote servers would be impossible to recover if not through the failed Google services , how the supposed advantages of a computing “ in the cloud ” would end if it was n’t even capable of guaranteeing the most trivial access functionalities as any off - line word processor ?
But even more dangerous than Google ’s unreliability are its tendency to abuse users ’ data and the inadequacy of support for who became victim of a fraud made possible by the security flaws of a popular social networking service .
It gives the heebie - jeebies to know that Mountain View delete posts from music blogs hosted on the Blogger platform , following an RIAA ’s report on the alleged distribution of copyrighted tracks and careless about the fact that nothing illegal is happening indeed and the blogger at issue ( Ryan Spaulding ) is behaving exactly as advised by the press release sent to him by the labels .
To whom like Mark Ghosh put then an excessive trust in Google services happened something even worse , he was left alone by a non-existent support service after having suffered a phishing attack on Orkut : the portal , one of the many designed to promote personal relationships old and new , is affected by a huge amount of security problems , is the favoured target of an endless series of worms , malware , crackers and cyber - criminals willing to exploit at their own profit users ’ personal data .
Ghosh , who says to be accountable for an Orkut community counting up to 25,000 users , tells the ho
rrible story about the seizure of his account after the attack , the useless attempts to ask Google for help and the fact to have essentially been alone with himself facing the issue .
“ Are we all under the false hope that someone in these big companies actually cares about the people that use their products ? ”
Ghosh asks himself , “ Is the online world doomed to failure in circumstances or are we willing to make a stand only when it affects us ? “ .
Where the users ’ data go
Google is the IT company that more than any other one , in these years , publicised Internet as the solution to any problem and the answer to any need , and if not even the corporation that shaped the net in its likeness is able to guarantee that minimum level of trustworthiness required to take care of sensible information , personal and professional data then it means that the entire system does n’t work : the user loses control on his own data , returns back to the dependency already existing tens of years ago between client and mainframe and in exchange he obtains zero guarantees , a mean ( when it goes well ) support and the tangible risk of an abuse or the selling off of the aforementioned information to the best bidder .
It already happened , it ’s happening again now that the Facebook founder has announced the intention to exploit the more than 150 millions members of one of the biggest social networking services for marketing purposes , by creating the largest database for marketing research of the world .
By offering to the interested companies the chance to lead targeted researches on a loyal and easily sortable user base , Mark Zuckerberg has finally found the way to monetise Facebook by selling off privacy and the likings of who thought it was only a question of “ friends ” old and new , photos , common interests and other nice things .
Not even a blind , at this point , could ignore what awful hazard is innate in handing over the keys of one ’s own digital world to a company whose only desire is to make business and profits .
The intriguing cloud computing meme hides the largest hoax of IT from the times of speculative bubble of the last Nineties , a phenomenon that pretends to bring the technology clock back of many decades ( if the net does it all then the PC upgrade rush has no meaning at all … ) and that is destined to disappoint all the promises of reliability , speed , simplicity and security done up to now .
Web 2.0 is dead , and even cloud computing does n’t feel very well .
The last nail on the coffin of the hopes that “ in the cloud ” it feel much better than off - line is the simple psychologic mechanism of survival , that livens or should liven any user , executive or CEO aware of the fact that if the on - line services ecosystem provider goes bankrupt , or decides to delete the account for whatever reason ( maybe for a human error like happened to Google ) , data , contents and business disappear forever .
Or end up being on a post - mortem auction on eBay .

The premier of British Columbia , Gordon Campbell , wants the federal government to repeal a major piece of legislation that helps protect the environment .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
The attack , which comes at a time when the federal government is already trying to weaken the act in question , at first appeared inconsequential .
It rated just one sentence deep in Feb. 16's 40 - page speech from the throne .
" The federal Navigable Waters Act [ sic ] should be repealed and replaced by legislation that meets the legitimate needs of the 21st century , " said the speech , which sets out the government 's priorities .
" A unified major project review process will speed up job creation in mining , energy , resort development and other areas . "
As it happens , the B.C. government had the name of the federal act wrong , leaving out the word " protection " from the Navigable Waters Protection Act .
The act 's primary purpose is protecting people 's right of access to rivers , lakes and any body of water it is possible to travel by boat or ship , an environmental lawyer explained .
By helping protect waterways , the act has the side benefit of keeping them in their natural state .
That law 's too old : Campbell
Reporters , curious about why the provincial government dislikes the act , got little help from Campbell during a scrum in his office .
" Let 's put this in context for you , " said Campbell responding to a question from CKNW 's Sean Leslie .
" That act was passed in 1882 .
I would suggest that the world has changed dramatically in the 21st century from what it was like in 1882 . "
The act slows development , he said .
" Right now across the West , literally every economic development minister will tell you that the federal Navigable Waters Act [ sic ] is a huge impediment to investments and to jobs . "
He added , " If there are legitimate needs for the Navigable Waters Act [ sic ] , put them in place in a 21st - century bill , but do n't hold up 21st - century investment and jobs because of a 19th - century piece of legislation . "
Just what projects are being slowed by the act ?
" You name it .
Name a project that 's a significant project .
If it involves any kind of watersheds , it could do that , sometimes if it involves an agricultural ditch it , may be called on . "
The act is supposed to ensure people can travel the country 's waterways , he said .
" We 're capable of doing that in British Columbia without checking with the federal government . "
' Profound misunderstanding '
Campbell 's right that the Navigable Waters Protection
Act is old , said Will Amos , a staff lawyer for Ecojustice in Ottawa .
That 's not a reason to get rid of it , he said , asking rhetorically , " Is the Constitution outdated ? "
In fact , the principle the act is based on goes back much further , he said , to the Magna Carta , signed in 1215 .
Since then , common law in many countries , including Canada , has protected the public 's right to use waterways .
The public has that right , said Amos , and the federal government is mandated to protect it .
" The suggestion of a repealing of the Navigable Waters Protection Act is ridiculous and inappropriate , " said Amos .
" It 's a legally and historically incorrect view ...
It 's a profound misunderstanding of navigation history and law . "
Amos said he can , however , understand why Campbell wants it killed .
" The provinces do n't like any federal environmental regulation and enforcement . "
Or as Linda Duncan , the MP for Edmonton - Strathcona and the federal NDP 's environment critic , put it , " Provincial premiers always want to get rid of the federal government . "
Told of Campbell 's comments about the age of the act , she said , " Yes , they are very old laws .
People have guarded them . "
Environmental assessments
The Navigable Waters Protection
Act will trigger an environmental assessment whenever a structure goes over a river or a lake , Duncan said .
" It sounds like a minor thing , but it 's an important part of federal responsibility , " she said .
" This is not an insignificant law . "
In B.C. , for starters , thousands of salmon streams could be affected , she said .
Campbell 's are strange remarks from a premier working on his green reputation , she said .
" He 's showing his true colours .
Unbelievable he would single it out . "
That leaves observers wondering why exactly Campbell wants the act gone .
" It 's a major trigger for the Environmental Assessment Act , " said Andrew Gage , staff counsel for the West Coast Environmental Law group .
It affects proposals such as a controversial one now being debated to add a marina to Victoria 's inner harbour .
Provincial NDP environment critic Shane Simpson said Campbell has all kinds of reasons to oppose the federal regulations .
The act affects run of the river hydro projects , gravel extraction and aquaculture , he said .
" This could certainly relate to issues around oil tankers . "
" I think it really does have to do with beginning to reduce environmental oversight , " he said .
Last week 's B.C. budget cut the province 's environment ministry by 11 per cent , said Simpson .
" Instead of putting resources in to deal with these in a more thoughtful way , the other option is just get the rules out of the way totally . "
Federal threat
While repealing the act is not something on the federal agenda , the Conservative government is in the process of significantly weakening it .
On behalf of various clients , including environmental groups and Mountain Equipment Co-op , Amos will appear before the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance today ( Feb. 23 ) to oppose the changes , which the Conservative government announced with the budget in late January and detailed in the Feb .
6 Budget Implementation Act .
Harper 's proposed amendments would make it easier to skip the approval process and environmental assessments , said Amos , who wrote an Ecojustice memo on the issue .
" The [ Transport ] minister will be able to exempt whole classes of waterways and works from the approval process and environmental assessments . "
The minister could , for example , decide that aquaculture projects are no longer subject to the approval process , he said .
He or she could do the same for micro- hydro projects , a controversial topic in B.C. .
For such projects there would no longer even be any need to notify the public , Amos said , threatening both long - standing access rights and possibilities for protecting waterways .
With the stroke of the pen , he said , " They could do a lot of damage and nobody would know . "
The Harper government argues the changes are needed to accelerate infrastructure spending , said Amos .
" Wrecking the environment to stimulate the economy is not the direction we need to go . "
Sneaky bill
A better way to accelerate approvals would be to invest money in the government departments that do the work , he said .
" They could do that and they ought to do that . "
Instead , Harper is choosing a deregulation approach .
" We saw where deregulation got the U.S. economy .
We do n't need to go down the same route with the environment . "
That Harper 's government has brought the changes forward as part of an unrelated bill is outrageous , he said .
" The real problem is we were n't consulted , " he said .
" There 's a lot of people really concerned about this ...
We 're finally going to get the opportunity to be heard . "
Stories are starting to emerge from the paddling community , and there is concern among environmentalists , though the issue has received little media attention .
Amos said he 'll tell the Feb. 23 committee meeting the amendments are contrary to the interests of many Canadians , including those in the ecotourism business , sport fishers and outdoors stores .
" You 're going to hear more about this soon . "
The NDP 's Duncan said bringing the changes forward as part of a budget bill is sneaky .
" It should be done in an open forum so people can understand what they 're up to , " she said .
" Should n't they come forward in a way the public can discuss and debate ? "
The federal Liberals were in a position to ask for the amendments to be removed before they pledged support for Harper 's budget , she said , but failed to do that .
Green edges
Campbell 's attack on the federal laws is just another sign his commitment to the environment is weak , said the provincial NDP 's Simpson .
" It was always very narrow , " he said .
There was the introduction of the carbon tax to show Campbell 's interest in the environment , but little more .
" If you looked past that there 's not much in the way of green initiatives that you can find on the agenda . "
While Campbell has received credit for the carbon tax , a lot of environmentalists have ignored his brown side and what 's actually happening on the land , said Vicky Husband .
A long time conservationist , Husband describes herself as a " free radical " since her parting a few years ago from the Sierra Club .
In a recent e-mail , she listed a number of things the Campbell government has done : subsidizing the oil and gas industry , promoting coal bed methane exploration , encouraging " ruin of river " private hydro projects , funding advocates of offshore oil and gas development , allowing the removal of land from management under tree farm licenses , removing control over forest industry practices , promoting fish farms , ignoring the evidence on sea lice and salmon , proposing pipelines across Northern B.C. and building more highways in the Lower Mainland .
" A lot of the leading environmental groups are caught up in climate change and if there 's a carbon tax , things are good .
I 've always said , ' show me , ' " she said .
" It 's a total sham ...
He 's going green around the edges and that 's it .
There 's no green in the centre . "
Pressing Harper to get rid of an act that helps protect waterways is just one more example , she said .

December 14th , 2008 Tags : benchmark , c , gcc , llvm Security : Subject : LLVM-GCC Vs GCC Time : 09:54 pm
http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/
So I have done few benchmarks myself , using ( mostly ) the C code .
The code used is exactly the same for both compilers .
C souce code ( from the Shootout site ) , and timings in OpenOffice format :
http://www.fantascienza.net/leonardo/js/llvm_vs_gcc.zip
In the nbody benchmark there 's a large difference , I do n't know its origin ( I hope LLVM will fix those problems .
And I hope LLVM will someday support exceptions on Windows too ) .
Generally for LLVM - gcc it 's generally better to compile with - msse3 ( without it some timings become quite bad , expecially for the mandelbrot benchmark ) .
Compilers used : LLVM - gcc V. 2.4 GCC V. 4.2.1-dw2 ( mingw32-2 ) Compiler options used : GCC : - O3 -s - fomit - frame - pointer LLVM - gcc : - O3 -s - fomit - frame - pointer Benchmarks using FP numbers are compiled with - msse3 too .
CPU used : Intel Core2 , 2 GHz ( 32 - bit mode ) .
All benchmarks use only 1 core .
TIMINGS GCC , best of 3 : bintrees , n=15 : 4.24 s fannkuck , n=11 : 5.24 s fasta , n=9_000_000 (> NUL ) : 3.76 s fasta , n=9_000_000 ( a ) : 4.17 s k_nucleotide , ( d ) : 4.63 s mandelbrot , ( c ) n=4_000 : 2.49 s meteor_contest_ccp , n=2_098 : 0.12 s meteor_contest_c , n=2_098 : 0.17 s nbody , ( c ) n=10_000_000 : 5.92 s nsieve , n=12 : 5.47 s nsieve_bits , n=13 : 4.31 s partial_sums , ( c ) n=7_000_000 : 5.77 s recursive , ( c ) n=12 : 5.82 s reverse_complement ( b ) (> NUL ) : 1.77 s reverse_complement ( b ) ( a ) : 2.54 s spectral_norm , ( c ) n=3000 : 6.78 s sum_file , input=71_974_912 bytes : 2.28 s TIMINGS LLVM - gcc , best of 3 : bintrees , n=15 : 4.26 s fannkuck , n=11 : 5.45 s fasta , n=9_000_000 (> NUL ) : 3.69 s fasta , n=9_000_000 ( a ) : 4.01 s k_nucleotide , ( d ) : 4.71 s mandelbrot , ( c ) n=4_000 : 2.40 s meteor_contest_ccp , n=2_098 : 0.13 s meteor_contest_c , n=2_098 : 0.14 s nbody , ( c ) n=10_000_000 : 16.63 s nsieve , n=12 : 5.47 s nsieve_bits , n=13 : 4.15 s partial_sums ( c ) , n=7_000_000 : 6.52 s recursive , ( c ) n=12 : 6.47 s reverse_complement ( b ) (> NUL ) : 1.90 s reverse_complement ( b ) ( a ) : 2.60 s spectral_norm , ( c ) n=3000 : 5.96 s sum_file , input=71_974_912 bytes : 3.28 s Key : ( a ) = to no existing output file .
( b ) = input generated by fasta with N=9_000_000 .
( c ) = compiled with - msse3 too .
( d ) = from fasta file n=1_000_000 Note , useful as reference point : nbody .
java , N=10_000_000 : 5.48 s
After a suggestion I have compiled again all the programs with a more fitting march :
llvm -gcc - O3 -s - fomit - frame - pointer - msse3 - march=core2
Or : llvm - g++ - O3 -s - fomit - frame - pointer - msse3 - march=core2
Some timings are changed a little : TIMINGS LLVM - gcc core2 , best of 3 : fasta , n=9_000_000 (> NUL ) : 3.69 s == > 2.75 s fasta , n=9_000_000 ( a ) : 4.01 s == > 3.08 s reverse_complement ( b ) (> NUL ) : 1.90 s == > 1.88 s reverse_complement ( b ) ( a ) : 2.60 s == > 2.97 s
So overall there 's an improvement .
Ignoring the timings for nbody the total of the other timings ( with - march=core2 ) is close enough to the total for gcc .
In the meantime LLVM developers have found the problem with nbody ( and filed a bug performance report ) , the compiler does n't inline the sqrt ( ) in the following line , that is the most hot loop :
double distance = sqrt( dx * dx + dy * dy + dz * dz ) ;
See :
http://www.llvm.org/PR3219
For the Java code of ' nbody ' see also here :
http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=nbody&lang=all
You can find that reformatted nbody Java code into the zip too .
Using idea from the following two pages :
http://weblogs.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2008/03/deep_dive_into.html
http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/04/06/The+Complexities+Of+Black+Boxes.aspx
Installing the " self - extracting DEBUG Jar file " , and then using :
java -XX : +PrintOptoAssembly - server - cp . nbody
I was able to find the asm code produced by the JavaVM for the nbody benchmark .
It essentially uses only the SSE registers , and no floating point stack .
It contains three inlines calls to the sqrt ( but the program contains only two of them ) .
At a first look , that asm does n't look much different frm the asm produced by LLVM - gcc ( but LLVM - gcc does n't inline the call to the sqrt ) .
I have seen that the last C++ version of the nbody ( you can find it too inside the zip ) compiled with LLVM - gcc is able to run in 4.98 s , but it uses lot of intrinsics like __builtin_ia32_haddpd ( ) , that will not be the best for future CPUs ( while the Java code is perfectly general ) , in practice it 's partially asm already .
Update 1 : I have added CPU used , compiler version used , changed the title of the post a little .
Update 2 : I have cleaned up timings and the graph , leaving only the ones with - msse3 for benchmarks that use FP numbers .
Update 3 : I have added timings for - march=core2 , link to bug # 3219 , and fixed the key a little .
Update 4 , Dec 19 : I have added the Java code and relative asm and comments .

Thanks , very useful !
Maybe you should post these results on the LLVM dev list to let them fix the problems with nbody ?
I 've only tried the nbody benchmark so far and I got similar results :
I have no exact numbers , but with gcc as 1.0 I had for LLVM
on a AMD 64 X2 4400 + : around 1.5
on a Core2 Duo ( do n't know the specs ) : around 2.0
I even compared llvm - gcc with my own compiler ( with a LLVM backend ) and both produce approximately the same results here .
So I do n't think that it 's something frontend related .
On which CPU did you run the tests ?

You are welcome .
The CPU used is a Core2 at 2 GHz .
Later I may show such results to the LLVM dev list .
Your ratios are less extreme than mine .

Very useful data .
I 'm wondering how Java manages to beat even GCC at what I presume is a numerical benchmark .
Is the Java version using some kind of special native code numerics lib or something ?

No , Java is n't using anything special ( Java 1.6.0_06 ) .
The same result can be seen on the Shootout site too , test it yourself :

Those old benchmarks game measurements also show Oberon - 2 nbody ( source code translated to C then compiled with GCC ) and G++ nbody faster than Java . ( Reply ) ( Parent ) ( Thread )

It looks like your llvm - gcc is defaulting to targeting really old CPUs .
Make sure to pass - mss e2 or later to all compiles .
If you build llvm - gcc yourself you can get this by configuring llvm - gcc with '-- with-arch=nocona --with-tune=generic ' .
This is how llvm - gcc is built on Mac OS / X for example .

You are probably right , but I have used the llvm - gcc pre-compiled for Win as it comes from the site .
Make sure to pass - mss e2 or later to all compiles .
Thank you for the suggestion .
As you can see I have already used sse3 in most of the benchmarks that use floating point numbers : mandelbrot_sse3 , nbody_sse3 and partial_sums_sse3 ( one of such timings is n't present in the graph ) .
The only missing ones are recursive and spectral_norm :
Timings ' recursive ' : GCC , n=12 : 5.88 s GCC , -msse3 , n=12 : 5.82 s LLVM-gcc , n=12 : 7.95 s LLVM-gcc , -msse3 , n=12 : 6.47 s Timings ' spectral_norm ' : GCC , n=3_000 : 6.78 s GCC , -msse3 , n=3_000 : 6.78 s LLVM- gcc , n=3_000 : 6.70 s LLVM - gcc , -msse3 , n=3_000 : 5.96 s
I 'll soon update ( and clean up ) the graph with this new data .

Correct , we need to support everything for pre-compiled binaries , thus it was built to generate ' generic ' i686 code by default .

The only C implementation in the current benchmarks game is GCC .
So , it 's time to add the LLVM too to the tested backends .

Why do n't you include language X ?
" We have no ambition to measure every Python implementation or every Haskell implementation or every C implementation - that 's a chore for Python enthusiasts and Haskell enthusiasts and C enthusiasts . "
GCC works fine as an example C implementation for the benchmarks game .
You want to compare C implementations and I applaud you actually bothering to make the timings needed - but do n't criticize others for not taking on that chore .

At the moment your site is probably the best of its kind , so it 's seen by lot of people as a reference , and it 's used a lot .

There 's been some analysis of the slowness you 're experiencing on n-body and some of the other floating - point benchmarks , and we think we 've found the explanation :
On Linux , math functions like sqrt ( ) set the errno global variable , which means they cannot be lowered into native instructions .
GCC does something smart and emits code to determine if errno will not be set ( in the common case ) , and if so uses a hardware instruction .
Otherwise it calls the real function .
LLVM does not yet do this .
For what it 's worth , this problem does not manifest on Mac OS X , where the math functions do not set errno , so the call is always lowered to hardware instructions where possible .
You can track this problem at http://www.llvm.org/PR3219

Thank you .
I have given a look at the llvm - dev mailing list too .
It seems an important enough " performance bug " .
I hope it will be improved .

Our long national nightmare is over .
Despite rumors to the contrary , it ’s been confirmed that President - elect Barack Obama is not a user of Microsoft ’s Zune music player .
If you ’ve been holding your breath you can let it out now .
Seriously , you ’re starting to turn a little purple there — anodized aluminum purple , amirite ?
High five !
According to the Wall Street Journal , an Obama spokesperson put the rumor to rest , saying “ Not true , the President - elect uses an iPod . ”
It 's good to see the incoming administration is on top of the important issues of our day .
I feel better about the future already .
Of course , this is n’t really new to us here at MacUser — heck , we were talking about what Obama had on his iPod way back in June and we know he and the rest of the family are Mac users .
Meanwhile , Philadelphia City Paper blogger Neal Santos , who started the uproar after seeing the next president at the local gym , stands by his assertion that he saw Obama using a Zune — but that it was n’t necessarily his Zune .
Look , this is a time for the country to be coming together , not tearing apart at the seams over some age - old partisanship bickering : today , I want all you iPod fanboys out there to go find a Zune user and give them a big old hug .
I know it ’ll be difficult for you ( finding a Zune user , that is ) , but do n’t be shy : they ’re all about the social .
OTTAWA–Four Canadian and U.S. fighter jets were scrambled to meet a pair of Russian bomber planes found flying on the edge of Canada 's Arctic airspace hours before President Barack Obama arrived in Ottawa for his first foreign visit , Canada 's defence minister said .
Peter MacKay would n't say whether he thought the Feb. 18 flight of two TU - 95 Bears , long - range Russian bombers , was designed to create mischief for a Canadian security system that was already stressed by the presidential visit .
But he said the response of Canadian pilots operating under the command of NORAD sent a clear message to Moscow .
" I 'm not going to stand here and accuse the Russians of deliberately doing this during the presidential visit , but it was a strong coincidence which we met with the presence ... of F - 18 fighter planes and world - class pilots that know their business and send a strong signal that they should back off and stay out of our airspace , " he told reporters .
MacKay initially said there was a single Russian bomber but a NORAD spokesman and the minister 's officer later said there were two .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in Saskatoon that the incident was a real cause for concern that will not intimidate Canada .
" This government has responded every time the Russians have done that .
We will continue to respond .
We will defend our airspace . "
The Russian planes broke no international laws when they encroached on the 200 - mile Canadian perimeter , 190 kilometres northeast of Tuktoyaktuk , but experts say it was a clear attempt to test defence systems in the disputed Arctic territories .
" Russia has become more active than in the past , " said Ray Henault , formerly Canada 's chief of defence staff .
Henault , who served as chairman of NATO 's military council until last year , said the bomber flights are a " legitimate activity " that have nonetheless complicated relations with other Arctic nations in recent years .
" To call it a threat is probably a little bit stronger than I would call it . "
If the Arctic equation helps answer why Russia would be increasing its activity in the high North , the question of why Canada chose today to draw attention to a fairly common occurrence is less clear .
A senior government official said highlighting the mid-air meeting is a good way to show the worth and relevance of NORAD while its commander , U.S. Gen.
Victor Renuart , visits Ottawa .
It 's also a good way to " get some ink " for Canada 's contribution to continental security , the official said .
But it's also a diplomatic rebuff to Russian officials who have complained in the last week of nations that are " militarizing " the Arctic to bolster their claims to valuable energy and mineral resources locked beneath the thawing tundra and the seabed .
" We know that the waters are opening up , we know that other countries have expressed interest in the Arctic and that we intend to have a very real and current activity and presence in the Arctic , " MacKay said yesterday .
MacKay has asked Russian Defence Minister Anatoly Serdyukov and Russia 's ambassador to Canada to give Ottawa a " head 's up " when such flights are planned .
" To date , we have not received this type of notice , " he said .
Gen . Renuart , has also " reached out " to Moscow , requesting that they file formal international notice of the flights to no avail , said NORAD spokesman Michael Kucharek .
In Moscow , an unnamed government official called MacKay 's statement a " farce " and said the Russian government was reacting to Canada 's objections with " astonishment , " news agency RIA - Novosti reported .
The agency also quoted Col. Alexander Drobyshevsky , a defence ministry spokesman , saying that neighbouring states had been previously notified of the bombers ' flight .
" They would say that , " countered Rob Huebert , associate director of the University of Calgary 's Centre for Military and Strategic Studies .
The break - up of the Soviet Union in 1989 crippled Russia 's economy and brought such long - range flights , a staple of the Cold War , to an end .
That all changed in recent years as Russian overflights have resumed .

" They 're doing them in the hundreds .
It 's not just the Arctic .
They 're overflying into the Pacific , they overflew an American carrier battle group .
Everyone 's saying , ` What the hell 's going on here ? ' "
Huebert said .
NORAD 's Kucharek said Canadian and U.S. fighter jets have been scrambled more than 20 times since early 2007 to perform visual identification of Russian bombers and to direct them away from North American airspace .
Moscow began flying its old Cold War routes in late 2006 , he said , but have always remained in international airspace .

Colin Powell has made bizarre comments that echo the recent declaration by Democratic VP candidate Joe Biden that there will be an " international crisis " early into Barack Obama ’s presidency that will test the new president by forcing him to make unpopular decisions .
Speaking on meet the press two days ago , Powell officially endorsed Obama and also made the following statement :
" The problems will always be there and there ’s going to be a crisis which will come along on the 21st , 22nd of January that we do n’t even know about right now .
So I think what the President has to start to do is to start using the power of the oval office and the power of his personality to convince the American people and convince the world that America is solid , that America is going to move forward , we are going to fix our economic problems , we ’re going to meet out overseas obligations . "
Watch Powell make the comment at 2.35 into the following video :
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Is Colin Powell referring to a theoretical crisis that could occur at any time ?
If so why does he choose a specific date , within the first two days after the inauguration ?
Also why does he refer to general problems that the new president will have to deal with in a separate context ?
We are already in an economic crisis , everyone knows that , so what new crisis is Powell talking about ?
Whatever you read into Powell ’s comments , they sound somewhat bizarre , particularly as they come on the back of Joe Biden ’s " guarantee " of a " generated crisis " to " test the mettle " of the new leader within six months of the new presidential term :
What does Biden mean by " generated crisis " ?
It is an undeniably strange term to use .
His reference to John F. Kennedy indicates that Biden may have been referring some kind of geopolitical crisis in the vain of the Cuban missile crisis of April 1961 .
The confrontation between the United States , the Soviet Union , and Cuba at the height of the Cold War came within the first four months of JFK ’s presidency .
Obama ’s running mate made the comments at a fundraising event in Seattle two days ago , on the same day Powell also spoke of a coming crisis .
We should n’t be surprised at Powell ’s comments however , given that the former Secretary of State seemingly has a knack for predicting events before they take place .
Previous to the beginning of the Iraq war in February 2003 , an audio tape containing a voice described as that of Osama Bin Laden was touted as proof positive of Al Qaeda links with Saddam Hussein .
Hours before the tape was discovered and aired by TV channel Al Jazeera , Powell announced in the US Senate that a “ Bin Laden tape is coming proving Iraq ’s links with Al - Qaeda . ”
This led some to raise the question how does Colin Powell know what Al Jazeera are going to broadcast before they do ?
In an amazing and timely coincidence , the tape came barely a week after Powell ’s attempts to link Al Qaeda and Saddam in his botched presentation of lies and exaggerations before the UN Security Council .

During tonight 's Presidential Debate Senator John McCain made the claim that he " warned " about the impending economic crisis .
That 's amazing , seeing as he said in 2007 that he was in fact surprised by it and failed to predict the disaster he , President Bush and the GOP brought upon America .
Think Progress has the video and more :
I do n’t know of hardly anybody , with the exception of a handful , that said “ wait a minute , this thing is getting completely out of hand and is overheating . ”
So , I ’d like to tell you that I did anticipate it , but I have to give you straight talk , I did not .
Obama nails him in tonight 's debate :
China successfully launched three taikonauts into Earth orbit and , on September 27th , the first Chinese national ( 41 year old fighter pilot Zhai Zhigang ) walked in space .
The space walk lasted a total of 15 minutes , enough time to retrieve some solid lubricant from the outer hull of the Shenzhou - 7 module and to give the brand new “ Feitian ” space suit a trial run .
The launch , orbital insertion , space walk , re-entry and landing were all executed perfectly , securing China as only the third nation to successfully carry out an extra-vehicular activity ( EVA ) .
It can therefore be expected , as with space flight achievements by the US and Russia before , there will be some conspiracy theories out there …
OK , Phil Plait over at Bad Astronomy beat me to the punch on this one , but I thought I ’d contribute my 2c worth .
First , let ’s have a look at the video montage I used as a reference ( primarily because this YouTube video had a “ high quality ” version ) :
At first I was more than a little intrigued by this video .
After discussing this with Captain Jack over at Paranormal Radio in last week ’s regular show on October 3rd ( listen to the recording ) , I began to replay the video over and over to watch for the anomalies .
Unfortunately the version I used ( above ) , has some rather annoying commentary with it .
There have been a few websites now pointing the finger at this “ faked ” Chinese space walk , primarily anti-government websites ( such as the Epoch Times , who provides no references to the “ Chinese bloggers ” they cite ) , plus pro-Taiwanese commenters .
Of course there is a searing discontent toward China , after all this regime is responsible for human rights breaches , suppression of freedom and control of information .
The western world has it ’s problems , but at least we ’re not controlled by the state ( at least we think we ’re not … are we ? ) .
Insofar as China ’s efforts in space , they needed to be sure that they were 100 % authentic and transparent with the world .
Unfortunately , they were already fighting a losing battle even before the rocket launched .
A few hours before the launch of the Shenzhou spacecraft , the state - controlled news website Xinhuanet published an article documenting the successful orbital insertion of the three - man crew .
A transcript of the future conversation between mission control and the Shenzhou 7 module appeared online due to a “ technical error . ”
( A pretty big error if you ask me . )
Even before the engines had ignited the conspiracy theories were on fire !
And rightly so .
Who ’s to say this transcript would n’t have been issued regardless of mission success or failure ?
So , China was already on its back - foot , the launch was viewed with utmost suspicion .
Bubbles
After a whole evening devoted to scrutinizing floating Chinese astronauts , I ’m convinced that the China space walk is authentic , although I ’m not prepared to dismiss the conspiracy claims out of hand .
Pretty much all of the claims can be explained easily ( of which I ’ll give a rundown later ) , but the one thing I have been intrigued by are the alleged “ bubbles . ”
The theory goes a little like this :
In an effort to direct attention away from the baby milk scandal , China rushed the launch of the Long - March II -F rocket to bring their successful EVA forward by a few days .
Alas , the Chinese authorities had no intention to send a costly mission into space .
So , just like the faked visuals in the Beijing Olympics , they put together a Capricorn One - style faked space mission to wow the world .
So how did they do this ?
They shot the whole EVA in a massive water tank ; the rotating Earth was pasted in by digital - visual experts .
What do you get in water ?
Bubbles .
And by the looks of things , there are plenty of bubbles in the video !
Actually , although I was curious at first ( and I ’ll explain why in a moment ) , those objects you see are not bubbles , it ’s pieces of debris being released from inside the spaceship and from the activities of the taikonauts .
If you have a look at the image above , I decided to trace the paths taken by our “ bubbles ” in an attempt to see where they originated .
Although I was using the highly scientific method of pausing a YouTube video and hitting the “ Prt Sc ” button , I think I was able to capture seven “ bubbles ” pretty nicely .
Then , using Photoshop ( like that ’s never been used in space - related propaganda before ) I traced the track made by the “ bubbles ” ( red line ) and then traced its direction back to a possible origin ( blue line ) – all are straight lines .
I would have liked to have captured more of these “ bubbles ” but even the “ high quality ” version of the video was n’t great , so I had to make do with seven .
As pointed out by the anti-conspiracy theorists out there , bubbles tend to float upward .
Well , this is true , but I was concerned that these “ bubbles ” could still be “ bubbles ” even though they look as if they are travelling in “ random ” directions .
After all , if weightless conditions had been replicated in a huge water tank , why would it matter which way up the “ mocked ” spaceship was orientated ?
I was concerned that we may be looking at a full - scale mock - up of the Shenzhou - 7 dangling down , or tilted , so the camera is at the top , looking toward the bottom of the tank .
Therefore , any “ bubbles ” produced float upward , toward and then away from the camera .
At first , this might give the impression the “ bubbles ” are travelling in random directions … but there would be a flaw to this plan …
If we are able to track the paths of each of the “ bubbles ” , given enough bubbles , we should see a statistical trend toward a radiant pattern , much like a meteor radiant ( pictured left ) .
After all , given enough travel time , all bubbles in a deep tank will float upward , in a straight - ish line , each tracing back to a more - or - less common radial point .
So what do we see ?
“ Bubbles ” numbered 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 and 7 seem to appear from a common point .
Hah !
Proof that these are bubbles !
Woah , hold on just a minute .
There are another two “ bubble tracks ” that do n’t follow this pattern .
The renegade “ bubbles ” ( numbered 3 and 5 ) seem to not fit this trend , plus they are travelling in straight lines , no curvature or turbulent behaviour to suggest they were being disturbed .
For my theory to be correct , all the bubbles would need to be travelling from the same radial point .
Unless they are being blown around by some underwater fan system ; my radiant theory was getting weak .
So I looked back to the official explanation as to what these “ bubbles ” were : debris from inside the Shenzhou module were being released into space – the pressure gradient from inside ( the capsule ’s pressure will have been “ equalized ” with the vacuum of space , it would n’t be a perfect vacuum ) to outside caused the fast velocities of the debris .
With this in mind , I looked to where “ bubbles ” 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 and 7 came from .
Tracing back along the blue lines , they do indeed originate from the open hatch .
Still , they might have still been bubbles , but that did n’t explain “ bubbles ” 3 and 5 .
3 and 5 originated from the activity of Zhai Zhigang during the EVA and appeared to fire away in completely different directions to the other five “ bubbles ” .
Also , on reviewing each of the moving objects , they appear to very un - bubble - like shapes .
Some look like tumbling pieces of ice or other flake - like pieces of debris .
Alas , there is one thing I cannot very explain convincingly .
At 3:03 minutes into the video , you will notice a strange bubble - like object appear near Zhai ’s visor .
This is one of the key elements to the space walk conspiracy .
It looks like a bubble has been released , it travels around the bulbous helmet and then released upwards ( following line number 3 in my diagram ) , much like what you ’d expect from a diver ’s mask .
I actually think this is a piece of debris travelling toward the camera , giving the impression it is an expanding bubble travelling upwards .
There is probably a contributing reflection in the visor that makes it look as if the debris is travelling around the visor , when it is actually travelling on a linear path away from Zhai .
I ’ll leave that oddity for you to decide .
We must also remember , if this was shot in a massive tank of water , there would be a lot more bubbles in the water .
Unless they were digitally removed ( in which case , why leave the obvious seven bubbles for us all to see ? ) , this definitely was not an underwater scene .
Other underwater phenomena like turbulence , cavitation and nucleation are also not present .
Reflections of an array of studio lights
This is another “ key ” piece of evidence that the space walk was faked – the reflection in Zhai ’s wrist mirror .
The mirror is used by the taikonaut to see beyond his field of view ; at the end of the day , it is hard to turn your head in a space helmet , so Zhai had to employ the use of a handy little mirror on his wrist .
But , if this scene was filmed underwater , in a studio , surely any reflective objects in the scene will pick out things like …
I do n’t know … studio lights ?
According to the theory , at 5:23 minutes into the video , a rapid wrist movement appears to flash three rows of a studio light array .
I ’ll make this one quick and painless …
Wind back the video to 1:18 minutes , when Zhai crawls out of the hatch .
Look in his visor .
There is a wide - angle view of the hull of the spaceship .
What do you see ?
There is an obvious three - row array of some kind of lighting system or some other spaceship equipment .
It is not studio lighting you can see in Zhai ’s wrist reflection , it is a reflection of some equipment ( possibly a small light array for the camera ) attached to the hull .
I cannot find the blueprints of the Shenzhou - 7 module , but if I had to put money on it , I ’d say the “ studio lights ” are in fact a small lighting system for the hull - mounted camera .
Alas , the Chinese DID get into orbit …
The main conspiracy theories are the “ bubbles ” proving this space walk was filmed in a water tank , and the reflection proving it was shot in a studio .
For the reasons given above , neither are a possibility .
There are also some other theories such as :
There are no stars .
Correct , many orbital images and video do not contain stars .
This is because the Earth is usually the brightest thing ( by several orders of magnitude ) in shot .
If there is a bright object ( i.e. a white spacesuit , or bright terrestrial clouds ) , the camera ’s aperture will close down .
This has the effect of removing any faint objects from the shot .
Stars will blend in with the black of space so the details of the spacewalk and Earth ’s globe can be seen .
If the camera aperture were to be opened , the brightness of the Earth will appear “ burned out ” , appearing as a bright white blob .
There are measures that can be taken to decrease the contrast with the background of space , thereby picking out the pinpoints of starlight , but streaming video from space is n’t typically of the highest quality , especially if the system is automated .
The flag looks funny .
Actually it does n’t .
This is a classic piece of evidence for the Moon hoaxers , saying that the Apollo flags implanted in the lunar surface “ wave ” as if blown around .
The same theory appears to be aired when Zhai enthusiastically waves his red Chinese flag around .
Admittedly , the flag was probably made out of a stiffer material than fabric ( to ensure the whole flag can be seen on camera , rather than folding into a useless knot ) , but there is no indication that this flag is waving underwater .
It is waving an a vacuum , there ’s no evidence to the contrary .
So , we are presented with two options .
Either , China went into space and performed a flawless 15 - minute EVA , or the mother of all space hoaxes has just been carried out .
So which one do you think it is ?
I ’m betting that China did indeed get into space .
The “ bubbles ” are in fact space debris , the reflection of “ studio lights ” is in fact a reflection of some equipment on the Shenzhou - 7 hull , and everything else is simply hard to believe .
Whether you like it or not , China is indeed the third country in history to carry out a successful space walk …

Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) just sent a letter to Lehman Brothers CEO Richard Fuld , who ’s scheduled to testify before the House Oversight Committee on October 6 , to follow up on a previous document request .
Among other things , the committee had sought e-mails and other documents that had been sent or received by Fuld over the past six months .
According to Waxman , Lehman blew [ PDF ]
Thursday ’s deadline to produce the records .
And Fuld ’s counsel has apparently told the committee that he does n’t expect to have much to turn over .
In conversations with Committee staff , your counsel stated that he and his team are working on collecting your e-mails from this time period , but they expect to produce relatively few to the Committee because you were an infrequent user of e-mail .
Your counsel and his team have also informed Committee staff that they do not currently plan to produce any documents sent , received , or reviewed by you during the past six months that are nonelectronic , such as internal memoranda from company officials , assessments of the company ’s potential liabilities , or warnings of the company ’s impending collapse .
According to your counsel , although these documents did exist at one time , they were typically “ discarded . ”
Discarded ?
Sarbanes - Oxley , signed into law after the Enron debacle , forced publicly traded companies — such as Lehman Brothers , before it was delisted by the New York Stock Exchange — to comply with heightened record - retention procedures .
And it imposes strict criminal penalties on anyone who tampers with company records :
Whoever knowingly alters , destroys , mutilates , conceals , covers up , falsifies , or makes a false entry in any record , document , or tangible object with the intent to impede , obstruct , or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under title 11 , or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case , shall be fined under this title , imprisoned not more than 20 years , or both .
It ’s unclear whether the documents in question are covered under Sarbanes , but , just the same , “ discarded ” does n’t seem like it ’s going to fly , particularly since congressional scrutiny is the least of Lehman ’s problems .
The failed investment bank is currently under investigation by the FBI , as well as the subject of multiple lawsuits , including a class action that was filed earlier this week .
And Waxman is growing testy with Lehman ’s lack of cooperation , too .
It is difficult to understand how Lehman Brothers is unable to produce a single internal document that went to or from the CEO ’s office over the past six months .
It is also difficult to understand why there is no log , file , or other record documenting where these internal documents went .
For these reasons , I request that you inform the Committee by the close of business today whether you will agree to expand your search of documents to include company officials and employees outside the office of the CEO .
If we do not receive such a commitment , the Committee will begin the process of seeking these documents by compulsory means .
Have a nice weekend , Mr. Fuld .
Mr Hakimjan says he was sold to US authorities by Pakistani farmers Sweden has agreed to give asylum to a Chinese Muslim man who was held at Guantanamo Bay for almost five years .
The migration court accepted that Adel Hakimjan , from China 's Uighur minority , was not a terrorist and granted him permanent residency as a refugee .
There are still 17 Uighurs being held at Guantanamo Bay .
They refuse to return to China because they fear persecution there .
Activists welcomed Sweden 's move and urged other countries to follow suit .
Zachary Katznelson , legal director of UK - based rights group Reprieve , said Britain and Sweden had led the way in accepting former detainees .
" We hope this is the first step for countries across Europe in accepting the men from Guantanamo who cannot be returned to their home countries , " he said .
Humanitarian concerns
The 17 Uighurs still being held at Guantanamo have all been cleared for release , but the US cannot find any country willing to take them .
Beijing has labelled them " terror suspects " and said it " strongly opposes " any country taking them in .
Mr Hakimjan 's sister Kauser had not seen her brother in a decade
The authorities in China accuse some of them of being members of the East Turkestan Independence Movement - a Muslim separatist organisation Beijing says uses terrorist tactics .
Mr Hakimjan says he fled persecution in China in 1999 intending to travel to Turkey to find work .
But after the US invasion of Afghanistan , he claims he was sold to the US authorities by Pakistani farmers for about $ 5,000 ( £ 3,500 ) .
In 2006 he was finally released along with four other Uighurs .
They went to Albania because it was the only country willing to accept them .
According to Swedish newspaper
The Local , he filed an application for asylum in Sweden after taking part in a conference there in late 2007 .
Initially his application was turned down under what is known as the first country of asylum principle - he had already been granted asylum in Albania - and he was due to be sent back there .
But he appealed on the grounds that his sister - his only living relative outside China - lives in Sweden .
Migration Judge Carl - Otto Schele said Mr Hakimjan 's family connections and humanitarian concerns had contributed to the court 's decision to overturn the deportation order .
He said the court had found " sufficiently compelling reasons to make an exception from the first country of asylum principle and grant him permanent residence as a refugee " .

Stemming is the process for reducing inflected ( or sometimes derived ) words to their stem , base or root form .
– Wikipedia article on Stemming
Ever used a website that allowed you to tag content ?
Ever ended up accidently using slightly different tags ?
Something like graphs and graphing or blog and blogs ?
( I hope so , otherwise it ’s just me … )
To spot some of the more obvious overlaps you can stem each of the words and look for a common base .
Where one ’s found there is the possibility of mistaken duplication .
For example if you passed hunts , hunted and hunting through a stemmer each would return ‘ hunt ’ .
If you want to try for yourself there are online stemmers available .
As a more concrete example let ’s look at the wonderful service del.icio.us .

You might say he 's gone to that Big Crib in the Sky .
William Windsor , better known to Phoenicians as " Baby Man , " has sucked his last pacifier .
According to Phoenix police , Windsor -- a former country - western singer , Broadway actor , heir to the Popular Mechanics fortune , and full - time adult baby / diaper lover -- was found dead in his modest home at 1422 E.Weldon Ave. on January 30 .
He was a few months shy of his 58th birthday .
A postal employee called police after the mail at Windsor 's home had built up for a couple of weeks .
Phoenix police spokesman Luis Samudio said that a death investigation was under way , and there were no further details available .
A call to the Maricopa County Medical Examiner 's Office confirmed that it has Windsor 's body , and that an autopsy was being performed this morning to determine cause of death .
No word yet on whether Windsor died with his diapers on .
A visit to his home this morning found his tan Buick with the license plate " DIAPER 1 " parked in his driveway next to empty cat food bowls .
In the backyard , frilly pink baby nighties , like the kind Windsor wore 24 - 7 , hung on a clothesline .
Through the side door , Windsor 's oversize crib , which he slept in as part of adopting the lifestyle of an infant , could be glimpsed in the distance .
Windsor earned minor celebrity through former New Times reporter Joe Watson 's 2005 cover story , " Baby Man , " which documented Windsor 's infantilism and remains one of New Times ' most popular stories online .
Watson described meeting the beer - drinking , cigarette - smoking adult bambino at a local tavern for their initial interview .
Windsor wore " a pink bonnet over his golden locks , " a pink dress , a diaper , bobby socks , and patent - leather shoes .
According to Watson , Windsor reeked of baby powder .
Although Windsor traced his baby obsession all the way back to his earliest memories , it was n't until 2004 that he went " 24/7 AB / DL , " not long after his father 's death in late 2003 , which netted him a cool $ 1.25 million inheritance .
After that , he went everywhere dressed as an infant .
Trained himself to go to the bathroom in his diapers .
Ate baby food .
Adopted an alter ego named " HeidiLynn . "
Hired women to " mommy " him .
When Watson did his story , Windsor was living in a small one - bedroom apartment .
Documents at the Maricopa County Recorder 's office show that he purchased the property at 1422 E. Weldon Ave. in the fall of 2006 .
Windsor appeared on a memorable episode of The Jerry Springer Show dedicated to adult babies , and he maintained a Web site about his activities at heidilynnsworld .com .
His neighbor Rose Hartman remembered him as a quiet man who mostly kept to himself .
" He never came out in the daytime much , " said Hartman , who lives across the street from Windsor 's home .
" He only came out at night . "
Hartman said she never knew Windsor 's name , and simply referred to him as " Diaper Man , " though Windsor had once introduced himself to her as HeidiLynn .
She related that the mailman told her he had looked through Windsor 's window to check on him , and saw a mass of flies .
" It smelled like 16 cats had died in there , " said Hartman .
" When the police came , they had to break down the back door to get in .
I do n't know where he was [ in the house ] , but the maggots and everything were on him and stuff .
He was just like a blob , that 's how people described him . "
Police would not say how long Windsor had been deceased .
Interestingly , the blog site CrankyJennie reported a Baby Man sighting the weekend of January 10 at a local performance of the Broadway musical Hair .
According to Watson 's story , Windsor " starred in Hair , in the lead role of Claude , at the height of the anti-war movement of the early 1970s . "
Windsor 's demise has already been noted on the DailyDiapers chat board , where HeidiLynn 's comrades and friends are posting remembrances .
" You were never down on life , and we will miss you , " writes " Vic " on the thread dedicated to Windsor .
" May all of us remember her for the great friend that she was to us all . "

Astronomers crack lunar mystery with ancient rock
MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY NEWS RELEASE
Posted : January 20 , 2009
CAMBRIDGE , Mass . --
The collection of rocks that the Apollo astronauts brought back from the moon carried with it a riddle that has puzzled scientists since the early 1970s :
What produced the magnetization found in many of those rocks ?
The longstanding puzzle has now been solved by researchers at MIT , who carried out the most detailed analysis ever of the oldest pristine rock from the Apollo collection .
Magnetic traces recorded in the rock provide strong evidence that 4.2 billion years ago the moon had a liquid core with a dynamo , like Earth 's core today , that produced a strong magnetic field .
The particular moon rock that produced the new evidence was long known to be a very special one .
It is the oldest of all the moon rocks that have not been subjected to major shocks from later impacts - something that tends to erase all evidence of earlier magnetic fields .
In fact , it 's older than any known rocks from Mars or even from the Earth itself .
" Many people think that it 's the most interesting lunar rock , " said Ben Weiss , the Victor P. Starr Assistant Professor of Planetary Sciences in MIT 's Department of Earth , Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences and senior author of a paper on the new finding being published in Science on Jan. 16 .
The rock was collected during the last lunar landing mission , Apollo 17 , by Harrison " Jack " Schmidt , the only geologist ever to walk on the moon .
" It is one of the oldest and most pristine samples known , " said graduate student Ian Garrick - Bethell , who was the lead author of the Science paper .
" If that was n't enough , it is also perhaps the most beautiful lunar rock , displaying a mixture of bright green and milky white crystals . "
The team studied faint magnetic traces in a small sample of the rock in great detail .
Using a commercial rock magnetometer that was specially fitted with an automated robotic system to take many readings " allowed us to make an order of magnitude more measurements than previous studies of lunar samples , " Garrick - Bethell said .
" This permitted us to study the magnetization of the rock in much greater detail than previously possible . "
And those data enabled them to rule out the other possible sources of the magnetic traces , such as magnetic fields briefly generated by huge impacts on the moon .
Those magnetic fields are very short lived , ranging from just seconds for small impacts up to one day for the most massive strikes .
But the evidence written in the lunar rock showed it must have remained in a magnetic environment for a long period of time - millions of years - and thus the field had to have come from a long - lasting magnetic dynamo .
That 's not a new idea , but it has been " one of the most controversial issues in lunar science , " Weiss said .
Until the Apollo missions , many prominent scientists were convinced that the moon was born cold and stayed cold , never melting enough to form a liquid core .
Apollo proved that there had been massive flows of lava on the moon 's surface , but the idea that it has , or ever had , a molten core remained controversial .
" People have been vociferously debating this for 30 years , " Weiss said .
The magnetic field necessary to have magnetized this rock would have been about one - fiftieth as strong as Earth 's is today , Weiss said .
" This is consistent with dynamo theory , " and also fits in with the prevailing theory that the moon was born when a Mars - sized body crashed into the Earth and blasted much of its crust into space , where it clumped together to form the moon .
The new finding underscores how much we still do n't know about our nearest neighbor in space , which will soon be visited by humans once again under current NASA plans .
" While humans have visited the moon six times , we have really only scratched the surface when it comes to our understanding of this world , " said Garick - Bethell .
The research , which also included MIT undergraduate student Jennifer Buz and David L. Shuster of the Berkeley Geochronology Center , was funded by the NASA Lunar Advanced Science and Exploration Research Program , as well as the Charles E. Reed Faculty Initiatives Fund , the Victor P. Starr Career Development Professorship , and the Ann and Gordon Getty Foundation .
Devastation of Urban Gas Attack
In 1938 , the Japanese Red Cross worked with government authorities to create a series of posters to teach the public about the new Anti-Aircraft Defense Law , which was enacted in seeming anticipation of air strikes following the outbreak of the Japan - China War ( 1937 - 1945 ) .
Among other things , the new law required citizens to take protective measures against gas attacks and prepare for disinfection , evacuation and relief .
For the government , one purpose of the posters -- which were created as part of a military exhibition at the Red Cross Museum -- was to instill a pattern of " anti-aircraft defense thought " among the population .

New technology has been a real boon to many third world nations
How can we be sure new technologies wo n't have a negative impact , asks Bill Thompson
Coming up with ideas for new digital products and services is hardly difficult in this world of rapid technological development and increasing access to computers and the network .
Anyone with a vague grasp of the capabilities of internet - connected devices should be able to think of two or three innovations over an overpriced latte , in their nearest ' third space ' coffee shop .
Having ideas may be easy , but deciding which to pursue and turning them into reality is difficult work with a low likelihood of success .
There 's a lot of support for entrepreneurs in business , and the recent announcement that 35 UK companies will be going to the South by South - West interactive conference in Austin , Texas as part of government - sponsored ' Digital Mission ' is a good demonstration of how to help growing companies .
Non-commercial ventures need help too , and it can be hard to find .
Yet when it 's available it can make a real difference , as I found out at a conference in Cambridge last week .
Digital divide
Two years ago , the EPSRC - one of the UK research funding agencies - offered money to four development projects that were concerned with bridging the global digital divide , and last week they held a review meeting where all the project teams could come together and talk about their experiences to date .
In this increasingly connected world , we are , at some point , going to have to discuss the ethical dimension of our innovations
Bill Thompson
Because I 'd been involved in the very early stages of the project , I took the opportunity to find out how the ideas that we 'd discussed so long ago were progressing .
Project update Storybank is helping rural communities in India to create and share audiovisual material , the Village e-science project helps farmers in sub-Saharan Africa develop their agricultural practices , and the Rural e-services work offers support for Indian villagers to help design ICT systems that serve their needs .
The fourth project , Fair Tracing , is trying to make it possible for consumers to find out more about Fair Trade goods they buy , perhaps even being able to tell precisely who made them .
The meeting also provided an opportunity for the project teams to hear from some of those working at the sharp end of ICT use in development , like Paula Kotzé from the Meraka Institute and Gary Marsden from the University of Cape Town .
Marsden was the highlight of the meeting for me , partly because of his engaging style but also because he is able to blend an astute understanding of what technology can do with a profoundly empathetic appreciation of the needs of real people in their daily lives .
One of his recent projects is the ' Big Board ' , a large flat - panel screen that he installed in a community centre in a Kenyan town .
The screen has several images on it arranged in a grid , and it is used as way to transfer information to and from mobile phones in an area of the world where high network charges mean that downloading content is too expensive and access to PCs and the internet is too limited to be an option .
Big Board uses the combination of Bluetooth and a cameraphone to help people get data onto their mobiles .
A user takes a photo of the item they are interested in and then uses Bluetooth to send it back to the computer that is driving the board .
The image is analysed , and if it is recognised then the relevant data is sent back to the phone - on the demonstration system , available options included music , images and text .
It 's not fast , but it works .
And it is a two - way service , as users can register with the board and send their own content for other people to download .
Unexpected results
In the trial the two most popular types of user - generated content were completely unexpected .
Young people used the board to upload T - shirt designs which a local printer then downloaded and manufactured , and local choirs used it to swap recordings of their gospel choir performances .
Gary Marsden presents the Big Board project at MobileActive08
As Marsden pointed out , these were activities which came from the community and served its real needs , but they could only emerge because the technology was not constrained .
The Big Board allowed things to happen , without limiting what those things were , so much so that Marsden finished his talk by admitting that he has given up trying to predict the ways new tools will be used by communities .
He believes evaluating technology projects is almost impossible , because there are so many different factors to take into account , and often the really significant outcomes are not ones that were anticipated .
The Big Board is a fascinating idea , although Marsden doubts it would catch on in the West .
He reckons the downloads take too long and in our busy and media - saturated lives , few of us would bother to wait for the latest Beyonce song to be sent to a phone via Bluetooth .
Sticky wicket However , it also raises a few questions .
Some users were blocked because they were using the board to share pornography , but it 's not clear who should make decisions about what content is appropriate on a community service like this .
And what happens if new tools or services disrupt established community practices , as with the use of mobile phones to allow young men and women to contact each other freely in cultures that normally segregate the sexes ?
These are not exclusively issues that affect development projects , of course .
And I doubt that many of the technology entrepreneurs at Digital Mission will sit down and consider the wider social impact of their new products or services even when , like the microprocessor or the mobile phone , they threaten to overthrow the established order .
But in this increasingly connected world , we are , at some point , going to have to discuss the ethical dimension of our innovations .

On my hot seat today is Rep. Cynthia Davis , ( R - O' Fallon ) , and not just because she bought herself a truck for personal use with state money a bunch of years back , or what I think are questionable parenting techniques .
According to KMOU of Columbia , Missouri , Davis is trying to push a bill through the house to pay at - home moms $ 600 each year they care for children under the age of 16 .
A nice gesture , but dads need not apply .
Davis informed the NBC affiliate reporter Sarah Hollenbeck " only women can be nurturers " and has intentionally left dads out of the bill .
Let 's send send a bunch of emails to NBC reporter Sarah at mailto : sjh4h5@mizzou.edu ,%20athomedad@aol.com .

I do n't think it will take too much pressure and a followup article from more dads to get her to re-think her misguided position .

Ah , fertilization -- that miraculous process to which we all owe our existence .
Let ’s review : First , a wastefully huge swarm of sperm weakly flops along , its members bumping into walls and flailing aimlessly through thick strands of mucus .
Eventually , through sheer odds of pinball - like bouncing more than anything else , a few sperm end up close to an egg .
As they mill around , the egg selects one and reels it in , pinning it down in spite of its efforts to escape .
It ’s no contest , really .
The gigantic , hardy egg yanks this tiny sperm inside , distills out the chromosomes , and sets out to become an embryo .
Or would you have put it differently ?
Until very recently , so would most biologists .
For decades they ’ve been portraying sperm as intrepid warriors battling their way to an aging , passive egg that can do little but await the sturdy victor ’s final , bold plunge .
But the first description is closer to the truth , insists Emily Martin , a 47 - year - old researcher at Johns Hopkins who has spent the past seven years examining the metaphors used to describe fertilization .
Martin is not a biologist ; she ’s a cultural anthropologist .
But her efforts to spotlight the male - skewed imagery that permeates our views of reproduction have placed her at the center of a growing debate about how cultural myths can turn into scientific myths , and vice versa .
Martin did n’t set out to skewer biologists .
Actually she was studying biology , among other things , at the University of Michigan in 1965 when a course on Japanese music hooked her on investigating other cultures .
After picking up a Ph.D. in cultural anthropology from Cornell in 1971 , she spent nine years traveling back and forth between the United States , Taiwan , and China , where she was studying Chinese rituals and social organization .
Then , having done the study of a foreign culture that ’s traditionally expected of anthropologists , and being pregnant with her first child , she started casting about for a new project closer to home .
Studying your own culture is harder , she says , because everything seems so normal to you .
Not until 1982 , while attending a class for expectant parents before the birth of her second child , did Martin stumble on her topic .
It suddenly hit me that the way everyone was talking about their bodies was really weird , she recalls .
It was the body , the uterus , and the contraction -- as if these things were n’t a part of us .
I realized that medical science was in need of some sort of interpretation , and my wedge would be reproductive issues .
Martin started off by interviewing dozens of women on their feelings about every aspect of reproduction , from menstruation to menopause .
Her book The Woman in the Body , published in 1987 , explored the relation between images of the body and ideas about oneself .
But by 1985 Martin realized that she had been looking at these issues from only one point of view .
I decided to do an ethnographic study in a scientific setting , to see how biologists thought about some of these questions , she says .
Also , I thought I should be including male reproductive processes as well .
Fertilization research , she realized , would allow her to cover all the bases .
As she began her background studies , Martin was surprised to find that popular literature , textbooks , and even medical journals were crammed with descriptions of warrior sperm and damsel - in - distress eggs .
Martin found that classic biology texts , for example , enthused about the human male ’s amazing productivity -- some 200 million sperm every hour -- while practically complaining over the waste of the 2 million immature eggs present in the human female at birth , only some 400 of which the ovaries ever shed for possible fertilization , with the rest destined to degenerate over the woman ’s lifetime .
The real mystery , says Martin , is why the male ’s vast production of sperm is not seen as wasteful .
Less mysterious , in Martin ’s opinion , was the motivation for such biased language .
Men link potency to strong sperm , she says .
You ’d like your sperm to be like you ; no wonder everyone believed sperm were torpedoes .
In all her searching , Martin came up with only a single depiction of less - than - mighty sperm : Woody Allen ’s portrayal of a neurotic sperm nervous about his imminent ejaculation in the movie Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask .
Woody Allen aside , the durability of the masterful - sperm imagery astonished Martin .
It continued to dominate the contemporary technical and popular literature despite a growing body of evidence that the egg plays anything but a passive role .
From the early 1970s on , studies of the sperm and eggs of many species have revealed that molecules released by the egg are critical to guiding and activating the sperm -- that is , triggering the sperm to release proteins that help it adhere to the egg .
In fact , the egg might just as well be called eager as passive .
Among many species of lizards , insects , some crustaceans , and even turkeys , the egg does n’t always wait for the sperm ’s arrival .
It can begin dividing without fertilization , and females can reproduce without sperm at all .
Yet none of this had made a dent in biologists ’ language .
When I asked them about it , they told me I had a point , says Martin .
They claimed the imagery came up only when they needed to explain their research , and not in the lab .
But I wanted to know what was really going on .
By 1986 Martin had begun hanging out with a team of researchers at Johns Hopkins who were observing sperm mobility in hopes of coming up with a strategy for a new contraceptive .
They had started the year before with a simple experiment -- measuring human sperm ’s ability to escape and swim away from a tiny suction pipet placed against the side of the sperm cell ’s head .
To the team ’s great surprise , the sperm turned out to be feeble swimmers ; their heads thrashed from side to side ten times more vigorously than their bodies pushed forward .
It makes sense , says Martin .
The last thing you ’d want a sperm to be is a highly effective burrower , because it would end up burrowing into the first obstacle it encountered .
You want a sperm that ’s good at getting away from things .
The team went on to determine that the sperm tries to pull its getaway act even on the egg itself , but is held down against its struggles by molecules on the surface of the egg that hook together with counterparts on the sperm ’s surface , fastening the sperm until the egg can absorb it .
Yet even after having revealed the sperm to be an escape artist and the egg to be a chemically active sperm catcher , even after discussing the egg ’s role in tethering the sperm , the research team continued for another three years to describe the sperm ’s role as actively penetrating the egg .
Meanwhile , Martin was keeping an eye on two other fertilization groups .
They too seemed at times to disregard their own observations when writing about fertilization .
Researchers at the University of Wisconsin , for example , described the way sea urchin sperm first make contact with an egg by quickly stringing together protein molecules into a filament that extends out until it reaches the egg .
But instead of describing this as an innocuous process of assembly and attachment , the group wrote -- in a pioneering paper that otherwise points out the egg ’s ability to actively clasp and entwine -- that the sperm ’s filament shoots out and harpoons the egg .
Likewise , when a researcher at the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology in Nutley , New Jersey , wrote in 1987 of his discovery that mouse eggs carry a molecular structure on their coating that fits inside a complementary structure on the sperm , helping bind the two together , he described the two structures , naturally enough , as a lock and key -- but he called the egg ’s protruding structure the lock and the sperm ’s engulfing structure the key .
Martin does n’t suggest that these researchers willfully distorted their imagery .
In fact , she notes that one of the investigators at Johns Hopkins was her politically correct husband , Richard Cone .
What ’s more , Martin concedes that she herself was slow to recognize the disparity between the discoveries at Johns Hopkins and the way the findings were written up .
It did n’t strike me for a few years , she says .
But innocent or not , she adds , the cultural conditioning these biologists had absorbed early in their careers influenced more than their writing : it skewed their research .
I believe , and my husband believes , and the lab believes , that they would have seen these results sooner if they had n’t had these male - oriented images of sperm .
In fact , biologists could have figured out a hundred years ago that sperm are weak forward - propulsion units , but it ’s hard for men to accept the idea that sperm are best at escaping .
The imagery you employ guides you to ask certain questions and to not ask certain others .
People preparing to dismiss Emily Martin as a humorless feminist have their work cut out for them .
At once animated and easygoing in her cramped , cactus - strewn office , Martin chuckles as she goes through an inch - thick file of hapless - egg and macho - sperm imagery clipped from magazines .
( In one Gary Larson cartoon , a housewife egg fends off a swarm of sperm trying to get past her by posing as phone repairmen , insurance salesmen , and UPS deliverymen . )
I just think this stuff is a riot , she says .
In fact , it ’s the biologists who seem a little stuffy .
Though she usually lectures to students , Martin recalls one lecture she gave to biologists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1990 .
It was one of the most painful experiences of my life , she says .
I had gotten to the point where the audience is usually rolling in the aisles , and all I got was stony silence .
I could see they were furious .
On the other hand , I can understand their feelings ; I get defensive when someone criticizes cultural anthropology .
One researcher who does n’t bristle at Martin ’s jabs is Scott Gilbert , a developmental biologist at Swarthmore College .
Though he suggests Martin may go a little overboard in stressing the egg ’s aggressiveness -- for example , he prefers to think of the egg as engaging in a dialog with the sperm rather than gluing it down -- he does believe her views are a vast improvement over the conventional explanations .
Most studies clearly show that the sperm is attracted by the egg and activated by it , says Gilbert .
But if you do n’t have an interpretation of fertilization that allows you to look at the egg as active , you wo n’t look for the molecules that can prove it .
You simply wo n’t find activities that you do n’t visualize .
Now that the discrepancy between experiment and interpretation is being brought out into the open , the professional literature seems to be coming around -- although a recent issue of the biology journal Cell Differentiation and Development placed on its cover a Prince Charming sperm delivering a wake - up kiss to a long - eyelashed Sleeping Beauty egg .
As for the popular press , Gilbert and Martin cite the same recent example as particularly egregious : an article titled Sperm Wars that appeared as a cover story in a national science magazine whose name you ’d recognize in a minute , which referred to the sperm cell as a formidable .00024 - inch weapon , tipped with a chemical warhead ( see DISCOVER , July 1991 ) .
On the other hand , Developmental Biology , the most popular college textbook in its subject area , takes great pains to point out the new , equal - opportunity view of fertilization .
No wonder : Gilbert wrote it .
One reason the older interpretation is dying hard is that it tends to be self - reinforcing , not only in suggesting ready - made imagery that can skew observations but also in subtly determining who becomes a biologist in the first place .
This business has stopped certain people from entering the field , says Gilbert .
Why would a woman want to continue if people are telling her she ’s passive ?
Nevertheless , as Martin points out , a growing number of women are continuing in biology .
But that wo n’t guarantee more evenhanded interpretations .
Scientific training involves a rigorous socialization process that does n’t allow for different perspectives , she says .
It ’s hard to say that women biologists are any less guilty of these things than men .
Even if biologists do move away from the passive - egg myth , other images are waiting in the wings .
These days , says Martin , researchers seem ready to confer a spider woman aspect on the egg .
Men have always turned to spider imagery when they are confronted with women who acquire power , she charges .
Indeed , her file of magazine clippings contains several images in support of her claim .
One striking example : the cartoonish silhouette employed as the emblem of the once - popular Charlie ’s Angels television series , which depicts the three starring female characters , guns and all , unmistakably merged into the eight - limbed shape of a spider .
Though Martin is the first to insist that much of the fertilization imagery is good for a laugh , she does n’t mean to let scientists dismiss it all as a big joke .
People say , ‘ Oh , what difference does it make ? ’ as if this stuff does n’t affect anyone , she says .
But our culture is affected by these powerful visual images .
We all put so much faith in science , and so much of the negative load lands on women .
She notes , as another example , that it ’s been known since the 1960s that women exposed to toxic chemicals bear children who run a higher risk of serious medical problems .
Those findings reinforced the cultural notion that women should be sheltered , and some companies have rules to prevent women of reproductive age from working at jobs that might involve exposure to these chemicals .
But only in the past few years have comparable studies shown that men exposed to high levels of lead , vinyl chloride , and about a dozen other chemicals also have children who are at higher risk .
It ’s the notion of invulnerable sperm , she claims , that made it take so long for scientists and the public to accept the male role in birth defects and infertility .
Martin has recently shifted her focus to metaphors used in other areas of medical research .
For example , she says , when AIDS was seen as affecting only the ‘ dregs ’ of society , scientists described it as a monkey virus .
Now that well - to - do white women are getting it , all of a sudden researchers are talking about AIDS being an autoimmune disease .
There are , of course , other reasons that researchers ’ language might change , including a growing knowledge of how the AIDS virus in fact wreaks havoc on the host ’s immune system .
Martin is still studying the literature and observing researchers in immunology labs .
For now , she concedes , all you can do is raise a question .
It ’s often impossible to prove causality .
Although she is no longer studying fertilization imagery , Martin still lectures on the topic because , she contends , the work shows that science can have social effects .
When we anthropomorphize the egg and sperm , when we turn them into a miniature bride and groom complete with personalities , what effect does this have on abortion legislation ?
These effects are n’t intended by scientists , but they happen .
They blend moral and scientific issues together in a way that makes me want to stand up and say something .
There ’s further irony in the traditional metaphors .
The notion of fiercely battling , competitive sperm suggests that they ’re battling each other in a race to the egg .
In fact , says Cone , they have a hard time making their way through the mucus glop , and like a team of bicyclists they take turns up front parting strands of mucus .
So in a sense sperm are cooperative .
The egg , on the other hand , is the real competitive loner .
Only one matures each month , and the one out in front suppresses the maturation of all the others .
The macho image of sperm not only obscures this reality ; it actually reverses what ’s been observed .
Can biased metaphors be eliminated from science ?
Martin does n’t think so .
Even if they could be , she does n’t think that antiseptically neutral language would be desirable .
Metaphor is , after all , a powerful vehicle for creative thinking .
The goal should n’t be to clean the imagery out , she says , but to be aware that it ’s there .
It also helps , she adds , to be able to take a joke .
Humor takes away the sting , she says , along with the potential for inculcating harmful ideas .
• Created in 1974 in response to high plastic prices from oil crisis •
More than 2bn of the 7.5 cm - tall dolls have been sold worldwide
The German inventor of Playmobil toys , which became an instant success when they hit the market 35 years ago , has died at the age of 79 .
Hans Beck , a furniture maker and model enthusiast , came up with the toy in 1974 after being asked to create a new and collectible play concept .
It was initially suggested he might work on a range of cars .
Instead Beck came up with the dolls and earned himself a place in toy history .
He worked according to his motto " no horror , no superficial violence , no short - lived trends " , the Brandstätter Group , owners of Playmobil , said in a short statement .
Beck created a whole fantasy world of figures with moving arms and legs that bend at the hip , wear snap on clothes , and continue to capture the imagination of children all over the world .
More than 2.2bn figures have been produced and sold in over 70 countries .
At 7.5 cm tall , and promoted as " ideal for a child 's grip " , the figures are meant to represent real life average adult height of 175 cm ( 5ft 7ins ) .
The original figures were a knight , a builder and a Native American .
But the toy empire expanded hugely over the years and , alongside fairies , firefighters , nurses , jewel thieves , Egyptologists , prisoners , police tracking dogs and airport security staff are now part of the Playmobil firmament .
The trigger for the toy 's creation was the global oil crisis of the early 1970s , when the price of plastics increased sixfold .
Large toys which Brandstätter had produced up until then became prohibitively expensive and it was forced to rethink its product line .
Beck was asked to develop a " system of play which can be expanded and which through relatively small parts made out of the expensive synthetic material offers a high value product " .
Beck worked for Brandstätter for 40 years until 1998 .
In that time he became head of design .
He lived with his wife near Lake Constance in southern Germany where he died following a serious illness on Friday .
The success of Brandstätter , which employs 3,000 staff and posted € 452 m ( $ 408 m ) in sales last year , is based on the continued popularity of Playmobil .
The figures have won numerous prizes over the years for their quality as well as their educational potential .
The company has resisted calls to equip the figures for the digital age by adding sound effects and mechanised features , arguing that it does not want to betray Beck 's original concept .

" The Waq Waq are mythical lands , associated with trees bearing humanoid fruits , which were sometimes located in Africa and sometimes in the eastern Indian Ocean .
" Composed in Egypt in the first half of the 11th century , this recently discovered 12th / 13th century cosmographical manuscript contains highly unique celestial and terrestrial maps , including the first known rectangular map of the world produced before the renaissance [ I believe this has the first known map reference to England : ] .
The geographical references are based largely on the first century work of Ptolemy but the manuscript contains previously unknown distinct cartographic features .
In conjunction with the maps , the text provides insight into the customs and beliefs of the people and details about the commerce and trade routes in the Islamic Empire just prior to the start of the Crusades .
is actually divided between 2 books ( the universe and earth ) , and at the time of its purchase by the Bodleian in 2002 it was described as the most important Islamic scientific manuscript to have come onto the market in the last century .
The whole of book 2 ( earth ) and parts of book 1 are presented in high resolution format with mouseover translations , arabic and english pop -up transcriptions as well as footnotes and map legends .

Well , friends , if you had n’t heard , it seems they ’re conjuring up a direct - to - video sequel to Richard Kelly ’s fantastic 2001 cult hit Donnie Darko .
And we ’ve got the trailer right here .
The sequel , titled S. Darko , revolves around Donnie ’s little sister Samantha ( played by Daveigh Chase , reprising her role from the original … unlike everyone else ) , several years after his death at the end / beginning of the first film , receiving similar end - of - the - world premonitions like her brother did .
The trailer looks like run -of - the - mill whiny teen Sci - Fi channel trash and if I ’m not mistaken I think that was Elizabeth Berkley saying a line that sounded like “ We need to get to the children before they spoil . ”
And just in case you were n’t willing to believe that this had anything to do with the original film , the kicker at the end gives us a glimpse at a guy in a demon - bunny mask .
It ’s pretty worthless , but if you must , check it out right here .
WASHINGTON Several Chinese readers have contacted me to express astonishment at the chorus of voices blaming China for the U.S. recession .
They wonder :
Is this the preamble of a protectionist backlash ?
There is plenty that China deserves to be bashed forits political system and its backing of Sudan and Zimbabwe , for instance but not the U.S. recession .
Yet although it is hard to see how China - bashing would translate into protectionism when Washington needs Beijing s financial help , one should never underestimate peoples capacity to self - inflict damage in times of panic .
The buy American provision barring the use of foreign steel and iron in the economic stimulus package approved by the U.S. House of Representatives is a stark reminder .
China - bashers maintain that Beijing cheapened its exports through currency manipulation , encouraging Americans to devour them ; the Chinese then invested part of that money and other savings in U.S. assets , prompting the drop in interest rates that in turn fueled the housing bubble .
With variations , this view is shared by the previous and the current secretaries of the Treasury , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , some members of Congress , not to mention some well - known commentators .
They claim that the U.S. has been spending too much because China has been saving too much ( I kid you not ! ) .
Yes , in the last 10 years the real personal saving rate in the U.S. has been close to zero ( although it is now going up in the midst of the recession ) , while that of China has been somewhere between 30 percent and 40 percent .
If we add government and corporate savings , Chinas rate has been close to 50 percent , almost five times that of the U.S .
But China has been saving much of its income since long before U.S. home prices skyrocketed , and it continues to save more than two years after the bubble burst .
The idea that Chinas savings caused the low interest rates that pumped Americas housing bubble does not square with the fact that , according to the International Monetary Funds World Economic Outlook , the savings of the underdeveloped nations continued to rise between 2003 and 2007 , when mortgage rates rose steadily in the U.S. after their ridiculously low years earlier in the decade .
As economist Robert Murphy , the author of  The Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism ,  maintains in an article , when American consumers went on a binge because they dreamed that their houses would appreciate forever , the worlds saving rate was actually lower than in the 1980s and much of the 90s .
The U.S. financial mess and the ensuing recession were home - grown .
Whether one subscribes , as I do , to the view that the consumers  frenzy and Wall Streets lunacy originated in the Federal Reserves policy of easy money and the lowering of lending standards or , as many others think , in financial deregulation , the key decisions were made by Americans who were ( or seemed ) perfectly awake .
China did not set U.S. interest rates , increase the money supply and pass laws such as the updated Community Reinvestment Act or the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act .
And if one subscribes to the other view China is not the one that deregulated U.S. financial markets through laws such as the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act in 1999 .
When a government as the Bush administration didengages in expensive foreign and domestic policies that feed on deficits and debt , and consumers decide to follow suit , you eventually run into trouble .
The fact that another country decides to save half of its income and invest in the future should make Americans proud :
The gospel of U.S. capitalism has finally spread to the unbelievers !
Had it not been for Chinese , Japanese and British investors , the U.S. would have gone bankrupt .
Given the amount of new debt that Washington is contemplating in order to rescue 
Americans from the smartest thing they have done in a long time save some money and try to adjust China - bashers should be aware that they will need foreign savers more than ever .
None of this means that Beijings economy is above reproach .
For one , China increased the money supply irresponsibly and is now facing an economic slowdown that , as The Economist showed this week , is not primarily due to the drop in exports to the United States .
But Washington should not blame the wrong culprit for its mistakes .
Instead , Americans should accept that  the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom only in William Blakes prose .
In real life , the road to paradise is that of hard work , thrift and creative investment .

At least 11 people have been killed in a collision between a train and a tourist coach in central Slovakia .
The accident happened on a level crossing near the town of Brezno as the coach was travelling to a ski resort , officials say .
The 36 people on the coach were all from Banovce - nad - Bebravou in western Slovakia , reports say .
The train - which was derailed in the crash - pushed the bus for tens of metres , said a rail spokeswoman .
" All the dead and injured were on the bus .
There were only a few passengers on the train and they did n't suffer any serious injuries , " said Martina Pavlikova , of Slovak Railways .
The scene of the crash is close to the popular ski resort of Polomka Bucnik .
Slovak news agency TASR said the collision occurred at about 0900 ( 0800 GMT ) on Saturday .
It said the railway crossing had only light signals with no barriers to stop vehicles from crossing .
TASR said several of those injured were in a serious condition .
Two people with spinal injuries were airlifted to hospital in the town of Banska Bystrica , while others less seriously hurt were taken to hospital in Brezno , according to the www.sme.sk news website .
Boston Globe :
Rep. Barney Frank said he plans to file a bill to legalize " small amounts " of marijuana .
Frank announced his plans late Friday on the HBO show " Real Time , " hosted by Bill Maher .
" I 'm going to file a bill as soon as we go back to remove all federal penalties for the possession or use of small amounts of marijuana , " Frank , a Massachusetts Democrat , told Maher .
Frank did n't define " small amounts . "
Efforts to reach Frank on Saturday were not immediately successful .
Frank said he'd filed a similar bill in the Massachusetts Legislature in the 1970s , but has n't tried since he was elected to Congress .
" I finally got to the point where I think I can get away with it , " he said .
Frank said he thinks " its time for the politicians in this one to catch up to the public .
The notion that you lock people up for smoking marijuana is pretty silly . "
Police are trying to track down a man who repeatedly smashed a Multanova against a Swanbourne lamp post on December 30 .
Police Media 's Ros Weatherall said the vandalism occurred about 4.50 pm .
The alleged offender tries to wrench the Multanova from its mounting .
" One of our camera operators was monitoring northbound traffic on the West Coast Highway adjacent to Swansea street in Swanbourne , " Ms Weatherall said .
" He 's seen a man standing nearby at a bus stop paying attention to the Multanova and kept an eye on him because he appeared suspicious .
[ digg - reddit - me ] Reem Al Ghussain , an English teacher at Al - Azhar University in Gaza in the Guardian :
[ My children ] ask me : “ Why are the Israelis doing this to us ? ”
My child in fifth grade asks me : “ What did we do to them ? ” I tell them that they want to take our land and they want all Palestinians to die .
It is this attitude , this indoctrination that passes down hatred and a sense of the ‘ Otherness ’ of the enemy from parent to child , that is at the root of so many long - simmering conflicts .
As Glenn Greenwald wrote , channeling George Orwell :
If you see Palestinians as something less than civilized human beings : as “ barbarians ” – just as if you see Americans as infidels warring with God or Jews as sub - human rats — then it naturally follows that civilian deaths are irrelevant , perhaps even something to cheer .
For people who think that way , arguments about “ proportionality ” wo n’t even begin to resonate – such concepts can’t even be understood – because the core premise , that excessive civilian deaths are horrible and should be avoided at all costs , is n’t accepted .
Why should a superior , civilized , peaceful society allow the welfare of violent , hateful barbarians to interfere with its objectives ?
How can the deaths or suffering of thousands of barbarians ever be weighed against the death of even a single civilized person ?
So many of these conflicts – one might say almost all of them – end up shaped by the same virtually universal deficiency : excessive tribalistic identification ( i.e. : the group with which I was trained to identify is right and good and just and my group ’s enemy is bad and wrong and violent ) , which causes people to view the world only from the perspective of their side , to believe that X is good when they do it and evil when it ’s done to them .
X can be torture , or the killing of civilians in order to “ send a message ” ( i.e. , Terrorism ) , or invading and occupying other people ’s land , or using massive lethal force against defenseless populations , or seeing one ’s own side as composed of real humans and the other side as sub - human , evil barbarians .
As Bill Bishop described in Slate the tendency of groups to polarize towards extremes ( in the context of the Palin rallies in the news then ) :
We are constantly comparing our beliefs and opinions to those of the group .
There are advantages to being slightly more extreme than the group average .
It ’s a way to stand out , to ensure others will see us as righteous group members .
“ It ’s an image - maintenance kind of thing , ” explained social psychologist Robert Baron .
Everybody wants to be a member in good standing , and though it sounds counterintuitive , the safest way to conform is to be slightly more extreme than the average of the group .
Cass Sunstein , a law professor and adviser to Barack Obama , described how this dynamic works in a social setting as a preface to his discussion of “ leaderless jihad “ :
A few years ago , Daniel Kahneman , David Schkade , and I were involved in several studies of punitive damage awards by juries .
We began by asking one thousand or so demographically diverse people to register their judgments about misconduct by various wrongdoers .
We asked them to rate their moral outrage on a scale of zero to six , where zero meant “ not at all outrageous ” and six meant “ exceptionally outrageous . ”
We also asked them to come up with an appropriate dollar award …
[ As our ] goal is to understand how juries really behave – or more ambitiously , how outrage develops in the real world …we conducted a follow - up study , involving about three thousand jury - eligible citizens and five hundred deliberating juries , each consisting of six people .
Here is how the experiment worked .
Every juror read about a personal injury case , including the arguments made by both sides .
Jurors were also asked to record , in advance of deliberation , their individual judgments on a bounded numerical scale , and also in terms of dollars .
Next they were asked to deliberate together to reach a verdict , both on the bounded scale and on the dollar scale .
Our goal was to discover the relationship between people ’s individual judgments , in advance of deliberation , and the ultimate views and actions of group members who have discussed the matter .
You might predict ( as I did ) that deliberation would lead to compromise , and hence that the verdicts of juries would be pretty close to the median of punishment judgments of jurors ; but your prediction would be badly wrong .
It turned out that the effect of deliberation was to create a “ severity shift . ”
When people began with a lot of outrage , their interactions made them significantly more outraged than they were before they started to talk .
And with dollar awards , the severity shift was especially large .
The ultimate award of juries was usually higher than the award favored by the median juror in advance of deliberation .
In many cases , the jury ended up with an award at least as high as the highest award favored , in advance , by any of the jury ’s members .
Sunstein connects this experiment of moral outrage and social dynamics to Marc Sageman ’s “ Leaderless Jihad ” :
Drawing on the data , Sageman offers an arresting conclusion , which is that a major explanation of Islamic terrorism lies in patterns of social interaction that transform moral outrage into extremism .
In his account , terrorists are not mentally ill , poor , uneducated , sociopathic , or victims of trauma .
In the main , they are ordinary individuals who move to radical positions as a result of discussions with like - minded others .
Sageman focuses in particular on the rise of what he calls “ global Islamist terrorism ” – a large and loosely organized social movement that is subject to no command - and - control structure and has prospered in the wake of the invasion of Iraq .
What makes Sageman ’s account distinctive is his emphasis on the crucial role of social networks – in the real world and on the Internet – and his effort to show that an understanding of those networks has significant and sometimes counterintuitive implications for how to safeguard national security .
At the same time , Sageman offers general lessons about how enclosed enclaves of like - minded types help produce political beliefs and action of many kinds , including violence .
This same dynamic plays out on many different scales in our society and in societies around the world , with differing levels of ferocity .
How a society deals with this dynamic helps determine it ’s stability , or lack .
One of the ways to address this issue seems to be dialogue and communication among polarizing groups – and friendships between these groups – a principle which Obama , to his credit , has often stood for .
As Americans increasingly clustering and moving into areas in which they are ideologically comfortable , as they tend to find media outlets that cater to their ideological preferences and ignore as biased those media sources that do not , we are moving away from those aspects of American society that have tamped down extremism and encouraging this dynamic of polarization .
At the same time , we should n’t overstate things about American polarization .
It ’s hard to believe we are close to the point that Russian academic Igor Panarin is predicting – that America will break into six seperate parts [ map ] .
Much more significant is the extent to which this dynamic plays out amongst Muslim populations that are trending towards extremism and in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict – as these situations demonstrate extremely heightened forms of this dynamic .
Without understanding this dynamic , we can never address the root of these issues – and we will be tempted to respond without adequate reflection .

Finn.no , som er et av Norges aller mest besøkte nettsteder , oppfordrer nå brukere av Internet Explorer 6 om å laste ned en nyere versjon av Internet Explorer .
Brukerne lokkes med at de vil få en bedre brukeropplevelse , men i dette blogginnlegget legges det ikke skjul på at årsaken til kampanjen er at Finn.nos utviklingavdeling er lei av å måtte bruke betydelige deler av sin arbeidstid på å gjøre tilpasninger til den foreldete nettleseren .
Kampanjen til Finn .
no er interessant siden det er det er første gang vi har sett et stort norsk nettsted komme med en slik oppfordring .
Finn .no ble i forrige uke besøkt av nesten 1,8 millioner unike brukere .
Ifølge dette blogginnlegget benyttet 17 prosent av disse brukerne Internet Explorer 6 i januar i år .
Det er bare Internet Explorer 7 som benyttes mer .
Det er også klart at flere av Norges største nettaviser , blant annet VG Nett og Dagbladet .no , nå har lagt ut eller vil legge ut en tilsvarende oppfordring på sine sider .
Også A - Pressen oppfordrer nå IE6 - brukerne til å oppgradere .
Også digi . no skal gjøre det samme .
Erlend Schei , driftsansvarlig og utvikler i Finn . no kan overfor digi .
no ikke nøyaktig tallfeste hvor mye tid Finn.nos utviklere bruker på å løse IE6 - problematikk .
- En frontendutvikler bruker kanskje en fjerdedel av tiden sin på dette .
Et nylig eksempel var en annonse vi brukte et par ukeverk på å fikse fordi den ble feil på grunn av en IE - bug .
Det er noe annonsørene setter lite pris på , forteller Schei til digi.no .
- Også kundesenteret vårt er positivt til dette .
Mange bugs kundene opplever er knyttet til IE6 , forteller Schei .
Utviklerne vil heller bruke tid på å lage ny funksjonalitet .
- IE6 setter en del begrensninger når vi går til mer rike frontend - applikasjoner som presser nettleseren litt ekstra , sier Schei .
En del har reagert på at Finn .
no oppfordrer brukerne til å bytte til IE7 i stedet for andre nettlesere som mange mener er langt bedre .
Schei innrømmer at også IE7 kommer litt til kort i blant , ikke minst når det gjelder JavaScript - ytelsen .
- Vi opplever i blant at ting går mye tregere i IE7 enn i de andre nettleserne .
Men samtidig ønsker Finn . no å være nøytrale overfor nettlesere , bortsett fra IE6 , selvfølgelig .
- Mange , både brukere og IT - sjefer opplever det som tryggere å bruke en nyere versjon Internet Explorer , som de kjenner fra før , enn å ta i bruk noe helt nytt , mener Schei .
digi .no har gjentatte ganger skrevet om dette problemet , som har forsuret hverdagen til webutviklere i en årrekke .
Les også :
Men det er trolig dette denne artikkelen i tu.no , skrevet av tidligere utgavesjef i digi.no , Anders Brenna , som har fått Finn . no og de andre til å reagere , godt hjulpet en en drøss med meldinger på Twitter .
Mens mange webutviklere tidligere anså det som viktigst å få websidene til å fungere i Internet Explorer , har nettlesere som Firefox , Safari og Opera de siste årene fått såpass store brukerandeler at de ikke lenger kan ignoreres .
Til tross for at alternativene er mange , klynger mange Windows - brukere seg fortsatt til Internet Explorer 6 , en nettleser som ikke har blitt vesentlig oppdatert siden Windows XP kom på markedet , det vil si i 2001 .
Dette var på et tidspunkt da Microsoft valgte å gå sine egne veier , uten nødvendigvis å følge anbefalingene fra blant annet W3C .
Dette har ført til at IE6 håndterer en del innhold på weben annerledes enn de øvrige nettleserne , også nyere versjoner av Internet Explorer .
Samtidig har IE6 dårligere støtte for nyere webstandarder enn samtlige av nettleserens hovedkonkurrenter .
Om oppfordringen vil føre til noen bedring , er uvisst .
Internet Explorer 7 ble lansert i oktober 2006 og Microsoft har senere lagt IE7 til som en automatisk og høyt prioritert oppdatering til Windows XP med Service Pack 2 eller nyere .
Brukerne kan dog velge at IE7 ikke skal installeres .
Det er altså ingen tvungen oppgradering .
Hovedårsaken til at Microsoft ikke gjør installasjonen av IE7 obligatorisk er trolig at mange bedrifter benytter interne systemer som fortsatt ikke har støtte for andre nettlesere en Internet Explorer 6 .
Dette skyldes enten manglende vilje til å bruke penger på en oppdatering av forretningssystemet , eller at en slik oppdatering faktisk ikke finnes .
En annen mulighet er at mange av brukerne faktisk ikke har muligheten til å installere IE7 , fordi de bruker piratkopierte utgaver av Windows .
Dette medfører også at de heller ikke får installert andre oppdateringer .
Det forteller litt om hvorfor skadevare som utnytter selv gamle sårbarheter , fortsatt lever i bedre velgående .
Tallene fra Finn .
no tyder likevel på at det er i bedriftene at IE6 brukes mest .
- Vi har sett nærmere på tallene og de viser at andelen som bruker IE6 på dagtid er nesten 25 prosent .
På kveldstid og i helgene reduseres andelen til 12 prosent , forteller Schei .
Blant digi. no - leserne er ikke IE6 - andelen like høy .
I snitt så langt i februar har drøyt 8 prosent av besøkene skjedd med IE6 .
IE7 ble benyttet med 29 prosent av besøkene , mens betaversjonen av IE8 ble benyttet ved drøyt 3 prosent av besøkene .
Andelen til Firefox er 37 prosent , Opera har 12,5 prosent , Safari 4,5 prosent mens Chrome har 3,5 prosent andel .
digi .no har ikke nettleserstatistikk som skiller mellom dagtid og kveldstid , men i ukedagene i forrige uke ble IE6 benyttet ved 9 prosent i besøkene .
Sist helg var derimot andelen til IE6 bare drøyt 4 prosent .
Samtidig viser tallene at andelen til Firefox totalt med god margin passerer andelen til IE totalt i helgen .
Andelene er da henholdsvis 39 og 35 prosent .
Hvis noen lurer , så er kan IE6 også oppgraderes til IE7 ved å følge instruksjonene på denne siden .

SASKATOON , Saskatchewan , Feb. 27 ( UPI ) -- Canada will not tolerate Russian intrusions into Canadian airspace , Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Friday .
" I have expressed at various times the deep concern our government has with increasingly aggressive Russian actions around the globe and Russian intrusions into our airspace , " Harper said at a Saskatoon , Saskatchewan , news conference .

" This government has responded every time the Russians have done that , " he said .
" We will continue to respond -- we will defend our airspace . "
His comments followed a disclosure from Defense Minister Peter MacKay Friday morning that Canadian warplanes intercepted an approaching Russian bomber hours before U.S. President Barack Obama 's Ottawa visit last week .
Canadian defense and North American Aerospace Defense Command officials later said two Russian warplanes , not just one , were involved in the incident , Canwest News Service reported .
Norad identified the Russian aircraft as twin - propeller , turboprop Tupolev Tu-95 strategic bomber and missile carriers , known by NATO as the " Bear . "
A Russian air force official confirmed the Feb. 18 incident , but said the warplanes were Tupolev Tu-160 supersonic , variable - geometry heavy bombers , with a NATO reporting name of " Blackjack . "
" The Tupolev - 160 fulfilled all its air patrol tasks .
It was a planned flight , " Lt. Col.
Vladimir Drik told the RIA Novosti news agency .
Drik said the crew followed international air protocols and did not violate Canadian airspace .
Harper said Canada would " respond every time the Russians make any kind of intrusion on the sovereignty of Canada 's Arctic . "
" That 's our obligation and that 's what we 'll do , " he said .
Updated Computer networks that use proxy servers to automatically redirect browser connections should be on the lookout for a serious architectural flaw that could allow attackers to remotely access intranets and other website resources that are normally off limits , security experts are warning .
At least four proxy server vendors , including QBIK New Zealand , SmoothWall , Squid and Ziproxy remain vulnerable to flaw , according to this advisory from the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team .
Products from several dozen additional vendors were vulnerable but have been updated in the past few weeks .
Network administrators will need to install the latest versions to ensure their networks are n't vulnerable .
The architectural flaw affects proxy servers that run in what 's known as transparent interception mode .
The configuration allows servers to intercept and redirect network connections without any user interaction or special browser settings .
To exploit the bug , attackers can manipulate host header values using active content such as Java and Flash .
" An attacker may be able to make full connections to any website or resource that the proxy can connect to , " CERT warns .
" These sites may include internal resources such as intranet sites that would not usually be exposed to the internet . "
The vulnerability was originally reported by Robert Auger of PayPal 's Information Risk Management team .
In a note posted on Cgisecurity.com , he said he planned to release a more detailed technical analysis in March , presumably after network administrators have had a chance to patch vulnerable networks .
Based on the bare - bones analysis provided by CERT , it appears the bug may also threaten end users , presumably through phishing attacks .
" To successfully exploit this issue , an attacker would need to either convince a user to visit a web page with malicious active content or be able to load the active content in an otherwise trusted site , " the advisory reads .
The good news is that the vulnerability only seems to affect proxy servers running in transparent mode .
Browser same - origin policies , which prevent cookies and other types of content set by one domain from being accessed or manipulated by a different address , make it hard for attackers to reuse authentication credentials to gain unauthorized access .
CERT is encouraging admins to update their proxy servers and in the meantime to follow a series of workarounds .
It remains unclear how common transparent interception is used in proxy servers .
While several security experts said few large companies use it , Kevin Johnson , a senior security analyst at InGuardians , said the configuration is often used when implementing reverse proxies for load balancing , content caching and other network management services .
" It 's a good thing this was announced , " he told The Register .
" Proxy servers have been a point of interest for the last decade . " ®

STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
In the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand Nine
A RESOLUTION affirming States ’ rights based on Jeffersonian principles .
Whereas the Constitution of the State of New Hampshire , Part 1 , Article 7 declares that the people of this State have the sole and exclusive right of governing themselves as a free , sovereign , and independent State ; and do , and forever hereafter shall , exercise and enjoy every power , jurisdiction , and right , pertaining thereto , which is not , or may not hereafter be , by them expressly delegated to the United States of America in congress assembled ; and
Whereas the Constitution of the State of New Hampshire , Part 2 , Article 1 declares that the people inhabiting the territory formerly called the province of New Hampshire , do hereby solemnly and mutually agree with each other , to form themselves into a free , sovereign and independent body - politic , or State , by the name of The State of New Hampshire ; and
Whereas the State of New Hampshire when ratifying the Constitution for the United States of America recommended as a change , “ First That it be Explicitly declared that all Powers not expressly & particularly Delegated by the aforesaid are reserved to the several States to be , by them Exercised ; ” and
Whereas the other States that included recommendations , to wit Massachusetts , New York , North Carolina , Rhode Island and Virginia , included an identical or similar recommended change ; and
Whereas these recommended changes were incorporated as the ninth amendment , the enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people , and the tenth amendment , the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people , to the Constitution for the United States of America ; now , therefore , be it
Resolved by the House of Representatives , the Senate concurring :
That the several States composing the United States of America , are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their General Government ; but that , by a compact under the style and title of a Constitution for the United States , and of amendments thereto , they constituted a General Government for special purposes , -- delegated to that government certain definite powers , reserving , each State to itself , the residuary mass of right to their own self - government ; and that whensoever the General Government assumes undelegated powers , its acts are unauthoritative , void , and of no force ; that to this compact each State acceded as a State , and is an integral party , its co-States forming , as to itself , the other party : that the government created by this compact was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself ; since that would have made its discretion , and not the Constitution , the measure of its powers ; but that , as in all other cases of compact among powers having no common judge , each party has an equal right to judge for itself , as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress ; and
That the Constitution of the United States , having delegated to Congress a power to punish treason , counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States , piracies , and felonies committed on the high seas , and offences against the law of nations , slavery , and no other crimes whatsoever ; and it being true as a general principle , and one of the amendments to the Constitution having also declared , that “ the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people , ” therefore all acts of Congress which assume to create , define , or punish crimes , other than those so enumerated in the Constitution are altogether void , and of no force ; and that the power to create , define , and punish such other crimes is reserved , and , of right , appertains solely and exclusively to the respective States , each within its own territory ; and
That it is true as a general principle , and is also expressly declared by one of the amendments to the Constitution , that “ the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people ; ” and that no power over the freedom of religion , freedom of speech , or freedom of the press being delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , all lawful powers respecting the same did of right remain , and were reserved to the States or the people : that thus was manifested their determination to retain to themselves the right of judging how far the licentiousness of speech and of the press may be abridged without lessening their useful freedom , and how far those abuses which cannot be separated from their use should be tolerated , rather than the use be destroyed .
And thus also they guarded against all abridgment by the United States of the freedom of religious opinions and exercises , and retained to themselves the right of protecting the same .
And that in addition to this general principle and express declaration , another and more special provision has been made by one of the amendments to the Constitution , which expressly declares , that “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof , or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press : ” thereby guarding in the same sentence , and under the same words , the freedom of religion , of speech , and of the press : insomuch , that whatever violated either , throws down the sanctuary which covers the others , and that libels , falsehood , and defamation , equally with heresy and false religion , are withheld from the cognizance of federal tribunals .
That , therefore , all acts of Congress of the United States which do abridge the freedom of religion , freedom of speech , freedom of the press , are not law , but are altogether void , and of no force ; and
That the construction applied by the General Government ( as is evidenced by sundry of their proceedings ) to those parts of the Constitution of the United States which delegate to Congress a power “ to lay and collect taxes , duties , imports , and excises , to pay the debts , and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States , ” and “ to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers vested by the Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof , ” goes to the destruction of all limits prescribed to their power by the Constitution : that words meant by the instrument to be subsidiary only to the execution of limited powers , ought not to be so construed as themselves to give unlimited powers , nor a part to be so taken as to destroy the whole residue of that instrument : that the proceedings of the General Government under color of these articles , will be a fit and necessary subject of revisal and correction ; and
That a committee of conference and correspondence be appointed , which shall have as its charge to communicate the preceding resolutions to the Legislatures of the several States ; to assure them that this State continues in the same esteem of their friendship and union which it has manifested from that moment at which a common danger first suggested a common union : that it considers union , for specified national purposes , and particularly to those specified in their federal compact , to be friendly to the peace , happiness and prosperity of all the States : that faithful to that compact , according to the plain intent and meaning in which it was understood and acceded to by the several parties , it is sincerely anxious for its preservation : that it does also believe , that to take from the States all the powers of self - government and transfer them to a general and consolidated government , without regard to the special delegations and reservations solemnly agreed to in that compact , is not for the peace , happiness or prosperity of these States ; and that therefore this State is determined , as it doubts not its co-States are , to submit to undelegated , and consequently unlimited powers in no man , or body of men on earth : that in cases of an abuse of the delegated powers , the members of the General Government , being chosen by the people , a change by the people would be the constitutional remedy ; but , where powers are assumed which have not been delegated , a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy : that every State has a natural right in cases not within the compact , ( casus non foederis ) , to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits : that without this right , they would be under the dominion , absolute and unlimited , of whosoever might exercise this right of judgment for them : that nevertheless , this State , from motives of regard and respect for its co-States , has wished to communicate with them on the subject : that with them alone it is proper to communicate , they alone being parties to the compact , and solely authorized to judge in the last resort of the powers exercised under it , Congress being not a party , but merely the creature of the compact , and subject as to its assumptions of power to the final judgment of those by whom , and for whose use itself and its powers were all created and modified : that if the acts before specified should stand , these conclusions would flow from them : that it would be a dangerous delusion were a confidence in the men of our choice to silence our fears for the safety of our rights : that confidence is everywhere the parent of despotism -- free government is founded in jealousy , and not in confidence ; it is jealousy and not confidence which prescribes limited constitutions , to bind down those whom we are obliged to trust with power : that our Constitution has accordingly fixed the limits to which , and no further , our confidence may go .
In questions of power , then , let no more be heard of confidence in man , but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution .
That this State does therefore call on its co-States for an expression of their sentiments on acts not authorized by the federal compact .
And it doubts not that their sense will be so announced as to prove their attachment unaltered to limited government , whether general or particular .
And that the rights and liberties of their co-States will be exposed to no dangers by remaining embarked in a common bottom with their own .
That they will concur with this State in considering acts as so palpably against the Constitution as to amount to an undisguised declaration that that compact is not meant to be the measure of the powers of the General Government , but that it will proceed in the exercise over these States , of all powers whatsoever : that they will view this as seizing the rights of the States , and consolidating them in the hands of the General Government , with a power assumed to bind the States , not merely as the cases made federal , ( casus foederis , ) but in all cases whatsoever , by laws made , not with their consent , but by others against their consent : that this would be to surrender the form of government we have chosen , and live under one deriving its powers from its own will , and not from our authority ; and that the co-States , recurring to their natural right in cases not made federal , will concur in declaring these acts void , and of no force , and will each take measures of its own for providing that neither these acts , nor any others of the General Government not plainly and intentionally authorized by the Constitution , shall be exercised within their respective territories ; and
That the said committee be authorized to communicate by writing or personal conferences , at any times or places whatever , with any person or person who may be appointed by any one or more co-States to correspond or confer with them ; and that they lay their proceedings before the next session of the General Court ; and
That any Act by the Congress of the United States , Executive Order of the President of the United States of America or Judicial Order by the Judicatories of the United States of America which assumes a power not delegated to the government of United States of America by the Constitution for the United States of America and which serves to diminish the liberty of the any of the several States or their citizens shall constitute a nullification of the Constitution for the United States of America by the government of the United States of America .
Acts which would cause such a nullification include , but are not limited to :
I. Establishing martial law or a state of emergency within one of the States comprising the United States of America without the consent of the legislature of that State .
II .
Requiring involuntary servitude , or governmental service other than a draft during a declared war , or pursuant to , or as an alternative to , incarceration after due process of law .
III .
Requiring involuntary servitude or governmental service of persons under the age of 18 other than pursuant to , or as an alternative to , incarceration after due process of law .
IV .
Surrendering any power delegated or not delegated to any corporation or foreign government .
V . Any act regarding religion ; further limitations on freedom of political speech ; or further limitations on freedom of the press .
VI .
Further infringements on the right to keep and bear arms including prohibitions of type or quantity of arms or ammunition ; and
That should any such act of Congress become law or Executive Order or Judicial Order be put into force , all powers previously delegated to the United States of America by the Constitution for the United States shall revert to the several States individually .
Any future government of the United States of America shall require ratification of three quarters of the States seeking to form a government of the United States of America and shall not be binding upon any State not seeking to form such a government ; and
Motivation :
I had an existing class hierarchy , where I sometimes wanted to make the same modification to two different classes , while leaving the original classes untouched .
I considered the decorator pattern because it let me add functionality to objects of different types by intercepting then proxying method calls .
My client using the decorated object saw these objects behaving polymorphicly because the method interface was constant , while object behavior varies by object .
However , the decorator did not give me true polymorphism because the decorator class is not in the inheritence tree of the object it decorates .
Therefore if code inside the decorated object calls one of it ’s own member functions it will never execute the matching method of the decorator .
What if you wanted true inheritance , but also wanted to add the same behavior to multiple types of objects ?
Lets take an example …
Lets say we have a Person class .
From that class we derive both a Man and a Woman class .
PERSON | ------------------------------ | | MAN WOMAN
What if I introduce the concept of an insecure person ?
Lets say that insecurity manifests itself the same way in both sexes .
I want to be able create a regular man , a regular woman , an insecure man or an insecure woman .
Adding another stipulation , lets say that insecurity modifies the existing methods of a person in some way , as opposed to just adding new methods .
I do n’t want multiple inheritance since I am modifying existing methods of the class , not adding new methods that the class does not have .
I also do n’t want a decorator , as we will see later , because there are non-public methods called internally that I want overridden as well .
I do n’t want to put IF statements in the code to check if we are insecure , since I think inheritance is more maintainable .
I also do n’t want to create insecure man and insecure woman classes separately because they would share exactly the same code .
What I really want …
PERSON | ------------------------------ | | MAN WOMAN | |
INSECURE INSECURE
In programming languages I ’ve used , it is not possible to create the class hierarchy above at design time .
The “ insecure ” class has two different parents , but only one parent at a time .
What if we could separate the definition of the class hierarchy from the class definition itself ?
e.g. class InsecureMan = Person -> Man ->
Insecure
class InsecureWoman = Person -> Woman ->
Insecure
In python , you can approximate such a language construct because you can create and manipulate classes on the fly .
It is likely that someone better versed in metaclasses could do a cleaner job than I have done , but I include here a version that has been working for me .
Lets say I start with Insecure derived from Man .
It is not safe to just take an instance of the Insecure class and change it ’s parent class from Man to Woman if you desire an Insecure Woman instance .
If you had existing instances of Insecure Men you will have transgendered them by changing the parent of the Insecure class , since they all share the same class definition .
Therefore , before linking classes together to build a class heirarchy we create a class shell whose parent we can set , then copy over references to all the class members and methods .
Alternative Designs :
There are ways via composition to solve this particular problem .
You could provide the person with a VoiceBox , or an InsecureVoiceBox derived from a VoiceBox .
The InsecureVoiceBox adds in the “ if that is OK . ” when asked to speak .
But , if there are a wide variety of methods that need modification , or if the voice box needed access to Person methods composition might not fit as well .
“ I ca n’t get a job anywhere . ”
I ’ve been getting a lot of e-mails that start like that .
This one was from Ellie Trope of Mid-City in Los Angeles , near La Brea , who lost her job more than a year ago .
She wrote me after reading my column two weeks ago about the endless mob scene at the employment office in Van Nuys .
Trope , 43 , is an attorney with 15 years of experience , and she said lawyers are losing their jobs in droves .
When people in banking and the mortgage industry were getting the heave - ho , it came as no surprise .
In fact , on Friday I spoke to a banking executive with 20,000 employees under him who got fired in December after 21 years on the job .
But I would have thought anyone with a law degree would be able to talk their way out of a layoff , file for an injunction , whatever .
Advertisement
Not so .
Trope told me it ’s gotten much worse of late , and when I made some phone calls and checked on the Internet , I found that law firms in California and throughout the nation have been handing out pink slips by the dozens and the hundreds .
“ Job cuts in U.S. legal sector hit 1,300 for January , ” said a headline at Legalweek.com .
“ Today is n’t over , but it already has a name : Black Thursday , ” said a Los Angeles County Bar Assn .
blog this week , making reference to hundreds of layoffs in the legal biz that were announced around the world the other day .
Trope sounded weary when I spoke to her by phone .
The financial pressure of losing her job took a huge toll on her marriage , she told me , and she and her husband are now living separately .
They share custody of their two children , and despite the financial strain , Trope has n’t wanted to put the nanny on the bricks too , so she ’s shuttling back and forth between households with the kids .

“ I ’m definitely not desperate , ” said Trope , who worried about coming off like a whiner when so many people are in far worse shape .
But she did n’t sound whiny to me .
Instead , she was very forthcoming about what it ’s like to fall from your perch and realize , to your surprise , that being humbled is n’t entirely a bad thing .
“ Attorneys used to be recession - proof , ” said Trope , and she assumed she was too .
From Fairfax High , she went to UC Riverside and then Whittier Law School .
She had several jobs after graduating 15 years ago , mostly as an in - house counsel specializing in consumer products .
Advertisement
Last February , after 15 months with an international toy company handling licensing , copyrights , advertising and labor relations , she heard layoffs were coming because the 2007 Christmas season had been slow .
Then she was whacked .
“ I loved the people I worked with , ” said Trope .
“ It was almost like losing a boyfriend or a relationship .
I was devastated . ”
But her disappointment did n’t shake her confidence .
“ I figured I ’d find another job . ”
Advertisement
When it did n’t happen right away , she did something she never expected to do in her life .
“ I applied for unemployment insurance . ”
How did it feel ?
“ I figured I paid into it , and this is what other people do . ”
Advertisement
To stay on the dole , you ’ve got to show that you ’re actively looking for work .
So Trope checked various search sites and diligently applied for one job after another , and another , and another .
But it was like fishing in an empty lake with a dead worm .
By then , she ’d heard stories of other laid - off lawyers growing more desperate .
She landed a maternity fill - in job in April , but it lasted only until August , and by then hundreds of lawyers were swarming the few available jobs , slapping their resumes on a mountain of others .
“ I have great skills and great experience , but so do the other 500 people who are after the same job , and they might have gone to Harvard . ”
Her husband is a lawyer too , and he was having his own problems holding on to clients and finding new ones .
Suddenly , said Trope , they were behind on the mortgage .
Advertisement
With help from a family member , she moved to her own place to try to figure out her marriage and her career .
As for the latter , she reluctantly decided to lower her expectations and began applying for jobs as a contract administrator , an office administrator and a paralegal .
But she struck out there too , in part because other lawyers were trying the same thing .
“ After a while with the paralegal jobs , the listings said , ‘ No attorneys . ’
I think it ’s because they figured attorneys would leave as soon as they found work as lawyers . ”
In mid-January she got a temporary lawyer job for hourly pay , and this week she ’s switching to another temporary arrangement , hoping this one turns into a long - term job .
“ In my life , things were always way too easy to get , ” Trope said .
“ I put my head in the sand and never thought about the worst that might happen .
It was way too easy to not have a backup plan , and I did n’t worry .
I did a great job at work and I thought that was enough , and it ’s not anymore . ”
Advertisement
She never lived lavishly , she said , but she and her husband were overextended on the mortgage and private school for the kids .
Trope thinks back on how her grandmother , who lived through the Depression , always slipped sugar packets into her purse when she left a restaurant .
Now Trope understands , and though she knows she ’ll never be hungry , she wonders how she ’ll continue to pay for health insurance and whether the house she and her estranged husband own can be saved from foreclosure .
“ I ’ve found strength in myself I never thought I had , and the things that were important to me before are now less so .
Seeing my kids happy matters more to me than anything , and whatever happens , I think this will be one of the defining experiences of my life . ”

Saying Proposition 8 violates constitutionally protected liberties , Attorney General Jerry Brown on Friday asked the California Supreme Court to strike down the same - sex marriage ban , even as supporters filed a brief that would erase the legal recognition of couples married before Election Day .
In a brief filed with the high court , the state top ’s lawyer argues for the first time that Proposition 8 should be invalidated , saying it is “ inconsistent with the guarantees of individual liberty safeguarded ” by the California Constitution .
Brown had not taken a position on the measure until now .
“ There are certain rights that are not to be subject to popular votes , otherwise they are not fundamental rights , ” Brown said in an interview .
“ If every fundamental liberty can be stripped away by a majority vote , then it ’s not a fundamental liberty . ”
Proposition 8 supporters on Friday further pumped up the wattage of the coming legal confrontation by naming Kenneth W. Starr , the former U.S. solicitor general and independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation against then - President Bill Clinton .
Starr , dean of the law school at Pepperdine University , will argue the Yes on 8 case before the Supreme Court , in arguments that could begin as soon as March .
An estimated 18,000 same - sex couples married in California after the Supreme Court ’s ruling in May that struck down existing legal bans .
Brown has said that Proposition 8 is not retroactive to those couples , and he reiterated that statement Friday , saying the marriages of same - sex couples who wed between June 16 and Election Day should remain valid in California , regardless of whether Proposition 8 is upheld .
Proposition 8 supporters acknowledge those marriages were legal before Election Day , and say they are not trying to “ nullify ” them now .
They argue that the plain language of Proposition 8 — “ Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California . ” — means those marriages can no longer be recognized in California , although they would still be valid in other states where same - sex marriage is legal or recognized .
“ Proposition 8 is in effect , and only marriage between a man and a woman is recognized , ” said Andrew Pugno , general counsel for the Proposition 8 Legal Defense Fund .
“ It does n’t say only a man and woman can get married .
It says that only marriage between a man and a woman is recognized .
It means what it says . ”
The group ’s brief says Proposition 8 “ encompasses both pre-existing and later - created same - sex ( and polygamous ) marriages , whether performed in California or elsewhere .
With crystal clarity , it declares that they are not valid or recognized in California . ”
Supporters of same - sex marriage charged that the real intent was to attack gays and lesbians .
“ In doing what they are doing now , they are showing the world what their true agenda is : to harm lesbian , gay and bisexual people , ” said Geoff Kors , executive director of Equality California .
“ No one could think it ’s morally acceptable to destroy a legally existing marriage . ”
Proposition 8 opponents filed suit the day after the marriage ban passed , arguing that the initiative process was legally flawed .
Brown had urged the Supreme Court to take the case , but by saying Friday that Proposition 8 should be invalidated , he aligned himself with civil rights groups and left Proposition 8 supporters legally isolated .
Normally , the attorney general would defend existing state law .
The Supreme Court ’s ruling in May held that the state constitution provides a right to marry that cannot be denied to same - sex couples .
The brief filed by the attorney general on Friday argues that in order invalidate such a fundamental right , the court must determine that there is a compelling justification to do so , such as the protection of public health or safety .
But , Brown argues , the court ’s ruling in May found that no such compelling justification exists , so Proposition 8 must be invalidated .
Brown compared his decision to oppose Proposition 8 to Attorney General Thomas C. Lynch ’s decision to oppose Proposition 14 , a 1964 constitutional initiative that overturned a state law that prohibited housing discrimination based on race .
“ It ’s unusual , but it happens , ” Brown said of an attorney general opposing existing law .
“ Existing laws include the whole of the constitution , and just as Attorney General Lynch filed a brief calling for the invalidation of Proposition 14 , we ’re filing a brief here calling for the invalidation of Proposition 8 . ”

Christianity has been met with varying levels of embrace in the past 450 years in Japan , but even now it has failed to catch on as one of the dominant religion s.
This essay will attempt to show exactly why this is the case — first , that the religion of Christianity did not “ mesh ” well with the native Japanese religions of the time , and second , that the rulers of the time saw it as a threat and possible prelude to increased European influence in Japan .
Christianity was first introduced to Japan in the form of a Jesuit mission led by Francis Xavier , arriving to the Japanese isles in 1549 CE ( Packet 167 ) .
Christianity was actually embraced during this period , even so much so as to prompt some historians to label the years that followed Xavier ’s landing as the “ Christian Century ” .
The people took to this new religion out of curiosity and to try something new , but also , as a recent exam question showed , because the extreme poverty and feelings of hopelessness of the common people at this time led them to seek redemption from a source outside of the traditional Japanese religions ( EALC Midterm ) .
Even some of the daimyos and shoguns of the time actively supported Christianity , the most prominent among them being Oda Nobunga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi ( although Hideyoshi ’s support can be seen just as an offshoot of his intense hatred of Buddhism ) .
While Nobunga rose to power , in fact , “ Christianity approached the status of a state religion ” ( Packet 167 ) .
This period of tolerance , however , abruptly came to an end in the early 1600s , culminating in the total banning of Christianity by the Tokugawa regime in 1640 ( Hendry 127 ) .
When a young man named Amakusa Shiro led a popular Christian uprising at Shimabara in 1638 , he and tens of thousands of his followers were massacred .
Why the abrupt change of attitude ?
First , as Lande quite succinctly puts it , “ Christianity was strange to the Japanese . ” ( Packet 167 )
Most of the older Japanese religions were not mutually exclusive — one could be a Shinto kami worshipper as well as a believer in Buddhism at the same time without sacrificing the purity of either .
It ’s been noted that even all three of the major Japanese religions of the time — Buddhism , Shinto , and Confucianism — “ had managed to coexist with remarkably little friction . ” ( Packet 190 ) Even today , it is commonplace for Japanese to still make pilgrimages to Shinto shrines at least once a year while still using Buddhism for funerals and formal ceremonies .
Other mixtures of the dominant religions occur in similar ways .
This contrasts with the “ absoluteness of Christian claims ” ( Packet 167 ) — you either were a Christian or you were not a Christian , and the thought that you could be both Christian and something else at the same time was foreign to the missionaries trying to convert the Japanese .
They believed that “ Christianity was believed to be the only road to glory and salvation . ” ( Packet 167 ) Also , as stated earlier , many Japanese initially turned towards Christianity because they believed it proved new hope for them and a possible escape from their poverty .
But , later , many felt that “ the Christian God seemed unable to save his adherents from pain and misery .
The fate of the crucified Jesus himself underlined the argument . ” ( Packet 167 )
This lack of divine protection offered by the native Japanese religions served to turn some away from Christianity .
Second , Christianity was seen as a foreign threat .
The Japanese , and especially the Tokugawa rulers of the time , saw Christianity as a symbol of the “ dangers of European colonialism ” ( Packet 167 ) .
The Japanese have always been somewhat distrustful of the West , lasting until Commodore Matthew Perry forcibly “ opened ” Japan in 1853 .
Christianity was thought of as a “ foot in the door ” through which the Western powers such as Great Britain , Portugal , Spain , and France were increasing their influence upon Japanese affairs .
The Japanese rulers saw this as a threat to their unquestioned control , and so they began their merciless persecution of Christianity — over the next two hundred years , “ all families were to be registered at a Buddhist temple … Christianity was virtually eliminated from the country . ”
( Hendry 127 ) They instead promoted Buddhism and Confucianism , especially Shinto as “ National Learning ” — undermining the “ foreign ” Christianity by playing to the patriotism of the Japanese people .
So , we can see that the failure of Christianity after 1600 was caused by two main points — the exclusiveness of the religion itself , and the Tokugawa ’s desire to eliminate foreign threats and secure their own power .
The effects of this purge can be seen even today , as Christians still number less than 2 percent of the Japanese population ( Hendry 127 ) .
While “ white weddings ” and other Christian ideas have been imported to Japan , these can be seen more of the increasing Westernization and not of any embrace of Christianity itself .
All in all , it remains a fringe religion .

The recession in the eurozone deepened at a record rate in the final three months of 2008 , partly down to an unexpectedly grim picture in Germany .
Official figures published today said output across the 15 - nation single currency zone fell by 1.5 % between October and December .
It marked the third successive quarter of contraction and the fastest decline since the eurozone was created in 1999 .
Analysts at Capital Economics said the " recession in the region is deepening at an alarming rate " and forecast a 3 % decline this year .
Germany , the biggest economy in Europe , depends heavily on exports and has begun to suffer acutely due to the collapse in global demand .
In the most recent quarter , the German economy contracted by 2.1 % , the steepest decline since the country was reunified in 1990 .
Italy declined by 1.8 % and France by 1.2 % .
" Today 's data wipes out any illusion that the eurozone is getting off lightly in this global downturn , " said Jorg Radeke , an economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research .
" Indeed , what has started as a financial market turmoil has long moved to the real economy . "
A wider measure of 27 countries , which includes Britain and the eastern European countries that joined the European Union in 2004 , also suffered a 1.5 % decline in output during the quarter , according to the statistics group , Eurostat .
The decline in Europe is now worse than the United States , where the financial crisis began and which reported a 1 % contraction in the final quarter of last year .
Howard Archer , an economist at Global Insight , said the decline would further encourage the European Central Bank ( ECB ) to cut interest rates from 2 % to 1.5 % at its scheduled meeting next month .
There was official confirmation last month that Britain had entered recession , when government data showed a 1.5 % contraction in the economy , the second quarter in a row of declining output .
Steve Barrow at Standard Bank said : " Today 's figures show that the eurozone is struggling more than the US at the moment in terms of GDP growth .
That is going to continue holding the euro down and keep the ECB focused on lowering rates . "
Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Gov. Sarah Palin ( D - AL ) holds her five - month old son Trig on the fourth day of the Republican National Convention at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul , Minnesota on September 4 , 2008 .

JUNEAU , Alaska , Sept. 8 ( UPI ) -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's leadership style has been criticized as lacking follow - through and punitive to those who contradict her , critics say .
Critics cited as an example Palin 's efforts on a bipartisan bill in the Alaskan legislature to investigate charges of unethical conduct by a senior Republican official waned after she became governor , the Los Angeles Times reported Monday .

A spokesman for the governor 's office said such criticism is misplaced .
Palin 's press secretary Bill McAllister said the governor has always been " sufficiently " informed and engaged .
" In just two years in office , she accomplished more than most governors in their entire careers , " McAllister told the Times .
Her critics do credit Palin with moving a state rocked by ethics scandals into cleaning house and pushed to make oil companies pay more to access Alaska 's oil and gas reserves .
Her administration also has n't been as transparent as she promised , the Times said .
Palin invoked executive privilege in refusing to disclose information about one ethics case , and last week she moved to block a legislative inquiry into her role a state public safety official 's firing .
Several legislators told the Times Palin does not brook much dissent , sometimes cutting off relations with those she deemed unhelpful or critical .
Snow forms at temperatures below 0C , when water freezes by forming crystals around " seeds " of particulate matter such as dust .
These crystals come in many different forms , from needles and hexagonal prisms to the beautiful plates and branching , star - like forms we call snowflakes .
Snowflakes are composed of individual ice crystals that have collided within a cloud and frozen together , producing an infinite variety of forms .
At very low temperatures , snowflakes remain in a powdery " dry " form , such as those that fell at the beginning of the snow storm in South - east England on Monday .
At higher temperatures , closer to 0C , the snowflakes stick together to become larger and " wetter " .
This type of snow can easily turn to rain and sleet .
Wet snow is more common in Britain than the powdered variety , which famously interfered with the hydraulic systems of British Rail trains when it fell in February 1991 , and will forever after been known as the " wrong kind of snow " .

Will there be a surge in births in nine months ?
Trains are n't running , offices abandoned .
What to do but snuggle under the duvet and ...
It is widely believed that any natural event that keeps people confined to their homes results in an immediate boost to the conception rate – whether blizzards , earthquakes , or transport strikes .
Nine months after a blackout that plunged New York into darkness for 10 hours in 1965 , it was reported that several hospitals saw a baby boom .
Closer analysis revealed that the number of births was actually within the normal monthly variation .
But the myth has persisted .
As a New York Times writer observed at the time : " It is evidently pleasing to many people to fantasise that when people are trapped by some immobilising event ... most will turn to copulation . "

What caused this week 's blizzards ?
A cold mass of continental air arrived in the South - east from the Arctic via western Russia .
It picked up moisture as it passed over the relatively warm North Sea , which at this time of the year is about 5C .
Once it hit colder land , the moisture stored within clouds that had formed in the air mass fell as snow on Sunday night and Monday .
Meanwhile , a low pressure area developed to the south of the British Isles , which moved north .
This rather warmer air , just above 0C , mingled with the cold continental air and added extra moisture to the mix as it travelled north .
The result was that even more snow fell as it crossed the country .

What 's the best way to clear a drive of ice ?
The easiest way is to brush away the snow before it can melt and refreeze into ice , which makes the clearing process so much more difficult .
Adding salt lowers the freezing point of water and so aids the break up of ice , although this too can refreeze if the temperature falls well below 0C .
Spreading gritty sand over ice helps to prevent slipping .
The grit used on roads is rock salt mined from the ground and crushed to form light brown granules , which in turn is crushed by traffic , spreading it far and wide .

Is it safer to drive or cycle in the snow ?
Generally speaking , four wheels are more stable than two .
However , a car sliding on ice is a danger to others as well as the driver , whereas a sliding bike is only really a danger to the rider .
Being heavier , a car is more likely than a bike to get out of control on ice – unless the car has snow tyres .
A cyclist also has a better awareness of the road conditions than a driver so is more likely to be cautious when riding in snow , and is more likely to be able to avoid icy patches .
So on balance , it is probably safer to ride a bike than a car , providing you take it easy .

How is snowfall measured ?
The Met Office has 193 weather stations across the country , where it measures both how much snow is laying on the ground and how much has fallen from the sky .
The former is measured by man or machine , using a ruler to determine how much snow is underfoot .
The latter is done in the same way as rainfall is recorded .
Snow is collected , as it falls , into a copper container and then melted .
The Met Office uses the calculation that 1 mm of water is equivalent to 1 cm of snow .

Can we eat snow ?
The closest most people will have come to a snow dish is a light dusting of icing sugar on a dessert , but anyone with a handful of fresh snowflakes can whip up a frozen marvel in seconds .
Naturally , these snow delicacies tend to be at the icy end of gastronomy : snow ice cream , snow sorbet and so on .
And , as they usually contain large amounts of sugar and cream , are not suitable for those on a diet .
First , though , we should consider how safe snow is to eat .
As frozen precipitation , it 's surely as ( un ) healthy as rainwater – and most of us would n't scoop up handfuls of water from puddles and make soup from it .
Yesterday it was hard to get an official answer to the question of whether we can eat snow .
A press officer at the Drinking Water Inspectorate replied : " We only deal with the water companies and mains water .
Try the Environment Agency . "
They said : " We do n't seem to be regulating snow .
You should call the Health Protection Agency . "
Their spokesman 's response was : " I do n't think we could answer it .
I suppose you could call the Department of Health ... , " who said : " Thank you for calling the Department of Health newsdesk .
You call is being placed in a queue ... "
( Later , a spokesman sent a statement saying : " If the snow is fresh , untrampled or untampered then there is little risk of contamination and so it can be consumed .
If it is not virgin snow then it is advisable to boil it before drinking as a source of water . " )
Luckily , some of the finest minds on the internet have already applied themselves to this question ; and the answer is n't necessarily good news .
A Los Angeles Times report warned : " Snowflakes drifting out of the sky may have a surprise inside : bacteria . "
The Drinking Water Inspectorate advises people not to drink untreated water , warning it may be contaminated with bacteria , protozoa , parasites or viruses .
" Many of these are harmless , but some may cause serious illness or even death , " said a spokesman .
And so to a recipe :
Chocolate Snow Ice Cream
Ingredients :
Big bowl of snow
One cup sugar
One cup chocolate milk
Instructions :
Mix together

Does it make us happy ?
Does the dawn sun ?
The smell of bacon frying ?
Crisp clean sheets ?
Of course .
A soft blanket smothering the noisy , confused world in silent , virginal white ?
Only a curmudgeon could be left unmoved .
Psychologists say it all depends on how you see it .
An appreciation of beauty enhances wellbeing , and this can be measured ( via the stress hormone cortisol , levels of which are lowered ) .
But if you peer through the curtains and think only of the plane you have to catch , the car that wo n't start or the school that your children will not be going to , it will have the opposite effect .
" Go for a walk in the park in the snow and it will de-stress you , " says the aptly named Ilona Boniwell , a specialist in the psychology of happiness and wellbeing at the University of East London .
The transformation of the world should be uplifting , she says .
Provided you see it as a gift , not a problem .

Should you have a hot toddy in the cold ?
The image of a St Bernard reviving avalanche victims with a slug of brandy from the barrel round its neck has entered popular myth as the ideal way to deal with the menacing cold .
St Bernards no longer patrol the slopes of the Alps , and probably never carried brandy anyway , which is about the worst medicine you can give to someone who is lying in the snow .
Alcohol dilates the peripheral blood vessels , causing blood to rush to the skin and the cheeks to flush , releasing a comforting warm glow .
In doing so , however , it causes the body temperature to fall – the last thing you need while exposed to the elements .
So save the hot toddy till you are back indoors and warming your toes by the fire .

How long will the snowy weather last ?
At least until the end of the week , with at least as much snow as fell on Monday expected again .
Barry Grommet of the Met Office warns that southern and central England is " not out of the woods yet " , with " significant amounts " of snow still to come .
Most of the country will experience freezing conditions tonight , and the Met Office has issued a severe weather warning for both Thursday and Friday , with temperatures dipping as low as minus 5C .
Up to 10 inches of snow could fall in some parts of the country on Friday alone .
Rain , sleet and strong winds will sweep across central and southern England in particular , only letting up slightly at the weekend .

What 's the safest way to drive ?
If a road has not been gritted , avoid driving in the tracks of other vehicles , where compressed snow will provide less grip than the relatively undisturbed snow around it .
Visibility , which is impaired in snowy conditions , can be improved by wearing sunglasses , which reduce the glare of a low winter sun .
Windscreen washer bottles need the right balance between water and solution , and should be checked to make sure they 're not frozen .
The best way to avoid skidding is to keep speeds low and apply the accelerator and brakes gently .
Once in a skid , it 's best to lift off the accelerator and steer in the direction of the skid .

Is it illegal to throw a snowball at a stranger ?
Some police forces have announced a " crackdown " on children throwing snowballs .
Hertfordshire police said they might arrest or fine " anyone who is causing antisocial behaviour or who is acting irresponsibly in these current conditions " .
Chief Inspector Nigel Brown said : " We understand people want to have fun in the snow but would ask members of the public to think about the consequences of their actions . "
Generally , throwing snowballs does not qualify as assault because those being hit have usually consented .
But if they have not , and if they are placed in fear of injury or indeed are injured , throwing a snowball could be construed as actual bodily harm , grievous bodily harm , or worse .

How can we help garden birds ?
In really harsh weather such as we have been experiencing this week , garden birds – and indeed all wild birds – definitely need help or they will not survive .
They face a double problem in periods of heavy snow : the need to maintain their energy levels while having difficulty finding food .
In continuous cold , small birds lose body heat very quickly and expend a lot of energy trying to maintain it , yet the fuel to do this is often unavailable as the ground is covered , it is too hard to dig out worms and insects , many autumn berries are long gone and water is frozen .
According to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds , seed - feeders are one of the best ways to help as modern specialised bird seeds such as sunflower hearts or nyjer seeds are very rich in nutrition .
They need to be regularly filled as they will quickly run out , bird tables need to be regularly cleared of snow and water supplies need to be changed .
The RSPB says that under these conditions food put out into gardens is a real lifeline which can make all the difference to wild birds ' survival .

So should we stop worrying about global warming ?
No .
This week 's snowfall is a phenomenon of weather .
Global warming is a phenomenon of climate .
The difference between weather and climate is not always appreciated , but it is crucial for an understanding of climate change and how it may begin to affect us .
In simple terms , weather is what happens this week ; climate is what happens this century .
One is a short - term phenomenon , the other is a long - term one , and while over the long term we can perceive a trend , over the short term what we perceive is variability .
The natural variability of the weather is enormous .
In essence , it is infinite .
So it is virtually impossible to deduce anything about climate or climate change from a single weather event .
Even as the climate warms , some years will be cooler than others , and climate history shows us that the warming will not proceed in a steady , orderly – in scientific terms , linear – way .
It will go in leaps and bounds , and there may be periods of years when the warming seems to have paused , followed by years of rapid warming .
So do n't look at the event .
Look at the trend .
And despite this week 's snow , the temperature trend for Britain is remorselessly up ; the average temperature of the UK has risen by a full degree Centigrade over the past 40 years .

BART may raise fares , reduce service BAY AREA
BART may be forced to raise fares and parking fees , close some stations on weekends , reduce the frequency of service and lay off employees to help close a projected $ 37 million budget deficit this year , agency officials said Thursday .
" Everything 's on the table , " said BART spokesman Linton Johnson .
The dramatic cost - cutting measures come as the regional transit agency is faced with lower - than - expected revenue from fares and taxes and anticipated state funding cuts .
The BART Board of Directors was to be presented with various budget - balancing options by the staff on Thursday , but delayed the review to hold a public hearing on the New Year 's Day fatal shooting of an unarmed man by a BART police officer .
The budget issue will be addressed at a future meeting , when more details will be provided .
The projected shortfall for the next fiscal year , which starts July 1 , also is grim .
Officials forecast a deficit from $ 45 million to $ 55 million in the next budget cycle .
SINGAPORE / LONDON ( Reuters ) - Goldman Sachs ’ energy equity research team , which predicted a crude oil spike to $ 200 a barrel earlier this year , slashed on Friday its 2009 forecast to just $ 45 as demand deteriorates .

The team led by Arjun Murti , who made waves in 2005 by calling crude ’s ascent to $ 100 , also said prices would bottom out early next year and that a shift from “ demand destruction ” to “ supply destruction ” would ultimately revive oil ’s rally .
In a separate report , Goldman ’s commodities research team also cut its 2009 forecast to an average $ 45 and predicted world oil demand would fall by 1.7 million barrels per day ( bpd ) and help drive oil prices down to $ 30 a barrel in the first quarter .
“ We expect that an additional 2 million barrels per day ( bpd ) of OPEC supply cuts will be required in 2009 , along with a 600,000 bpd reduction in Non-OPEC production , in order to rebalance the market , ” the team led by Jeffrey Currie wrote .
But both groups saw prices recovering in the near term .
Murti’s team predicted a return to positive demand growth and shrinking non-OPEC supply would lift prices to $ 70 a barrel by 2010 and to $ 105 by 2012 .
“ We do not believe oil markets are on - track for a decade - plus period of weakness like seen in the 1980s and 1990s , ” they wrote .
Oil has collapsed more than $ 100 from its July peak as the dawning of a global recession drives demand lower in major economies .
But analysts and officials are warning that a prolonged period of cheap prices could set the stage for another rally if new investment is halted .
U.S. oil prices fell more than $ 2 a barrel to below $ 46 on Friday after a bailout plan for struggling U.S. auto makers stalled this week ’s tenuous recovery from a four - year low .
Does exposure of baby boys -- in utero or in infancy -- to bisphenol A , a man -made chemical which mimics natural estrogens , predispose them to prostate cancer later in life ?
A five - year , $ 2.6 million grant to a University of Illinois at Chicago researcher and her colleague aims to answer this question by shedding light on the mechanism by which it may occur .
Gail Prins , professor of urology at the UIC College of Medicine and lead investigator on the grant , and her colleague , Shuk - Mei Ho , professor and chair of environmental health at the University of Cincinnati , established in earlier studies in animals that perinatal exposure to BPA at very low doses results in increased sensitivity to estrogen as the male animal ages and an increased risk of developing prostate cancer .
Demonstrating a similar link in humans in an epidemiological study is difficult because of the small dosages and long lag time between exposure and effect .
With the new grant , from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences , Prins and Ho will attempt to unravel the genetic mechanism by which the dose - response effect in animals is thought to occur .
Scientists think that sensitization to estrogen due to a much earlier exposure to an estrogen - like compound is an " epigenetic " phenomenon -- a heritable change in gene function that occurs without a change in the DNA sequence , as in mutation .
In this model , the early environment of the fetus causes chemical changes in DNA , called imprinting , which may cause later changes in gene expression .
These epigenetic changes , which result in increased or decreased expression of a gene -- or changes in the type of tissues in which the gene is expressed -- can have profound affects on the development of an organism , Prins said .
And there is increasing evidence that these changes may be implicated in the origin of a number of adult diseases , like prostate cancer .
" We hypothesize that early ' imprinting ' of the prostate gland by exposure to small doses of BPA is the result of specific modifications which permanently affect gene expression in the gland , " Prins said .
" As men age , they produce less testosterone and relatively more estrogen .
Our work with animals has shown that exposure of the ' BPA - imprinted ' prostate gland to this more estrogen - rich environment is the key to the heightened risk of developing cancer . "
BPA is a key chemical in the production of polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins and is found in products ranging from baby bottles to tin can linings .
BPA may break down and leach into food or beverages when it is heated .
More than a billion pounds of BPA is produced in the United States each year .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found BPA in 92 percent of Americans age six or older .
The new study will work with both an animal model and human prostate - like structures and is designed to characterize the dose - response and the period of susceptibility in the developing male , to determine which genes are modified and turned on or off as a result .
The researchers also plan to test directly whether the epigenetically modified genes play an active role in the later development of cancer of the prostate gland .
" It 's our hope that the findings of this study will serve as a model for human exposures to prevalent environmental hormonal disruptors with suspected carcinogenic potential , " said Prins .
The study may also lead to improved methods of screening men who may already be at risk , Prins said .
" In addition to increasing our understanding of how BPA affects these changes on a molecular level , identification of the specific gene modifications caused by early exposure to BPA may provide us with biomarkers for identifying men at higher risk for prostate cancer as a result of environmental exposures , " said Prins .
UIC ranks among the nation 's top 50 universities in federal research funding and is Chicago 's largest university with 25,000 students , 12,000 faculty and staff , 15 colleges and the state 's major public medical center .
A hallmark of the campus is the Great Cities Commitment , through which UIC faculty , students and staff engage with community , corporate , foundation and government partners in hundreds of programs to improve the quality of life in metropolitan areas around the world .
This is a healthy pelican – quite beautiful .
Unfortunately , very sick pelicans are falling out of the sky these days .
It ’s one of many recent alarming indicators from our fellow creatures that things are seriously wrong .
Hundreds of sick pelicans have fallen to the ground from Mexico to Oregon , smashing into cars , boats and beaches , and experts are baffled .
Authorities have ruled out domoic acid poisoning , which has affected wildlife before .
It ’s nothing short of a mystery .
Surviving pelicans have been found in yards and on roads , disoriented and weak .
So far , experts think the cause could be anything from unknown poison contamination to exposure to the toxic run-off from the recent Southern California fires to malnutrition due to evaporating fish stocks .
Though the exact cause is a mystery , it ’s almost certainly due to human impact .
And , it ’s only the most recent case in a slew of disturbing mass animal deaths around the world .
In the last two years , California ’s crops were affected by a mysterious disappearance of bee hives .
Known as Colony Collapse Disorder , the worker bees simply fly away and never return .
Since October 2006 , over 35 % of the honey bee population in the United States has vanished .
In some states , as many as 90 % of bees have disappeared .
Scientists do n’t know what causes CCD , but theories range from stress due to travel ( bees are trucked across thousands of miles , in some cases , to pollinate ) , or pesticide exposure .
A case for local , organic food ?
Dolphins off the beaches of Cornwall , thought to be stressed by Royal Navy operations , apparently committed a mass suicide last summer .
26 dolphins consumed and inhaled debris and mud .
Though dolphins have been found dead en masse before , this is the most baffling incident .
The only other possibility , experts say , is that the dolphins may have been scared by a whale .
Scared enough to willingly fill their lungs and bellies with mud ?
Cases of seals and sea birds washing ashore have been common in recent years .
For example , over 1000 Shearwater sea birds were found dead in the Bahamas and parts of Florida in 2007 .
The cause was n’t bird flu , as experts had suspected when shearwaters turned up dead in 2005 .
There is still no explanation , but every year sees an increase in sea bird deaths , with toxicity the most common culprit .
Also last year , at least 40 endangered gharials in the Chambal river in India died of cirrhosis of the liver , due to apparent poisoning ( a flood in 2007 is thought to have increased metal levels in the river ) .
What was particularly odd about the incident was that only wild gharials , of breeding age , died – the captive bred animals were fine .
And here ’s a case for organic textiles in addition to food : in 2006 , a controversy erupted over the plight of sheep and goats who became ill and died after eating genetically modified cotton .
People working with the animals said they simply became “ dull and lifeless and died ” .
They were found dead with swollen stomachs , mouth lesions and black stools .
Bacterial and viral infections were ruled out ; and no sheep grazing on non-modified cotton died .
In 2007 the same thing happened , also in India , to cattle .
Hundreds , and possibly thousands , of sea turtles were found floating dead or washed ashore in El Salvador in 2006 .
At first thought to be caused by fishing activities , experts quickly ruled this out and the case remains a mystery .

So outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was speaking in Ashkelon on Monday , and he said the most amazing thing .
The USG Open Source Center translated the relevant passage from his speech , in which he claimed he had the ability to control US foreign policy and summarily over - rule the Secretary of State :
‘” Olmert Says Israel Determined To Go On , Recalls Phone Talk on UNSC Vote With Bush
Telephone report from Ashqelon by political correspondent Shmu’el Tal — liveA
Voice of Israel Network B
Monday , January 12 , 2009 . . .
Document Type : OSC Translated Text [ Olmert : ]
“ It transpired all of a sudden that a vote would be held in 10 minutes ’ time .
I tried to find President Bush , and I was told he was attending an event in Philadelphia . ”
Cont’d
‘ I know that if somebody tried to find me on the phone right now , it would have to be something unusual and extraordinary for them to say : Leave it all and go to some room to talk to me .
In this case , I said : I do n’t care , I have to talk to him right now .
He was taken off the podium and brought to a side room .
I spoke with him ; I told him :
You ca n’t vote for this proposal .
He said : Listen , I do n’t know , I did n’t see , do n’t know what it says .
I told him : I know , and you ca n’t vote for it !
He then instructed the secretary of state , and she did not vote for it .
It was a proposal she had put together , one she formulated , one she organized , one she maneuvered .
It left her rather embarrassed , abstaining in the vote on a proposal she herself had put together .
That was why the French and the Brits said she had pulled a fast one on them , she having been the one to spur them to submit the proposals . ” ‘
Olmert ’s account cannot be accurate as to detail .
Bush was not interrupted during his speech in Philadelphia , and the speech was given many hours before the UN vote .
But that kind of discrepancy is easily resolved if we want to believe that Olmert is telling the truth .
When he called the White House , he may have initially gotten a staffer who said something like , Bush is away at Philadelphia for a speech .
Olmert could have misunderstood the staffer to say that Bush was still giving the speech .
But that Condi Rice worked hard to get that UN resolution and that the other diplomats were shocked when she suddenly instructed Zalmay Khalilzad to vote against it is well known and was reported in the Arabic press at the time .
Raghida Dergham wrote in the London - based pan-Arab daily , al - Hayat , on Jan. 10 , 2009 ( OSC trans . ) :
‘ French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner chaired the session , since his country is the UNSC ’s chairman this month , which was attended by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , British Foreign Secretary David Miliband . . . [ etc. ]
Rice surprised the meeting by abstaining from voting after the Americans had left a clear impression during the negotiations of their intention to vote in favour of the resolution .
. .
British diplomacy played a consensual and leading role which contributed to breaking the cycle of delay and procrastination by French diplomacy .
Reporting on the penultimate session of the ministers , sources said Kouchner tried to postpone the voting until today on the pretext that Presidents Husni Mubarak and Nicola Sarkozy approved this delay but the Egyptian foreign minister replied back immediately denying this was true about the Arab stand .
The sources said the Saudi foreign minister demanded that Kouchner put his country ’s stand aside and respond to the demand to hold a session for voting .
The British foreign secretary was on the point of presenting the consensual resolution regardless of the French and US stand .
Russia intervened at the last moments and told the Arab side it was ready to participate with Britain in putting up the draft resolution officially for a vote .
US Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad arrived suddenly at the meeting to report his country ’s stand .
. . ‘
So Dergham ’s account , gleaned from UN sources in New York , shows that Rice had been more in favor of the cease - fire resolution than Bernard Kouchner of France , who used his position as chair to attempt to delay it coming up for a vote .
You could imagine Olmert calling up Sarkozy and urging this delay .
But Kouchner could not stand against the combined pressure of Britain , Russia and Saudi Arabia , and had to allow the vote to go forward .
Then everyone was surprised by Rice ’s about - face .
And it was reported at the time that she changed her mind after a phone call from Bush .
So the substance of Olmert ’s allegations are consistent with Dergham ’s account , gleaned from interviews with eyewitnesses to the process among the Arab participants : “ Rice surprised the meeting . . . ”
It is therefore reasonable to think that Olmert did talk to Bush last Thursday , and that he did have Rice over - ruled .
One can only imagine that he had tried hard to dissuade Rice from participating in the drafting process at all , and had tried to have her veto the resolution , in accordance with standard US procedure of shielding Israel from the UNSC .
She must have blown him off or been evasive , alarming him that there would be a UN ceasefire resolution before which Israel might have to bow .
My own guess is that Olmert had Bush tell her to veto it altogether , but you have to wonder whether she and Khalilzad engaged in their own little final rebellion and so just voted “ present , ” which allowed the resolution to pass .
( Olmert has ignored it . )
Olmert reports that Bush had no idea what the substance of the resolution was , and this anecdote is consistent with what we know about how this White House has functioned .
Bush admitted to Bob Woodward that an important decision on sending some troops to Iraq had been made by National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and that Bush had not sat in on the relevant meetings .
So Rice was at the UN on her own , thinking she was a plenipotentiary of Bush , and Olmert was annoyed at this attitude and decided to put her in her place .
Why did Olmert spill the beans on his backroom maneuvering against Rice ?
It is a very damaging thing that he said .
As Daniel Levy , who had been a Labor Party adviser on peace negotiations , told The Los Angeles Times ’s Paul Richter :
‘ This is terrible for the United States . . .
This confirms every assumption they have in the Arab world about the tail wagging the dog .
. . .
It ’s a story you ’re likely to hear quoted there for years to come . ”
Levy also accused Olmert of “ unparalleled arrogance . ” . . .
” There are some things you do n’t say , even in Ashkelon , even in Hebrew . . . ”
The likelihood is that Olmert was stung by severe criticism of his government for allowing the UNSC cease - fire resolution to be passed .
His Kadima Party is in a neck and neck race with the even more hard line and far rightwing Likud Party , with elections to be held on February 10 .
Presumably Olmert was trying to deflect the Likudniks ’ charges that Kadima was inept or impotent , and to improve the standing of his would - be successor , Tzipi Livni ( now the Foreign Minister ) .
Olmert is having to step down as prime minister because of a corruption scandal that blew up in his face and made him look petty and greedy .
As a mediocre politician with an over - sized ego , he does n’t have many opportunities left to try to rehabilitate his reputation .
If he pushed W. around for Israel ’s sake while she warred with the Hamas terrorists ( his way of thinking ) , then maybe that would take some of the edge off his unseemly money - grubbing and massive list of failures , which include the 2006 Lebanon War .
Finally we come to the really big mystery .
If the substance of what Olmert said is correct , even if he got some details wrong , then why in the world did Bush listen to him ?
Bush is outgoing and faces no new elections .
His party cannot benefit or suffer with the Israel lobbies from a decision he took in relative secrecy since it wo n’t even face another election for 2 years , by which time this Gaza war will be completely forgotten .
Why in the world would Bush over - rule the US Secretary of State , for the sake of Olmert , in the midst of delicate negotiations with European and Arab allies ?
Here are the only possibilities I can think of :
1. Bush is as dumb as he looks and just agrees with the last person he spoke to .
2 . Bush hates it when the roar of cannon dies down , and is a sadist who enjoys prolonging war far too much to ever actively back a ceasefire .
3. Olmert has something over Bush .
I remember that Bush had taken on Sharon in September of 2001 , calling for a Palestinian state and ordering Sharon to stop colonizing the West Bank .
Sharon was so furious that he compared Israel ’s situation to that of Czechoslovakia in 1938 , when the rest of Europe let Hitler grab part of it .
But by spring of 2002 Bush was bending over backward to please the Likud .
What changed ?
Something did .
There is a mystery to be explained here .
I only point out that along with the previous two explanations , this one would make sense of otherwise baffling behavior on Bush ’s part .
Precisely because his overly frank speech raises these sorts of questions , I expect Olmert to deny the entire address , and then it will be expunged from the public record and never spoken of again .
In any case , this slippage of the veil over the way US foreign policy is being dictated by a foreign country reinforces the need for a Peace PAC or ‘ For America ’ PAC to counter - act the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , which is obviously way too powerful for Israel ’s own good .
J - Street and Brit Tzedik Ve Shalom and Tikkun and other liberal Jewish - American organizations are trying to do the right thing here .
Whereas AIPAC gets plenty of help from the evangelicals , the rest of us are letting down the majority of the Jewish community that supports the peace process by not helping it lobby on this issue .
That resolution Olmert tried to spike means that his government ’s continued war on Gaza ( he ordered 60 airstrikes on Monday through early Tuesday ) is even more illegal than the whole enterprise was to begin with .
The good news is that history always repeats itself  so we can see what ’s coming down the pike .
The bad news is that history always repeats itself  so we can see what ’s coming down the pike .
Sigh .
Take this little snippet from the very clever book , the Traveler ’s Guide to the Ancient World : The Roman Empire , which is a " travel guide " to the City of Rome and its environs from the year 300 AD .
Note the following quote on pages 20  21 :
" The consequences of the barbarian threats that first developed 60 or 70 years ago … " [ ca .
230240 AD ] " were that emperors needed to be near the frontiers and required money to pay their troops on campaign .
Many emperors , in need of cash , simply reduced the silver and gold content of the coinage  effectively making enough coins to pay their soldiers , but decreasing their actual value .
Civilians have felt the cost of a devalued coinage : an overall rise in prices .
Indeed it has become difficult to persuade the local aristocracies to pay for the restoration of temples , theaters , and amphitheaters in many of the cities of the empire .
" Most Romans hope that the introduction of maximum prices and wages will curb inflation  now realized to be a negative effect of the debasement of the coinage . "
Every empire tries it : the debasement of the currency in a dishonest and desperate bid to get something for nothing in order to pay for the spiraling costs of empire .
Today , we call it Keynesian Economics , and it is still carried out by modern imperators and their senatorial lackeys who use currency debasement as a " hidden tax " to fleece the plebs to pay for imperial expansion and to take care of their friends and patrons .
Of course , every empire thinks it will avoid the fates of every other previous empire : " This time , it will be different , it ca n’t happen here . "
But the reality is that honest money just works better all the way around , for everyone .
It is a fact of history and mathematics that no one , not even a mighty imperial government convinced of its own omnipotence , can actually get something for nothing nor create wealth out of thin air .
There is no philosopher ’s stone , and there is no free lunch .
When " super - powers " begin debasing their own currency by circulating debt and fiat " legal tender " unbacked paper under the color of " money , " it is a clear - cut sign that the empire is in decline .
I would recommend that citizens of Rome save in honest Barbarian money or pure gold coins , and not squander their grain allowances at the forum buying fancy consumer goods that come into the empire via oriental trade routes .
Maybe even better yet , try to find some solid businesses to invest in beyond the Euphrates and the Rhine .
Of course , hindsight is 20/20 .

The Best of Larry L. Beane II
Israel has launched an air strike in Gaza , killing one Palestinian and wounding at least one other , medical officials said .
The strike hit close to the town of Khan Younis , in the south of Gaza .
The men were on a motorcycle when they were hit by fire from an Israeli drone , Palestinian security officials said .
The strike came hours after officials from Hamas - which has internal control of Gaza - said they expected a truce with Israel to be announced in days .
The Israeli military said the men had been planning an attack into Israel , the Associated Press reported .
At least one of them was a member of a militant group , the Popular Resistance Committees , reports citing officials in Gaza said .
The air strike came hours after the military said militants in Gaza fired two rockets into Israel , causing no casualties .
The two sides have exchanged sporadic fire since calling unilateral ceasefires in mid-January at the end of Israel 's three - week offensive against Gaza .
Hamas officials in Cairo said earlier that a long - term truce could be announced within days .
Border crossings would reportedly be re-opened and a ceasefire would be called for 18 months under the Egyptian - brokered deal - on which Israel has not yet formally commented .
In a world first , a research group in Kyoto Japan has succeeded in processing and displaying optically received images directly from the human brain .
Here 's the Japanese press release for good measure .
One step closer to broadcasting your dreams ?
The research is due to be published today in the US scientific journal Neuron
With the government now debating the release of the second half of the TARP funds , perhaps now is as good a time as any to look at how successfully spent the first $ 350 Billion dollars were .
The evidence is not very favorable .
What I can say without reservation is that the TARP spending prevented large brokers and banks from going to zero .
Since the legislation was passed in the Fall , there has not been a major disruptive bankruptcy .
Sure , the FDIC had to take over a few institutions that were overdue for the long dirt nap anyway , but the sort of market roiling Bear Steans collapse , and the subsequent Q3 Lehman / AIG / CitiGroup disasters have at least stopped .
This is not , to be clear , any declaration that the TARP has been a success .
We have avoided financial armageddon , but other than that , it has been an abject failure .
The short list of criticisms starts with the ad hoc way it was formed , and foisted on the public .
There were no clear goals , no over - arching strategy , no milestones to evaluate its success .
Let ’s take a quick look at some of the shortcomings and misfires the TARP has yielded :
1. No Strategic Plan : What was the original purpose of the TARP ?
Its hard to say , other than it was of the greatest importance it be passed with minimum debate and even less information .
Without stated objectives , its difficult to evaluate whether it is achieving those goals .
2 . Methods and Tactics :
By what method was the TARP to be implemented ?
Buy distressed assets ?
Recapitalize the banks ?
Increase lending to businesses and consumers ?
Rescue foreclosed homeowners ?
Stimulate the economy ?
The constantly morphing objectives make it hard to take the original claims very seriously .
3 . No Triage :
There seemed to be no evaluative method in determining which banks should be saved and which should be put down .
If the goal was to strengthen the financial sector , then the approach is to help those that can be strengthened , and have an orderly liquidation of those that cannot .
Merely throwing money at weak and dying banks is no long term strategy .
4 . Wasting Taxpayer Monies :
Why did private investors like Warren Buffett get so much of a better deal than Uncle Sam ?
Its clear to me that both Treasury and the Fed lack the expertise to negotiate these investments .
Instead , set up a matching investment .
Let those in the private sector with the expertise to do so make substantial arms - length investments , with the the US matching ( at 10 or even 20X ) on the same terms .
5 . Transparency , Accountability , Responsibility : How monies have been spent by the Treasury department ( and Fed ) should be a textbook example of government accountability and transparency .
Its not , and there is no good reason why .
The Fed is even worse , refusing to release any details , which has led to lawsuits being filed by Bloomberg and Fox News to get the specific public information .
6 . Evaluating Progress :
All major programs should have some method of evaluating if they are achieving their goals .
This is missing from the TARP , and its why so many people have no idea if it has been successful or not .
7 . Moral Hazard :
Why are we rewarding companies that were poorly managed , reckless money losers ?
All of the TARP recipients should have anyone senior management associated with the bad investments fired ; bonuses suspended , shareholders wiped out .
How are these firms paying dividends with government money ?
Where are the clawbacks of bonuses from Stan O’Neill , Angelo Mozilo , Chuck Prince ?
That the people responsible for the mess are even remotely profiting from it is simply unconscionable .
As bad as the $ 700 plus billion expnditures have been , the real damage lay in the future .
When in doubt , traders will go bigger and more reckless than ever before .
That is the terrible lessons of the TARP :
Make sure you screw up big enough to get the taxpayer to rescue you . . .
" Make them taste the bitterness of war and the tragedies of homelessness and the misery of horror , " he said in a call to militant fighters .
" They should not be secure while our people ( Palestinians ) are scared .
JACKSON , Ga. , Dec. 6 ( UPI ) -- First Georgia Community Bank in Jackson , Ga. , has been seized by regulators , becoming the 23rd financial institution nationwide to fail this year .

United Community is paying a 0.811 percent premium for the deposits .
The bank will buy about $ 60.6 million of First Georgia 's total assets of $ 237.5 million .
The FDIC said it is keeping the remaining assets for later disposition ..
First Georgia 's four branches were to open Saturday as United Bank locations .

The bodies of Manuel Ponce Rosas and Raúl Lucas Lucía , two indigenous human rights defenders and leaders of the Organization for the Future of Mixteco People ( OFPM ) , were discovered on Sunday , in shallow graves near the township of Tecoanapa in Costa Chica , Guerrero .
The two men , aged 32 and 39 respectively , were abducted on February 13 by three armed men claiming to be agents of the Ministerial Investigative Police ( PIM ) .
“ At the time of their abduction , [ Manuel and Raúl ] were attending an event marking the beginning of the building of a local secondary school in the town of Ayutla de los Libres , ” reports Amnesty International .
“ The event was attended by several municipal authorities .
According to Raúl Lucas ’ wife , who was also present , an armed man arrived at the school at 1.15 pm and threatened Manuel Ponce with a gun .
Raúl Lucas intervened to try to help him and was subsequently hit by the armed man . ”
“ A second man with a gun then arrived on the scene and both men forced Raúl Lucas and Manuel Ponce into a vehicle with tinted windows and no number plates which then driven away . ”
“ No attempt was made to stop the abduction and … when relatives tried to report the abduction to the police and prosecutor ’s office , the authorities refused to open a criminal investigation . ”
The Human Rights Centre of Montaña reports that , “ at the same event was participating the director of Public Safety of Ayutla – and ex-military personnel , Luis Jose Sanchez Hernandez who together with the police officers who were with him , left the event exactly minutes before Raul Lucas and Manuel Ponce were forced into the vehicle . ”
“ During the identification of the bodies , which were found in plastic
bags and buried about 80 centimeters below ground level , the family
members noted that the bodies had visible marks of torture and in
particular , Raul Lucas had a bullet hole in the head , while the death
of Manuel Ponce seemed to have been caused by cerebral trauma . ”
The Human Rights Centre , along with the widows , relatives , and family of Raul Lucas and Manuel Ponce are demanding a full investigation into the deaths of the two slain leaders .

( CNN ) --
The fiance of a top Brazilian model -- whose hands and feet were amputated in a bid to save her from a deadly and little - known illness -- said he believes she will wake up from a coma , noting , " where there is a heartbeat , there is hope . "
Brazilian model Mariana Bridi is in a serious condition after undergoing multiple amputations .
Mariana Bridi da Costa , 20 , was in " very critical condition " on Friday , doctors said , as she fought a pernicious disease that has ravaged her body and forced doctors to perform the amputations and extract part of her stomach as well as both kidneys .
She was breathing through a respirator , officials at Dorio Silva Hospital in the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo said Friday .
" Where there is a heartbeat , there is hope , " her fiance , Thiago Simoes , told CNN in a telephone interview .
Da Costa suffered from necrosis , or the fast deadening of tissue , caused by septicemia .
Septicemia , triggered by a bacterial infection , causes insufficient blood flow that can lead to organ failure .
Bridi first sought medical advice after feeling ill in late December .
Hospital officials said she was transferred to Dorio Silva on January 3 in " septic shock , " a serious medical condition caused by an inflammation .
Bridi was first diagnosed as suffering a urinary tract infection .
By the time the infection was detected , it had developed into septicemia .
Doctors decided to amputate first her hands and then her feet after the condition reduced the amount of oxygen being delivered to her limbs .
Dr. Charles Clarke , honorary consultant neurologist for the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in the United Kingdom , said the development of a urinary tract infection to septicemia requiring amputation was " very rare . "
Vital Signs Each month CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta brings viewers health stories from around the world .
See more from the show »
Just less than one month ago , Bridi was a healthy young woman well on the way to achieving her dream of becoming a world class model .
She placed sixth in the Miss Bikini International competition in China last year and took first place for the " Best in Swimsuit " category .
In 2007 and 2008 , she came fourth in the contest to become Brazil 's entrant for the Miss World pageant .
Simoes said da Costa was on her way to international stardom , signing with prominent model scout Dilson Stein , who brought Brazilian models , including Gisele Bundchen and Luize Altenhofen , to the world stage .
" All the agencies were very interested in knowing her .
I know for a fact that they would have loved her because Mariana is beautiful , " Stein told Brazil 's Tribuna newspaper .
Her fiance told CNN that da Costa woke up from a coma ten days ago and told him how much she wanted to be alive .
" She told me she was praying to stay alive , that she still had a lot to do on this earth , that she wanted to go on with her plans , " he said .
" She comes from a humble family and she was the main breadwinner , " said Simoes , who refuted rumors that da Costa was dieting and that might have affected her health .
" She never dieted , never took pills ... she is a very simple , very warm human being , " he said .
Meanwhile , Tribuna reporter Rafaele Gasparini , who recently spent several hours with da Costa 's family , told CNN that they were not so optimistic about her condition , which is deteriorating rapidly .
" Her father told me that she is unconscious and her blood pressure is dropping rapidly , " said Gasparini .
" Her relatives walked out ( in the afternoon ) , and there seemed to be a farewell mood , " she said .
Gasparini said the model was in a " forced coma , " which might help her body recover from the physical shock .
She was also being treated with noradrenaline .
Known as a " fight or flight " chemical that the body releases in stressful situations , noradrenaline produces increased blood pressure and heart rate .
A doctor who recently published an article in The New England Journal of Medicine on the disease , told CNN that little was known about the illness , although it is the tenth leading cause of deaths in the United States .
" We know a lot about what happens once a patient contracts the illness but we know very little about what causes it , " said Dr. Greg Martin of Emory University in Atlanta .
" It is a leading health threat in this country , killing at least 800,000 people a year , " he said .
Martin said sepsis was a " response " to an infection , which can cause the immune system to lose its balance .
" Basically , the immune system goes haywire after contracting an infection and begins to overreact , " he said .
Men were more susceptible than women , Martin said .
News of Bridi's condition spread quickly throughout Brazil and then worldwide .
A message on her Web site said the volume of traffic had caused it to crash , and that the site had received more than 15,000 hits in two days .
" The whole world , I repeat , the whole world is touched by the case of Mariana , " it said .
The message said they had received " e- mails of solidarity from all corners of the world : Australia , Ukraine , Czech Republic , France , Italy , USA , Russia , etc . "
The model 's family and friends have urged people to keep praying for her survival .
" Mariana is ( a ) warrior and will win this battle , " they said in a statement .

Please review our list of best credit cards , or use our CardMatch ™ tool to find cards matched to your needs .
For those who romanticize the Amish as one of our few living links to a bygone era before credit cards and cell phones , you ’d be more likely to find that in the pages of Mark Twain .
Yes , the Amish are famous for being thrifty and for being not the sort to become mired in debt , but even the Amish use credit cards .
Take Daniel Miller , 41 , an Amish businessman in West Union , Ohio , which is something of a tourism mecca for locals who want to breathe in the rolling Appalachia countryside and the Amish culture that comes with it .
Miller looks the part , with his beard , suspenders and clothes that resemble a photo one might find in an 1897 Sears , Roebuck & Co. catalog .
But when he discusses how he uses his credit card , there ’s no doubt that he belongs firmly in the 21st century .
Some Amish use rewards points , cite convenience
Miller runs Miller ’s Furniture , several dozen yards away from two other businesses that his brothers , Harry and Larry , operate and own , Miller ’s Bulk Food and Miller ’s Bakery & Gifts .
The businesses accept Visa and MasterCard branded cards from the public — these days , they ’d be crazy not to — but the Amish use them as consumers , too .
In fact , the Amish wrestle with many of the same credit card issues as the “ English ” — the term they use for the nonAmish .
“ It ’s easier to use it , especially when you ’re traveling or even like when my wife ’s shopping at the store , ” says Miller .
“ I daresay , if we have 100 Amish families in the area , 90 percent of the families use them . ”
In fact , Miller , who rides in a horse and buggy and has as normal of an Amish lifestyle as anyone else , can nevertheless sound like any of the English when it comes to using his credit card .
For starters , he candidly admits that in the past , before he took over the family business 15 years ago , there were times when it would take him three or four months to pay off a purchase made on a credit card .
And currently his favorite credit card is a store credit card that comes from Cabela ’s , a retail chain that sells hunting , fishing and outdoor gear .
When he is able to get to Wheeling , W. Va. , where the nearest store is located , he uses the points that he has accrued on his Cabela ’s Visa card to trade in for items in the store .
He says that Cabela is a favorite credit card of the Amish in Adams County .
Not all Amish use plastic
Not every Amish community is the same , however .
As Tom Cross , executive director of the Travel & Visitors Bureau in Adams County , Ohio , observes , there are progressive Amish communities and very conservative Amish communities .
“ I would call this a middle - of - the - road one , ” says Cross .
Miller ’s estimate that 90 percent of the families in Adams County have a credit card , but at least one Amish expert , Erik Wesner , estimates that across the 1,600 Amish communities throughout North America , the number is more like 20 percent .
Wesner writes a blog called AmishAmerica and is working on a book about Amish business wisdom to be published in the spring of 2010 by Jossey - Bass , a division of Wiley .
He estimates that in the past four years , he has visited 20 Amish communities in five states and has met with about 5,000 Amish families .
He also used to have a bookselling business , in which he had about 1,300 Amish customers , many of whom used credit cards .
Most Amish , however , who tend to have bank accounts just like any English person , “ are more likely to use a check than any other means of payment , ” says Wesner .
“ It ’s difficult to judge , however , for a number of reasons …
Besides a few common theological and cultural tenants all Amish adhere to , there are no \u2018 top - down ’ dictates over Amish society when it comes to the cultural rulebook , and for example , what technologies are acceptable . ”
Those theological and cultural tenants that Wesner is talking about are generally known , but often misunderstood , by the English .
Everyone knows that they travel in a buggy pulled by horses , that they do n’t have electricity and generally shun modern conveniences on a daily basis , and they especially shun bringing technology into their homes .
They are n’t allowed to divorce or leave the Amish community without being excommunicated , but in many other ways they are , figuratively , plugged into the rest of the world .
They are allowed to be passengers in cars , for instance , and to fly in airplanes .
Some Amish like to watch TV if they ’re at a friend ’s house or staying in a hotel .
But as a general rule , they would never own a TV , a computer or an iPod because that would be too much of a distraction from devoting their lives to worshipping God .
On the other hand , they believe that God wants them to make money like anyone else , and so if an Amish businessman needs a website , he will hire someone to set one up for his storefront , even if he himself never sees it .
For instance , Wesner knows some Amish who use e-mail for work purposes .
On the other hand , Miller has never seen a website and wo n’t even see this article , unless someone prints it out and shows it to him .
And yet in many ways , Miller is extremely savvy and , according to him , it ’s the English who are just now beginning to catch up to him .
There is no electricity in his store , but the credit card machines that he uses for his customers are as fast and efficient as in any other retailer .
He uses green energy to power his credit card processing machine .
It comes from a wind turbine and solar panels .
Using caution and common sense
For the Amish who do use credit cards , the rules that they live by are their own — not mandated by the church — and nothing you could n’t figure out on your own .
But if you wanted to follow the Amish blueprint to using credit cards , you would do well to :
Each month , pay for everything you buy .
Roman Mast , 49 , is the bearded and bespectacled general manager in Adams County ’s Keim Family Market , which sells everything from food to furniture .
He says that the Amish do n’t have any personal finance rules that they have to follow , but personally , “ I would advise if you ca n’t pay what you owe at the end of the month , you ’re better off throwing the credit card away .
I know the credit card company does n’t make any money that way , ” adds Mast , “ but I ’d rather be fair to my family than to the credit card company . ”
Miller , who says he pays off the balance every month as well , agrees and says , “ Before I swipe , I ask myself : ‘ Do I really need this ? ’ “
Teach your children the value of being thrifty .
Both Miller and Mast stress this , and it ’s more important than ever for the Amish , since their generation is arguably the first wave of Amish to regularly use plastic .
Mast , who has had a credit card for 20 years , says that his parents never used one .
“ It was n’t an option for them .
They would always say , \u2018 Be thrifty , try to pay for what you buy , ' ” says Mast .
“ If he were alive today , my dad would frown on credit cards . ”
Look for warning signs that you have a money management problem — and get help before there is a crisis .
The Amish are particularly good at this .
Miller says that if they notice someone seems to be having problems paying their bills , the community has a fund that can help an Amish resident — and the church elders will get involved and assist in creating a workable budget .
Miller admits that he ’ll occasionally see his own English customers appear to have problems .
Miller says , “ I ’m not dogging anybody , but I ’ll see a customer putting a card through , and it wo n’t take , and then a second card wo n’t go through either , and then finally they locate a third card , and , yes , they can buy something in my store , but I do n’t know if I ’m helping them or not . ”
Credit crunch
When the financial markets took a tumble in September , and suddenly credit started drying up , some of the Amish could n’t help but notice .
Not all Amish are working the farms .
Some of them are working in hotels and factories , and Donald B. Kraybill , a religious studies professor at Elizabethtown College , in Elizabethtown , Pa. , and the author of books including “ Amish Grace ” and “ The Amish of Lancaster County , ” says that the Amish who work in the construction industry are particularly worried about the economy right now .
In Lappanee , Ind. , for instance , many Amish working in the recreational vehicle manufacturing industry were laid off last summer , as high gas prices strangled consumer demand for recreational vehicles .
The Amish are well known for their pacifism .
Not only do they not fight , they do n’t like to criticize anyone , and so it ’s hard to find Amish people who will say anything negative about their English countrymen ’s propensity to buy now and worry about paying for it later .
That said , from the Amish populated community of Lancaster , Pa. , Wesler ’s contact who uses e-mail and who wishes to remain anonymous , sent him a message that suggests some Amish are anxiously following the economic news — and lay the blame at the most logical suspects :
“ The prevalent opinion with the Amish is the crisis was caused by lending and borrowing money that could not be afforded , with the fault lying with both lenders and borrowers .
Some young Amish couples would be in real trouble were they not able to find work .
But so far , no homes and not many jobs have been lost . ”
But over in West Union , Ohio , Mast says that business is doing just fine — indeed , on a recent Wednesday afternoon , there were plenty of shoppers milling about and purchasing the quilts and homemade soft pretzels — and wonders if the media is making too much out of the credit crunch .
“ What you read in the paper and what we experience in the store is contrasting , ” says Mast .
“ We ’ve been very busy and blessed , and we do n’t worry about what you read in the papers .
If anything , I think what you read in the papers makes people stop buying . ”
Meet Obama 's bodyman : The White House ' Chief of Stuff ' who caters to the President 's every whim
Barack Obama ’s first guests at the White House could n’t have missed him .
Crammed into a tiny cubicle just outside the door of the Oval Office sat Reggie Love , a 6ft 5 in , 18 - stone , shaven - headed , muscle - packed , former American football player .
Though the man is fast , athletic and tough - he can bench press 350 lb and played both basketball and American football at Varsity level - he is not one of the new President ’s official bodyguards .
Heavy duty : Reggie Love , President Obama 's bodyman , lugs bags to a car and , right , on the campaign trail
And though he has a degree in political science from one of America ’s finest institutions , the blue chip Duke University , he is not a policy adviser .
Yet Reggie , a charismatic and immaculately dressed 26 - year - old from Charlotte , North Carolina , spends more time with Mr Obama than anyone else - even the First Lady , Michelle Obama .
For he is the President ’s ‘ bodyman ’ .
The bodyman is a curiously American political appointment , dating back to the first U.S. president George Washington , who paid his assistant Tobias Lear £ 250 a year to act as valet , secretary , bodyguard and general factotum .
The personal protection role has long been assumed by the highly - trained bodyguards of the Secret Service but , ever since Washington , every President has employed a trusted personal aide who caters for his every whim .
The role remained a little - known political tradition until the inner workings of the White House were dramatised in the TV drama The West Wing , where the handsome and dapper bodyman Charlie Young , played by Dulé Hill , was always at the right hand of fictional President Josiah Bartlet .
Obama and Reggie with another aide in the campaign aircraft
Like Young , Love is expected to shadow the President at all times , rarely straying more than a body length away from him during his waking hours .
It is Reggie who holds Mr Obama ’s BlackBerry , dials the numbers on his mobile phone , briefs the White House chef on what the President would like for lunch and what he would like to drink .
Every time Mr Obama leaves for a meeting , Reggie hands him his suit jacket and dabs any spots on his tie with a stain removal pen .
Until Reggie Love , bodymen tended to be regarded as glorified butlers , hired for their self - effacing manners and efficiency at managing their employers ’ schedules .
Their most public job was handing out souvenir cufflinks engraved with the Presidential seal to White House visitors .
But Mr Obama promises to be a different kind of President - with a different kind of
bodyman .
Reggie , who even the notably cool Mr Obama acknowledges is super - cool , has a suitably pithy phrase for his role .
He is the White House Chief of Stuff .
Brotherly love : Reggie sticks close to Obama as they take to the streets
He will make sure the Oval Office kitchen is stocked with the President ’s favourite energy snacks - including handmade milk chocolates from Fran ’s Chocolates in Seattle , peanuts and raisins , roasted almonds and pistachios and chocolate roasted peanut bars .
He always has a pack of the President ’s favourite chewing gum - Dentyne Ice - and dispenses nicotine gum .
( Mr Obama is a secret smoker with a penchant for Marlboro cigarettes but promised Michelle he would quit if he ran for the White House . )
And he ’ll always have a pen and notepad .
Reggie , who joined the Obama staff two years ago as a £ 20,000 - a- year post room assistant and now earns around £ 75,000 , works at least 18 hours a day .
He is up at dawn , bellowing instructions to the President as they go through a gruelling early - morning work - out .
Mr Obama also likes to play impromptu games of basketball and his bodyman , who was captain of the Varsity side at Duke , is always on his team .
Throughout the day , Reggie will constantly be on hand .
He will make sure Mr Obama has a copy of his briefing notes or the latest version of his speech .
He will also make sure the President knows who he is shaking hands with .
Fist lady : Obama and wife Michelle greet each other at a rally with a fist bump
But he is not just Mr Obama ’s ultimate personal assistant .
He has become a trusted friend .
The two men do , however , have one strict ground rule .
They never speak about politics , restricting their conversation to music and sport .
When Mr Obama is through with his interminable meetings with policy advisers , he unwinds by talking to Reggie .
The two men exchange music on their iPods - Reggie is a fan of hip - hop music and has introduced Mr Obama to the rapper Jay - Z ; the President , on the other hand , has broadened his young assistant ’s repertoire by playing him music by Frank Sinatra and the jazz saxophonist John Coltrane .
Reggie even acquired a tattoo on his arm during Mr Obama ’s campaign trail .
The inscription reads : ‘ My Word , My Bond , My Boyz , My Blood ’ and alludes to his loyalty to Mr Obama and the Democratic Party .
Inauguration : Barack Obama - his hand on the Lincoln Bible held by his wife Michelle - is sworn in by U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday
Most of all , the two men like to watch late - night sport on television , during which Love swigs Budweiser after serving his boss with bottled water .
‘ One cardinal rule , ’ the President has confided , ‘ is we do n’t watch the news .
We do n’t watch any talking heads or any politics .
We watch sport and argue about that .
' There ’s no doubt that Reggie is cooler than I am ...
I am living vicariously through him , ’ he added .
Reggie is even credited with encouraging the Harvard - educated President to lighten up by greeting friends and colleagues with a closed - fist ‘ high five ’ - known as a fist bump .
Mr Obama added , somewhat wistfully , that he regards ‘ my guy , Reggie ’ as the kid brother he never had .
Salute to the Commander - in - Chief : Sasha , seven , raises a gloved thumb to show her approval
According to his old schoolfriends , Reggie Love ’s relationship with Mr Obama is one of mutual respect , bolstered by the fact that both have overcome considerable odds .
Mr Obama ’s early life with an absent father is well documented .
Reggie , meanwhile , grew up in a poor area of North Carolina , with aspirational parents who struggled to pay their bills .
Mark Raymond , who knew Reggie at high school , said : ‘ He came from a working family and it was his mother who pushed education .
She made sure he did his school work and he got good marks . ’
Another friend said : ‘ I can see why Barack Obama would bond with Reggie .
Reggie is from a poor family that put high values on education .
' He was one of the best high school footballers in the country and was offered scholarships by universities with top teams - the sort of teams that might have led him to a professional sports career .

‘ But he picked Duke University , which did n’t have a great team but had very high academic standards .
' You see , this is all about personal responsibility .
That ’s what Obama is all about .
That is what he keeps preaching to the black community .
' And Reggie saw the big picture and has shown responsibility .
He has taken his opportunities and made the most of them .
' I ’m sure Obama admires him .
He can point at Reggie and say , “ That ’s the way to go ” . ’
Reggie shares another trait with Mr Obama .
The President was renowned in his youth for his beautiful girlfriends and has admitted to experimenting with marijuana and cocaine , as well as alcohol .
Reggie also had a wild side .
He was dropped from the Duke basketball team for a while after being arrested for under - age drinking and after a picture of him apparently drunk at a university fraternity house party surfaced on the internet .
Reflecting on this period of his life , he said : ‘ You make mistakes , you learn from them , and you try to use them to make you a better person . ’

First day on the job : The President , with Vice President Joe Biden , gets down to work
Reggie graduated with a degree in politics and public policy in 2004 .
He trialled for two professional American football teams , the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys , but failed to make the grade and in early 2006 applied for a humble post room job with Mr Obama , who had been elected as a senator in 2005 .
Reggie started at the bottom and became a political aide .
But when Mr Obama launched his bid for the Presidency , he decided that he needed a bodyman .
Reggie ’s initial chores could not have been more mundane .
On the campaign trail , he carried Mr Obama ’s briefing book , iPhone and BlackBerry , a dufflebag with chewing gum , toiletries and snacks .
On one cold day in Indiana , he was seen with Mr Obama ’s jacket draped at the ready over his arm .
By the time the Obama campaign reached Reggie ’s home town a few weeks later , the local boy had become instantly recognisable .
At a rally in North Carolina , Mr Obama grinned at his bodyman as the crowd set up a chant of ‘ Reggie , Reggie , Reggie ! ’
Reggie ’s handsome features have been noticed in Washington .
He has been earmarked as one of DC ’s most eligible bachelors by People magazine and Vanity Fair .
Insiders at the White House insist that , for now at least , he does not have a steady girlfriend .
But Reggie remains ambitious .
Though he is devoted to looking after the President , Reggie says his exposure to the centre of power has inspired him to dream of going to law school , just like Obama , and returning to Washington in a more influential position .
... and the secret of the presidential watch
Time for change : Obama wears the watch as he gets down to business
For a man with the expensive style of Barack Obama , it at first seems an oddly jarring accessory - the relatively cheap and chunky - looking sports watch he has been pictured wearing .
The Jorg Gray 6500 , which was made in China and generally sells for about £ 100 , has replaced the £ 1,000 Tag Heuer Swiss timepiece that the elegant politician sported in the early days of his campaign .
On closer inspection , however , his new watch - which is stainless steel with a leather strap - turns out to be something of a rare model .
For , unlike the models available to the public , it is customised with the emblem of the U.S. Secret Service .
A Washington insider said last night : ‘ The story going around the White House is that Barack ’s political advisers said the Tag Heuer looked too expensive and that he should wear something anyone could afford .
‘ By one account , when his agents heard about this , they clubbed together to buy him the new watch .
' They got him the same model , with the Secret Service logo , that they wear when on duty . ’
Rare : A close - up of the watch with the Secret Service logo , right
The President likes ...
Grilled fish , steamed broccoli , southern - style barbecues , cheeseburgers ( with cheddar ) ; Black Forest berry tea , bottled water ; Dentyne Ice gum , handmade milk chocolates , peanuts and raisins , roasted almonds and pistachios , chocolate roasted peanut bars ; basketball , Sinatra and John Coltrane .
... and dislikes
Mayonnaise , asparagus , salt and vinegar crisps and soft drinks .
Trying hard to dislike cigarettes .
The Monsoon and Environment Research Group of Peking University submitted a report to Chinese Science Bulletin , recently , showed that regional summer monsoon rainfall in China can be predicted by 1 - 2 seasons ahead by using the signals of the sea surface temperature anomaly ( SSTA ) and the subsurface temperature anomaly ( STA ) in the central equatorial Pacific ( CEP ) .
Several new facts have been revealed as follows .
(1) The strongest center of SSTA along the equatorial Pacific has migrated westward from the eastern equatorial Pacific ( EEP , NINO3 region ) to the CEP ( NINO3.4 or NINO4 region ) in the last half century .
Regular inter-annual oscillations or variation frequency of SSTA in the equatorial Pacific are modulated by intensive La Niña events for about decadal interval .
The winter phase - lock feature for warming events is commonly found at different intervals but warming places are also modulated by intensive La Niña events .
The positive SSTA along the equatorial zone results from exposing positive STA which appears about 3 months earlier than SSTA .
This is a precursory signal for indicating the future warming or cooling event in the equatorial Pacific .
(2) The subtropical summer monsoon rainfall in China has had a long - term rising trend for the last two decades .
The long - term increasing trend is still continued in the central China ( Huaihe ) region but a deducing trend has been observed since 1998 in southern regions .
A typical biennial oscillation of summer rainfall anomaly has been found in central China and biennial oscillation of SSTA has also been observed in the CEP since the early 21st century .
(3) Since the beginning of the 21st century , three warm events in winter occurring in the CEP have been accompanied with more summer rainfall in central China and less summer rainfall in southern China .
The warm SSTA indicated that the winter phase - lock SSTA had a determined relationship with the summer rainfall anomalies in central China and southern China respectively .
This relationship shows that the more summer rainfall in central China follows the winter - spring warm water in the CEP while the more summer rainfall in southern China may follow the winter - spring cool water in recent years .
A cold water event was observed in 2008 so that the more summer rainfall has been successfully predicted in southern China .

Apple is n't going to roll out a revamped Mac desktop anytime soon , because you would n't buy one anyway , analysts say .
Tough economic times , a shrinking desktop market and strong notebook sales make the idea of a sexy , aluminum Mac Mini an unwise investment for
Apple , said Trip Chowdhry , a Global Equities Research analyst .
" In this environment where nobody is buying anything and you come out with a kick - ass product , you might get a lot of wows and woos , but that does not convert into sales , " Chowdhry said .
" So that 's a wasted effort . "
Apple's
Mac desktop line is conspicuously overdue for a refresh .
Typically , these computers receive at least an incremental upgrade ( i.e. , minor improvements to processor , memory , storage ) every seven months .
However , both the Mac Mini and Mac Pro have n't received an update in well over a year , and the current iMac is 10 months old .
Apple 's secretive business strategies and company culture are unconventional , to say the least , but it appears the state of the PC industry —
combined with the economic downturn — is forcing the corporation to conform .
Richard Shim , an analyst at research firm IDC , said
U.S. desktop sales shrank about 8 percent last year , dropping from 34.2
million desktop shipments in 2007 to 31.4 million units in
2008 .
And worldwide , PC shipments shrank about 6 percent , from 153.6
million units shipped in 2007 to 144.9 million in 2008 , Shim said .
On top of that , Apple 's MacBook sales are skyrocketing , growing 71 percent in the first quarter of 2009 compared to a year ago .
Meanwhile , the company 's desktop sales declined 25 percent year - over - year , according to Peter Oppenheimer , Apple 's chief financial officer .
" IMac sales went to hell in December , " said Charlie Wolf , a Needham & Company analyst .
So even though numerous Apple insiders blurted rumors about a redesigned Mac Mini due for an early 2009 release , Apple is likely waiting for a better time to roll out a makeover for this long - neglected device , as well as for the iMac line .
And that makes sense , because form - factor upgrades draw in the most sales , Wolf said .
With all that said , Chowdhry estimates that 2010 would be a more reasonable year for Apple to release any form - factor upgrades for its desktop line , including the Mac Mini .
As for incremental upgrades , Chowdhry predicted the Mac Pro and iMac will likely receive a minor boost sometime in June , in time for the back - to - school season .

Mainstream authors and publishers seem happy to appropriate the tropes of science fiction but not the label itself
What do novels about a journey across post - apocalyptic America , a clone waitress rebelling against a future society , a world - girdling pipe of special gas keeping mutant creatures at bay , a plan to rid a colonisable new world of dinosaurs , and genetic engineering in a collapsed civilisation have in common ?
They are all most definitely not science fiction .
Literary readers will probably recognise The Road by Cormac McCarthy , one of the sections of Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell , The Gone - Away World by Nick Harkaway , Stone Gods by Jeanette Winterson and Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood from their descriptions above .
All of these novels use the tropes of what most people recognise as science fiction , but their authors or publishers have taken great pains to ensure that they are not categorised as such .
The Gone - Away World by Nick Harkaway has just had its paperback release , and is a tour - de - force of ninjas , truckers , Dr Strangelove - type military men , awe - inspiring imagery and very clever writing .
It 's also undeniably science fiction .
Harkaway is an unrepentant fan of the genre , but his publishers William Heinemann have taken a lot of care not to market the book as such .
Harkaway himself said in a recent interview : " I suppose the book does take place in the future , but not the ray - guns - and - silver - suits future .
It 's more like tomorrow if today was a really , really bad day . "
It 's this cartoon imagery of science fiction that least appeals to serious writers and readers .
Or , as Margaret Atwood put it more bluntly and infamously : " Science fiction is rockets , chemicals and talking squids in outer space . "
Jeanette Winterson has leapt into the fray too , commenting : " People say to me , ' so is the Stone Gods science fiction ? '
Well , it is fiction , and it has science in it , and it is set ( mostly ) in the future , but the labels are meaningless .
I can't see the point of labelling a book like a pre-packed supermarket meal .
There are books worth reading and books not worth reading .
That 's all . "
Those in the science fiction camp would say that it is unfair for mainstream authors to appropriate the clothing of the genre but refuse to be counted among their number .
SF uber - fan and pundit David Langford publishes a monthly column called Ansible , both online and in the SF magazine Interzone , in which he has a section called As Others See Us , featuring ( usually disparaging ) quotes from the mainstream media about science fiction .
Are they right ?
If you want to buy Oryx and Crake or Stone Gods , should you head for the general fiction section in Waterstone 's or the science fiction and fantasy shelves ?
Perhaps the problem is that our present has caught up with the future presented to us by the pioneers of science fiction .
Back in the 40s and 50s , when bright - and - shiny / dark - and - dangerous futures were given to us by the pulps , they were truly beyond anyone 's ken .
Now we are actually living in a science fiction future , is it fair to label a novel that extrapolates from what is possible today to what will probably be possible tomorrow , such as Oryx and Crake , as a flight of fancy , no more than a fairy story ?
Those writers such as Jon Courtenay Grimwood and Ian McDonald , who write literary , contemporary fiction but do n't mind the science fiction label , would probably disagree that everything in the genre deserves to be slapped with a " pure fantasy " sticker .
But it is doubtless true that rocket ships and rayguns do form a part of the science fiction panoply , and it is this image which will cause readers who do not consider themselves fans of that genre to shun it .
Is it feasible , as Jeanette Winterson seems to be suggesting , to do away with all categories on novels , and simply file them all in an A - Z of general fiction ?
It might conceivably give every novel a fighting chance , but would the reader who visits a shop or library looking for the latest crime , war or , indeed , science fiction novel really be well served by such a move ?
On the ( Im ) possibility of Obfuscating Programs
Webpage for a paper by Boaz Barak , Oded Goldreich , Rusell Impagliazzo , Steven Rudich , Amit Sahai , Salil Vadhan , and Ke Yang
Abstract
In this work , we initiate a theoretical investigation of obfuscation .
Our main result is that , even under very weak formalizations of the above intuition , obfuscation is impossible .
We prove this by constructing a family of functions F that are inherently unobfuscatable in the following sense : there is a predicate pi such that ( a ) given any program that computes a function f in F , the value pi(f ) can be efficiently computed , yet ( b ) given oracle access to a ( randomly selected ) function f in F , no efficient algorithm can compute pi(f ) much better than random guessing .
We extend our impossibility result in a number of ways , including even obfuscators that ( a ) are not necessarily computable in polynomial time , ( b ) only approximately preserve the functionality , and ( c ) only need to work for very restricted models of computation TC0 ) .
We also rule out several potential applications of obfuscators , by constructing ``unobfuscatable '' signature schemes , encryption schemes , and pseudorandom function families .
Material available on - line
The Pirate Bay's " spectrial " got underway in Sweden Monday morning as prosecutors laid out the charges .
Appearing before a packed house of bloggers , press , and people dressed as pirates , prosecutor Hakan Roswall made his opening statement , charging The Pirate Bay with aiding in massive copyright infringement and profiting from its actions .
Three Pirate Bay defendants and Carl Lundstom , a Swedish businessman who used to run Rix Telecom and is accused of being a Pirate Bay investor , were in the dock listening .
Roswall painted the group as businesspeople out to make serious money from their operations , and he detailed the site 's genesis and growth since being launched back in 2004 .
Those who understand what The Pirate Bay is and how BitTorrent works wo n't find much new or shocking in Roswall 's summary of the case ; the question is simply whether creating a search engine and tracker service that traffics mainly in copyrighted content is illegal in Sweden or not .
Content owners did provide a bit of new information , however — specifically , the amount of money that record labels and movie studios want from The Pirate Bay .
It turns out to be over $ 13 million ( 117 million kronor ) .
For a trial taking place in Sweden and broadcast only in Swedish , one of the remarkable aspects of the " spectrial " is the interest and involvement of people from around the world .
With Swedish media outlets making the audio stream of the trial available , bilingual webheads have been translating and summarizing the day 's action on the Web and — in a remarkable show of commitment to the cause — though hundreds of tweets .
In addition , The Pirate Bay defendants are themselves blogging , tweeting , and holding press conferences ( one was held on Sunday ; Swedish TV4 was banned for past " bad behavior " ) .
They are intent on seeing the trial as mere spectacle and sideshow , a last gasp of the absurd from some dying industries , and one that will be demolished by people power .
In an editorial released this weekend " via the internets , " The Pirate Bay wrote that the way this trial differs " from most earlier trials is that everything in and surrounding it will whirl round and round in diverse channels of communication ; to be discussed , reinterpreted , copied and criticized .
Every crack in their appeal will be penetrated by the gaze of thousands upon thousands of eyes on the internets , in all the channels covering the trial .
Old cliches from the antipiracy lobby wont stick .
You wo n’t be able to say stuff like , ' you ca n’t compete with free ' or ' filesharing is theft ' without a thousand voices making fun of you . "
Despite the glib tone and tough words , the defendants face up to two years in jail and potentially massive fines .
They may consider the trial to be little more than spectacle , but if so , it 's a spectacle with real consequences .
The defendants claim not to be worried .
Tweeting from within the trial today , The Pirate Bay 's programmer Peter Sunde wrote , " How the hell did they think this was going to be something else than EPIC FAIL for the prosecution ?
We 're winning so hard . "
Ludvig Werner , the boss of IFPI 's local Swedish chapter , had a somewhat different perspective : The Pirate Bay is about keeping money out of creators ' hands and putting it into Pirate Bay pockets .
" Copyright exists to ensure that everyone in the creative world — from the artist to the record label , from the independent film producer to the TV programme maker — can choose how their creations are distributed and get fairly rewarded for their work , " he said in a statement .
" The operators of The Pirate Bay have violated those rights and , as the evidence in Court will show , they did so to make substantial revenues for themselves .
That kind of abuse of the rights of others cannot be allowed to continue , and that is why these criminal proceedings are so important for the health of the creative community . "
Researchers ranging from psychologists to epidemiologists have wondered for some time whether online , multiplayer games might provide some ways to test concepts that are otherwise difficult to track in the real world .
A Saturday morning session at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science described what might be the most likely way of finding out .
With the cooperation of Sony , a collaborative group of academic researchers at a number of institutions have obtained the complete server logs from the company 's Everquest 2 MMORPG .
As the researchers who are dealing with this new resource describe it , it 's one of those " be careful what you wish for " situations — with nearly 60 TB of data , the standard procedures for tackling social data sets just are n't up to the job .
Dmitri Williams introduced the project and described how researchers have been approaching various game developers over the years .
He paraphrased the conversation with Sony as :
" What do you collect ? "
" Well , everything — what do you want ? "
" Can we have it all ? "
" Sure . "
The end result is a log that includes four years of data for over 400,000 players that took part in the game , which was followed up with demographic surveys of the users .
All told , it makes for a massive data set with distinct challenges but plenty of opportunities .
Computer science challenges
Jaideep Srivastava is a computer scientist doing work on machine learning and data mining — in the past , he has studied shopping cart abandonment at Amazon.com , a virtual event without a real - world parallel .
He spent a little time talking about the challenges of working with the Everquest II dataset , which on its own does n't lend itself to processing by common algorithms .
For some studies , he has imported the data into a specialized database , one with a large and complex structure .
Regardless of format , many one - pass , exhaustive algorithms simply choke on a dataset this large , which is forcing his group to use some incremental analysis methods or to work with subsets of the data .
Srivastava then gave a short tour of the sorts of items the team is trying to extract from the raw logs .
He apparently has graduate students working on non-traditional figures like the " monster composite difficulty index " and an " experience rate measure . "
But many of the other measures that researchers in the social sciences want — trust , performance , expertise — are fairly subjective .
To get estimates of them , the team is experimenting with trying to track physical proximity and direct interactions , such as when characters share experience from an in - game victory .
To give a concrete example of the data 's utility , Srivastava described how he could explore the phenomenon of customer churn , something that 's significant for any sort of subscription - based service , like cell phones or cable TV .
With the full dataset , the team can now track how individual customers dropping out of the game influenced others who they typically played or interacted with .
Using this data , the spreading rate and influence factor could then be calculated , providing hard measures to work with .
Getting social
Noshir Contractor described how the data was allowing him to explore social network dynamics within the game .
He described a variety of factors that are thought to influence the growth and extent of social networks , such as collective action , social exchange , the search for similar people , physical proximity , friend - of - a- friend ( FoaF ) interactions , and so on .
Because these are well - developed concepts , statistical tools exist that can extract their signature from the raw data by looking at interactions like instant messaging , partnerships , and trade .
Contractor described the results of running these tests on a week 's worth of data from a server that saw over 3,000 North American players during that span .
In that week , his team could detect over 2,000 players that became involved in partner relationships and about 2,500 who took part in trade interactions .
The IM network had fewer participants ; in the question - and - answer session afterwards , Williams suggested that many players rely on VoIP for their interactions —
" It 's easier to say ' look out ' than take your hands off the controls and type it , " he said .
Nevertheless , signatures of popularity and FoaF relationships were apparent in the IM data .
FoaF relationships were the most common in other interactions as well .
Mixing in the demographic information produced a few surprises .
Gender turned out to be a negative influence on interactions : even after their low numbers were taken into account , female players avoided interacting with each other .
Time zones had some influence ; players in the same time zone were 1.25 times more likely to partner than players even one time zone apart .
But distance had a much larger effect ; players within 10 kilometers of each other were five times more likely to interact .
Contractor concluded that , for the typical player , the game simply offered a way of continuing their real - world social interactions in a virtual setting .
Links between the real and virtual world
In addition to introducing the EQ2 logs as a resource , Dmitri Williams described some of the efforts involved in exploring how much of the real world spilled over into the virtual .
The average age of players turned out to be 31 .
" These are n't just pasty white teenage boys in a basement — to be sure , they 're there , but they 're not typical , " he said .
The older players tended to play more than the kids and , although the total hours played seem large , he said that the time mostly displaced either TV watching or movie going .
And the surveys showed that those who viewed TV news in the first place continued to do so , suggesting that gamers really slotted EQ2 into their entertainment time .
Mostly , the gamers seemed healthy ; their body mass index was better than the US average and , although they were slightly more depressed than average , they were also less anxious .
Buried among those happy , average players was a small subset of the population — about five percent — who used the game for serious role playing and , according to Williams , " They are psychologically much worse off than the regular players . "
They belong to marginalized groups , like ethnic and religious minorities and non-heterosexuals , and tended to use the game as a coping mechanism .
Implications for gaming and science
Williams pointed out one case where having access to the server logs allowed the researchers to identify some serious skewing in the responses to the demographic surveys .
Older women turned out to be some of the most committed players but significantly under - reported the amount of time they spent in the game by three hours per week ( men under - reported as well , but only by one hour ) .
The example highlights the risk of using self - reporting for behavioral studies and the potential of the virtual world data .
Saying , " I 'm not tenured yet , and I do n't want to tick off that many people at once , " Williams would n't get into the significance of this finding , but Srivastava was happy to do so .
( " I 'm tenured and I 'm not in the social sciences , " he said , " so i can tick as many people off as I like . " )
In his view , the data suggests that many studies that report marginal male - female differences in gaming based only on self - reported figures most likely did so based on unreliable numbers .
It 's entirely possible that a number of other sanity checks on past studies are lurking in this virtual data trove .
There was also talk about the potential for a symbiotic relationship between game designers and researchers .
Srivastava 's work on customer churn , for example , could prove highly valuable for developers that rely on retaining subscribers , and many of the studies that the speakers were interested in doing could provide valuable feedback on how users were actually interacting with various features of the game .
For the most part , the companies that the researchers have approached either have n't been interested in sharing their logs or the logs themselves do n't contain the sort of data that would make for fruitful research .
In several cases , Williams has been told that he should ignore entire classes of events in the logs , because they were purely put in for debugging purposes .
But he argues that this is n't just about researchers losing out .
" There are a lot of things we can show them about their bottom line , but these industries are deadline focused , " Williams said .
" They 're not far enough beyond the garage - shop mentality . "
Awesome Pictures
Collection of 15 best pictures around the internet , some are real photos , some are photoshoped , but these awesome pictures are really inspiring :
I have been thinking back to my Mormon experience , and all I endured during those years .
There were things that I could not tolerate then , and cannot think about now , without feeling angry .
Some might be petty , but they rubbed me as wrong as the real history of Mormonism did .
Its all part of the same heavy saddle Salt Lake puts on your back .
I hated the obsession with the Word of Wisdom .
It was a monstrous thing , and it took on an incredibly ugly life of its own .
Not content with what was listed in the actual Word of Wisdom , fanatic Mormons plugged in a tangled web of extension cords , and came up with cola drinks , cooking wine , and even prescription medications --- my father 's step - mother would not allow my dying grandfather pain medication when he was dying of cancer , because it " was against the spirit of the Word of Wisdom . "
The Word of Wisdom is a huge bore , and it turns coffee drinkers into sinners , and tea drinkers into evil people with no hope in the afterlife .
None of it had anything to do with spirituality , goodness , Christianity , or common sense .
Another one I cannot forget , or get over , was the ham fisted nonsense one had to take from " Priesthood authority . "
Members have their lives pried into through offensive and intrusive interviews .
Minor sins , once confessed , can be used as leverage to beat someone over the head , or get them kicked out of BYU .
The knuckle dragging " Priesthood leaders " were , as a whole , a bunch of dopes who could not think , forgive , or see beyond the end of their own noses .
They were incapable of answers , good advice , or practical thought .
They made Mormonism a huge and offensive intrusion .
The took a good situation and made it bad , or a bad situation and made it worse .
I could not come to terms with the missionary experience either .
It came as a complete shock to me .
I went out full of idealism , and high hopes .
I was going to embark on a splendid spiritual journey .
I would gain that elusive testimony , know the church is true , and come back ready for a life of obedience .
What I got was a para - military nightmare , fresh from the exercise of totalitarian authority .
I was told what to read , think , eat , and wear .
I was not able to sit down in the summer heat without being made to feel guilty .
I was expected to be out at night in sub-zero weather , knocking on doors at 9:00 p.m .
I was rebuked for honesty , and humiliated for normal thoughts .
I was pushed around , bullied , and misused .
I came as a volunteer , asking for nothing .
In exchange , I was treated like dirt .
I never have forgotten the experience .
After all , it was " the best two years of my life . "
Temple marriage is another thing I regret .
I had heard so much , and I was sure it would be breathtaking .
I would feel bonded to my wife for eternity , and there would be no problems .
Sure , some of my relatives could not come , because they could not get in the temple , but I was still certain it was right .
The actual ceremony was a short , sorry little affair .
I wore clothes that embarrassed me , and my poor wife did not look like a bride .
When it was over , we did not even feel married .
Both of us were terribly let down .
There was nothing special about any of it .
I still look back , and feel rather sorry we were denied a real marriage I could feel good about , or look back on with any degree of nostalgia .
We never went back to the temple after the day we were married .
Neither of us felt any desire to go back at all .
I will also never be able to forget the social pressure , and the constant concern my family had with what everyone thought .
My poor mother was terrified of what the neighbors , our " brothers and sisters , " would think .
Image was everything .
Appearances were paramount .
One said the right things , wore the right clothes , and went to the right places .
Being caught out of the pattern could be damning .
Heaven help the poor backslider who gets caught with coffee in their shopping cart .
Such a thing could ruin a reputation , and cause a complete loss of friends .
The suits were dark , the shirts were white , and the lives were regulated .
Even things from a person 's past could haunt them .
I recall a lovely woman in " the ward , " who had been excommunicated years before .
Soon , word got around , and she fell several pegs in many people 's eyes .
And it was not kept secret .
Nothing was kept secret .
All sins were public , all confessions common knowledge , and all lives were an open book .
So many things felt wrong , because they were wrong .
A person is not supposed to be owned by a religion , or turned into a robot .
People were meant to enjoy life , and think for themselves .

In future , the most effective antibiotics might be those that do n’t kill any bacteria .
Instead the drugs will simply prevent the bacteria from talking with one another .
Drug -resistant bugs are winning the war against standard antibiotics as they evolve resistance to even the most lethal drugs .
It happens because a dose of antibiotics strongly selects for resistance by killing the most susceptible bacteria first .
If , however , researchers can identify antibiotics that neutralise dangerous bacteria without killing them , the pressure to evolve resistance can be reduced .
One way to do that is to target the constant stream of chatter that passes between bacteria as molecular signals .
Critical mass
Individual bacteria monitor the concentration of signalling molecules , and when it reaches a certain level , change their behaviour .
That concentration provides a rough indication of when the number of cells in a particular population has reached a certain critical mass – known as a quorum .

When a quorum is reached , pathogenic bacteria shift from a benign state and begin attacking the host by secreting toxins .
But hacking the bacterial communication system could make it possible to prevent this transformation , and leave the cells waiting in a safe form for an attack signal that never comes .
That would give the immune system extra time to naturally clear the bacteria from the body , says David Spring at the University of Cambridge , UK .
His research group has now developed an artificial molecule that could lead to a treatment to destroy the quorum signals sent out by many bacteria , including Pseudomonas – a bacterium that can lead to life - threatening conditions such as meningitis , and that is the primary cause of mortality in individuals with cystic fibrosis .
Fleeting target
The group is working with Martin Welch , also at Cambridge , to design an antibody that will act as an enzyme and speed up the natural decay of the signalling molecules .
This could ensure that the bacteria never receive the command that triggers a change in behaviour .
That antibody would have to be able to bind to a short - lived transitional chemical formed during the natural breakdown of the signalling molecules , and could then chaperone them to an early demise .
This poses a tricky problem for the researchers , as the transitional chemical is too unstable to use in tests of suitable antibodies .
“ Transitional states have fleeting lifetimes and cannot be isolated , ” says Spring .
To get round this , the team has come up with an artificial mimic to take its place .
Because they ca n’t study the transitional form ’s structure directly , their artificial version is a best estimate based on computer models .
Needle in a haystack
Initial tests , though , suggest the mimic is a close match for the real chemical .
At the beginning of the decade , Lian - Hui Zhang ‘s team at the University of Adelaide in Australia identified a bacterial enzyme , AiiA , that naturally destroys quorum signal molecules ( Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , DOI : 10.1073/pnas.060023897 ) .
This enzyme cannot be used for human treatment because it is attacked and destroyed by the immune system .
Spring ’s team put AiiA in a test tube with a ready supply of the quorum signal molecule and measured the rate of the breakdown reaction .
When they added a quantity of their artificial molecule to the mix , the reaction rate dropped because some of the enzyme latched onto the artificial molecule instead – it would only have done this if the molecules were very similar .
Because of that success , the team will now begin searching through an extensive library of real and artificial human antibodies held at Cambridge to identify any that lock onto their artificial molecule .
It might be some time before a good match is found , says Spring – the library contains some thousand billion antibodies .

In a cheery classroom decorated with posters exhorting students to “ Dive into a Good Book , ” four first - graders , who are struggling to read , recited words ending with the “ ang ” sound -- bang , rang , sang , fang , gang .
The Foothill Ranch Elementary School students used their index fingers to trace the letters into squares of felt and carpet , imprinting the connection between the letters and the sound into their minds .
The Language Arts Assistance Program has helped a generation of struggling youngsters in this Orange County suburb become skilled readers .
But it , along with sports teams , small classes and school librarians , may vanish next year as Saddleback Valley Unified School District officials trim $ 13 million in spending for the upcoming school year .
Under the budget approved by the state Thursday , schools and community colleges will be forced to cut $ 7.4 billion from their budgets this year and $ 3.2 billion next year .
And a $ 787 - billion federal economic stimulus package that is expected to send billions to school districts is n’t enough to backfill deficits , educators say .
“ It does n’t look good for us , ” said instructor Tina Hatch , 52 , who teaches the reading program designed for pupils in first , second and third grades .
“ It ’s very sad because these kids definitely will fall through the cracks if there ’s not a program like this . ”

Because of reduced state funding , school districts across the state are dealing with such difficult decisions .
They have been cutting spending annually in recent years , but prior trims -- slimming the administrative staff , cutting back on maintenance , reducing the cleaning schedule -- were mostly invisible to students and parents .
But now , in many places the low - hanging fruit is gone , and educators are left with painful cuts that reach directly into classrooms , including widespread teacher layoffs , increasing class sizes and the eliminations of music , sports and other programs that are not mandated by state and federal law .
And that includes Saddleback ’s reading - intervention program .
“ You ’re very definitely going to feel the pinch in the classroom because there ’s no place else to go anymore , ” said Saddleback Supt .
Steven Fish , whose school board also is considering closing a neighborhood elementary school and trimming its International Baccalaureate program .
“ The list is n’t long enough .
I need more . ”
The state budget offers school districts greater flexibility to spend so - called categorical funds , which in the past have been earmarked for such specific items as textbook purchases .

Funds earmarked for limiting class sizes in kindergarten through third grades , however , were preserved for that purpose , a victory for the teachers unions and a blow to some local district officials who had been calling for greater flexibility in using that money .
An earlier proposal by the governor to shave five days from the school year was eliminated from the final package but will probably be raised again in the spring .
“ This budget will result in real cuts to real students in the classroom , ” said Jack O’Connell , the state superintendent of public instruction .
“ These reductions will be felt and seen . ”
A spokesman for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said given the state ’s fiscal crisis , state officials did the best they could to protect students .

“ Probably more than any other sector of the budget , we went to great lengths to ensure that K - 12 schools and community colleges had the greatest amount of flexibility and relief possible in what is the worst budget year in memory , ” said H.D. Palmer , state deputy director for external affairs .
“ By definition , closing a $ 41.6 - billion budget gap is going to create difficult decisions .
We tried to minimize how difficult those decisions were for ” schools .
In Los Angeles Unified , the state ’s largest school district , officials expect to slash about $ 800 million in spending for the next 18 months .
District officials have yet to disclose how they expect to close this budget gap , but it is hard to imagine a scenario that wo n’t affect the district ’s nearly 700,000 students .
Layoffs are likely .
“ I will be recommending cuts the likes of which this district has never seen , ” said Supt .
Ramon C. Cortines at a recent meeting .
Teachers must be warned by March 15 if they will face layoffs , but already districts have decided to send more than 12,000 pink slips to tenured and probationary teachers across the state , the most ever seen this soon before the deadline , said David Sanchez , president of the California Teachers Assn .

The budget , he said , “ was balanced on the backs of the students of the state of California . ”
In Hayward , school trustees voted earlier this month not to participate in the state ’s class - size reduction program and will boost class sizes in kindergarten through third grades , from the current maximum of 20 students per teacher to between 30 and 34 pupils per class .
The move will allow the district to eliminate 120 teachers , saving $ 2.7 million annually .
“ We just could n’t afford it anymore , ” said Val Joyner , spokeswoman for the 20,000 - student district .
In Azusa , district officials decided this month to issue layoff warnings to 116 teachers -- a dent in their efforts to cut $ 16.8 million from their annual $ 100 - million budget .

“ We ’re already running lean and mean , ” said Kathleen Miller , spokeswoman for the 11,100 - student district .
“ Every program will probably be affected in some way . ”
Districts throughout the state are shutting neighborhood schools .
In the West Contra Costa Unified School District , which must cut tens of millions of dollars over the next three years , trustees decided earlier this month to close four schools .
“ Closing schools is difficult at best but unfortunately necessary , ” wrote district Supt .
Bruce Harter in an open letter in January .
“ No one in our community , especially our board of education members and I , wants to close schools . ”
He also warned of “ substantial layoffs ” in the upcoming school year .

“ Last year , we cut $ 6.4 million from the budget by keeping the impact away from the classroom , ” Harter said .
“ We wo n’t be able to do that this year .
Every part of our district will feel the pain . ”
In the Atwater Elementary School District , which is cutting counselors and reading coaches as part of its effort to trim $ 2.5 million from its $ 37.5 - million budget , Supt. Melinda Hennes agreed with Harter .
“ Last year , we approached our cuts with a focus on what can we eliminate and still provide quality services to our students , ” said Hennes , whose district serves 4,600 K - 8 students .
“ This year , it ’s a whole different way of looking at things -- what do we have to have , what do we have to keep in order to keep our doors open for kids . ”
At Foothill Ranch , meanwhile , the budget problems were n’t far from the adults ’ minds as the children practiced phonics .

“ Teaching everybody , to me , is not a choice .
It ’s a responsibility to make sure we do the best we can for all students , ” said Adele Walsh , a district reading specialist who supervises the Language Arts Assistance Program , which serves 1,000 students in 26 schools throughout the nearly 34,000 - student district .
“ You have to intervene early and not wait until they ’re so far behind . ”
Eliminating the program would save more than $ 522,000 annually .
The program definitely has its boosters .
“ I like reading about . . . people and animals , ” said Charlotte Baldi , 6 , adding that she ’s “ 100 % faster ! ”

Lisa Brosnan , a Rancho Santa Margarita mother whose 8 - year - old twin boys went through the reading program last year and are now successful readers , said : “ I feel sorry for our school district , all the districts , because they just have to put up with so much , just trying to keep the basics .
It ’s just really sad ; we live in such a beautiful state , and we have to worry about stuff like this . ”

Calm Down a Hyperactive Baby
The head of the International Monetary Fund backed Gordon Brown 's recession strategy yesterday by urging governments to pump more money into their economies or face a worsening downturn .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn warned that the measures announced by the G20 nations in Washington last month may not be enough to kick - start the global economy .
Strauss - Kahn added that the IMF may next month revise down economic growth forecasts for 2009 , which have already been cut from 3 % to 2.2 %
" Our forecast , already very dark ... will be even darker if not enough fiscal stimulus is implemented , " he told BBC Radio 4 .
In an implicit backing of the British prime minister 's £ 20 bn stimulus plan , Strauss - Kahn said he had reversed his view of state borrowing and believed that increasing government debt was the " less bad solution " when faced with the worst downturn in up to 70 years .
Nonetheless , Strauss - Kahn described the increase in UK debt to fund the economic shock treatment as " disturbing " .
The IMF chief said other countries should follow the British example , adding that a stimulus of about 2 % of global gross domestic product , or $ 1.2tn ( £ 800 bn ) for the G20 nations , was the best option .
" We see 2009 as really being a bad year with recession for most advanced economies and growth decreasing for emerging economies , " he said .
" At the G20 in Washington a few weeks ago , all the heads of state and government seemed to be aware that something has to be done and I can see that some measures have been announced , but I 'm afraid it wo n't be enough .
Our estimate is that we need a stimulus of something like 2 % of GDP , which is $ 1.2tn . "
Strauss - Kahn also rejected the argument of Germany 's finance minister , Peer Steinbrück , who caused a diplomatic incident a fortnight ago when he described Gordon Brown 's plan , underpinned by a cut in VAT , as " crass Keynesianism " .
" I understand the traditional view of the Germans , but nevertheless I think we are in a time when we should be a bit more imaginative then we have been , " said Strauss - Kahn .
European Union leaders ignored Steinbrück 's comments earlier this month and agreed a € 200bn ( £ 185 bn ) stimulus package , funded by measures including tax cuts and the acceleration of public spending projects .
He added that it was " noble " for the European Central Bank president , Jean - Claude Trichet , to warn that eurozone governments must control their borrowing , adding : " He 's the head of the central bank - it's his job to say things like that . "
However , Strauss - Kahn said a looser fiscal policy remained a better option than curbing borrowing , which risks exacerbating the global downturn .
" I do n't think as a general stance we should have a lax fiscal policy , but we are in the biggest crisis we have experienced for 60 or 70 years , " he said .
" The threat is that big today that we are between two difficult problems : increasing deficit , which is never good , and fighting against recession , which is even worse .
We have to choose the less bad solution . "
Strauss - Kahn said the reduction in US interest rates to 0.25 % last week would not be enough to revive the world 's largest economy , and a stimulus plan , being drafted by the incoming administration of president - elect Barack Obama , will be needed .
He said the Federal Reserve rate cut was " welcome " but added : " It ca n't be considered enough .
That 's why we need to use the other tools we have in our tool - kits - namely a fiscal stimulus . "
( CNN ) --
During the first couple of weeks of his presidency , Barack Obama has made good use of his " spiffy " new ride .
President Barack Obama walks onto Air Force
One for his first flight as commander in chief .

The president , who has made several trips around the country in Air Force One , was particularly excited during his first trip on the plane as commander in chief when he flew recently to the House Democrats ' annual retreat in Williamsburg , Virginia .
" Thanks for giving me a reason to fly Air Force One , " he told the House Democrats after his flight , which took him away from a week of fighting for the economic stimulus bill .
Donning a blue jacket with the presidential seal on the right and his name embroidered on the left , Obama came back to the press section of the plane shortly before taking off for Williamsburg .

" Hey guys , what do you think of my -- this spiffy ride here ? " the president asked the group of reporters traveling with him on the presidential plane .

Riding aboard Air Force
One is a treat for the president , but also for the reporters covering the White House , said CNN 's Ed Henry .
" I 'm always amazed that every time someone finds out what my job is , without fail , their first question is : ' Do you get to fly on Air Force One ? ' "
Henry said .
" There is a wonder and mystery about this plane that is just remarkable . "
As president , Obama 's first ride on the helicopter Marine One to Andrews Air Force Base , where Air Force
One is kept , also seemed to leave him impressed .
" It 's spectacular , " Obama said .
" You go right over the Washington Monument , and then you kind of curve in by the Capitol .
It was spectacular . "
Obama also flew on the plane from Chicago , Illinois , to Washington for his inauguration , but it was n't called Air Force One , because Obama was not yet the president .
He also had previously been a guest on Air Force One when his predecessor , former President Bush , was in office .
Each president gets his own pilot and Obama met his on that first trip to Washington .
" You 're out of central casting , you 're exactly what I want the pilot of Air Force One to look like , " Obama joked .
The aircraft is maintained and operated by the Presidential Airlift Group , which falls under the White House Military Office .
It was founded at the request of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944 and originally called the Presidential Pilot Office , according to the White House Web site .
During the next two decades , different propeller planes served as the main transportation for the president .
That was until President Kennedy became the first to travel in his own jet aircraft , which was a modified Boeing 707 , according to the site .
Do n't Miss Bush takes final Air Force
One ride as president
The current plane was first used in 1990 during the administration of President George H.W. Bush .
The aircraft , which is longer than the length of a hockey rink , has 4,000 square feet of floor space stretched across three levels .
The plane includes a large suite for the president that includes an office , bathroom and conference room .
It also provides sleeping quarters for the president .
The plane has two food preparation galleys that can feed 100 people at a time and a medical suite that can be used as an operating room , according to the site .
While the plane does have its luxuries , plenty of the extras are devoted to security .
Air Force
One can refuel in midair , has unlimited range and has electronics " hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse , " according to the White House site .
In the event of an attack on the country , the plane , equipped with advanced and secure electronic communications equipment , can become the president 's mobile command center .
" [ The president ] has the ability to run the country from Air Force One , " said Col.
Mark Tillman , who flew the plane for former President Bush during the last eight years , including after September 11 , 2001 , and into Baghdad , Iraq .
" So he has everything that 's available to him at the White House available to him at 45,000 feet . "
On occasion , press briefings take place aboard the aircraft .
Henry recalled an instance when he was taking off from Egypt and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice briefed reporters on the trip .
" I 'm struck by the history of standing in the aisle just two feet away from the secretary of state , " Henry said .
" Until we hit some turbulence and I 'm suddenly hanging onto the edge of a seat praying , ' Please God do n't let me slam into the secretary of state in the aisle of Air Force One -- my mom will never forgive me . '
I held on for dear life and the secretary kept her balance and the mini press conference went on without a hitch 30,000 feet in the air . "
Henry said so far , Obama has made more of an effort to visit the back of the plane and talk with reporters than President Bush did .
" So far , President Obama has come to the back of the plane to chat with reporters on each one of his early trips aboard Air Force One , and he 's even taken some questions on the stimulus bill , " he said .
" But it 's relatively easy to do that in the early days when you have legislation to sell .
Will he still visit the media two years from now when the newness has worn off and maybe he 's a little tired of the media ? "
Some reporters along for the ride on Air Force One have started to Twitter their experiences and solicit questions from the public to ask Obama during the flight .
Time.com : Swampland blog : More from the dept . of not Bush : Aboard Air Force One
Air Force
One and its staff are known for their food preparation .
In the galley , the staff often keeps a list of the way many of the regular passengers take their coffee , so they can get it right without having to ask .
" One of the best parts of Air Force One is the staff .
All of the Air Force stewards treat everyone with respect , and they are the consummate professionals , " Henry said .
" They go out and shop for all the food they bring on Air Force One so they can prepare special meals not just for the president , but for all the passengers .
Whether it 's Texas chili or chicken parmigiana , they always take good care of their passengers . "
Obama tried the food during the flight to his inauguration .
" Let 's see how you do a burger , " Obama joked aboard the plane .
The president asked for a healthy side of salad and vegetables as well , prompting the waiter to ask if that meant he would skip the french fries .
" Oh , I 'll still take the fries , " Obama quipped .

I ’m totally smitten with these gorgeous vintage kimono fabrics from Shibori !
She stocks all sorts of weights , from delicate silk to cotton and wool .
Owner Juliet and her husband Richard are ordained Zen Buddhist priests .
She says she ’s struck by , “ the sense of history and culture when you handle Japanese kimono silk . ”
I have to say , I can totally see where she ’s coming from .
On top of being absolutely beautiful , the patterns on her kimono fabrics make you think of a different place and time .
Since they ’re all vintage , that means they ’re eco-friendly to boot !
The Shibori shop stocks a wide variety of vintage kimono fabric , and the prices are really reasonable .
Juliet gave me a little history of the kimono .
The way the Japanese treated the fabric as well as the garment itself is a great lesson in green crafting !
They respected the materials and did n’t decide something was useles just because it needed a bit of mending .
Juliet shares that :
Kimono were treated with respect and well cared for .
Some are handed down and kept in the family .
It was not uncommon that daily worn kimono would be discreetly patched underneath until they were no longer presentable , then the garment would be taken apart and used to make smaller garments for others , and then when those were no longer presentable , those garments might be taken apart to make a small wrap or bag ( furoshiki ) or useful as a towel … nothing was wasted .
What a wonderful legacy to work into your own sewing project !

Even after 65 years , remembering how Vera Trotter was killed on a winter ’s evening in 1943 as the Luftwaffe made one of its regular post -Blitz raids on London ’s East End is still enough to bring Alf Morris to tears .
Standing on the eastern steps of Bethnal Green Tube station , the 78 - year - old dabs his eyes with a handkerchief as he describes the moment his father found his eight - year - old friend .
“ My dad was the person who eventually identified Vera , ” he recalls .
“ Only the week before he ’d taken a nail out of her shoe .
That was the only way that he was able to recognise her . ”
But Vera was n’t killed by German bombs .
She died in the worst civilian accident of the Second World War – or , indeed , since – a barely - reported crush of people that was kept secret for years .
As the air raid warning sounded on 3 March 1943 , Vera and her mother Lillian routinely gathered their bundles of bedding and made their way to Bethnal Green Tube , a brand new extension of the Central line that had yet to serve as a station | but for the previous two years had become a much - needed air raid shelter with 5,000 beds .
For those living in the surrounding bomb - ravaged area , the triple bunk beds of Bethnal Green , nestled deep underground , were a safe haven .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But Vera and Lillian never made it that night .
They and 171 others were killed as they descended the eastern staircase of the station .
For once the terrifying one - tonne bombs dropped from the German Heinkels were not to blame for the horrendous death toll .
The Bethnal Green Tube disaster , as it came to be known , was simply a tragic accident that remained buried in secrecy for decades .
A small brass plaque above the entrance to Bethnal Green is the only indication for today ’s commuters of what happened there .
But now an ever dwindling group of survivors and their descendants are hoping to build a large memorial above the steps of the Tube station to inform future generations of the tragedy .
Planning permission has , after much wrangling , been approved but a lack of funds means that the £ 600,000 ‘ Stairway to Heaven ’ seems as far away from being built as eve .
Survivors like Mr Morris are determined to have a proper memorial built before their generation |dies out .
But they remain deeply concerned that few people are willing to support their cause because the disaster was an accident that took place in the poor East End .
“ That disaster literally rocked the East End but no one wants to know about it , ” said Mr Morris , shaking with anger .
“ I honestly believe that if it had happened in Knightsbridge or Kensington there would already be a memorial .
I owe it to Vera and all the other people that died that day to create something that will preserve their memory forever .
There should have been a memorial 50 years ago . ”
That Alf Morris is even here to campaign for a memorial is a miracle in itself .
Twelve years old at the time , like Vera he found himself caught in the impenetrable crush on the eastern staircase as hundreds of terrified Londoners fled for the supposed safety of the shelter .
He said : “ To this day I do n’t really know how I survived .
People were screaming all around me , all trapped .
I ’d become wedged in a corner and although I could n’t move my legs I was able to move my arms .
It was Mrs Chumley , the air raid warden , who saved me .
She just waded in and pulled me out . ”
Concerned that the Nazis would use the disaster for propaganda , Churchill banned media coverage .
Censored from history , it was years before the public knew the truth and even now it remains a woefully unstudied tragedy , even though it was more deadly than the 1989 Hillsborough disaster , in which 96 Liverpool FC fans died , or the 1966 Aberfan tragedy which claimed 144 lives – 116 of them children .
To this day , the details of exactly what happened at Bethnal Green that night remain unclear .
Locals say the crush began when a woman | carrying a baby slipped at the bottom of the stairs shortly after a new |battery of anti-aircraft rockets opened up in a nearby park .
After living through the Blitz and two years of frequent bombing raids , East Enders had become more than used to the sounds of war .
They would boast about being able to tell what type of bomb was falling or which anti-aircraft gun was firing from the noise it made .
But no one had told locals about this particular battery of guns that had just been installed and fired rockets instead of shells .
When the guns opened up , locals assumed they were taking a direct hit and the usually orderly queues outside the Tube station descended into pandemonium .
As the crush worsened , two buses drew up , disgorging even more terrified passengers into the staircase .
Peter Perryment , also aged 12 , was walking towards the Tube with his 17 - year - old sister Iris and their seven - year - old cousin Barbara .
He had lived two doors down from Alf Morris , before both families had been bombed out in 1940 .
Mr Perryment was two - thirds of the way down the stairs when the crush began and was the last person to be pulled out alive .

“ I was holding so tightly onto Iris ’s hand but eventually we had to let go of each other , ” he recalls .
“ Even when I was freed and walked past all the bodies , it never occurred to me that they were dead . ”
The next day his father came back from the mortuary and said they had found Iris .
“ He just looked at my mother and said , ‘ She ’s gone , girl .
Iris is gone ’ .
I ’ll never forget that day . ”
Sandra Scotting , 60 , is now trying to trace the remaining survivors of the disaster and to raise money for the memorial , to feature an inverted white marble staircase and the victims ’ names .
Her mother Irie suffered facial paralysis from the crush and the three - month - old nephew she was carrying died in her arms .
Irie died three years ago .
“ My mother did n’t talk about what had happened to her for more than 50 years , ” said Mrs Scotting .
“ The whole event was shrouded in such secrecy that people just did n’t feel able to talk about it or mourn openly .
What we want to do is build a place which will not only teach future generations about what happened but also give the few remaining survivors a place to grieve . ”
Official secrets : Wartime spin
The official cover -up of the Bethnal Green Tube disaster was one of many instances of the government suppressing bad news in the Second World War .
Concerned that morale would be affected by a tragedy not directly caused by enemy action , Churchill allowed newspapers to report only limited details .
The reason why more than 700 US Marines died while practising for D - Day is also unclear .
The official line was that a German E - boat launched a surprise attack , but many descendants of the victims believe they were killed by friendly fire .
Writers were also closely monitored ; George Orwell ’s Animal Farm was only published after VE day because Britain feared any criticism of the Soviets would harm the war effort .

Soot from industrial and automotive sources that falls on the snow - covered mountains of the western U.S. and Canada is causing the snowpacks to melt as much as a month earlier in spring , according to a new study .
The trend may create additional challenges for hydroelectric generation , fisheries and irrigation , which are also grappling with greenhouse gas - caused climate change .
Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy 's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory found that soot absorbs sunlight somewhat like an asphalt surface , warming the snow and air just above it by up to 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit ( almost 0.7 degrees Celsius ) , melting the snow .
Writing for an upcoming issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research — Atmospheres , report co-author William Gustafson said that the Cascades have lost 60 percent of their snowpack since the 1950s .
The study was in part an attempt to determine how much soot contributed to that melt .
" If we can project the future — how much water we 'll be getting from the rivers and when — then we can better plan for its many uses , " said climate physics scientist Yun Qian .
“ Snowmelt can be up to 75 percent of the water supply , in some regions .
These changes can affect the water supply , as well as aggravate winter flooding and summer droughts . ”

Economic hard times are about to hit New York City ’s employees where it hurts : in their driveways .
As the Bloomberg administration scrambles to cut spending , it is ordering city agencies like the police , parks and health departments to give up nearly 700 city - owned cars , a cherished perk for their workers .
The move would save $ 20 million over the next two years , according to a copy of the memorandum sent to city agencies .
The decision to sell off scores of Toyota Prius cars and Ford Escape sport utility vehicles is very likely to irritate many city workers , who use the them to travel around the city inspecting sites or rushing to meetings .
But it would help blunt criticism that City Hall practices a form of vehicular hypocrisy , telling ordinary New Yorkers to use mass transportation while at times clogging the streets with its own city - issued cars .
City agencies must relinquish at least 10 percent , or about 685 , of their 6,800 nonemergency vehicles by the end of March , according to the memo from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg , which was sent on Wednesday and obtained by The New York Times .

The price of cocaine has plunged in recent years
The price of cocaine in Europe is set to fall even further as smugglers use new routes through West Africa and the Balkans , says the UN anti-drugs agency .
In its latest report , the International Narcotics Control Board ( INCB ) , said West Africa has become a " major hub " for South American cocaine smuggling .
UK officials said last week that the price of cocaine had fallen by half in the last 10 years .
The INCB said prices would continue to fall unless the supply was curtailed .
INCB President Hamid Ghodse said more needed to be done to intercept shipments of cocaine and other drugs .
" The route of transporting for traffickers has become relatively easier and less susceptible to interdiction , " he said .
' Cocaine stockpiles '
The INCB 's annual report says South America 's main producers of cocaine - in Colombia , Peru and Bolivia - were switching their smuggling routes from the Caribbean and the North Atlantic to avoid US and British naval patrols .

The smugglers are targeting countries with " weak governmental structures that have limited capacity to defend themselves against drug trafficking and its consequences , such as corruption and drug abuse " , the INCB warns .
The Balkans - traditionally used to smuggle heroin from Afghanistan and Central Asia into western Europe - are now increasingly being used as a supply line to bring cocaine into Europe .
Stockpiles of cocaine are being built up in West Africa from where it is smuggled into Europe , either directly or via the Balkans , the report says .
The INCB also reports : Criminal gangs are posing as fictitious companies to obtain the chemicals needed to manufacture illicit drugs such as amphetamines and ecstasy
Canada has become a primary source of ecstasy for North America and a significant supplier for Asia
Poppy cultivation has shrunk in Afghanistan but the country still produces more than 90 % of the world 's opium
Illegal online pharmacies are selling pharmaceutical drugs - or counterfeit versions - without prescription .

London - based designer Ivo Vos is an illusionist .
He has created concept ideas for everyday products that push the limits of what they can do .
Vos ' latest series called the Brunch involves adding a splash of gadgetry and precision to familiar household appliances like the toaster , teapot and place mat .
Take his toaster .
Vos has drawn up a device that allows the user to set the degree , angle and the force with which the toasted bread can be catapulted on to the plate when done .
It brings " knowledge , skill and anticipation to the toasting of a slice of bread , " says Vos on his site by way of explanation .
As for degree of browning of the toast and how long it will take to get done , those are the kind of mundane details best left to your Black and Decker .
There 's also a teapot that records the height from which you pour the tea and cutlery that looks near - indistinguishable when placed on a specially designed place mat .
The products are all concepts so do n't hold your breath for them to be available soon .
And stop dreaming about them else you may just have to eat some burnt toast in the morning .

Bet you saw this one coming : GM , which has until the 17th to report its progress on a " viability " plan , is set to tell the government that either it gets more cash , or it 's going bankrupt anyway .
Yep , that initial outlay was just a downpayment .
See , it has n't made progress with its bondholders , and talks with the unions have broken down .
It seems everyone is betting that the Democratic - controlled government blinks .
According to WSJ , it looks like the company will need at least another $ 5 billion .
And that may be just to make it through the quarter .
Oh , and from the " more nuggets from the stimulus " - category : GM is getting a $ 3 billion tax break once Obama signs the law .
You might 've missed that while you read the 1000 + pages this weekend .
Olives are fruits of the olive tree .
The tree is believed to have originated in South Caucuses and afterwards it began to be cultivated in the Mediterranean region .
Olives are now being grown at tremendous commercial scale in Italy , Spain and Greece .
Olives are produced in other Mediterranean countries , too , but their share is minor .
There are about 400 cultivars in Italy alone .
All cultivars fall into two main groups : olives used for olive oil production and so called the table olives .
The former are smaller in size , richer in lipids and produce more oil .
It is noteworthy that , unlikely other cooking oils , olive oil production does not require using chemical processes .
The color of olives depends on the degree of their ripeness .
Olives change their color from yellowish and green to purple and black as they ripe .
Harvesting starts when olives meet all organoleptical standards .
In Italy among a great variety of cultivars the best popular olives are : black , fleshy and sweetish Baresane olives , green , giant Greche olives , slightly tart green Siciliane olives , sourish purple and black di Gaeta olives , and green or black di Cerignola olives .
Olives are widely used in culinary across the world , for appetizers , salads , sauces and in various main dishes .
One of the most amazing olive dishes is made in Ascoli Piceno region , Italy .
It is called olive all ’ascolana and is actually huge breadcrumbed green olives stuffed with meat and fried in olive oil .
Nutrients in olives :
Proteins , lipids , carbohydrates , fiber , sugar , and ash .

Firstly , I absolutely have to thank Michael for all the years of hard work he ’s put into making Linux Game Publishing what it is today .
Without Michael ’s years of dedication so much of what is Linux Gaming as we know it today simply would n’t exist .
It ’s on his shoulders that I find myself standing , far from attempting to fill those shoes .
As Michael mentioned , I ’ve been involved in Linux gaming for many many years , sometimes directly , sometimes indirectly .
Games have always been a passion of mine and working on and with them possibly more so .
I ’m so excited to be at the helm of a company that I ’ve loved for so very long and a company whose future I ’m certain is bright .
I ’ve delayed posting this greeting message for a few days , because one of the most common remarks I have noticed since Michael and I began discussing this transition is that LGP has n’t given enough feedback to the community .
I wanted to see the responses to Michael ’s resignation and of course the announcement of my arrival so that I can answer questions I saw being posted on various forums , news sites and this very blog .
I have great plans for Linux Game Publishing .
Since some of them coincide with queries that people have posed either directly to me in our IRC channel or in comments online , I will respond to them now : -
Regarding Michael :
He is not disappearing completely , but will be working with me for some time in an advisory capacity – his knowledge and experience in the Linux gaming world is unparalleled as I ’m sure you ’d all agree .
As well as working with me , Michael will occasionally be contributing to new and old titles .
Linux games are still a huge passion of his and I do n’t think we’d be able to keep him away from the code , even if we were crazy enough to want to ;)
Digital distribution channels :
This medium certainly has a strong future and is only going to grow .
I personally have accounts at online stores such as Steam , GOG , Desura , Gamer ’s Gate , Gameolith and others .
Expanding digital distribution is definitely a priority for me .
I have already had tentative discussions , begun setting up and getting ready to distribute through a few big names in Linux digital distribution .
Our current shipping of physical CDs and DVDs :
We ’ve admittedly had problems with this and it ’s something I ’ve been working on in the background since Michael and I started having discussions around his handover .
Once our new distribution channels are in place , those of you that have seen delays in delivery should n’t ever experience that again .
We ’re going through a period of transition at the moment and as much as I ’d love everything to happen “ right now ” , there ’s a lot of work to be done .
I ’m very aware that there are unhappy people out there – you are my primary focus right now .
Linux Game Publishing is a great company , with massive potential and I ’m truly excited to be a part of its history in the making .
As for new games : Yes , we have some in the pipeline !
With all that has happened , there have obviously been delays .
We have two announced titles that everyone is aware of , namely Disciples 2 : Dark Prophecy and Bandits : Phoenix Rising .
I ’m happy to say that there will be an announcement regarding one of them soon .
There are also other unannounced titles we ’re working on and I ’m really looking forward to reaching the point where we can announce those to you .
LGP has a strong team of great programmers , that have stood with Michael and worked with him through the years .
Some have been around for a while and we also have some new faces .
I am incredibly grateful to our team for the hard work that they have put in , contributing towards what we currently have and will be producing going forward .
Keep a keen eye on us here at LGP , you wo n’t be disappointed ;)

Enjoying your nap , petal ?
Even a photo shoot does n't wake Dreamy the dormouse
Nestled in the heart of a rose , his slumber cushioned by soft petals and his bushy tail , Dreamy the dormouse looks snoozily content .
But life has n't always been so blissful .
His seven - month hibernation was rudely interrupted when his mossy nest was dug up by an inquisitive dog .
Magical rescue : Dreamy poses on a red rose for his photo shoot .
When he wakes up he will be none the wiser of his fame
Discovered by the dog's owner wide awake , if slightly bewildered , he was taken to the Secret World Wildlife Rescue Centre in Somerset , where staff fattened him up on hazelnuts and seeds before giving him a coconut shell in which to sleep away the rest of the winter .
So deep was his resumed slumber that he did n't stir when called on for a photoshoot , with Dreamy being carefully placed in the rose after the centre petals had been plucked out .
Dreamy is likely to snooze for another two months or so .
Sanctuary founder Pauline Kidner said : ' We 'll release him in April ready for him to find a Mrs Dormouse and form a new family . '

“ Too little too late ” : Congressman on Republican opposition to stimulus package
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Monday , Feb 9th , 2009
Texas Congressman and member of the House Financial Services Committee , Ron Paul , has slammed Republican opposition to the latest proposed stimulus bill , saying it cannot make up for the last eight years of unfettered spending .
“ In some ways , it ’s too little too late , ” Paul said in a video address on his Campaign for Liberty Website .
“ it ’s like they ’re born - again budget conservatives . ”
“ Where were we in the past eight years , when we could have done something ?
It is the last eight years that has set this situation up .
So we ca n’t blame the Democrats for the conditions we have . ”
Paul continued .
“ We have to blame both parties and presidents of the last several decades to have generated this huge government . ”
The Congressman also slammed three Senate Republicans for voting with the bill .
“ It ’s unfortunate that the three Republicans caved in and went with the Democrats . ”
Paul said , referring to GOP senators Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe , both of Maine , and Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania .

( Article continues below )
The Congressman also criticized the proposed stimulus , calling it a “ pure spending package ” and pointed out that the so called “ compromise ” , that will see the bill cut to $ 780 billion , is nothing of the sort .
“ This is not unusual in Washington , to propose a higher number and then pretend you ’re acting fiscally conservative by cutting back . ”
Paul explained .
The Congressman also explained why the federal government should not have the responsibility of overseeing the revival of the economy .
“ They create money out of thin air , keep low interest rates artificially , and cause people to do things they would n’t have otherwise done .
They malinvest , they build too many houses . ”
“ Sure , we want more spending , ” Paul said .
“ We need a lot more spending in the economy , but it has to be done by market forces , by individuals , by businesses making proper decisions . ”
“ Most people think that inflation is only high prices , but that is just one of the consequences of inflation .
Inflation is the distortion of interest rates in the money supply which causes people to do dumb things . ”
“ The bigger problem is that the Fed is still intact , secretly passing out trillions of dollars , causing people to make more and more mistakes . ”
Paul said .

Community organizing , resurgent ?
A reader sends in this course catalogue from the adult education arm of the University of Missouri Kansas City , which is using Obama 's ( rough ) image and slogan to promote classes in ... community organizing .
Which is to say that Obama has made community organizing cool .
Or , at least , that college administrators think he has .
When you look at the fighting in Gaza , or any of the other small , chronic wars we get these days , you notice that traditional war buffs , the ones who like to talk about WW II , do n’t have much to say .
If they say anything at all , it ’s usually , “ They should just wipe ’em out ! ”
Like , “ Israel should just wipe the Pals out ! ”
Or “ America should just wipe Iraq off the map ! ”
And on paper , they ’re right .
Israel could kill every single man , woman and child in Gaza if it wanted to .
And Hell , it probably does want to .
So why does n’t it ?
America could wipe the Sunni Triangle off the map easily , nuke the whole place or use neutron bombs —
Hell , nerve gas , even — if we were worried about limiting damage .
But nobody does this stuff .
Why not ?
That ’s the big question .
That ’s what drives the frustration you ’re hearing when these old - school war buffs try to deal with war circa 2008 : they think in terms of hardware , and the hardware — the nukes — does n’t seem to apply , somehow .
So why not ?
The first key fact is that we ’re living in a lull , a pause in longterm military history .
We live in the hangover after a wild night , the first half of the twentieth century .
That was a binge to end all binges , an era of great , total , merciless warfare .
Everybody thinks of the Western Front in the First World War when they think of total war , but there were plenty of other fronts just as merciless , just as brutal , like the Russian Civil War or the Greek - Turkish war in western Anatolia , which was even nastier , if that ’s possible , than the Russian fighting .
No quarter asked or given on either side .
In this phase , nationalism was n’t a bad word yet .
People were willing to die , more like eager to die , for their countries .
Even countries like Italy had a real over - the - top mentality in WW I .
Like I ’ve said many times , Europe before 1945 was an alien planet that has about as much to do with Europe today as Abba has to do with the dead German guy who did the helicopter music in Apocalypse Now .
The first go - round , from 1914 - 1918 , took a lot out of them , so when the sequel rolled around in 1939 , a lot of countries were already moaning and groaning that nobody was going to get them out on the dance - floor again .
England and France were going , “ Aw no , jus ’ lemme set a spell , my lumbago ’s actin ’ up … . ”
But there were the younger , braver countries like Japan , the US , Germany and the USSR who had that “ C’mon , the night is young ! ” spirit and dragged them up for a second waltz .
That little number lasted until 1945 , and it got a little hectic even for the hotshot kids .
By the end it was like one of those Itchy and Scratchy cartoons where the cat and the mouse face off with knives and escalate to bigger and bigger guns til the last shot is of a giant pistol blowing up the earth .
And that ’s when Phase 2 , the Hangover starts .
After 1945 everything is different .
Until you face that fact you wo n’t understand modern war at all .
We ’re living in a lull .
Nobody wants to admit that ; everybody wants their time on the planet to be the big moment of history , but militarily , this is not a great era .
We ’re waiting , hedging our bets .
Nobody ’s willing to play the nukes , and until somebody does , big - time , we ’re like old ladies playing the slots , one quarter thrown away at a time , nobody willing to roll big at the craps tables .
When you live in a lull like we do , you think everything ’s happening for the first time , when what you really have is the same plays called with different rules .
What made me realize that was this article I saw in the Israeli paper Haaretz that summed up a US Army report on the 2006 war between the IDF and Hezbollah .
According to this report , Hezbollah had scored some kind of tactical breakthrough by fighting almost like a conventional army , fighting from bunkers instead of relying on mobile warfare .
They claimed this was a first in history , a “ non-state actor ” fighting a successful conventional war .
Well , of course it ’s not new at all .
What ’s new is the squeamish , namby - pamby set of rules that operate since 1945 .
Those rules are why Hezbollah was able to win .
Unless you understand that , you wo n’t understand how wars work these days .
So let ’s take a look at a pre-1945 war for a parallel .
Let ’s see , where can we find a “ non- state actor ” trying to use conventional military strategy ?
About a million places , actually , but my favorite example is one of the biggest and most unknown wars around : Mao ’s communists vs. the Nationalists in China in the 1930s .
Not many people realize what a huge , ruthless war this was .
And almost nobody realizes that it was n’t a bunch of ignorant peasants duking it out ; both sides had expensive foreign advisors , usually Germans for obvious reasons , telling them how to fight .
Mao ’s military advisor was a German communist cadre named Otto Braun .
He took a Chinese name , Li De , but as you can imagine he was n’t likely to pass for a local , being a classic German military type , a long skinny skeleton with big glasses and even bigger plans .
Mao had been fighting the kind of brilliant rural guerrilla warfare he ’d learned from the Hunan bandit chiefs .
One of these bandit chiefs told Mao , “ All you need to know about war is : circle around , circle around , circle around . ”
Mao took that lesson to heart , because he discovered if his guerrillas did n’t keep moving away from the Nationalists ’ front , they ’d get ground up .
Otto Braun convinced the Chinese Communist leadership that these bandit tactics were too low - down and no-count for the People ’s Liberation Army .
He got them to adopt a “ Blockhouse Strategy ” which was basically exactly what Hezbollah ’s “ bunker strategy ” was .
Only it did n’t work .
The Nationalist forces attacked Mao ’s bunkers , sustained huge losses but kept attacking , and eventually wore down the Communist defenses .
That was the pattern of warfare up to 1945 : accept huge losses to take enemy territory , because when you do , you will be able to neutralize those territories for good .
So it pays off .
You lose , say , 300 men taking a section of Maoist territory by overrunning those blockhouses .
You ’ve now gained a peasant population of , say , 100,000 .
You now get the return on your losses : you immediately kill any Communist sympathizers in the region and force all the young men to sign up with your army at bayonet - point .
You ’ve made good your casualties because , once you control the enemy territory , you change it for good , turn it from red to blue .
You ca n’t do that now , except once in a while , in remote places like Sudan or Congo where none of the locals have friends in the media .
For most other places , where the news cameras are willing to go , this is the era of squeamishness .
Now let me say , before people start writing in with horror stories from Nam or Africa , I ’m not saying we ’re nice .
We ’re no nicer than Foch or Kitchener or Ataturk or Chiang or Budyonnov or any of those early 20th - c. maneaters .
We ’re just more sly and cautious about it , because we ’re squeamish , we ’re scared , we ’re edging back from the cliff out of pure selfish fear .
We still do plenty of nasty stuff but only where the locals can’t dish it out in return , like the Brits in Kenya or the French in Algeria in the 1950s or us in Nam in the 1960s or the Russians in Chechnya .
What we ’re not usually ready to do is what made sacrificing soldiers ’ lives worthwhile for attacking armies pre-1945 : total , ruthless , unashamed wipe - out of any opposition once the territory was taken .
The best - known case in the Middle Eastern theatre , post - 1945 , was what the Israelis ’ Phalangist allies did in Sabra and Shatilla outside Beirut in 1982 .
What you saw there was an attempt to do early - 20th - century warfare in the wrong era .
I repeat : what they did there , wiping out enemy civilians once they ’d taken the territory , would have been standard policy for any European army pre-’45 .
But in 1982 it backfired completely and gave the IDF a bad name it ’s never managed to lose .
Artist Pierre Blanc makes fancy vases with emblems of hard rock bands .
To me , this just seems like such a strange fusion of concepts that I simply can’t decide if they are compelling or just downright ugly .
Nevertheless , each piece is unique – signed , dated and numbered .
I ’m not too sure who would buy these ( they go for anywhere from 200 to 400 euros ) or if there is actually any market for these whatsoever , but they sure are interesting to look at .
A couple of ACDC vases .
I remember in University we used to play a drinking game where we ’d drink beer out of a glass boot .
If we only had this vase then .
Kiss and the Misfits .
Gene Simmons has the Kiss logo on just about everything already , but I bet this is one type of merchandise that he never thought of selling .
My Personal favorite – a Motorhead vase .
Pierre also makes hanging plates with images of wrestlers , turntables and guns and all sorts of other crazy pottery .

President Obama tapped two Silicon Valley notables today as members of his new Economic Recovery Advisory Board .
The 15 - member board is charged with advising Obama on decisions about the US economy and announced to spur Congress into passing legislation for his $ 700 bn + stimulus spending package .
Obama said he created a panel of outside advisers to enlist voices from " beyond the Washington echo chamber . "
Among his picks is Charles Phillips , president of Oracle and John Doerr , a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who serves on the boards of Google , Amazon , and Symantec .
" We will meet regularly so that I can hear different ideas and sharpen my own , and seek counsel that is candid and informed by the wider world . "
The board is headed by Paul Volcker , the former US Federal Reserve chairman and one of Obama 's top economic advisers .
" We 're also going to count on these men and women to serve as additional eyes and ears for me as we work to reverse this downturn , " said Obama .
" Many of them have a ground - level view of the changes that are taking place . "
Phillips became president of Oracle in May 2003 and was previously with ( the then - investment bank and now - bank holding company ) , Morgan Stanley .
Doerr is a venture capitalist who 's backed quite a few big names of Silicon Valley in their early years .
Like Compaq , Sun Microsystems , Intuit , Netscape , and Amazon .
He 's also been a major advocate for carbon trading and green tech causes .
Other names on the board include Martin Feldstein , professor of economics at Harvard University ; Jeffery Immelt , CEO of General Electric ; and Robert Wolf , CEO of investment bank UBS Group Americas .
In his press conference today , Obama cited a US Labor Department report that the US lost 598,000 jobs in January , saying delays from Congress in passing the stimulus package is " inexcusable and irresponsible . "
Apparently it worked , as CNN reports a tentative agreement for the stimulus package has been reached .
A vote on the bill is expected sometime Friday night . ®

VISUAL REPORTS : " Last night ( Feb.21 ) Comet Lulin was visible to the naked eye with identical brightness as star b Vigo HP58510 with a magnitude of 5.35 , " reports Eddie Irizarry of the Sociedad de Astronomía del Caribe in Puerto Rico .
" But what caught our attention was Lulin 's noticeable speed .
Using a telescope , take a good look at the stars that surround Comet Lulin ; then look again just 10 minutes later and you will see how Lulin 's position has changed .
It is amazing how fast this comet is moving ! "

China dispatches warships to Somali waters
By Carol Divjak
21 January 2009
China has used attacks on Chinese ships by pirates off the coast of Somalia , and the authorisation by the UN Security Council to fight piracy , to launch itself as a blue water naval force on the international scene .
As it seeks to become a major economic power , China is compelled to project its military forces around the world to protect its trade , investments and supplies of raw materials .
Like its rivals that already have warships patrolling the strategically vital sea lanes through the Gulf of Aden connecting Asia and Europe , China 's naval presence is not so much about fighting the pirates , but protecting its own economic interests .
On December 26 , two destroyers and a supply ship carrying 800 troops , including special forces , guided missiles and helicopters set sail from a new naval base on Hainan Island off the south China coast .
The three - month mission is being given considerable prominence with state television reporters on board to broadcast the operations back home .
The state media is comparing the operation to the fifteenth century voyages of Chinese navigator Zheng He , who sailed a vast fleet through the Indian Ocean and reached Africa .
China 's failure to follow up on Zheng 's voyages by expanding trade and establishing colonies is often held in ruling circles to be the reason why it failed to become the major capitalist power .
They are determined not to miss out this time .
The official China Youth Daily called on the Chinese navy to follow Zheng
He 's methods of attacking on land and sea to root out the pirates in the Strait of Malacca at the time , then bringing " captured leaders back to the Celestial Empire [ to face justice ] " .
Zheng 's aim was actually to force the " barbarians " to be subservient to the " Middle Kingdom " .
The newspaper called for troops to land in Somalia to destroy pirate bases — in essence , an aggressive , interventionist policy .
The Peoples Liberation Army Daily commented on January 4 : " Today , overseas trade has become absolutely vital to our economy , sea lanes and major choke points have become the important ‘ lifeline ' of our economic and social development .
Using naval forces to protect national maritime interests is an important measure for our military to defend the national interests ... "
As China became an economic power , the newspaper continued , national interests went beyond the traditional territories of air , sea and land , and " expand towards the ocean , outer space and cyber space .
Wherever are our expanded national interests , the duties of our military will be expanded there " .
Trade with Europe , Africa and the Middle East has vastly expanded .
Around 1,265 Chinese commercial vessels passed the Gulf of Aden last year , including tankers carrying 60 percent of China 's imported oil from the Middle East , as well as shipments of raw materials from Africa .
Europe is now China 's largest trade partner , with much of the trade passing through the Red Sea and Indian Ocean .
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao reported last month that Somali pirates had attacked one fifth of Chinese vessels passing through Somali waters from January to November last year , hijacking 15 vessels .
The region is one of great power rivalry .
The US has repeatedly intervened in the Horn of Africa , a region next to Sudan , where China has major oil interests .
Both the US and European powers have repeatedly accused China of protecting the Sudanese regime and failing to exert pressure to halt ethnic cleansing in the Darfur area .
There will be minimal cooperation between the Chinese and other navies in the area , apart from routine communications with the other warships , including those from the US , Europe , India and Russia .
The Chinese vessels will not be part of any multinational command and will protect mainly Chinese ships .
Hong Kong and Taiwanese ships will also eligible for escort .
So far the fleet had carried out six escort missions .
China is clearly flexing its military muscle .
Li Wei , director of the anti-terrorism research centre at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations , told the China Daily last month : " China 's military participation sends a strong political message to the international community , that a China with its improved economic and military strength is willing to play a larger role in maintaining world peace and security . "
The US , Japan , India and Europe are watching the development with unease .
China has emerged as a new power , rapidly penetrating into Africa , Latin America and now the Indian Ocean .
The London - based Times summed up the concerns in the West : " In an era when China is playing a much larger global role in commerce and politics , the deployment [ of warships to the Gulf of Aden ] redefines it as a nation prepared to spill blood protecting its diverse stakes in the world economy . "
The Chinese military budget for 2008 saw another sharp increase after a major jump in 2007 .
The budget increased by 17.6 percent to $ US58.8 billion , although the US Defence Department claims that Beijing 's real military spending is two to three times that figure .
Much of this military expenditure went to the navy .
China now possesses 57 attack submarines , half a dozen of which are nuclear - powered , 74 major surface vessels ( destroyers and frigates ) and 55 large - and medium - sized amphibious ships .
A few nuclear - powered strategic submarines are armed with long - range ballistic missiles .
A significant portion of this naval force has been built since 2000 .
China is now the world 's third largest shipbuilder — building one fifth of the world 's ships — and thus has a considerable industrial basis for further naval expansion .
A strategic report published this month by the right - wing US think tank , the American Enterprise Institute , pointed out that the rapidly expanding Chinese submarine force has taken " American intelligence experts by surprise " .
Since 1990 , China has initiated five submarine programs and , since 1995 , has added 37 submarines to its navy , including nuclear - powered ones .
By adding three new subs a year , China could have up to 85 submarines in eight years .
" Never since the period between the two world wars has a nation undertaken a comparable level of submarine development , " the study stated .
Although the Chinese navy has been aimed primarily against Taiwan , the US is deeply concerned that China will challenge its dominance in the Pacific Ocean .
In October 2006 , a Chinese submarine followed the USS Kitty Hawk without being detected and surfaced close to the aircraft carrier , causing dismay in US naval circles about China 's advances in submarine technology .
A major concern for China 's rivals is recent preparations to build aircraft carriers .
At the news conference announcing the dispatch of warships to Somali waters , Chinese defence ministry spokesman Huang Xueping said China would use aircraft carriers to " defend sovereignty over coastal areas and territorial seas " .
His comment came just after Chinese general Quan Lihua told the Financial Times in November that China was considering the construction of one to two aircraft carriers .
China has negotiated to order 50 Su-33 fighters from Russia , specifically designed for carriers .
The Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported on December 31 that sources in the Shanghai municipal government and Chinese military had indicated China would start to build an aircraft carrier at the Shanghai shipyard this year , to be completed by 2015 .
The two 50,000 - 60,000 - ton carriers are to be conventionally - powered vessels and therefore much smaller than their US counterparts .
They will be assigned to the Southern Fleet in the South China Sea and possibly to the Indian Ocean to protect oil shipments from the Middle East .
Well aware of the potential threat to Japan 's sea lanes , Asahi Shimbun warned that these carriers " could significantly impact the delicate military balance in East Asia " .
Although still the leading naval power in Asia , Japan is acutely aware of China 's growing economic and military strength .
Since World War II , the Japanese constitution has banned the use of military force in settling international disputes , and this has inhibited the building of obvious offensive weapons such as aircraft carriers .
However , in recent years , the Japanese navy has undergone significant changes , circumventing the pacifist clause by building helicopter carriers labelled " destroyers " .
Some analysts believed these carriers could be converted to carry fixed - wing aircraft .
Reacting to the news of Chinese warships heading for the Gulf of Aden , Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso immediately instructed the defence ministry to " quickly participate in counter - piracy measures " .
However , this deployment is likely to face a protracted political process before being approved .
Japan 's ongoing refuelling operation in the Indian Ocean to support the US - led war in Afghanistan has provoked considerable political opposition , creating political crises for the Liberal Democratic Party government .
India , another Chinese rival , is also concerned about Beijing 's Somali mission , even though China and India held joint naval exercises in 2008 and counter - terrorism exercises in 2007 .
China has established ports in Myanmar , Pakistan , Sri Lanka and Bangladesh , and conducted naval exercises with Pakistan , creating fears in New Delhi that China is seeking to penetrate the Indian Ocean , long regarded by India as its sphere of influence .
Already operating one aircraft carrier , with one more under construction and buying a second hand one from Russia , India is spending billions of dollars every year to beef up its navy to protect its own economic and strategic interests .
A comment in the Indian Express last month warned that Chinese warships in the Indian Ocean are " bound to constrict India 's own freedom of naval action in the Indian Ocean .
China 's strategic re-entry of the Indian Ocean after nearly five centuries demands a sophisticated Indian response that simultaneously cooperates with the PLA navy on shared maritime objectives and pre-empts any Chinese moves to establish a permanent base in the Indian Ocean ...
As China 's shadow darkens over the Indian Ocean , the government must get its diplomats and sailors to work together as never before . "

The Adventures of a Pythonista in Schemeland/15
by Michele Simionato
February 11 , 2009
It is impossible to overvalue the importance of pattern matching which is in my opinion one of the most important concepts in programming .
Unfortunately , this technique is only available in very high level programming languages and therefore it is usually unknown to the average programmer .
I saw pattern matching for the first time in ' 95 , when using Mathematica for High Energy Physics symbolic computations , which is a very specific usage indeed .
Nowadays , however , the trend toward higher and higher abstraction is influencing all programmming languages and I am pretty sure than soon or later pattern matching will enter in mainstream languages .
For the moment , you can find it in functional languages and , in a poor man form , in certain scripting languages .
It should be noticed that common functional languages such as SML , OCaml , F# , Haskell ( or even Scala ) only have run time pattern matching , since they lack macros .
In Scheme instead compile time pattern matching is somewhat preferred : you use it to manipulate compile - time lists which are actually blocks of code wrapped in macros .
Runtime pattern matching is used to manipulate lists ( or other data structures ) which are only know at runtime : in particular , they could be user input .
Compile time pattern matching can be used to implement a compiler ; run time pattern matching to implement an interpreter .
In this episode I will discuss only a poor man form of runtime pattern matching , list destructuring , i.e. the ability to match ( nested ) lists with a single predefined pattern .
This ability is akin to what def- syntax can do at compile time .
Full runtime pattern matching is able to manage a whole set of patterns , akin to what syntax - match can do at compile time .
The poor form of pattern matching is called tuple unpacking in Python ( note for lispers : you would call it destructuring bind ) .
For instance , you can write :
>>> ( a , ( b , [ c , d ] ) ) = ( 1 , [ 2 , iter ( ( 3 , 4 ) ) ] ) >>> ( a , b , c , d ) ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 )
Tuple unpacking works at any level of nesting and for any kind of iterable , therefore it is pretty powerful .
Moreover , tuple unpacking is even more powerful in Python 3.0 , where it is possible to split an iterable into its head ( car ) and tail ( cdr ) :
>>> head , * tail = ( i for i in ( 1,2,3 ) ) >>> ( head , tail ) ( 1 , [ 2 , 3 ] )
I have noticed in episode # 5 that the star syntax in Python is similar to the dot syntax in Scheme , when used in the signature of functions with a variable number of arguments ( variadic functions ) ; the syntactic extension in Python 3.0 makes the similarity stronger .
The main difference between Python and Scheme is that Scheme pattern matching is not polymorphic , i.e. you cannot match with the same pattern a list and a vector or an equivalent iterable .
You must use different patterns , or esplicitely convert the types .
There are plenty of libraries for full runtime pattern matching : one of the most common is the match library by Andrew Wright , which is available practically for all Scheme implementations .
In Chicken Scheme match is actually built - in in the core language :
$ csi CHICKEN Version 2.732 - macosx - unix - gnu-x86 [ manyargs dload ptables applyhook cross ] ( c)2000-2007 Felix L. Winkelmann compiled 2007 - 11-01 on michele - mac.local ( Darwin ) # ;1 > ( match - define ( head . tail ) ' ( 1 2 3 ) ) # ; 2 > ( list head tail ) ( 1 ( 2 3 ) )
Recently the implementation of match has been rejuvenated by Alex Shinn , who fixed a few bugs and reimplemented everything in terms of syntax - rules macros , whereas the original used define - macro : this modern implementation is also available as an R6RS library , thanks to Derick Eddington and you can download it for here , if you want to use this matcher with Ikarus .
Editor 's Note , December 19 , 2009 :
In the wake of the scandal surrounding investor Bernard Madoff , Smithsonian looks back at the crook who gave Ponzi schemes their name
John Kenneth Galbraith once observed that " the man who is admired for the ingenuity of his larceny is almost always rediscovering some earlier form of fraud . "
Although the details may vary , all flimflam games rely on their basic ability to make a lie look like the truth .
Even today , confidence artists continue to work their scams with great success .
Time and again , people from every walk of life demonstrate their ability to abandon common sense and believe in something that is simply too good to be true by succumbing to the con man 's call .
Yet when all is said and done , the Internet is merely a vehicle for swindlers to reach their victims .
" What is new — and striking — is the size of the potential market and the relative ease , low cost and speed with which a scam can be perpetrated , " FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky told a Senate subcommittee during a February hearing on Internet fraud .
But there is nothing new in the scams themselves : they are the same pyramid schemes , phony business opportunities and phantom storefronts that have been fooling the unwary and greedy for centuries .
Many of these computer - savvy crooks have taken their cue from an Italian immigrant named Charles Ponzi , a dapper , five - foot - two - inch rogue who in 1920 raked in an estimated $ 15 million in eight months by persuading tens of thousands of Bostonians that he had unlocked the secret to easy wealth .
Ponzi's meteoric success at swindling was so remarkable that his name became attached to the method he employed , which was nothing more than the age - old game of borrowing from Peter to pay Paul .
The rules are simple : money taken from today 's investors is used to pay off debts to yesterday 's investors .
Typically , these investors are lured by promises of exorbitant profits — 50 , even 100 percent .
Often , they are coached to recruit more investors to enrich themselves further .
The problem is that there is no actual investment going on ; the only activity is the shuffling of money from new investors to old ones .
Everything is fine until the scheme runs out of new investors and the whole house of cards comes tumbling down .
We still hear about Ponzi schemes , or pyramid schemes , as they are more frequently called .
Last year , the collapse of dozens of Ponzi schemes in Albania sparked mass rioting that escalated into a national crisis .
And in New York , investors were out an estimated $ 1.5 billion when the Bennett Funding Group , described by regulators as a " massive , ongoing Ponzi scheme , " went belly - up .
On the Internet , a company called Fortuna Alliance promised investors monthly returns as high as $ 5,000 ; more than 8,600 people bought into the scheme , which was shut down by the FTC in 1996 .
Fortuna eventually stipulated to an injunction prohibiting its alleged scam .
In January 1998 , a judge ordered the company to start paying back its investors .
The FTC says it is seeking $ 5 million in refunds for consumers .
Ponzi himself was probably inspired by the remarkable success of William " 520 percent " Miller , a young Brooklyn bookkeeper who in 1899 fleeced gullible investors to the tune of more than $ 1 million .
Years later , " Honest Bill , " as he came to be known after a jail term in Sing Sing and a turn down the straight and narrow , questioned the workings of Ponzi 's enterprise .
" I may be rather dense , but I cannot understand how Ponzi made so much money in so short a time , " Miller observed to a reporter from the New York Evening World mere days before the bottom fell out of Ponzi 's scheme .
But whatever Ponzi lacked in originality , he had plenty of finesse — and chutzpah .
" He was a fascinating crook — the ultimate con man , " says Ponzi biographer Donald Dunn .
Ponzi's investors ran the gamut from working - class Italian immigrants like himself to cops and politicians .
He even accepted money from a priest .
In the summer of 1920 , Ponzi was front - page news virtually every day in the Boston papers .
But prior to 1920 , few people outside Boston 's Italian community had ever heard of Charles Ponzi .
He told the New York Times that he had come from a well - to - do family in Parma , Italy .
He also claimed to have studied at the University of Rome , but said that he was not suited to the academic life .
" In my college days , I was what you would call here a spendthrift .
That is , I had arrived at the precarious period in a young man 's life when spending money seemed the most attractive thing on earth . "
When his money ran out , young Ponzi decided the wisest course of action was to head west .
On November 15 , 1903 , he stepped off the gangplank of the SS Vancouver in Boston Harbor with only a couple of dollars in his pocket — the result , he said , of being taken in by a cardsharp during the transatlantic crossing .
" I landed in this country with $ 2.50 in cash and $ 1 million in hopes , and those hopes never left me , " Ponzi later told the New York Times .
The road to riches was a long one for the ever - optimistic Ponzi , who waited and bused tables in New York City , painted signs in Florida and worked small jobs up and down the East Coast .
In 1917 , he headed back to Boston in response to a newspaper ad placed by merchandise broker J. R. Poole , who needed a clerk .
He soon met young Rose Gnecco on a streetcar and wooed her energetically .
A small , pretty woman from a modest background , Rose was swept off her feet by her older , seemingly sophisticated suitor .
Rose 's youthful innocence shines through even in newspaper photographs , as does her unswerving devotion to her husband .
The couple married in February 1918 .
Ponzi took over his father - in - law 's grocery business and proceeded to make a mess of it .
( He had already left Poole , who apparently failed to recognize his new clerk 's latent financial genius . )
It was not long before Ponzi struck out on his own , and finally hit upon the scheme that — for a short time — was to make him rich beyond his wildest dreams .
He had come up with the idea for an international trade journal , which he believed could make a tidy advertising profit .
But the bank where he sought a $ 2,000 loan , Hanover Trust Company , did not agree .
Following a brusque rejection by the bank president , Ponzi sat alone in his little School Street office and pondered his next move .
It came to him while opening his mail one day in August 1919 .
As Ponzi relates in his shamelessly exuberant autobiography , The Rise of Mr. Ponzi , a business correspondent from Spain , interested in learning more about Ponzi 's aborted journal , had enclosed a small paper square that put the well - oiled wheels of Ponzi 's imagination into overdrive .
The little scrap of paper was an international postal reply coupon , and the Spanish correspondent had enclosed it in prepayment of reply postage .
Purchased in a Spanish post office for 30 centavos , it could be exchanged for a U.S. postage stamp worth 5 cents , a redemption rate that was fixed by international treaty .
But the Spanish peseta , Ponzi knew , had fallen recently in relation to the dollar .
Theoretically , someone who bought a postal reply coupon in Spain could redeem it in the United States for about a 10 percent profit .
Purchasing coupons in countries with weaker economies could increase that margin substantially , he reasoned .
It should be possible , then , to make a financial killing by buying huge quantities of these coupons in certain overseas countries and redeeming them in countries with stronger currencies .
Ponzi called his new business the Securities Exchange Company , and set out to promote his idea .
It was a big idea — one that Ponzi managed to sell to thousands of people .
He claimed to have elaborate networks of agents throughout Europe who were making bulk purchases of postal reply coupons on his behalf .
In the United States , Ponzi asserted , he worked his financial wizardry to turn those piles of paper coupons into larger piles of greenbacks .
Pressed for details on how this transformation was achieved , he politely explained that he had to keep such information secret for competitive reasons .
Of course , there was no network of agents .
Nor , for that matter , did Ponzi expend any effort to corner the market on postal reply coupons .
A final audit of his company 's assets after the whole business was over turned up $ 61 worth of the coupons , according to Dunn .
Dunn 's book , Ponzi !
The Boston Swindler , provides a dramatized account of Ponzi's wild ride to riches and shows that , if anything , Ponzi 's genius lay in psychology , not finance .
Ponzi knew that his concept — the path to easy riches — was so alluring that the worst thing he could do was try to sell it too aggressively .
Borrowing a page or two from Tom Sawyer , he cultivated an image among friends and acquaintances as a man on the verge of wealth who preferred not to discuss his good fortune in detail — unless , of course , he was pressed .
In his role as the busy but cheerful investment expert , Ponzi showed up at boccie games and neighborhood cafés , plied his pals with good cigars and bonhomie , then rushed off to meet with one of his many important " clients , " Dunn relates .
Only after his victims were well primed was Ponzi ready to dangle his bait : the grand plan in which his investors received 50 percent interest in 90 days .
( Later he sweetened the pot , promising 50 percent interest in 45 days . )
By December , the money had begun to roll in .
Most of the actual investment pitches were done by sales agents who were trained by Ponzi and received 10 percent commissions for investments that they brought in to him .
In turn , many of those sales agents recruited " subagents " who received 5 percent commissions for new investors .
Once Ponzi paid off his first round of investors , word of the financial " wizard " on School Street spread quickly .
Ultimately , some 40,000 people joined the feeding frenzy .
Many people simply reinvested their profits with Ponzi , thereby relieving him of actually having to make good on his promise .
At the height of his success , Ponzi had offices from Maine to New Jersey , and was fending off shady offers from prospective " partners " in New York .
The newspapers caught wind of Ponzi after a man named Joseph Daniels filed a $ 1 million suit against him in July 1920 , according to Dunn .
Daniels , a furniture salesman , laid claim to a share of Ponzi 's fortune on the basis of an old debt .
His lawsuit for what was at the time an enormous amount of money started a buzz about Ponzi outside the circle of investors he had cultivated .
By then , Ponzi had built the lifestyle he had pursued for so many years : a 12 - room mansion in upscale Lexington ; servants ; a couple of automobiles , including a custom - built limousine ; and fine clothes and gold - handled Malacca canes for himself , and diamonds and other baubles for Rose .
He purchased commercial and rental properties all over Boston and acquired stock in several banks .
He even bought out his former employer , Poole .
" The more I bought , the more I wanted to buy , " Ponzi wrote .
" It was a mania . "
But what he really wanted was control of a bank .
He arranged a takeover of Hanover Trust , the same bank that had turned down his loan application the previous year .
A few months later , when Ponzi fell , so did Hanover Trust .
( The Commonwealth of Massachusetts , it turned out , had $ 125,000 on deposit with Hanover Trust — a revelation that figured in the September 1920 resignation of State Treasurer Fred Burrell . )
On July 24 , 1920 , the Boston Post ran a front - page feature on Ponzi with the headline : " DOUBLES THE MONEY WITHIN THREE MONTHS ; 50 Per Cent Interest Paid in 45 Days by Ponzi — Has Thousands of Investors . "
The article described his rags - to - riches ascent , including details of his postal reply coupon scheme .
It pegged Ponzi 's worth at $ 8.5 million .
Monday , the 26th , started out as a banner day for Ponzi .
The scene that awaited him as he approached his office that morning in his chauffeur - driven Locomobile " was one that no man could forget , " he later wrote .
" A huge line of investors , four abreast , stretched from the City Hall Annex , through City Hall Avenue and School Street , to the entrance of the Niles Building , up stairways , along the corridors ... all the way to my office !...
" Hope and greed could be read in everybody 's countenance .
Guessed from the wads of money nervously clutched and waved by thousands of outstretched fists !
Madness , money madness , the worst kind of madness , was reflected in everybody 's eyes !...
" To the crowd there assembled , I was the realization of their dreams .... The ‘ wizard ' who could turn a pauper into a millionaire overnight ! "
Interestingly , the U.S. Post Office Department announced new conversion rates for international postal reply coupons less than a week later — the first change in the rates since prewar days , the New York Times reported .
Officials insisted that the new rates had nothing to do with Ponzi 's scheme .
However , they also insisted it was impossible for anyone to do what Ponzi claimed to be doing .
( Postal authorities today say the same thing : although international postal reply coupons are available at post offices where there is a demand for them , regulations make speculation in them impossible . )
The tide turned quickly against Ponzi .
He had come under investigation by postal and legal authorities as early as February , but they appeared to be making little progress in their efforts .
Meanwhile , the editors at the Boston Post , possibly chagrined at having published the article that injected so much momentum into Ponzi 's enterprise , launched an investigation into his business .
The bad press enraged Ponzi .
At the advice of his publicity agent , a former newspaperman named William McMasters , Ponzi offered to cooperate with the U.S. District Attorney 's office by opening his books to a government auditor and declining to accept new investments , as of noon that day , July 26 , until the audit was complete .
Word that Ponzi was closing his doors prompted a huge run , as thousands stormed School Street to redeem their investment vouchers .
Ponzi directed his clerks to refund the money of everyone who presented a voucher .
On one day , the Post reported , Ponzi paid out more than $ 1 million .
Frightened investors who cashed in their chips early got back only their principal , which , Ponzi noted , saved him considerable interest .
Ponzi maintained a cool head .
He played games with the authorities — on the one hand appearing to cooperate with them , and on the other snubbing them to talk to reporters , who provided daily coverage of the unfolding drama .
" ‘ POSTAGE STAMP ' KING DEFIES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO LEARN HOW HE PROFITS , " the Washington Post reported on July 30 .
In the article , Ponzi shrugged off the notion that he was under any obligation to reveal details of his business dealings to officials .
" My secret is how to cash the coupons .
I do not tell it to anyone , " he asserted .
" Let the United States find it out , if it can . "
As the run continued , Ponzi ordered up sandwiches and coffee to be distributed to the mobs of people waiting outside his office .
He directed that women be moved to the front of the line , after hearing that several had fainted in the sweltering summer heat .
Uncertain whether he was a crook or a hero , the crowds simultaneously booed and cheered him .
Many people changed their minds while waiting to turn in their vouchers , convinced that their investments would pay off in the end .
The Boston Post reported how one man proclaimed Ponzi " the greatest Italian of them all . "
With false modesty , Ponzi pointed out that Columbus had discovered America and that Marconi had discovered the wireless .
" But Charlie , " the fan replied , " you discovered where the money is ! "
Meanwhile , speculators in Ponzi's hire bought up notes at a discount from the worried , Dunn reports .
The investigation slogged on .
" OFFICIALS BALKED BY PONZI PUZZLE , " the Boston Post observed .
Then , on August 2 , the Post dropped a bombshell after enlisting the cooperation of McMasters , Ponzi 's erstwhile publicity agent , who wrote a copyrighted , first - person report in which he proclaimed Ponzi " hopelessly insolvent . "
" He is over $ 2,000,000 in debt even if he tried to meet his notes without paying any interest , " McMasters declared .
" If the interest is included on his outstanding notes , then he is at least $ 4,500,000 in debt . "
Still , McMasters found it difficult to condemn the little financier : " No wonder Ponzi is confident :
He sees an apparently unlimited pile of cash ... the public dippy about him ... and Wall Street ‘ experts ' who never did anything like it themselves offering ‘ sure - thing ' explanation of his ‘ operations ' — is it any wonder the thing has gone to his head ? "
Note holders besieged the School Street office the day the McMasters article ran .
Ponzi hotly denied the charges of insolvency , and threatened to sue both McMasters and the Post .
The public circus escalated .
On August 10 , Ponzi gave a luncheon address at Boston 's Hotel Bellevue for the Kiwanis Club , which had invited him for a " battle royal " with a mind reader named Joseph Dunninger .
The idea was that Dunninger would " throw the X - ray of clairvoyance on the subtle brain of the little Italian and reveal what he found to the audience , " the Boston Globe reported .
But the spectators were so enthralled by Ponzi that the contest apparently never came off ; at 2:45 , Ponzi was still fielding questions from the audience .
Ponzi audaciously implied that he dealt directly with foreign governments in order to purchase the vast quantities of coupons needed to support his enterprise .
Because the governments from whom he bought coupons profited themselves , they " naturally would not care to reveal " the exact nature of their business , he explained .
" PONZI TELLS KIWANIS CLUB HOW HE GOT HIS MILLIONS , " the Globe shouted from its front page .
Editors at the Chicago Tribune , which also reported on the Kiwanis Club affair , were more skeptical : " PONZI REVEALS PHILOSOPHER'S STONE : 0+0= $ , " the headline ran .
On August 11 , the Boston Post made the sensational revelation that the financial wizard was a former jailbird , having served time ( 1908 - 10 ) in Canada for forging checks .
The article , the result of the Post 's own investigation , ran complete with mugshots of Ponzi from Montreal police .
Later , it was learned that Ponzi had served another term in a federal prison in Atlanta for smuggling five Italians from Canada into the United States .
The next day , Edwin Pride , the government auditor , concluded his examination of Ponzi 's books .
He found Ponzi to be $ 3 million in the red ( he later revised it to $ 7 million ) .
Ponzi was placed under arrest .
" PONZI WEARING HIS SMILE EVEN IN EAST CAMBRIDGE JAIL , " the Boston Evening Globe reported .
" The man 's nerve is iron , " his jailer marveled .
Half - a- dozen banks crashed in the aftermath of Ponzi 's fall .
His note holders received less than 30 cents on the dollar ; many investors held on to their notes , clinging desperately to the belief that their hero would somehow come through , Dunn says .
For its relentless reporting , the Boston Post won a Pulitzer Prize .
Ponzi was convicted on federal charges of using the mail to defraud .
He served 31 / 2 years and was paroled .
In 1925 , he was convicted on state fraud charges .
Out on bail while the verdict was under appeal , he headed for Florida to raise money by selling swampland under the name " Charpon . "
He was quickly arrested and convicted of fraud .
He jumped bail when he learned that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts had upheld his conviction in that state .
With authorities in two states in pursuit , Ponzi fled to Texas .
He signed aboard as a seaman on an Italian freighter , but was captured in New Orleans .
Ponzi was returned to Massachusetts to begin his sentence at the state prison in Charlestown .
When Ponzi emerged from jail in 1934 , balding and 40 pounds heavier , immigration authorities were on hand with a deportation warrant .
He had never become an American citizen and was considered an undesirable alien .
On October 7 , after his appeals to remain in the United States were rejected , he was deported to Italy .
Rose stayed on in Boston with plans to join him once he found employment , but after two years she tired of waiting and finally divorced him .
For years , says Dunn , who interviewed her not long before her death , she was dogged by rumors that she had a secret stash of her husband 's ill - gotten gains .
But Rose was a victim herself : she and eight of her relatives had loaned Ponzi more than $ 16,000 .
After Ponzi's departure , Rose led a pinched and quiet existence , eventually remarrying after her husband 's death and moving to Florida , where she tried to escape the notoriety of her former husband 's escapades .
Accounts of Ponzi's life after his eviction from the United States vary .
According to one version , he talked his way into a high - ranking financial ministry job in Mussolini 's government .
When officials realized that he was not the financial genius he purported to be , he fled carrying two suitcases stuffed with cash and caught a steamer to Brazil .
Dunn , who 's done the most extensive research on Ponzi , uncovered a different story .
He reports that Ponzi got help from his second cousin , Col. Attilio Biseo of the Italian Air Force , who was commander of the Green Mice Squadron and a friend of Mussolini's .
Biseo landed Ponzi a job with a fledgling airline doing business between Italy and Brazil .
This new career kept Ponzi in high style between 1939 and December 1941 , when the United States entered World War II and the Brazilian government cut off supplies to Ponzi 's airline , having learned that it was ferrying strategic supplies to Italy .
Out of a job , Ponzi scraped by , teaching English and French and later working as an interpreter for an Italian importing firm , according to Dunn .
But his eyesight was failing and a stroke in early 1948 left him partially paralyzed .
Ponzi died in a charity hospital in Rio de Janeiro on January 18 , 1949 , leaving $ 75 to pay for his burial .
Why does anyone fall for such scams ?
" It 's human nature , " says Susan Grant of the National Consumers League .
" The crooks know that there are basic human factors that they can appeal to — the desire to do what you think you see other people doing around you , making money and getting rich . "
In other words , wishful thinking .
In 1920 , people saw Ponzi as a man who could make the impossible possible .
Today , many people in search of lucrative investment opportunities " see the Internet as a place where all things are possible , " observes Paul H. Luehr , who chairs the FTC's Internet Coordinating Committee .
Sometimes , they simply can't tell the difference between a legitimate business enterprise and a hoax .
But other times it 's clear that they do n't really want to know .
Grant and Luehr tell of inquiries they 've received from consumers in search of reassurance that an attractive scheme is legitimate .
But when cautioned against it , they become angry .
" Many times people are mad at the government for spoiling a ‘ good ' investment opportunity , " says Luehr .
Today 's operators often use high - tech bells and whistles to lure their prey .
Ponzi's approach was more charismatic .
But the bait is always the same and the outcome is inevitable .
Up to 95 percent of the people who buy into Ponzi schemes eventually lose all their investments , says Luehr .
Generally , it is only the con man who gets the easy money .
For Ponzi , there undoubtedly were other rewards as well : excitement and power .
Richard Ault , a retired special agent and criminal profiler for the FBI , speculates that , more than anything , Ponzi wanted to be " something special . "
A poor immigrant , he sought to become part of the Boston establishment that had excluded him , Ault believes .
" It was an impossible goal , but he managed to achieve a little bit of it for a short period of time . "
To Ponzi , it was all a grand , desperate game that he was determined to play to its conclusion .
At the end , he had this to say about the mad caper on which he had led the people of Boston : " Even if they never got anything for it , it was cheap at that price .
Without malice aforethought I had given them the best show that was ever staged in their territory since the landing of the Pilgrims !...
It was easily worth fifteen million bucks to watch me put the thing over ! "
To Charles Ponzi , who began with nothing , ended up the same way but enjoyed a brief interlude of power and fame , it undoubtedly was .

Hoping for some Apple - like magic , Microsoft ( NSDQ : MSFT ) has announced plans to open its own chain of branded stores as it looks to catch up to its rivals .
No word on which of its products – which include retail - friendly gaming console XBox and the Zune music player — would be on sale in these stores ; also , no word on how many stores it is looking to open , or a timeline for opening them .
To lead the retail charge , the software giant has hired David Porter , most recently the head of world - wide product distribution at DreamWorks Animation , as its new corporate VP of retail stores ;
Porter also spent 25 years at of Wal - Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) in store ops , merchandising and IT .
One of the key decisions he has to make : whether to use the stores mainly as a showcase for MSFT products , or to actually sell hardware ( which would mean selling PCs from other companies ) and software .
Any decision that favored some PC makers and left others off store shelves could anger some hardware partners , as WSJ points out .
As for MSFT ’s reasoning behind opening these stores , in its own words : “ The purpose of opening these stores is to create deeper engagement with consumers and continue to learn firsthand about what they want and how they buy . ”
The company recently kicked off a big and rather - quirky consumer ad campaign featuring founder Bill Gates and comedian Jerry Seinfeld , which was n’t received that well , at least by the consumers it wanted to reach .
Some more details in the release here .
The move comes as other retail ( especially electronic ) stores have been under pressure .
Circuit City recently filed for bankruptcy and is in the process of closing down all of its stores , and rival CompUSA closed most of its retail stores last year .
Meanwhile , * Apple * has about 200 stores worldwide now .
These flashy stores have played a key role in the company ’s turnaround , resurgence and attracting new customers to its products including iPods , iPhones and its Macbook series , though average revenue per store in Q408 had fallen to $ 7 million , compared with $ 8.5 million in the year - earlier quarter .
A new study appearing in The Prostate has found that certain measles virus vaccine strain derivatives , including a strain known as MV - CEA , may prove to be an effective treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer .
The findings show that this type of treatment , called virotherapy , can effectively infect , replicate in and kill prostate cancer cells .
Prostate cancer is a leading cause death among males in the western world .
It is currently the second most common cause of cancer - related deaths among American men with 186,320 new cases and 28,660 deaths expected to be recorded in 2008 .
A sizeable proportion of these patients ultimately relapse , with a 5 - year failure rate for treatment ranging from 14 to 34 percent .
No curative therapy is currently available for locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer .
The median survival time of MV - CEA - treated mice in the study almost doubled compared to the controls , and complete tumor regression was observed in one - fifth of treated animals .
“ Based on our preclinical results as well as the safety of measles derivatives in clinical trials against other tumor types , these viral strains could represent excellent candidates for clinical testing against advanced prostate cancer , including androgen resistant tumors , ” says Evanthia Galanis , M.D. , of the Mayo Clinic , senior author of the study .
The study was supported by the Mayo Clinic Specialized Program of Research Excellence ( SPORE ) in prostate cancer .
These oncolytic strains of measles virus , represent a novel class of therapeutic agents against cancer that demonstrates no cross-resistance with existing treatment approaches , and can therefore be combined with conventional treatment methods .
Because primary tumor sites are easily accessible in prostate cancer , locally recurrent disease represents a promising target for virotherapy approaches .
The virotherapy agent can easily be applied directly to the prostate tumor via ultrasound - guided needle injections and close monitoring of therapy can be achieved by non-invasive techniques including ultrasound and MRI .
The measles vaccine strains also have an excellent safety record with millions of vaccine doses having been safely administered in over 40 years of use .
Repeated measurements of the marker CEA ( carcinoembryonic antigen , produced when the virus replicates ) following MV - CEA treatment can be performed via a simple blood test , and can potentially allow for optimization of dosing as well as the tailoring of individualized treatment .
To date , no significant toxicity from MV - CEA treatment of patients with other tumor types has been observed .
Prior studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potency of MV - Edm derivatives against a variety of preclinical animal models including ovarian cancer , glioblastoma multiforme , breast cancer , multiple myeloma , lymphoma and hepatocellular carcinoma .
The promising results prompted the rapid translation of engineered MV - Edm strains in three clinical trials that are currently active .
In the ovarian cancer trial , the furthest advanced ; evidence of biologic activity has been noted in refractory ovarian cancer patients .
The results set the foundation for additional studies in preparation for using engineered measles strains in a clinical trial for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer .
The next upgrade to Apple 's iPhone will have a strong focus on gaming , analysts and developers agree .
That 's because the gaming market is an increasingly juicy segment of the mobile multimedia space — and it's one that Apple 's phenomenally successful iPhone is well - positioned to dominate .
" The iPhone and iPod Touch are becoming a major new handheld gaming platform , and if you look at the App Store and look at what 's doing well , that 's reflecting , " said Bart Decrem , CEO of Tapulous , developer of the popular Tap Tap Revenge iPhone game .
" I would look forward to improvements in the device as a gaming platform both for the phone and iPod Touch . "
Apple made clear its plans to seize the gaming market in November 2008 when Apple marketing executive Greg Joswiak called the iPhone and iPod Touch " the future of gameplay , " posing a serious threat to dedicated gaming consoles such as the Nintendo DS and Sony
PSP .
The reasons ?
A few things :
The quick , electronic distribution method of games and apps via the iPhone 's App Store ; the accelerometer and multitouch display , which are introducing new approaches to gameplay ;
and the iPhone 's lighter , more portable form factor compared to its rivals .
Numbers say the iPhone is indeed in a position to assault the gaming market .
Analysts predict Apple is on track to sell 40 million iPhones or more per year .
By way of comparison , Nintendo sold 42 million DS consoles from January 2007 to
June 2008 .
Add to that the fact that the iPhone App Store has already got the DS and PSP beat in terms of game titles available :
When the App
Store was just three months old , it had 1,500 games ; the PSP and DS had about 600 and 300 titles , respectively .
There are just a few weaknesses the iPhone needs to address before it 's truly acknowledged as a serious game device , said Steve Demeter , developer of the Trism iPhone game : Processing limitations , graphic capabilities and memory management .
For example , the PSP 's advantage as a dedicated gaming device is that its application programming interface ( API ) is geared toward loading complex textures — a task the iPhone falls short on .
If Apple is serious about making the iPhone a gaming platform , it 's a good bet that the next upgrade to the iPhone will address those limitations .
Tero Kuittinen , a Global Crown Capital analyst , agrees that the next iPhone will have enhanced graphics and more powerful processing capabilities .
And those improvements will likely be incorporated in a new ARM chip that
Apple is developing in - house .
In April 2008 , Apple acquired semiconductor company PA Semi to manufacture ARM chips for future iPhones .
Other than introducing graphical improvements it 's unlikely the iPhone will see dramatic changes .
Kuittinen noted that Apple enjoys keeping its interfaces consistent to ensure software is backward - compatible — so forget about a slide - out keyboard or a screen that 's either much smaller or much larger than the current iPhone .
Developers Decrem and Demeter agreed that Apple will likely be conservative with changes so as not to require software coders to rewrite applications to be compatible with the next iPhone .
One minor change Apple will likely introduce in the third - generation iPhone is an improved web camera with video - recording capability and a flash .
Kuittinen said the camera will have to sport at least a
3.5 - megapixel resolution in order to compete with Research In Motion ,
Samsung , HTC and LG , which are already selling handsets with superior cameras to the iPhone .
When can we expect the next iPhone ?
Considering the first iPhone launched June 2007 and the second iPhone shipped July 2008 , the third - generation iPhone should land no later than summer 2009 .
Let 's hope this one has copy and paste .

Ruby 1.9.1 is the first stable release of the 1.9.x series , and brings , among many language and standard library enhancements , significant performance improvements .
However , compatibility with existing code and Gems can be stumbling block when migrating to 1.9.1 .
There are different reasons for that .
The ParseTree Gem , for instance , is not available because the new Ruby VM does n't keep a Ruby parsetree around after the source code 's parsed and compiled into bytecode .
A partial replacement is available in the Ripper library shipped with 1.9.x ( MacRuby , for instance , uses Ripper to parse Ruby sources for some purposes ) .
Libraries that only require parsing of source code can get by with either Ripper or ruby_parser .
Another potential reason for compatibility problems are subtle changes in the language semantics , such as block variables which are now scoped properly , as well other changes .
Whatever the reasons , the release of 1.9 in 2007 , and more so the release of 1.9.1 earlier this year has now caused increased attention to getting libraries ready for 1.9.x .
According to many reports , Rails 2.3 ( or Rails Edge ) appears to be 1.9.x compatible , earlier releases seem to have problems .
Ryan Bigg detailed a list of issues that come up with using Rails on 1.9.1 .
The Phusion Passenger blog reports that their most recent version is compatible with 1.9.1 , and detail which libraries they had to update or patch to make this work .
Some database adapters are read , such as the MySQL adapter released version 2.8.1 which is supposed to work with Ruby 1.9.1 .
An interesting solution to determining compatibility information is available at http://isitruby19.com/.
The site lists Ruby Gems and allows users to report their experiences with compatibility .
A nice feature is a green and a red bar next to the name of the Gem , which show the number of user reports of success or failure of this Gem on 1.9 .
The results should be taken with a grain of salt though , particularly Gems with only one user report .
At publication time of this news item , the ParseTree Gem was reported as " Working " , something contradicted by an earlier message by Ryan Davis , the creator of ParseTree .
Also , a quick test run of ParseTree in a Ruby 1.9.1 instance fails with
parse_tree.rb:3:in
` ': ParseTree does n't work with ruby 1.9.1
Nevertheless , http://isitruby19.com is one place to start when looking for compatibility answers .
What 's holding you back from migrating to Ruby 1.9.1 ?
Criminal gangs have dramatically increased their output of counterfeit £ 1 coins in the past year , pumping millions of fakes into the economy and threatening to undermine public confidence in the money supply .
Sampling by the Royal Mint of coins in circulation across Britain has found that the number in circulation rose by 27 per cent during 2008 , raising the amount of sham coinage to £ 37.5 m – or one £ 1 coin in every 40 – the highest since the coin was introduced in 1983 .
In 2002 , one in 100 £ 1 coins was a worthless fake and in 2007 one in 50 .
Royal Mint officials are considering launching a public information campaign to warn the public how to spot the fakes .
Technically any person handing one over is breaking the law , meaning that millions of people are unwittingly committing a crime every year , but many of the fakes closely reproduce the metallic compound used by the Royal Mint , making them hard to detect by bank counting machines .
The rise in forgeries , revealed in documents obtained by The Independent , prompted a warning from an expert that their prevalence could undermine confidence in the money supply .
" If the public starts losing confidence in coins and notes , you get people refusing to take them , " said Robert Matthews , who retired as Chief Assayer of the Royal Mint in 2002 .
" It could damage a lot of small shopkeepers doing lots of small transactions . "
The latest results suggest many people encounter bogus cash weekly , or daily if they handle money in a shop , pub , café or other business .
The Mint checked 15,481 coins supplied by banks and post offices at 31 places across the UK in October and November 2008 .
On average , the proportion of fake £ 1 coins since November and December 2007 rose from 2.06 per cent to 2.58 per cent .
There were much higher levels of fakes in Northern Ireland ( 3.6 per cent ) and London and the South - east ( 2.97 per cent ) .
They were lowest in the North - west .
Concerned officials at the Royal Mint have opened talks with the Treasury and the police on the problem .
Bank and building society tellers may be given specialist training .
Mint officials are also talking to vending operators about whether they need to tighten their mechanisms so they reject more coins , which could mean more frustration for those trying to buy parking tickets , drinks or cigarettes .
Martin Cragg , Royal Mint head of corporate affairs , said : " A number of measures are being undertaken by the Royal Mint with third parties to combat counterfeiting , including HM Treasury , the banks , vending operators and law - enforcement agencies .
" In particular , we are considering whether it would be appropriate and helpful to issue further publicity material which may assist the public and others to identify counterfeit coins . "
Little is known about the counterfeiters – few have been caught in recent years .
One theory is that blank coins from Italy and eastern Europe are " headed and tailed " by lower - level criminals in the UK .

The Abyss - Part V - More Invertebrates

Gastropods
Holothurians or " sea cucumbers " are an especially common sight on the floor of the
abyss , walking on tubular feet and grazing on bacteria - rich sediment with a ring of oral
tentacles .
Many sea cucumbers defend themselves from predators by regurgitating their
own sticky intestines , which will quickly regenerate .
In these images by researcher Stefano Schiapaelli ( CAML ) , we can get a good look
at a Scotoplane or " sea pig " and a newly discovered species of parasitic snail .
Stalked , filter - feeding Crinoids or " sea lilies " were once abundant at all aquatic
depths , but have been largely restricted to the abyss for millions of years .
Some
species are able to detach and swim short distances , or even walk on two or more
tentacles in a bizarrely anthropomorphic fashion .
Marine slugs and snails typically spend their early days as free - swimming , planktonic
larva before settling down to a life of sluggish slithering .
Some groups , however , are
holoplanktonic , which means that they retain their swimming form throughout their
lifespan .
These gelatinous , flapping " sea butterflies " or " pteropods " may filter - feed
on microscopic plankton , trap food in dangling webs of mucus or actively hunt other
invertebrates .
Their shells can be external , internal or completely absent , and some
may display bioluminescence .
Holoplanktonic mollusks are found throughout our
oceans , but seem to be more common in much colder waters .
Sponges
Xenophyophores
I can't remember when it was that I first learned of these humble little creatures , but
I 've yet to fully overcome the shock of their existence , and by now , I 'm sure you know
that this is saying quite a bit .
Liesurely creeping along the muck of the sea floor ,
these gelatinous globules collect tiny fragments of shells , sponges and other animal
remains to build a hollow casing or " test " ( what we see in these photos ) around their
delicate bodies .
Different species favor different building materials , and many form
tests of their own hardened excrement .
They secrete a blanket of mucus as they sift
for tiny particles of food in the surrounding mud , engulfing it in one more amorphous
pseudopodia .
So , where 's the shocking part ?
With some species reaching the size of a human fist ,
Xenophyophores are , by an immense margin , the world 's largest single - celled
organisms .
They are protozoans , related to the amoeba .
Giant germs that wear their feces are as high a note as I could ever end on , so with
that , I 'll bring this crappy little e-tour to a close .
Every year , science is surprised anew
by what we dredge up from these stygian pits , and we can no doubt look forward to
ever - weirder zoological discoveries in our lifetimes .
Echinodermata
A flesh - eating beast you are unlikely to find in a pineapple , the surface of this innocuous - looking
deep - sea organism functions as a sort of flypaper for small crustaceans , entangling their jointed
limbs in a velcro - like pattern of microscopic hooks .
Special cells in the sponge 's body migrate
around the prey to form a temporary orifice , where its lipid content is absorbed and carried to
the sponge 's core .
Many other sponges feed in a similar fashion , but Chondrochladia lampadiglobus , pictured here ,
is one of the most visually striking .
Nearly all are found in the deep - sea abyss , arctic waters and
underwater caves where sunlight and plankton are relatively scarce .

In Japan 's Kanagawa prefecture , it looks like you can add ' police sketch artist ' the list of occupations being killed by technology .
The authorities there evidently skipped the pad and pencil and went straight to the Nintendo Wii when they had to come up with an image of the perpetrator , using the Mii digital avatar tool .
It would almost be more believable if the police were actually looking for an avatar that had escaped its console and gone on a joyride , rather than looking for a human being who looks like an avatar that looks a little surprised and a little high .
Oh , and the sign says " This man is wanted for a hit and run – if you see him please report him to Kanagawa police immediately . "

In late 2007 , in Pashmul , a tiny cluster of villages in southern Afghanistan , Muhammad Khan began his tenure as the police commander by torching all the hemp in a farmer ’s field .
Farmers in the area had grown plants up to seven feet tall , and , being teetotallers , like many Afghans , they smoked hashish constantly .
Afghan soldiers and policemen in the area also smoked , to the exasperation of the NATO troops who were training them .
But Khan was n’t from Pashmul and he did n’t smoke .
He ordered his men to set the harvest ablaze , moved upwind , then turned his back and left , with an expression of indifference .
Khan and his police officers are members of Afghanistan ’s Hazara minority , identifiable among Afghans because of their Asiatic features ; the population they patrol is Pashtun .
Hazaras are mostly Shia , with a history of ties to Iran , whereas most Pashtuns are Sunni and have turned to Pakistan for support .
Over the past century , the two peoples have fought periodically , and the Hazaras , who are thought to make up between nine and nineteen per cent of Afghanistan ’s population — the Pashtuns make up nearly half — have usually lost .
On the border between the Hazara heartland , in the country ’s mountainous and impoverished center , and the Pashtun plains in the south and east , conflicts over grazing land are common .
But , working alongside NATO soldiers , Hazara police units are now operating far to the south of these traditional battlegrounds and deep into Pashtun territory .
The Pashmul base is just outside the city of Kandahar , in one of Afghanistan ’s most dangerous regions .
Last year , the Taliban all but wiped out the Afghan National Police , or A.N.P. , squads there .
Deploying Hazaras in this region is a risky move , and comes at a time when Taliban bombings and assassinations are making clear the failure of the U.S. - led NATO coalition and the Afghan government to secure the country .
Recently , a draft of a National Intelligence Estimate said that increasingly effective insurgent attacks and widespread corruption in President Hamid Karzai ’s government have eroded the government ’s authority , and concluded that the country is in a “ downward spiral . ”
And a leaked diplomatic cable quoted the British Ambassador as saying that “ the presence of the coalition , in particular its military presence , is part of the problem , not part of its solution . ”
If the coalition were to leave , the country would be left with the ragtag Afghan National Army , or A.N.A. , which deploys wherever it is needed to fight the Taliban in counter - insurgency battles , and the A.N.P. , which is responsible for street - level law enforcement and now bears the brunt of the Taliban insurgency .
( Last year , nearly four times as many Afghan police were killed as soldiers . )
Among Afghans , the A.N.P. has become known for incompetence and corruption .
Units like Khan ’s , made up of a despised minority with an unsparing attitude toward those they police , embody many of the paradoxes involved in trying to bring order to Afghanistan ’s ethnically fissured society .
In July , I visited Pashmul ’s police base , a small installation about twice as large as a tennis court and surrounded by ditches and razor wire .
Nearby are crumbling Pashtun villages of mud-brick homes , sprinkled with trash and unexploded ordnance .
Pashmul is ideal terrain for an insurgency .
The main sources of livelihood , other than hemp and poppies , are grapes and pomegranates , and , during the summer fighting season , foliage in fields and orchards provides cover for insurgents .
Because farmers are too poor to use wooden frames in their vineyards , their grapevines are supported by deep furrows cut in the earth ; thus in an apparently empty field hundreds of Taliban may be hidden .
Grape huts , scattered around the fields , have mud walls thick enough to stop bullets , and narrow ventilation slits that can accommodate rifle barrels .
Fighting has caused many Pashmul residents to flee to a temporary camp in the desert , from which they trek several miles each morning to cultivate the fields .
Khan ’s police unit patrols a war zone , and the men often do the work of soldiers rather than of normal beat police officers .
Although the Army lends support when the police encounter armed resistance , the soldiers then retreat to a base outside Pashmul .
On most days , the police patrol the alleys alone , except for a few Canadian soldiers whom NATO has assigned to train and mentor them .
Taliban snipers routinely fire at the base ’s wooden guard towers , and the Hazara policemen fire back .
They watch the rickety pickups that pass on a paved road along the base ’s eastern edge , on the lookout for suicide bombers .
Khan ’s men know the faces in each village , but they remain an alien presence .
One man , who sold goats to the Hazara policemen , would say hello to the patrol when it walked past his home ; his corpse later turned up in the next village .
Now in his late twenties , Muhammad Khan has an intense manner and an unsettling stare .
When I met him , he gave me an appraising look , his glare landing on the book in my hand , Paul Theroux ’s “ My Secret History . ”
Khan asked me , in Persian , what I was reading , and , struggling to recall the word for “ novel , ” I said it was “ a book . ”
He gave me the same suspicious look I later saw when he confronted frightened farmers about insurgents in their fields .
“ That much I can see , ” he said .
“ Is it a novel ? ”
Khan ’s directness enables him to work efficiently with his Canadian supervisors — particularly Mike Vollick , a warrant officer stationed at Khan ’s police base .
An infantryman , Vollick is thirty - seven and of medium height , with sturdy arms that , when I met him , five months after his arrival in Pashmul , were scabby from dozens of sand - fly bites .
The Canadians and the Hazaras communicate reasonably well , although they mostly use a translator and do n’t have more than a few dozen words in common , most of which describe military equipment .
Vollick considers
Khan the most effective Afghan police commander he has seen , and an ideal candidate for district police chief , although , given Khan ’s inability to speak Pashto , the local language , and the strength of Pashtun prejudice , this would be an unlikely appointment .
Khan enforces high standards — the men ’s blue - gray uniforms are tidy , and military routine is strictly followed — which are all the more impressive given the lack of discipline and infighting in most Afghan police units .
The men enjoy the slightly giddy camaraderie of a team under permanent siege , and they are bold fighters , though their zeal often exceeds the behavior that might be expected of a group given the task of winning the trust of an uneasy citizenry .
Once , when Vollick called off a planned patrol into Taliban territory for tactical reasons , he had to assuage the Hazaras ’ sense of honor by explaining why he had not led the group into battle .
The day before I arrived , Vollick and Khan , after months of long - range firefights across fields and vineyards , had planned an ambush of Taliban who , villagers said , sometimes gathered at a cemetery some five hundred yards from the base .
The Hazaras took up a position near the cemetery , and soon two men carrying heavy blankets rounded a corner and passed a mud wall .
Vollick stayed back to watch how the policemen behaved .
They passed the first test by not immediately killing both men .
But as soon as Khan ’s men called for the Talibs to halt , they dropped the blankets and raised Kalashnikov assault rifles that were hidden underneath .
The Hazaras outdrew them , and one policeman — who looked several years younger than his stated age of eighteen — emptied an entire magazine at one of the men , who fell dead with more than twenty bullets in his chest .
The other man scrambled away , wounded .
The Hazara men had never been this close to their enemy before , and they were eager to pursue the wounded man .
But Vollick shouted at them to stay where they were , fearing that they would be led into a trap .
“ They were losing their minds , they were so excited , ” Vollick told me later .
The dead man wore an orange skullcap , a loose shalwar kameez , sandals that the Hazaras identified as Pakistani , and Chinese military webbing that held his ammunition and weapons .
Vollick found a small book of names and phone numbers , as well as a rusted rifle whose stock had been shortened for easy concealment .
Moments later , the group heard shots nearby .
Another patrol had encountered a third insurgent , and two policemen killed him at point - blank range .
Soon , insurgents began shooting wildly from a concealed position .
Vollick ordered a retreat , and the group ran through the alleys toward the base .
The policemen moved with their Kalashnikovs raised , and Vollick shouted at them to lower their weapons , to avoid shooting innocent farmers .
The group returned with no casualties other than its composure and professionalism ; the Hazaras had behaved more like a paramilitary group than like a professional police team .
They hung the rusty rifle on a wall as a trophy .
In the next days , every Hazara I met pointed to it with pride .
That evening , they listened eagerly to the Taliban ’s radio channels , which featured confused messages about someone named Bashir .
Villagers later reported that the wounded man had died .
Two days later , Vollick , sitting in the base ’s kitchen , with his back to a wall of M.R.E.s and granola bars , described the operation as a success .
Police had subsequently picked up a suspected insurgent leader in the area , and Vollick ascribed the capture to Taliban panic resulting from the ambush .
“ We hit them when we chose , and they had no idea who did it or how , ” he said .
When he said “ we , ” he gestured to the Hazaras ’ sleeping quarters , twenty feet away .
“ It was a psychological victory . ”
The Hazaras I spoke with described the sprint back to the base , easily the most dangerous moment of the ambush , with nonchalance .
Muhammad Hussein — the boy who killed the first Talib — chain - smoked as he described it .
“ It was n’t that serious , ” he said .
“ They launched one rocket , but it was far from us . ”
But Vollick , a professional warrior , remembered the sprint differently .
“ We were running for our fucking lives , ” he said .
The Hazaras trace their bloodline to soldiers of Genghis Khan who settled in Afghanistan in the thirteenth century .
Some scholars doubt this pedigree , but Hazara mothers remind their children of their Mongol heritage by addressing them as “ bachah - ye Moghol ” — “ child of Mongols ” — to teach them good manners .
In the late nineteenth century , the Hazaras were among several groups who revolted against Abdur Rahman Khan , Afghanistan ’s Pashtun king .
They lost badly , and Khan built towers of Hazara skulls as a lesson to the survivors .
Most of the surviving Hazaras fell into poverty , doing the work of draft animals and slaves .
Pashtun nomads seized Hazara - held pastures and farmland at the southern foot of the mountains in central Afghanistan .
The British noted the Hazaras ’ role as servants and manual laborers in Kabul , and saw an opportunity .
The Orientalist Edward Balfour , though he described the Hazaras as “ unblushing beggars and thieves , ” went on to write , “ Some of the clans have a military repute ; they would make good soldiers , and might have risen to distinction , but they are disunited . ”
Lord Kitchener directed the Indian Army to create a unit of Hazaras , along the lines of the Nepalese Gurkhas , and in 1904 the 106th Hazara Pioneers was formed .
Known for fine marksmanship , the regiment fought in France in the First World War and in Baghdad in the early nineteen - twenties .
During the rest of the twentieth century , Pashtuns further encroached on Hazara land , and extremist Sunni clerics declared the murder of Hazaras a righteous act .
In the nineteen - eighties , the Soviet occupation largely spared the Hazara homeland , but they mounted an insurgency nonetheless , singing revolutionary songs whose villains were Pashtuns rather than Soviets .
By the nineteen - nineties , when the Sunni Taliban formed around Mullah Omar , the Hazaras had found an Iranian - backed Shiite , Abdul Ali Mazari , to oppose him .
Mazari led Hazara attacks on the Taliban , but , in 1995 , he was captured , tortured , and thrown from a helicopter near Ghazni , southwest of Kabul .
After Mazari , no Hazara leader reached national prominence until the formation of the Karzai government , in 2002 .
During the Taliban ascendancy , Muhammad Khan and all his men lived in Iran , as refugees .
Khan himself has spent twenty years there — most of his life — and he speaks with a slight Iranian accent .
Having been treated poorly as refugees , these Hazaras have no lingering fondness for Iran , but they have benefitted from the country ’s superior educational standards .
This , together with their determination to reëstablish themselves in what some Hazaras regard as their ancestral homeland , makes them effective janissaries for NATO .
The formation of police units like Khan ’s gives the Hazaras greater authority outside their own territory than they ’ve had in a century .
It is also a classic counter - insurgency gambit .
Tom Donnelly , a defense analyst at the American Enterprise Institute , who has undertaken a book - length study of NATO in Afghanistan , compares it to the American use of Shiite militias to fight Sunni insurgency in Iraq .
“ It ’s a common tactic in irregular warfare situations to pit the rivalries of an ethnically diverse populace against each other , ” he told me .
The difficulty is finding a way to avoid unleashing a dispossessed minority on a rampage of revenge against the group it is asked to control .
[ #unhandled_cartoon ]
Alessandro Monsutti , an anthropologist who has studied the Hazaras , fears that the short - term gain of the Hazara units ’ efficacy may be outweighed by long - term harm .
“ They ’re very efficient for narrow , military targets , ” he told me .
“ But what about rebuilding the country ? ” Donnelly , too , acknowledges that the use of ethnic militias could lead to explosive retribution when NATO leaves Afghanistan .
( European use of privileged local minorities in colonial Africa contributed to the continent ’s most destructive post - colonial wars , including the Rwandan genocide . )
The Hazaras have not , historically , fared well in combat with the Pashtuns , although the policemen at Pashmul seem eager to try their luck .
When Vollick asked them where he could get more police like them , they replied that they could raise a militia of a thousand men in their homeland , in Daykundi Province .
1 Carefully read all instructions , especially the fire hazard warnings below them .
2 Put 5g yeast into a bowl or cup and add a pinch of sugar and about 1 /4 cup warm water .
The water needs to be between 110 – 120 °F ( 43–49 °C ) .
Allow it stand for approximately ten minutes .
3 In the meantime , pour the flour , along with salt and sugar directly into the rice cooker .
4 Pour the milk into the flour that is now in the rice cooker .
5 Pour the yeast mixture from the first step directly into the dry ingredients .
6 Form the dough into a ball after kneading for 8 - 10 minutes , adding a little more flour if it seems too wet .
If the dough feels very sticky , then dip your hands into some flour so that the dough will not stick as you roll it .
7 Add butter to the dough ball .
It might be easier to [ 1 ]
It might be easier to cut the butter into small pieces .
Also the butter should be soft and at room temperature .
The butter will also help to grease the rice cooker bowl , so that the bread will not stick to the sides .
Knead the butter into the ball until the butter is completely absorbed into the dough and has no lumps .
8 Allow to sit for an hour in the rice cooker bowl in a warm area or on a warm setting .
This is the first dough rise .
9 Notice that the dough , as it sits undisturbed , doubles in size .
This is because the yeast in there is eating up the starch and sugars in the flour and breathing out carbon dioxide .
The carbon dioxide dissolves into the dough , and either escapes , or expands the air bubbles in the dough that were there from mixing causes dough to get bigger !
10 Lift the dough from the bowl and with some force , toss it back .
Do this a few times , until the dough returns to its original size .
Once again allow it to sit in a warm area .
This is now the second and final rise .
11 Note that the second rise will be the same as the first .
Just leave it alone for one hour , and it will puff back up to double its size .
Yeast works this way .
12 Bake for an hour , but check after a half hour to see if it is done .
Make sure it does not burn on the bottom .
Temperatures differ with each rice cooker , so you will have to learn what is best for you .
Write down the times and steps , so you will remember it for the next bake .

LONDON ( MarketWatch ) -- European banking giants UBS and HSBC may be liable for around $ 3.2 billion of losses from the Bernard Madoff scandal due to their role as custodians of funds in Ireland and Luxembourg , according to a published report Thursday .
Custodians are responsible for the oversight of funds and the transfer of cash to and from investors .
Individuals and institutions with money in funds that had UBS UBS , - 0.54 % ( 002489948 ) and HSBC ( HSBA ) HBC , - 0.48 % as custodians are claiming the banks failed to do their job because they did n't keep track of where the assets were , Bloomberg reported .

Leading industrial countries have pledged to avoid protectionism as they battle the global economic crisis .
Finance ministers at a G7 meeting in Italy said raising barriers to free trade would make the downturn worse .
Hours earlier , the US Congress approved an $ 787bn economic recovery plan that includes a ' Buy American ' clause .
G7 ministers said stabilising the world economy and financial markets was their priority .
They said they would work together to support growth and jobs .
The ' Buy American ' clause has raised fears that protectionism could be growing in the world 's largest economy .
The world - wide downturn means many Chinese workers are also seeking jobs
But in a statement after the meeting , new US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner dismissed such concerns .
" All countries need to sustain a commitment to open trade and investment policies which are essential to economic growth and prosperity , " he said .
Ministers also called for urgent reform to the International Monetary Fund , saying the crisis had shown weaknesses in the world financial system .
" We agree that a reformed IMF , endowed with additional resources , is crucial to respond effectively and and flexibly to the current crisis , " the ministers ' statement said .
Other points included : Praise for recent economic moves by China ;
Help for banks ; and
The need for a speedy end to the Doha talks on world trade The G7 comprises the US , the UK , Japan , Germany , France , Italy and Canada .
The BBC 's correspondent at the meeting says it was billed as a meeting to discuss the broad issues of the economic crisis , not to decide major policy initiatives - and that 's what it was .
Britain 's Chancellor of Exchequer ( Finance Minister ) , Alistair Darling , said it was a stepping stone to a meeting in London in April of the G20 group , which also includes big emerging economies such as China and India .

A Simple Python Jabber Bot
I ’ve been knocking together various little instant messaging bots recently , partly as a way to play around with XMPP .
As well as using the low level xmppy and XMPP4R - Simple libraries I ’ve been having lots of fun with the JabberBot framework .
Jabberbot lets you write simple bots incredibly quickly , using simple conventions to determine what commands the bot exposes .
It ’s easier to explain with a simple example .
The following bot lets you send the command time to it and returns the current time on the server on which the bot is running .
The magic is in the name of the method bot_time .
Any methods that start bot_ are automatically exposed as commands for the bot to accept .
You ’ll need an xmpp server for the bot to connect to but you could always just register an additional google account and use it over gtalk if you wanted to .
Personally I ’m running ejabberd on a local Ubuntu VM as well for testing .
pre. from jabberbot import JabberBot import datetime class SystemInfoJabberBot ( JabberBot ) : def bot_time ( self , mess , args ) : “ ” “ Displays current server time ” “ ” return str(datetime.datetime.now ( ) ) username = ‘ [ email protected ] ’ password = ‘ my- password ’ bot = SystemInfoJabberBot( username , password ) bot.serve_forever ( )
The JabberBot site has a few more examples as well with fancier features .
At the recent Last .fm hackday I spent a bit of time knocking together a bot which talks to the Last . fm API ( using the PyLast library for the API backwards and forwards . )
I did this mainly as a demonstration of how simple it can be to create a useful command line interface to your API using an instant messaging client .
The code for LastBot is on GitHub .
It has a few limitations and does n’t intent to cover anywhere near all the API .
When up and running you should be able to talk to it with your IM client .
Simply send the user specified in the settings file a message like so :
pre. search {query}
So if you wanted to search for “ astley ” you would type :
pre. search astley
Which would probably give you :
pre. you probably mean Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley http://www.last.fm/music/Rick_Astley/_/Never_Gonna_Give_You_Up
Richard Paul Astley ( born February 6 , 1966 ) is an English dance - pop singer , songwriter and musician .
He was born in Newton - le - Willows , St Helens , Lancashire , England .
Astley currently resides in Richmond , Surrey with his Danish girlfriend , Lene Bausager , and their daughter , Emilie .
In 1985 , Astley was playing the club circuit as a singer with a soul band named FBI , when he was seen by the record producer Pete Waterman and persuaded to come to London to work at the PWL recording studio .
If the first result that comes back is n’t the one you wanted you can ask for the next result by simply sending next in another message .
You can use prev as well to come back through the set .
pre. next
You can always send it a call for help at any time which should return the instructions to you via an IM message .
pre. help
Which should return something like :
pre. Personal LastFM search bot .
Useful for looking for tracks you ca n’t remember the full name of .
Or for findind out who sung a track .
search : do a search for tracks prev : get details about the previous track in the list next : get details about the next track in the list
More instructions , and the code behind the bot , can be found in the README .
As developers we spend a lot of time using command line interfaces - mainly for speed and because you can cram a lot of functionality into a small amount of screen real estate .
We ’re increasingly spending time debugging API calls as well and exposing your API calls for use by instant messaging clients has the potential to make development easier .
Think of the Python interactive shell or of IRB , but for APIs .
GLENN BILLEY has been hit harder than most by the global financial crisis .
He had a job as a car salesman at Barry Smith Holden in Pennant Hills six months ago .
Now Mr Billey sells the Big Issue outside Central Station each day to pay his bills .
He is homeless , he says , but remains positive .
" Hope never dies , you know .
You start giving up hope , you start giving up [ on ] life , on yourself . "
Mr Billey , who turned 40 on Sunday , said his story could be anyone 's in the current financial climate .
" I 've never been homeless before .
I 'm sort of trying to rebuild again and climb the rungs again , but it 's very difficult . "
The federal government ’s massive effort to save the financial system carries a price tag that has soared into the trillions .
Where will all that money come from ?
How much have the bailouts cost ?
Counting the money that has either been spent or promised in the form of loan guarantees , the figure now approaches a hard - to - fathom $ 8.5 trillion .
For perspective , that ’s more than the government spent , in inflation - adjusted dollars , on the Louisiana Purchase , the entire New Deal , and the Vietnam and Korean wars — combined .
The bailouts have been coming at such a feverish pace that it ’s hard to keep up , but they include everything from outright purchases of $ 500 billion in mortgage - backed securities to guarantees on $ 388 billion of Citigroup and General Electric debt .
Just one of the bailouts , of insurer AIG , cost $ 150 billion .
Where does the money come from ?
Technically , it comes from the federal Treasury .
But there ’s a problem .
Even before the current financial crisis erupted , the U.S. was spending hundreds of billions more than it was collecting , leaving a budget deficit of nearly $ 400 billion dollars .
So to pay for all the additional financial commitments the government has taken on in recent months , the Treasury has had to borrow hundreds of billions more .
To do that , it has been selling bonds on the global bond market .
How exactly does that work ?
Once a week , the Treasury Department , working through a syndicate of banks , conducts auctions for bonds — which come due in anywhere from 30 days to 30 years .
The Treasury deposits the proceeds of the bond sales to its account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
Then the government turns around and lends the bond revenues to Citigroup , AIG , and the other bailout recipients .
It ’s this process that people refer to when they say the Treasury is “ printing money , ’’ because the funds are essentially created out of nothing .
Everything is done electronically , however ; no physical bonds or cash actually exchange hands .
How much have we borrowed ?
A staggering amount .
The national debt currently stands at $ 10.6 trillion and is rising fast , since the Treasury is currently borrowing roughly $ 550 billion per quarter .
About half the debt is money the government owes to itself — some of the biggest buyers of Treasury bonds are the Social Security Trust Fund and other entitlement programs .
The remainder — the so - called public debt — is owed to individuals , institutions , and foreign governments .
The federal debt is now so large that taxpayers must pay $ 412 billion in interest every year — the third largest expense in the government ’s $ 3 trillion operating budget .
Can we afford that ?
Yes , at least in the short term .
The national public debt is about 39 percent of the annual U.S. output of goods and services , or gross domestic product .
That sounds like a lot , and it is .
But it ’s actually in line with the debt - to - GDP ratio of the past two decades , and far less than during World War II , when the debt - to - GDP ratio topped 100 percent .
Who ’s lending us all this money ?
To a large extent , the rest of the world — especially China , which as of September owned $ 585 billion in Treasury bonds .
The next largest foreign creditors are Japan , with holdings of $ 573 billion , and Great Britain , with $ 338 billion .
Foreign oil - producing countries own $ 182 billion of Treasury debt .
These countries have one thing in common :
They ’re major exporters to the U.S. , which gives them a lot of U.S. currency that they want to invest .
They invest much of those reserves in Treasury bonds .
What if China says ‘ no more ’ ?
It might cause a momentary shock , but other countries would likely pick up the slack — thanks , ironically , to the financial crisis .
With loans going into default at a record pace , bond buyers trust only the most creditworthy borrowers .
The U.S. has never defaulted on its bonds , making it the world ’s debtor of choice .
“ The Treasury , at this point , is viewed as the safest harbor in the world , ” says University of Pennsylvania economist Marshall Blume .
What is the effect of all this borrowing ?
It could enable the U.S. to spend its way out of the recession .
If the U.S. invests its money wisely — and that ’s a big if — then all that borrowing could , as Bill Gates said recently , “ bring us out of the downturn better off than when we went in . ”
Many experts say that investments in green technology , education , and infrastructure could lead to improved productivity and drive economic growth .
But there is a serious downside : Every dollar invested in Treasury bonds is one less dollar of investment available to the private sector .
And the private sector has been the source of most of the innovation that drives profit growth and creates jobs .
Are there other risks ?
Yes .
All that borrowing by the government , coupled with all the loans that the U.S. , in turn , is extending to corporations and consumers , dramatically increases the world ’s supply of dollars .
With so much currency in circulation , there ’s the risk of inflation , which is what happens when too much money chases too few goods .
Prices rise , workers demand higher pay to keep up , and a hard - to - control inflationary spiral begins .
But that ’s a worry for another day .
“ There are extreme circumstances when a larger national debt is accepted as the lesser of two evils , ” says Robert Barbera , chief economist at the Investment Technology Group .
Most economists agree that this is one of those times .
China in the catbird seat
Now that China is America ’s largest creditor , many observers worry that it could soon effectively have a veto over U.S. policies .
Some analysts have noted , for example , that the U.S. ’s ability to get tough with Iran is hampered by the fact that Iran is China ’s ally ; if the U.S. goes too far , according to this theory , China could punish the U.S. by halting its bond purchases .
But most experts say such a move could hurt China as much as it would hurt the U.S. China ’s economy depends heavily on exports to the U.S. , which buys $ 321 billion in Chinese goods every year .
By disrupting America ’s economy , China would only be crippling its own .
“ It ’s not in China ’s interest to create financial instability , ” says Bank of America market strategist Gerald Lucas .
Indeed , the precarious world economy gives both countries a strong incentive to work together .
“ China and the U.S. still need each other , ” writes Washington Post columnist David Ignatius , “ perhaps now more than ever . ”
Obama promises to deliver policies directly from the establishment that his supporters believe they are opposing .
– Carbon taxes / Environment czar
– An expanded police state / civilian national security force
– A continuation of the pre-emptive war policy ( possibly against Pakistan ) that made the Bush presidency so unpopular .
The tools found in Colorado resident Patrick Mahaffy 's backyard were n't the typical collection of weed whackers and shovels .
Instead Mahaffy 's yard hosted a collection of chipped stone knives and axes that date from the time of the Clovis people , who are believed to have been among the first inhabitants of America around 13,000 years ago .
" The idea that these Clovis - age tools essentially fell out of someone 's yard in Boulder is astonishing , " [ anthropologist Douglas Bamforth ] said .
" But the evidence I 've seen gives me no reason to believe the cache has been disturbed since the items were placed there for storage about 13,000 years ago " [ LiveScience ] .
The prehistoric tool cache was turned up when landscapers were digging a hole for a fishpond in Mahaffy 's backyard , and struck stone .
The collection contains 83 knives , axes , and smaller pieces of flint , and a chemical analysis of blood residue left on the blades revealed that the tools had been used to butcher extinct types of North American camels and horses , and well as bears and sheep .
Bamforth says the protein residue from the butchered animals suggests that the tools were n't buried as part of a ritual , but were instead tucked away for safekeeping .
" It looks like someone gathered together some of their most spectacular tools and other ordinary scraps of potentially useful material and stuck them all into a small hole in the ground , fully expecting to come back at a later date and retrieve them , " Bamforth said [ LiveScience ] .
The tools are n't notable merely for the unusual circumstances of their discovery , Bamforth says ; they 're also of great interest to researchers because only a scant handful of tools from that era have ever discovered in North America .
Homeowner Mahaffy adds that the tools are also remarkable for their meticulous craftsmanship .
He said he was struck by the beauty of the tools and also how well designed they seemed to be .
“ They ’re ergonomically perfect , ” Mr. Mahaffy said .
“ They fit perfectly in your palm , and your fingers curl over just where they should ” [ The New York Times ] .

Next Steps
All the changes necessary to run JRuby on Android have already been shipped in JRuby 1.2RC1 .
So you can grab those files and dex them yourself , or wait for me to add Android - related build targets .
Android 's default stack size is incredibly small , 8 kb .
So for all but the most trivial Ruby code you 're going to want to bump it up with - Xss .
See the final snippit at the bottom of this post for an example .
And of course you all know about using - Xmx to increase the max heap ; it applies to Android as well .
I need to report the bugs I 've found in Android 's bug tracker and provide some steps to reproduce them .
I 'll probably get to this in the next couple days .
Hopefully they can be fixed quickly , and hopefully patched Android does n't take too long to filter out to users .
Meanwhile , I 'll probably start poking at an all - at - once compilation mode , since I think that 's simpler initially than emitting Dalvik bytecode .
It 's already done in my head .
You 'll run a command to " fully compile " a target script or scripts , and it will create the .class file it does now along with all the method binding .class files it normally generates at runtime .
I 've been planning this feature for a while anyway .
With the " completely compiled " Ruby code you should be able to just " dex " it and upload to the device .
Given that most people will probably want to ship precompiled code , and given the fact that many libraries will never work , we need to modularize JRuby a bit more so we can rip out unsupported libraries , parser guts , interpreter guts , and compiler guts .
That should shrink the total size of the binary substantially .
And I have other ideas for shrinking it too .
We in the JRuby community also need to start brainstorming how to use this newfound power .
Assuming the above items are all completed soon , what will we want to do with JRuby on Android ?
Build apps entirely in Ruby ?
Script existing ones ?
What Ruby features would we be willing to drop in order to boost Android - based performance a bit more ?
Hopefully this discussion can start in the comments and continue on the JRuby mailing lists .
The Bottom Line
# dalvikvm - Xss128 k - classpath data/ruboto. jar org.jruby .

Ok , so I intentionally made my last post a bit of a " tease " .
You can't fault me for trying to drum up a little buzz , yeah ?
And hey , I spent almost as long fiddling with that logo as I did hacking JRuby to run on Android .
Here it is again , just for good measure :
On Monday night , the local Ruby group ( Ruby Users of Minnesota , or RUM ... great buncha guys ) hosted three talks : one on Android development , one on iPhone development , and one on migrating from Struts to JRuby a bit at a time .
The Android talk kinda hooked me , even though I was working on last - minute JRuby 1.2RC1 issues and not really paying much attention ( sorry , Justin ) .
I 'd considered getting JRuby working on Android before , since it 's compatible with most Java 1.5 language features , has a much more extensive library than any of the Java ME profiles ( which hopefully will be remedied in future ME profiles ) , and represented the best chance for " mobile JRuby " to date .
I had tweeted about it , scammed for a free G1 phone , and briefly browsed the online docs .
I had even downloaded it back in early January ... but I 'd never bothered to try .
So late Monday night , I tried .
And about an hour later it was running .
There 's really two sides to the Android SDK .
There 's the drag - and - drop fluffy - stuffy GUI in the form of a plugin for Eclipse .
That was my first stop ; I got it installed , created a sample project , and ran it in the emulator .
It worked as expected , and I 'll admit it made me want an Android phone a bit more .
I 'll be the first to admit I 've been skeptical of Android , but at this point it 's hard to argue with a totally open platform , especially since it has a shipping device now .
So yeah , SDK plus sample app was easy and appetite - whetting .
Then I tried to pull in JRuby 's main jar file .
Nothing seemed to work right .
I got errors about not having defined an " application " in some XML file , even though it was there .
There was no obvious information on how to add third - party libraries to my app , and I certainly may have done it the wrong way .
And of course my lack of knowledge about the structure of an Android app probably did n't help .
But ultimately , since I did n't really need a full - on application , I started to dig around in the SDK for " another way " .
Not one for reading documentation , I immediately started running the executables under " tools " with -- help and guessing at combinations of arguments .
Immediately I saw " emulator " and started that .
Yay , an emulator !
Then I saw dx , which looked intriguing .
A - ha !
It 's the tool for converting an existing class or jar into Dalvik bytecode .
A bit more fidding with flags , and I finally found the right incantation :
For the newbs : that 's - JXmx1024 M to allow dx to use up to a gig of memory , -- dex to convert to Dalvik bytecode , and -- output to specify an output file .
So , suddenly I had what I assumed was a Dalvik - ready ruboto . jar file .
A quick jar -t confirmed that everything appeared to be there , along with a " classes.dex " file .
There were also a bunch of warnings about " Ignoring InnerClasses attribute for an anonymous inner class that does n't come with an associated Enclosing Method attribute . " but warnings do n't stop a true adventurer .
I pressed on !
So , the next step was getting it into the emulator , eh? Hmm .
Well there 's no " upload " option in the emulator 's OS X menu , and nothing obvious in the Android UI .
There must be a tool .
Like maybe a debugging tool of some kind ... like a " jdb " but for Android .
Hmm ..... this " adb " executable looks promising ... Ahh , bingo .
And one of the adb subcommands was " push " for pushing files to the device .
A few minutes and experiments later , I figured out incantation # 2 : Or at least , I almost had it .
Obviously the device was being closed - minded about the whole thing .
So back to adb to run another subcommand and have a look around : Hmm. " data " .
That looks promising .
I mean , a " data " directory could n't possibly be read - only , right ?
So let 's give that a try .
BING !
We have liftoff !
Ok , so we 've " dexed " the jar , uploaded it to the emulator , and now we want to run it .
Back into the shell we go !
There 's obviously an sbin above , but it 's pretty slim : Another debugging thingy I suppose .
Maybe I 'll have a look at that later .
What about under " system " ?
I 've gotten used to the bulk of my system living under something called " system " from running OS X .
And as in that case , " system " was much more populous , with a bin directory containing all sorts of goodies .
However one of them jumped out at me immediately :
Oh , goodie , " dalvikvm " .
Could it possibly be the equivalent of the " java " command on a desktop ?
Could it really be that easy ?
It could !
My hands began to tremble .
My heart began to pound .
Could I simply doAnd expect it to work ?
Curses !
Ignoring for the moment how strange it seemed to have a - jar flag that simply does n't work , I tried specifying - classpath and org .
jruby .
Main.Aaaaaaaand ...
It blew up with my first official JRuby - on - Android exception !
Hmm .
The code in question simply iterated over an EnumSet .
After thinking through a few scenarios , I concluded this was not JRuby 's fault .
It seemed that I had discovered my first Android bug , the first time I tried to run anything on it .
And that made me sad .
But only for a moment !
The code in question turned out to be unimportant for a normal application ; it was simply iterating over a set of Errno enums we use to report errors .
Commented it out , and I was on to my next issue :
Ok , VerifyError because of missing JMX stuff ... that 's no problem , I can just disable it for now .
So , one more attempt , and if it fails I 'm going to start doing iPhone development I SWEAR .
SUCCESS !Ok , so we all agree Android dodged a bullet there .
But what 's the real status of JRuby on Android ?
It turns out there were very few changes necessary .
I fixed the EnumSet stuff by just iterating over an Errno [ ] ( EnumSet was not actually needed ) .
I fixed the JMX stuff by creating a BeanManagerFactory ( yay GOF ) that loaded the JMX version via reflection , falling back on a dummy if that failed .
And I fixed some warnings Dalvik was spouting about default BufferedReader and BufferedInputStream constructors by hardcoding specific buffer sizes ( I think Dalvik is wrong here , and I 'm arguing my case on the android - platform ML ) .
And that 's really all there was to it .
JRuby pretty much " just worked " .
Of course you see the " could not compile " error up there .
What 's up with that ?
JRuby normally runs mixed - mode , interpreting Ruby code for a while and eventually compiling it down to Java bytecode if it 's used enough .
But we do try to immediately compile the target script , since it does n't cost much and gives you better cold - start performance for simple scripts .
The error above was simply JRuby reporting that it could not compile my little -e script .
Why could n't it ?
Because the JRuby compiler is generating JVM bytecode , not Dalvik bytecode .
Dalvik does not run JVM bytecode .
Here 's the actual error you get :
So that 's caveat # 1 : this is currently only running in interpreted mode .
To avoid the compiler warning , you can pass - X - C to JRuby to disable compilation entirely .
Unfortunately , interpretation means JRuby is none too fast at the moment .
That may not matter if you 're scripting a " real " app , but we 'll definitely find ways to improve performance soon .
That may mean providing an all - at - once compilation tool for Ruby code ( we have an ahead - of - time ( AOT ) compiler right now , but it 's per- file , and still expects to generate some code at runtime ) , or it may mean a second compiler that generates Dalvik bytecode .
Either way ... it 's coming .
Caveat # 2 is that a large number of libraries are n't working , especially any that depend on native code :
And so on .
There 's nothing to say these libraries can't be made to work , but they 're not working yet .
And thankfully , our most important library seems to work fine :
And that leads me to caveat # 3 , better demonstrated than explained : Bummer , dude .
There seems to be some feature ( i.e. a bug ) preventing some Android core classes from reflecting properly , which means that for the moment you may not be able to access them in JRuby .
Overall , I think it was a great success .
We obviously were n't doing anything in critical JRuby code that Android could not handle .
Kudos to the Android team for that , and kudos to us for still supporting Java 1.5 .
But success in software only leads to more opportunities : JRuby works on Android , that much is certain .
The remaining issues will get worked out .
And I dare say this is probably the best way to get Ruby on any embedded device yet ; after dexing , it 's literally just " upload and run " .
So there 's a great opportunity here .
I 'm excited .
And just one more example to show that not just JRuby itself , but also Ruby libraries that ship with it work ( using the " complete " JRuby jar in this case ) :
For the rest of the time the popcorn is on the heat , you will need to constantly shake the pot .
I like circular motions ( clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counter clockwise in the southern ) , but sometimes I change it up with a little side to side or even a figure eight .
Once you add the sugar , the popcorn will stop popping .
It will take it about 30 seconds to 1 minute to start popping again .
Once it starts again , you will need to listen carefully to it .
The popping will get very rapid and then begin to slow .
Once it slows to once every couple of seconds you will remove the pot from the heat and dump it into your bowl .
Just as a note here , you will notice that the popped corn lifts the lid off my pot .
Feel free to use a pot with higher sides so this wo n't happen to you .
I just happen to like this pot so much that I can overlook it 's short sides .
Hey ladies , are you sick of air drying your bras and having it take forever ?
Me too !
That 's why I totally love this …
* McCain softens personal attacks on Obama
* Obama urges world leaders to coordinate action on crisis
* Newsweek poll gives Obama 11 - point lead
CHILLICOTHE , Ohio ( Reuters ) - An Alaska ethics inquiry found on Friday that Gov. Sarah Palin , the U.S. Republican vice presidential candidate , abused her authority by pressuring subordinates to fire a state trooper involved in a feud with her family .
The finding cast a cloud over John McCain ’s controversial choice of running mate for the Nov. 4 election .
On the day it was published he reined in an aggressive strategy against Barack Obama that had failed to cut into his Democratic rival ’s lead .
After a week in which he and Palin fiercely attacked Obama and inflamed supporters by urging them to question his fitness to be president , McCain switched to a milder tone , calling on frustrated loyalists to respect the Illinois senator .
Supporters appeared surprised by his conciliatory approach , booing at a Minneapolis rally when he told a skeptical backer that Obama was a “ decent person and a person that you do not have to be scared ( of ) as president of the United States . ”
The Alaska inquiry centered on whether Palin ’s dismissal of the state ’s public safety commissioner , Walt Monegan , was linked to her personal feud with a state trooper who was involved in a contentious divorce with the governor ’s sister .
The inquiry found that while it was within the governor ’s authority to dismiss Monegan , Palin violated the public trust by pressuring those who worked for her in a way that advanced her personal wishes .
“ Governor Palin knowingly permitted a situation to continue where impermissible pressure was placed on several subordinates in order to advance a personal agenda , to wit : to get Trooper Michael Wooten fired , ” the report said .
The investigation was commissioned in July by Alaska ’s Legislative Council composed of 10 Republican lawmakers and four Democrats .
ALASKAN SCANDAL
The scandal gained national attention after Palin , 44 , who was little known outside of Alaska and has virtually no national or international experience , was selected to be McCain ’s running mate in August .
The McCain - Palin campaign dismissed the report , saying it was a “ partisan - led inquiry run by Obama supporters , ” and Palin and her family had been justified to be concerned about the behavior of the trooper .
Palin “ acted within her proper and lawful authority in the reassignment of Walt Monegan , ” a campaign statement said .
McCain , 72 , made clear the shift in his approach during a rally in Lakeville , Minnesota , when supporters frustrated by his drop in the polls urged him to be a fighter at the next debate with Obama .
“ We want to fight and I will fight .
But we will be respectful .
I admire Senator Obama and his accomplishments , ” McCain said .
While a number of questioners expressed concerns about Obama , one woman went further .
“ I do n’t trust Obama .
I have read about him .
He ’s an Arab , ” she said , echoing a false assertion that has crept into some right - wing Internet blogs .
McCain shook his head in disagreement and cut her off , grabbing the microphone back .
“ No , ma’am .
He ’s a decent family man , ( a ) citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues , ” he said .
On Monday , Palin had told a joint rally with McCain in Florida : “ I am just so fearful that ( Obama ) is not a man who sees America the way you and I see America . ”
“ FEAR MONGERING ”
Critics say that line was especially pointed because of its potential subtext .
Obama , 47 , would be the first black president and his background , including part of a childhood spent in Indonesia , is different from that of most Americans .
He has accused the Republicans of fear - mongering .
The attacks by McCain and Palin have failed to stop a gradual increase in Obama ’s lead in polls as he focused on policies to cope with the international financial crisis .
A Newsweek poll published on Friday gave Obama an 11 - point lead over McCain at 52 - 41 percent .
A month ago this poll had the two candidates tied at 46 percent .
Other polls in the most contested states have also shown a swing toward Obama .
The election campaign has been overshadowed by the escalating international financial crisis , partly driven by the collapse of the U.S. housing market .
Stock markets around the world plummeted again Friday .
A majority of Americans tell pollsters they trust Obama more than McCain to handle economic issues .
Campaigning in battleground states key to the election , both candidates offered proposals to try to ease the strain on Americans from the market meltdown that has cost investment portfolios billions of dollars .
Are acai claims justified ?
The three main sets of claims examined
In the links at the bottom of this article , I 've included some of the scentific research done into acai berries and juice , so that you can read it yourself should you wish to see the original work .
Anti-oxidant properties .
The scientific analysis of acai extracts appear to show high and beneficial levels of anti-oxidants .
In the case of some types of anti-oxidant , it had the highest levels of any food tested .
The anti-oxidants were found to be in a form which could easily enter human cells , and it appears can do a lot of good .
There is further evidence that anti-oxidants in berries can indeed help treat cancer , although the research is in its early stages and is far from definite .
So in this respect , the evidence seems to support the claims that acai can be a great addition to your diet .
Weight loss
I have seen absolutely nothing which supports the idea that acai juice or the acai berry will help you burn fat or lose much weight , apart from websites which sell the stuff !
If you are eating healthily and exercising , consuming acai might well improve your sense of well - being as you lose weight , but that 's it .
There 's nothing of the weight - loss - magic - bullet about acai juice , unless you are a company selling it .
Some people swear it has helped them lose weight , but until there are proper , scientific trials , I 'm far from convinced .
General well - being and energy levels
This is something of a subjective test .
Lots of people do feel it makes them feel well and energetic .
It 's hard to measure , of course , and I 've not seen scientific trials specifically on this ( although the properties set out in the anti-oxidant categories might well make you feel good ) .
Overall , it seems that there are a lot of good things to be said about acai juice or pulp , and nothing bad .
It 's been massively over - hyped , of course , but the research I 've done has lead me to conclude it 's worth adding to my diet , and I 've done so .
ROME ( Reuters ) - Italian and British scientists want to exhume the body of 16th century astronomer Galileo for DNA tests to determine if his severe vision problems may have affected some of his findings .

The scientists told Reuters on Thursday that DNA tests would help answer some unresolved questions about the health of the man known as the father of astronomy , whom the Vatican condemned for teaching that the earth revolves around the sun .
“ If we knew exactly what was wrong with his eyes we could use computer models to recreate what he saw in his telescope , ” said Paolo Galluzzi , director of the Museum of History and Science in Florence , the city where Galileo is buried .
Galileo , who lived from 1564 to 1642 , is known to have had intermittent eye problems for the second half of his life and was totally blind for his last two years .
“ There were periods when he saw very well and periods when he did not see very well , ” said Dr. Peter Watson , president of the Academia Ophthalmologica Internationalis and consultant to Addenbrooke ’s University Hospital , Cambridge .
Watson , who has studied Galileo ’s handwriting , letters and portraits of the astronomer , suspects he may have had unilateral myopia , uveitis -- an inflammation of the eye ’s middle layer -- or a condition called creeping angle closure glaucoma .
Watson believes Galileo did not acquire his eye problems by looking at the sun but by systemic illnesses , including an attack when he was young that left him temporarily deaf and bloody discharges and arthritis so severe he was bedridden for weeks .
He was under particular stress when he was tried for heresy by the Inquisition because the Copernican theory he supported conflicted with the Bible .
ERROR OF A GENIUS ?
One of the “ errors ” that Galileo made , which Galluzzi suspects may have been attributed to his bad eyesight , is that he believed Saturn was not perfectly round but may have had an irregular , inflated side .
With his 20 - power telescope and with his eyes in bad shape he might have mistaken Saturn ’s gaseous ring to surmise that it was formed of one planet with two moons as satellites .
“ This was probably a combination of errors .
He probably expected to find satellites and his eyesight may have contributed to some confusion , ” said Galluzzi .
“ A DNA test will allow us to determine to what measure the pathology of the eye may have ‘ tricked ’ him , ” he said .
“ If we discover the pathology he suffered , we can formulate a mathematical model that simulates the effects it would have had on what he saw and using the same type of telescope he used we can get closer to what he actually saw , ” Galluzzi said .
“ We only have sketches of what he saw .
If we were able to see what he saw that would be extraordinary , ” he added .
Galileo was buried in Florence ’s Santa Croce Basilica about 100 years after his death .
Before , his remains were hidden in a bell tower room because the Church opposed a proper burial .
His bones were stored together with those of one of his disciples , Vincenzo Viviani , and those of an anonymous woman .
Galluzzi and others believe the bones belong to the most beloved of Galileo ’s three illegitimate children , Sister Maria Celeste , a nun who died when she was 33 .
She was the subject of the 1999 international bestseller “ Galileo ’s Daughter , ” by Dava Sobel .
DNA would determine if she is his daughter .
Galluzzi said he was waiting for permission from the Church to exhume the body and then would form a committee of historians , scientists and doctors to oversee the project .
Unbeliever :
Why can't some other " god " be the necessary starting point ?
Christian : Because there are no other gods .
U : How do you know that ?
C : Because God tells us : " For all the gods of the nations are idols , but the Lord made the Heavens " Psalm 96:5
U : What about the gods of the other religions ?
C : They do n't exist .
U : But other people believe that other gods exist .
C : I would argue that they do n't , as Scripture teaches us that they are " suppressing the truth in unrighteousness . "
U : Could you demonstrate why Allah or Vishnu could n't be the necessary starting point ?
C : Sure , because God tells us they do n't exist .
U : But their " holy " books would argue that your God does n't exist , how would you deal with them ?
Christian :
Which one do you believe ?
U : None of them .
C : Then there is no sense arguing about them .
We could also sit here and argue whether or not the moon is made of green cheese , but since neither of us believe that it would be a waste of time .
U : Surely you have heard of positing hypotheticals to disprove a claim ?
C : Yes , that would make sense in other instances but we are talking about the necessary starting point to make sense of argumentation , so it would not make sense to argue from a position that you do n't believe .
U : Ah , you are just saying that because you can't refute my hypothetical that Allah is the necessary starting point .
C : Not at all .
Just for kicks , I will refute your hypothetical
Premise 1 : If atheism is true , no gods exist
Premise 2 : Atheism is true .
Conclusion :
Therefore no gods exist and you have been refuted .
U : Um , but you are not an atheist !
C : Um , but you are not a Muslim !
Do you see why refuting hypotheticals when it comes to the justification for knowledge is pointless ?
U : Okay fine , I have just become a Muslim , now refute my god .
C : Do you see what you must do to even begin arguing against my position , you must abandon your position .
U : What do you mean ?
C : Are you saying that Atheism cannot provide the necessary foundation for knowledge ?
U : Um , atheism can't provide a foundation for anything as it makes no claims it is just a lack of belief .
C : Well in atheism there is the implied claim that knowledge can be justified without God , and you have demonstrated that by abandoning atheism to make your argument .
U : Okay fine , but you will discard my deity as quickly as I discard yours .
C : Not at all .
I know that you are not a Muslim , but I will demonstrate how I refute their claim as a sign of good faith .
( There are only 2 worldviews , God and " notGod . "
I treat all the " notGod " worldviews the same way , I ask them how they know what they know ) .
How do you know what you know ?
U : Revelation from Allah in the Holy Qur'an .
C : What does the Qur'an say about the Bible ?
U : It denies the Bible .
C : Then you need to read your Qur'an .
The Qur'an actually says that the Bible is a previous revelation of Allah , and that it is true ( Surah 6:114 * ) so why do n't you believe what it says ?
U : The Bible has been corrupted over the years .
C : Well actually we have complete copies of the Bible which predate the Qur'an ( i.e. Codex Vaticanus - 4th century AD ) , but what does your Qur'an say about whether or not the words of Allah can be changed ?
U : Um , you got me again .
C : Well the Qur'an actually says that the words of Allah cannot be changed ( Surah 6:34 , 6:115 ** ) , so how do you reconcile the fact that the Qur'an teaches that the Bible is the words of Allah , and that the words of Allah can not be changed with your claim that the Bible has been changed ?
( The point is that if the Qur'an is true , the Bible is true , and BECAUSE the Bible is true , the Qur'an is false ) .
U : Okay , good point , you have deconverted me from Islam , I have just become a Pastafarian and now believe that the Flying Spaghetti Monster is my god .
C : Just to be clear , are you telling me that atheism cannot justify knowledge and that is why you are jumping from alleged deity to alleged deity .
U : Yup , I 'm a Pastafarian , refute my god .
C : What do you know about this god of yours and how do you know it ?
U : He revealed it to me while I was standing in my closet by reaching down with his noodly appendage and implanting this knowledge into my head .
C : Well if I wanted to debate personal arbitrary revelations , I would go to the local asylum , as that is not at all like my claim .
I offer an objective revelation for anyone to examine , but if you wish to claim that as your justification for knowledge , I would ask you to please speak into the microphone and tell the world what it takes to deny the God of Scripture .

* Surah 6:114 " ... Those unto whom
We gave the Scripture [ the Taurat ( Torah ) and the Injeel ( Gospel ) ] know that it is revealed from your Lord in truth ... "
** Surah 6:34 " And none can alter the words of Allah "
Surah 6:115
" And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice .
None can change His Words .
And He is the All - Hearer , the All - Knower . "
See also Deuteronomy 13:1 - 5 and 18.20 which basically make it clear that if someone comes saying they have a revelation from God that the way to test the truth of this is whether or not it agrees with what has already been revealed - if it contradicts the revealed Word of God in the Bible then that revelation is not from God .
When BYD first debuted its wares at Detroit last year , its display was in the basement .
But this year , benefiting from the fact that other companies have downsized their displays and Nissan and Suzuki withdrew from the show entirely , BYD was given a spot on the main floor , nestled between GM , Ford , Mazda , Subaru , and Brilliance , the other Chinese automaker at this year ’s show .
Zhou and his colleagues arrived here on January 1 , and for the next several days toured twenty car dealerships in the Detroit area , learning about American sales techniques and service plans for the U.S. market .
Compared with the delicate balancing act that America ’s beleaguered automakers must perform at the show — acknowledging past missteps while projecting confidence about their viability and capacity to innovate — BYD ’s task is relatively simple : get a foot in the door and offer a glimpse of products to come .
But BYD still has much to learn from its competitors and their polished displays .
When I stopped by , the all - electric e6 , the jewel of BYD ’s fleet , had no signs or information screens describing the car ’s features , and the doors were locked , so visitors could n’t climb inside .
Most people were drawn instead to the F0 , a tiny red four - door that gets 56 mpg on a three - cycle engine , and costs just $ 6,000 .
Never mind that the F0 wo n’t even be available in America .
Visitors clustered around it , intrigued by the site of an authentic Chinese car , snapping pictures of each other at the wheel .
What ’s more , because Chinese manufacturers are better known for making cheap products than for green , technologically advanced ones , many visitors were clearly skeptical about BYD ’s quality .
A few visitors seemed determined to expose shortcomings .
Zhou showed me where one person had manhandled and broken one of the cars ’ rear windshield wipers .
Another had opened and slammed a door of the F0 sedan over and over , perhaps testing its strength .
“ I can understand the reason , but so many times ? ! ”
Zhou asked .
“ Maybe ten is okay , but 20 ? ”
Two men originally from Hong Kong who had driven down from Toronto , snickered just out of Zhou ’s earshot as they ran their hands across the interior and rapped their knuckles against the dashboard and console .
“ Every car company starts off crappy , ” one of them , Patrick Lui , commented .
( Indeed .
Hyundai , once dismissed for the same reasons , won top honors this year , with its Genesis luxury sedan named the show ’s car of the year . )
But Lui conceded that BYD has already made demonstrable progress : “ In a year ’s time , they ’ve made amazing strides .
Last year , it was like a plastic model glued together . ”
“ They just have to come up with their own style instead of copying from everybody else , ” said Lui ’s friend , Andy Lee .
“ They are the first company to introduce a fully electric car , ” Liu pointed out .
“ We ’ll see how that goes , see if it does n’t burn up , burst into flames . ”
I remember a time when I would threaten a person for not respecting our flag and loving our country .
" Love it or leave it , " I used to say ; " these colors do n't run " was another one .
I loved my country and thought it loved me back .
I was gung - ho all the way .
I thought there was no greater occupation than to fight and defend one 's country .
Hell , my dad did it , and his before him .
I would often boast how there had been a Gaddy in every war since the American Revolution .
I hoped to have the opportunity to defend my country in a war , like my dad , my uncle , and both my grandfathers
I attended and graduated from Virginia Military Institute , still believed in defending America , and was commissioned into the U.S. Army .
I wanted to be the best soldier and patriot I could be .
9 -11 happened and I was fired up , ready to go seek revenge for what had been done to my country and its people .
I ridiculed the plastic patriots that were suddenly waving the flag and yelling , " America is # 1 , " because I had been doing it for years .
I believed my government and its multitude of lies when it ordered me and others , to protect freedom , and spread it to the oppressed people in the Middle East .
The army was the army ; it had its faults , but I was going to fight America 's enemy and I was ready , even excited .
So , in October of 2004 , I was deployed to Iraq ; Northern Iraq to be exact , a nice little vacation spot named , Tal Afar .
I did n't find the enemy of America there ; I found regular people who were just trying to be free and out from under the new oppression that we placed on them as a conquering army .
I did n't find crowds of cheering people thanking me for their freedom ; I found hell ; a place where death and destruction awaited the freedom - creating US Army around every corner .
Being a student of history , the longer I was there , the more I began to feel very Roman , killing and conquering all in the name of Caesar Bush and the empire called America .
I watched as my commander committed war crime after war crime , shooting civilians and calling it victory in battle .
He would place whole neighborhoods and villages in my detention facility for months ; flex cuffed , thrown into old dirty bunkers , constantly interrogated , denied medications , and kept from their families .
His reason for this action that created more enemies than it eliminated : he wanted to , and was sure his actions would be called heroic and would earn him accolades and promotions .
Most soldiers on his staff were too worried about their careers to call him on his criminal actions ; those who did were relieved of command and called cowards or " gone over to the other side . "
I watched as he was promoted and his commanders praised him , completely ignoring his war crimes .
I too , did things that I am not proud of , things I must live with every day .
I began to find it impossible to justify what I was participating in , I refused the awards and decorations that were offered , for that is not what I saw the heroes of my youth do for their country .
That 's not what my country told me I would be doing , that 's not how defenders of freedom and democracy are supposed to conduct themselves , at least not the ones they told us about in school .
I was supposed to bring freedom and democracy to the oppressed and defend my country from her enemies , not put innocent people under the boot .
I found myself , and my country , being the oppressor of freedom , not the liberator as we claimed .
I believed the honest people of America would hate me and call for my arrest if they knew what was going on , but , I came home and they thanked me and bought me a beer .
They said , " good job , " " We hope you killed a lot of those SOBs for what they did . "
What they did was nothing ; I was more a terrorist than any Iraqi I meet on the street or in battle .
The only difference was I had a state sponsor .
I came home , my body and mind damaged , not as bad as some , but damaged just the same .
I looked for help , but there was none .
When I told my superiors , including my Chaplain , how I felt about the war , they tried to get me out as quickly as possible so I would not become a " bullet " on the general morning SITREP , and a statistic that would hurt the war effort .
I have gone to the VA repeatedly , but have not gotten any help .
They gave me drugs , told me nothing was wrong with me .
They told me to just stop bitching and that I should be grateful I get free healthcare .
Officially ,
The VA told me there was nothing wrong with me that I was not in combat , because I did n't have the 10 - cent badge I had refused .
A badge I refused because the army , in attempts to make people feel better about the crimes they had committed , handed them out like candy .
I have been continually told nothing is wrong with me , despite the fact their own physicians were treating me for PTSD and had diagnosed me as having classic symptoms .
Granted , the VA 's kind of treatment is to drug you out of your mind and put you on such an emotional roller coaster that you ’re better off without that kind of treatment .
Hell , I am a walking drugstore thanks to the VA ; I 've got uppers , downers and all - a- rounder's .
I am lucky I have the job I struggle to maintain everyday because of the insurance .
I struggle to feel normal again , trying to fix the damage to my body and mind that was broken in a country I should have never been in .
Recently , I have discovered what my dad warned me about many years ago was true : my country does not care about me ; I am just a warm body that once used , they can throw away and forget .
All those pseudo - patriotic Christian warmongers want to give me for my emotional nightmares and guilt is a beer and a thank you .
So wave your damn flag and feel good about yourself when you say thank you to a vet .
Go ahead , buy him a beer and congratulate him on his personal body count .
I say this : do n't thank us for what we did , because if you knew what we really did in your name , you would not thank us and buy us a beer .
Help us , because the country you so blindly support will not , and for God 's sake do not support sending more of our youth into that hell .
Their blood , and the blood of the innocent they kill is on your hands !

SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) -- A Utah Senate committee has approved a bill that would hide the preparation of alcoholic drinks behind 10 - foot - high walls in restaurants and make it illegal to appear drunk .
Sen . John Valentine , R - Orem , says Senate Bill 187 is intended to eliminate anything resembling a bar in restaurants .
His measure also would redefine what it means to be intoxicated in Utah , gutting a Utah Supreme Court ruling that said simply being a drunk is not a crime .
Under Valentine 's bill , it would be illegal for anyone to look like they are drunk .
The bill passed unanimously on Friday .
It will now be debated on the Senate floor .

Siegelman believes
Rove will never testify truthfully Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Monday February 23 , 2009
Print This Email This Former Alabama Democratic Governor Don Siegelman is trying to get answers as to why he was targeted for prosecution by the Department of Justice .
In an exclusive interview with Raw Story , Siegelman expresses his concerns about the negotiations taking place between former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove and Congress over Roves failure to appear before the US House Judiciary Committee and testify about Siegelmans case .
Rove has denied any involvement in Siegelmans prosecution and has offered to testify to Congress about the matter but has failed to appear when subpoenaed .
Rove received a third subpoena on February 13 relating to Siegelman and his alleged involvement in the firing of US Attorneys , and is scheduled to appear today .
The House Judiciary Committee , the White House and Rove are said to be in negotiations .
Siegelman believes that the topic of these negotiations is Rove 's demand for immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony .
He does not believe that Rove would risk showing up and testifying under oath and answer truthfully without immunity .
 Rove will never show up under oath and answer truthfully , " Siegelman said .
" He ca n't because he is guilty as sin . 
 He should ultimately go to jail for contempt , for perjury or for his abuse of power ,  the ex-governor added .
 He must not be granted immunity .
Giving him immunity will just ensure that he will not tell the whole truth . 
Siegelman believes , too , that Rove still has loyalists in the Justice Department looking after his interests .
 Rove has followers , just like Rove was a follower of Don Segretti in the Nixon White House ,  noted the former governor .
Rove 's attorney , Robert Luskin , vehemently denies that his client was involved in the prosecution of Siegelman .
 Rove is already on the record regarding the Siegelman allegations  they are wholly without merit  and he would obviously like to put this to rest ,  he told Raw Story earlier this month .
He added ,  We 're continuing to engage in constructive discussions with the committee " over Rove 's testimony , " and I 'd hesitate to speculate about what form Rove 's cooperation might ultimately take . 
Background The Democratic governor of Alabama from 1999 to 2003 , Siegelman became a Department of Justice target shortly after George W. Bush became president in 2001 .
The person leading the Justice Department investigation of Siegelman , starting in 2001 , was Bush 's newly - appointed US Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama , Leura Canary .
During the 2002 gubernatorial election , Canarys husband , Bill Canary , became a campaign advisor for Siegelman 's opponent .
Rove and Bill Canary had worked for many years together running judicial campaigns in Alabama .
In 2007 , a Republican opposition researcher for the Riley 2002 gubernatorial campaign came forward with startling allegations .
The whistleblower , Dana Jill Simpson , alleged that during a 2002 telephone conversation among Bill Canary , Governor Rileys son Rob , and Riley campaign aides , Canary had said that  Rove had spoken with the Department of Justice about pursuing 
Siegelman and had also advised Riley 's staff not to worry about Don Siegelman because his girls  would take care of the governor .
The girls  Bill Canary allegedly referenced were his wife , US Attorney Leura Canary , and Alice Martin , another 2001 Bush appointee who was the US Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama .
Simpson testified about these allegations under oath in front of the House Judiciary Committee in 2007 .
In 2004 , Martin and her office brought bribery charges against Siegelman and several others .
The judge on the case threw out all of the charges for lack of evidence and held an Assistant US Attorney in Martins office and others in contempt of court .
In 2005 , however , Canary charged Siegelman with 32 counts of bribery and other alleged crimes relating to the bribery of public officials .
Despite allegations of jury tampering , the judge 's ties to Rove and Bill Canary , Siegelman was convicted on seven of the 32 counts .
He was sentenced to seven years in prison and denied bond while he appealed his case .
After questions surfaced about his prosecution , Siegelman was released on appeal in April 2008 .
Interview Larisa Alexandrovna : Governor Siegelman , we have seen the back and forth between Congress and Karl Rove for quite some time now .
Adding to that , the White House has now gotten involved in asking for Rove and Congress to reach an agreement on Rove testifying in front of the House Judiciary Committee .
What do you make of the recent developments and do you see hope in your case ?
Don Siegelman : I do n't think [ Attorney General ] Eric Holder has control over DOJ yet .
Do n't forget Rove had eight long years to get his people in place .
The DOJ has been part of the problem and has been responsible for much of the cover up and delays in the Judiciary 's attempt to get to the truth .
LA : What do you mean by his people ?
DS : Rove has followers , just like Rove was a follower of Don Segretti in the Nixon White House .
Rove has his admirers , young Federalist Society want - to - bes , people who have done and who will do his bidding in his absence .
LA : What compromise do you think Rove is seeking ?
I have heard rumors of immunity in exchange for his testimony or he wont show up at all .
DS : Rove will never show up under oath and answer truthfully .
He can't because his is guilty as sin .
He should ultimately go to jail for contempt , for perjury or for his abuse of power .
He must not be granted immunity .
Giving him immunity will just ensure that he will not tell the whole truth .
LA : Wait , are you saying that you know he is seeking immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony ?
DS : Of course Rove is seeking immunity !
That 's why he has a good criminal lawyer negotiating for him .
LA : What do you make of Roves attorney Robert Luskins statement that with regard to you and your case , his client wont seek Fifth Amendment privileges ?
DS : Rove will never testify under oath about my case .
He will try to get immunity , not show up , lie or take the Fifth .
LA : Have you considered a civil suit ?
DS : I just want the truth to be told .
I will keep fighting to restore justice in this country and to preserve our American democracy .
It must start with the truth and holding accountable those who abused their power for political purposes .
LA : Yes , but what if Congress continues to hold no one accountable .
Then what ?
What I am saying is , do you see a civil suit as a viable alternative for getting at the truth ?
DS : A viable civil suit would need to come after Congress forces discovery of documents and testimony .
LA : Lets talk about the concept of Executive Privilege .
You are an attorney and perhaps I do not fully understand this concept , so I am interested on your take .
Rove is being asked to provide testimony about conversations with officials in the Department of Justice , and others , some not even in government about your case and other alleged political prosecutions and US Attorney firings .
My understanding is that Executive Privilege relates only to conversations with the President and only under certain conditions .
Is my understanding accurate ?
DS : The US Supreme Court was clear .
Executive Privilege does not protect anyone from a Congressional investigation of a crime and secondly it covers military and diplomatic secrets ; it covers matters where the president of the United States is involved .
It does not cover or protect the kinds of abuse that Congress is investigating .
LA : Then if the law is clear , then what is there to negotiate and why is Rove simply able to blow off a subpoena ?
If I were subpoenaed , I would have to show .
If you dont show , you get arrested .
I dont understand why there need to be negotiations .
Is it because they want his testimony and can only get it if they negotiate ?
DS : [ Yes , simply ]
Rove is seeking immunity [ from prosecution ] .
LA : Do you have faith in the new Attorney General , Eric Holder ?
What about in the new White House counsel ?
DS : I have faith in the people .
If the heat stays hot , the right actions will follow from the DOJ and the White House .
We must keep the pressure on .
LA : What do you feel are the implications if Obama fails to act ?
DS : President Obama is a good man , a smart man .
He knows what is at stake .
We must restore justice and take steps to preserve our democracy before we can safely move forward .
LA : What do you feel he can do directly that would help restore justice , as you see it ?
DS : Attorney General Holder needs just to be the good people 's lawyer that he is : order his subordinates to cooperate with Congress and stop the stonewalling that was done under Bush , Rove , and [ former Attorney General , Alberto ] Gonzales .
Turn over documents and offer DOJ employees to House Judiciary Chairman Conyers for questioning .
LA : You allege that you were the victim of a series of break - ins during the period in which you were being investigated .
Others in similar cases have told me similar stories .
There is the fire , arson , that destroyed the home of the whistleblower in your case .
Have you been approached by anyone , agency that is , who is actively investigating this ?
DS : Surely you did n't expect the FBI working under Bush and Gonzales ' appointed US Attorneys to investigate anything that might connect the dots between here and Washington ?
LA : No one has even approached you to ask about it ?
DS : No [ they have not ] .
The FBI has been tainted by this scandal .
They have an internal mess to clean up .
President Obama and Attorney General Holder need to make it clear that they expect the agency to get its house in order .
There are some who need to be disciplined .
Some crimes were ignored while Democrats were pursued ruthlessly , without regard to constitutional safeguards .
LA : What do you want Congressman Conyers to specifically ask Rove about under oath ?
About which people and relationships ?
DS : His relationship with Bill Canary , [ US Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama ] Leura Canary , [ US Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama ] Alice Martin , [ Republican Senator from Alabama ] Jeff Sessions , [ Republican Senator from Alabama ] Richard Shelby , Judge Mark Fuller , former Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor , [ former chief of the public integrity section of DOJ ] Noel Hillman .
LA : Why do you think Conyers is not calling Bill Canary , Leura Canary , and others in to testify , given that they would be far easier to get into deposition as they have no claims of any sort of privilege .
Would n't that be easier and put pressure on Rove to have to appear ?
DS : Well I believe in John Conyers .
I believe he is determined to get at the truth .
I do hope that others who were in Rove 's chain of command will be called to testify .
LA : Let me ask you about another case that is similar to yours .
In Mississippi , prominent Democratic trial lawyer and fundraiser Paul Minor was also convicted of seemingly trumped - up bribery charges .
Why do you think the media , which has at least given you some coverage , will not mention the other cases ?
DS : I think it is just too much for people to believe that this nation would be involved in stealing elections , going to war under false pretenses , using torture and illegal wiretaps to get information or that the DOJ would be used as a political weapon to win elections .
People just do n't want to believe those things about the country that they love .
LA : Do you think we need to pass laws , as we did after Nixons abuses of power , that would deal with these types of alleged abuses ?
DS : Yes , after we investigate the crimes .
LA : Do you think the Congressional Democrats have failed you , the rule of law , and so forth ?
DS : I have been uplifted by the spotlight of the national media and Congress 's investigation .
It 's time for the Republicans to stop being part of the problem , stop protecting Rove , and time for them to step up and work with John Conyers in his effort to get at the truth .
LA : Finally , I wanted to ask what if there is an issue between you and Alabama Congressman Artur Davis ?
He seems to be pulling back from supporting you .
( Davis recently left the House Judiciary Committee and told NPR journalist Gwen Ifill for her new book that Siegelman 's case will fade from view by next year ) .
If he is , do you know why ?
DS : I thank Congressman Davis for all he has done for me and for trying to get at the truth .
Congressman Davis is embarking on a very arduous journey and one that will require his full attention .
He is trying to make sure that he can do the job he was elected to do and make sure that he gives this upcoming race for Governor his best shot .
LA : In other words , he has to distance himself from this scandal , no matter how justified he thinks you are in seeking justice for what was done to you ?
DS : No , I think he just wants to stay focused on his immediate goal of winning as governor .
LA : Governor , one more question .
What is the status of your appeal with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ?
DS : Waiting on their ruling .
LA : Thank you for your time .

A few days ago , Time Magazine cashed in on the buzz around Detroit with a series of photos they called " The Remains of Detroit . "
While the images they portrayed were honest , they were not entirely fair .
Painting a portrait of an entire city from a dozen pictures does n't really do justice to either the rot of the city , or the renaissance .
We 're not here to preach about how Detroit as a city gets a bad rap or defend it from its warts , but if anyone wants to see what happens when an economy goes sour and competition shut plants down , we 're happy to give you an honest look .
Over the years there have been myriad auto plants rising to power only to be wiped from the map when misfortune falls upon them .
These hulking assemblages of glass and brick stand as a testament to the wills of men driven to greatness , and what happens when they , or their companies , are not continually vigilant of their profits or their contemporaries .
What follows is only a slice of Detroit , so take it as it is .

The Fisher brothers started life as carriage makers and eventually became body suppliers for Buick and Cadillac .
Their Fisher Body Plant 21 was in service between 1919 and 1974 and was closed shortly after the brothers died .
It was used by other companies but never built another car part .
The build stands now in a largely abandoned state , a single security guard watches over the back of the plant as it's slowly being taken apart .

The modestly - sized Hudson plant was originally home to the Aerocar company ( no not that Aerocar ) and was opened to produce Hudsons beginning in 1909 .
For the next three years Hudsons of the time were built there , but then in 1912 production was moved to a much bigger and more modern plant at Connor and Jefferson streets , which was demolished in 1961 .
The plant is currently a warehouse as far as we can tell and not vacant .

The Piquette plant was the first home of the Ford Model T and can be considered the birth place of the Ford Motor Company as we know it today .
Completef in 1904 and tiny by modern standards , the small plant measures only 400 by 56 feet with three floors , but was successful enough to outgrow its capacity in only nine years .
The plant is today kept as something of a museum to itself by the Detroit Historical Society .

If Ford was born at the Piquette plant , it grew up at the Highland Park plant .
When demand for the Model T exceeded the capacity of the old plant , Henry Ford and architect Albert Khan developed an all new type of plant built from reinforced concrete with many floors and large windows .
This was also the site of the first moving assembly line in an automobile plant and could crank out a Model T every 24 seconds .
Automobile production would move to the River Rouge Complex in 1917 where production continues to this day .
The Highland Park plant was last used in the 70's for the production of Ford tractors and is largely vacant currently .

Perhaps the most spectacular ruins in the entire city , the Packard Plant rests just off interstate 94 on the east side .
Of the empty factories , it is perhaps the saddest , having once been a seat of innovation and produced the finest cars money could buy .
The nearly mile long facility has long been quiet , serving as warehouse space for a while , and a destination for urban exploration , but recently security has been pulled , the once mighty facade was auctioned to the highest bidder , and the factory has been given up to the looters and the scrappers .

Sample Chapter from " Ruby Best Practices "
From : Gregory Brown < gregory.t. brown@ a . m
Date : Thu , 26 Feb 2009 10:23:22 +0900
== The short story Hi folks , I bugged O'Reilly to let me release a sample chapter of my book , and they let me .
So you can now directly download a PDF copy of my " Mastering the Dynamic Toolkit " chapter without having to go through any hoops :
http://cachefly.oreilly.com/catalogs/Mastering_the_Dynamic_Toolkit.pdf ==
For a little background on RBP :
This book is aimed mostly at people with a decent technical grasp of Ruby but not a ton of practical experience .
The goal is to show how to attack Ruby problems in the way that a seasoned Rubyist might .
Though it might not be suitable for raw beginners , intermediate Ruby programmers should be able to learn a lot from the book , and strong Ruby programmers should * enjoy * it .
I 've put together a great internal review team to help me make sure I reach this goal , and we also have Rough Cuts set up for general feedback . ==
For a little background on this chapter
In the PDF I linked above , you 'll find all sorts of meta - programming and DSL goodness , if not by name .
I try to emphasize how much these ' voodoo ' like features can be treated like ordinary Ruby code if you take some care to do things well .
I chose this chapter to release because it 's my favorite .
Most of the other chapters in the book follow the same general format , though .
That means if you like this one , you 'll probably enjoy the others as welll .
==
Please help me improve the book !
I still have a few weeks to make revisions , so whether you plan on buying the book or not , feel free to offer some feedback .
I 've also made an agreement with O'Reilly to allow me to release the book under a creative commons license 9 months after publication .
If after reading the chapter you decide you want to see the whole thing and offer some suggestion before it goes to print , please buy a rough cut : http://rubybestpractices.com
If you want to know exactly what 's in the book , you can check out this blog post : http://blog.majesticseacreature.com/archives/2009.02/whats_in_rbp.html
Anyway , I 'll spam the list only twice more , when the book reaches content completeness ( in a few weeks ) , and when it goes to print ( hopefully in June ) .
I hope you enjoy it !

To paraphrase the leader of a well - known open source software project : " Software is evolution , not intelligent design " .
The existence of several similar solutions to the same problem is not necessarily bad , it allows for in - depth exploration of a problem - space and means that users can use a solution that 's most to their liking .
I know I 've personally ( for what I considered to be good reasons ) chosen Template : : Toolkit over HTML :: Mason and vice versa for different projects .
And just look how many attempts ( some by very well - respected authors ) there were to devise a better object system for Perl 5 until one finally emerged that seems to be best - fit for most people .
This is not to say that your goal of collaboration is not a laudable one !
Of course the ( free software | Perl ) ?
world would be a better place if more people put their ego aside and tried to work together rather than being king of their own castle .
I just wanted to point out that TIMTOWDI is a good thing in it 's own right .
< pet rant > The one thing that does occasionally bug me about CPAN is the fact that module namespace is equivalent to functionality .
Thus , if I 'm the first person to think of writing Foo : : Frobnicate I will always remain the author of the authoritative module on the subject .
Even if the frobnicator incarnate later comes along to write his own ( much better ) module , he 'll have to call it Foo : : Frobnicate : : Better or something equally stupid .
I hope the Perl 6 people manage to better separate this ( even though I haste to admit that I have absolutely no bloody idea what a " better " way could be ) .</ pr>
All dogma is stupid .
The existence of several similar solutions to the same problem is not necessarily bad , it allows for in - depth exploration of a problem - space and means that users can use a solution that 's most to their liking .
- I count that as one of the , mentioned by me , ' technical reasons ' :)
But when reading that , I just had that thought that it is actually more breadth - first exploration - while forcing to collaborate on one solution would be depth - first exploration .
This is rather abstract to discuss without a concrete example , but you need to have breadth and depth both , do n't you ?
Having x modules all do the same task with different interfaces will shake out the " most preferred " over time or it will result in multiple interfaces existing to suit different types of people .
Again , collaboration is good , and for these modules to eventually use the same " engine " under the hood could be a good thing .
Even though that model of development ( create differing solutions and then try to cobble them together ) appears to be ass - backwards and more work , it seems to work pretty well .
All dogma is stupid .
Seriously , I do n't see Moose emerging as " the one best fit for most people " more than the Inside - Out fad , that Moose supplanted .
Which just serves to emphasise my point , it is a good thing that multiple solutions exist :-) .
From what I 've seen , many people looking for a " more modern " Perl OO system seem to settle on Moose these days , and it seems to be getting to the stage where s/many / most / .
But if you think there 's a better alternative out there ( out of interest , which would that be , btw ? ) , then clearly it is a good thing that these alternatives exist .
All dogma is stupid .
And just look how many attempts ( some by very well - respected authors ) there were to devise a better object system for Perl 5 until one finally emerged that seems to be best - fit for most people .
Considering I 've yet to encounter some non-CPAN code ( that is , code that actually runs solving some companies problem instead of just having the potential of doing so ) that actually uses Moose , I 'm not quite convinced about the " best - fit for most people " part .
What I do know is that Moose will get out of fashion and will be replaced by another system .
Considering
I 've yet to encounter some non-CPAN code ( that is , code that actually runs solving some companies problem instead of just having the potential of doing so ) that actually uses Moose , I 'm not quite convinced about the " best - fit for most people " part .
I am the author of Moose so obviously I will be biased , but we have about 7 - 8 major production systems at $ work that use Moose extensively to solve real world problems for some very large companies .
Best Practical ( RT , SVK , etc ) uses Moose / Mouse in there new SD project and some of the Hiveminder API modules .
Shadowcat Systems ( of Catalyst / DBIx :: Class fame ) has deployed systems using Moose .
I know that Moose is being used at ValueClick , IMDB , Yahoo ! and Symatec to name a few .
In short , just cause you have n't encountered it does not mean that it is not out there , because in fact it is very much out there .
This is not to say that it is the " best fit for most people " , even I wo n't agree with that statement .
What I do know is that Moose will get out of fashion and will be replaced by another system .
s/ Moose /$anything_technical/g
In case you have n't noticed we work in a very " fashion " driven industry , this is just how it works .
If you asked yourself that question before making all your technology choices ( and weighted it heavily ) then you would still be writing code with assembler on wire wrapped boards .

. <-- data point without Moose Moose is used in the project at work ( BBC ) .
And , I just came back from a London . pm tech meet where the topic of the talks was ...
Moose .
So statistically , Moose is used in 2/3 of all data points in this post .
That should tell you something ( what exactly is unclear though ) .

Like some alluded to above , I * like * competing packages .
So I do n't think too many projects should be mooshed together at all , but that was n't your real point .
This was -
So here is my idea , istead of trying to steer each other 's project into our goals let 's try to find some sub projects of common goals to collaborate on .
That 's a really good idea and it's interesting to note that the jQuery kit just did exactly this .
They broke out their selector engine as a separate piece -- called sizzle - - for any and all to use or improve .
Now finding ways to break out Perl projects the same way ...
That 's a trick .
I have felt that parts of Cat 's engines , like HTTP :: Body , should really be folded back into the HTTP :: Request space .
Hmmmmm ....
The presence of multiple solutions and approaches is n't competition .
It is a good and necessary thing .
As much as we might dream of finding “ it ” and then perfecting it ... the target is constantly changing .
Think about it : what 's in your pocket ?
Is it still a world of web - pages ?
Not really ... and for that matter , neither is the web .
Only this process has a ghost of a chance ( and a track - record ... ) of keeping up .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Renowned investor George Soros said on Friday the world financial system has effectively disintegrated , adding that there is yet no prospect of a near - term resolution to the crisis .
Soros said the turbulence is actually more severe than during the Great Depression , comparing the current situation to the demise of the Soviet Union .
He said the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September marked a turning point in the functioning of the market system .
“ We witnessed the collapse of the financial system , ” Soros said at a Columbia University dinner .
“ It was placed on life support , and it ’s still on life support .
There ’s no sign that we are anywhere near a bottom . ”
His comments echoed those made earlier at the same conference by Paul Volcker , a former Federal Reserve chairman who is now a top adviser to President Barack Obama .
Volcker said industrial production around the world was declining even more rapidly than in the United States , which is itself under severe strain .
“ I do n’t remember any time , maybe even in the Great Depression , when things went down quite so fast , quite so uniformly around the world , ” Volcker said .

G reen - haired protesters in the streets of Seattle were ridiculed for their belief that the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , and the world 's finance ministers enter into secret agreements to impoverish developing nations .
Here , in fact , is one such agreement : Argentina 's " Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report " from June 2001 .
This document , nominally produced by the World Bank , represents the interlocking directives of both the Bank and the IMF , as well as , indirectly , the wishes of both institutions ' largest patron , the United States Treasury Department .
Marked " Confidential " or " Official Use Only , " these reports are seldom publicized to the citizenry bound up in their stipulations .
And yet for the 100 - plus that rely on IMF and World Bank loans - countries such as Argentina , Tanzania , Ecuador , Sierra Leone - such agreements serve as de facto legislation , meticulous in detail and ideological in thrust .
Although couched as loan conditions or as helpful development advice , these reports more closely resemble the minutes of a financial coup d'etat ....
To reduce its deficit per IMF decree , Argentina had cut $ 3 billion from government spending - a cut that was necessary , the authors note here , to " accomodat[e ] the increase in interest obligations . "
These obligations , the report did not need to add , were largely to foreign creditors , including the IMF and World Bank themselves .
Since 1994 , in fact , Argentina 's budget deficits had been entirely attributable to interest payments on foreign loans .
Excluding such payments , spending had remained constant at 19 percent of GDP .
Despite the visible harm caused by cuts , the new plan ordered more .
This , the report promised , would " greatly improve the outlook for the remainder of 2001 and 2002 , with growth expected to recover in the later half of 2001 . "
The Bank was slightly off the mark .
By December 2001 , Buenos Aires ' middle class , unaccustomed to hunting the streets for garbage to eat , joined the poor in mass demonstrations .
How had Argentina arrived at such an impasse ?
In the 1990s the nation was the poster child for globalization , having followed without question the IMF and World Bank program .
The " reform " plan for Argentina , as for every nation , has four steps .
The first of these , capital market liberalization , was achieved by 1991's " Convertibility Plan , " which pegged the Argentine peso in a one - to - one relationship with the U.S. dollar .
This peg was designed both to keep inflation low and to make deficit spending difficult , in hopes of attracting and comforting foreign investors .
Liberalized markets free capital to flow in and out across borders .
But once Argentina 's economy began to wobble , money simply flowed out ....
The second step in the IMF / World Bank regimen is privatization .
Both at the urging of lenders and out of financial necessity , Argentina throughout the nineties sold off what Argentines now ruefully call " las joyas de mi abuela , " grandmother 's jewels : the state 's oil , gas , water , and electric companies and the state banks .
It was quite a fire sale .
Vivendi of France won rural water systems ; Enron of Texas the pipes of Buenos Aires ; Fleet of Boston took the provincial banks ....
In 1994 , at the World Bank 's urging , Argentina partially privatized even its social security system , diverting much of it into private accounts .
The U.S. - based Center for Economic and Policy Research calculated the revenue loss from this decision alone to be almost equal to the nation 's budget deficit during the period .
The third prong of the laissez - faire putsch is market - based pricing .
In Argentina , the main target of this initiative has been labor , that most inflexible of commodities .
" A major advance was made to eliminate outdated labor contracts , " states this report , noting approvingly that " labor costs " ( i.e. , wages ) had fallen due to " labor market flexibility induced by the de facto liberalization of the market via increased informality . "
Translation : workers who lost unionized jobs were forced into ad hoc arrangements , with far less protection .
Here , the report asks the government to decentralize collective bargaining , a move that would reduce union power ?.
Far from achieving this goal of " unemployment in single digits , " the World Bank and IMF saw the jobless figure in the Buenos Aires area rise from 17 percent to a staggering 22 percent in the year after the report 's issuance .
The violence and looting that rocked that rocked the city in December 2001 thus represents a stage in the " austerity " process that Stiglitz terms the " IMF riot . "
When a nation , he said , " is down and out , [ the IMF ] takes advantage and squeezes the last pound of blood out of them .
They turn up the heat until , finally , the whole cauldron blows up . " ....
Step four of the IMF / World Bank program is free trade .
The loan terms of the two institutions had required Argentina to accept " an open trade policy . "
As recession set in , Argentina 's exporters - whose products were effectively priced , via the peg , in U.S. dollars - were forced into a spectacularly unequal competition against Brazilian goods priced in that nation 's devalued currency .
Argentina grows a special kind of long - grain rice favored by Brazilians , and yet even as Brazil faced a hunger crisis tons of rice went unsold ....
Before 1980 , when the World Bank and IMF set out to rearrange the economies of developing nations , nearly all of them adhered to Keynesianism or socialism .
Following the " import - substitution model , " they build locally owned industry through government investment , behind a protective wall of tariffs and capital controls .
In those supposed economic dark ages , spanning roughly from 1960 to 1980 , per-capita in - come grew by 73 percent in Latin America and by 34 percent in Africa .
By comparison , since 1980 , Latin American income growth has slowed to a virtual halt - to less than 6 percent over twenty years - while African incomes have declined by 23 percent .
The IMF itself , in a statement accompanying its April 2000 " World Economic Outlook " report , noted that " in recent decades , too many countries , and nearly one - fifth of the world population , have regressed ?
This is arguably one of the greatest economic failures of the 20th Century . "
On this , at least , the IMF had it right .
A team at Rice University has determined that a strip of graphite only 10 atoms thick can serve as the basic element in a new type of memory , making massive amounts of storage available for computers , handheld media players , cell phones and cameras .
In new research available online in Nature Materials , Rice professor James Tour and postdoctoral researchers Yubao Li and Alexander Sinitskii describe a solid - state device that takes advantage of the conducting properties of graphene .
Tour said such a device would have many advantages over today 's state - of - the - art flash memory and other new technologies .
Graphene memory would increase the amount of storage in a two - dimensional array by a factor of five , he said , as individual bits could be made smaller than 10 nanometers , compared to the 45 - nanometer circuitry in today 's flash memory chips .
The new switches can be controlled by two terminals instead of three , as in current chips .
Two - terminal capability makes three - dimensional memory practical as graphene arrays can be stacked , multiplying a chip 's capacity with every layer , said Tour , Rice 's Chao Professor of Chemistry as well as a professor of mechanical engineering and materials science and of computer science .
Being essentially a mechanical device , such chips will consume virtually no power while keeping data intact – much the same way today 's e-book readers keep the image of a page visible even when the power is off .
What distinguishes graphene from other next - generation memories is the on - off power ratio – the amount of juice a circuit holds when it's on , as opposed to off .
" It 's huge — a million - to - one , " said Tour .
" Phase change memory , the other thing the industry is considering , runs at 10 - to - 1 .
That means the ' off ' state holds , say , one - tenth the amount of electrical current than the ' on ' state . "
Current tends to leak from an " off " that 's holding a charge .
" That means in a 10 - by - 10 grid , 10 ' offs ' would leak enough to look like they were ' on . '
With our method , it would take a million ' offs ' in a line to look like ' on , ' '' he said .
" So this is big .
It allows us to make a much larger array . "
While generating little heat itself , graphene memory seems impervious to a wide temperature range , having been tested from minus 75 to more than 200 degrees Celsius with no discernable effect , Tour said .
That allows graphene memory to work in close proximity to hot processors .
Better still , tests show it to be impervious to radiation , making it suitable for extreme environments .
Tour said the new switches are faster than his lab 's current testing systems can measure .
And they 're robust .
" We 've tested it in the lab 20,000 times with no degradation , " said Tour .
" Its lifetime is going to be huge , much better than flash memory . "
Best of all , the raw material is far from exotic .
Graphene is a form of carbon .
In a clump it 's called graphite , which you spread on paper every time you use a pencil .
The technology has drawn serious interest from industry , said Tour , who 's working on manufacturing techniques .
He said it 's possible to deposit a layer of graphene on silicon or another substrate by chemical vapor deposition .
" Typically , graphene is very hard to think about fabricating commercially , " he said , " but this can be done very easily by deposition .
The same types of processes used right now can be used to grow this type of graphene in place . "

( CNN ) -- Islamist militants took almost full control of Mogadishu on Thursday , less than 24 hours after Ethiopian troops withdrew from Somalia 's capital , a witness reported .
Ethipian troops invaded Somalia in 2006 .
The Ethiopian forces pulled out their last remaining bases in the city late Wednesday after two years propping up Somalia 's transitional government .
Forces from different Islamist groups -- including the hard - line al - Shabab , which the United States has designated a terror organization -- immediately seized every base the Ethiopians abandoned .
" The city is almost under Islamist rule , " said a local journalist who did not want his name revealed .
" You can hear different names of the Islamist groups taking control in many parts of the city . "
The journalist said the militants were in " full force " in most of Mogadishu .
However , they had yet to claim control of the city 's seaport , the presidential palace and a major junction on the south side .
Ethiopia invaded Somalia in December 2006 to install a U.N. - backed transitional government in Mogadishu after a decade and a half of near - anarchy .
The invasion had the blessing of the United States , which accused the Islamic Courts Union that captured Mogadishu earlier that year of harboring fugitives from al Qaeda .
The Islamists responded with a guerrilla campaign against government and Ethiopian troops .
Efforts to replace the Ethiopians with an African Union - led peacekeeping mission faltered as the violence worsened , and heavy fighting in Mogadishu and other cities drove hundreds of thousands from their homes .
Do n't Miss Ethiopian troops begin Somali withdrawal
The lawlessness also spilled onto the seas off the Horn of Africa , where international vessels are routinely hijacked by suspected Somali pirates who demand large ransoms .
And the transitional government was wracked by a power struggle between Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein and President Abdullahi Yusuf , who resigned in December .
Hussein said Thursday that he would run for president now that Ethiopian troops had gone .
Ahmed attempted to fire Hussein for being ineffective .
But Hussein said the president did not have that power , and the vast majority of members of parliament backed Hussein in a vote of confidence .

T opping Stephen Harper 's to - do list is a small job with huge implications .
He must insert the word " north " into the U.S. protectionist phrase : Buy American .
Buy North American is more than a slogan or even a do n't - beggar - your neighbour plea .
It defines shared economic space and is a declaration of common interests .
Most of all , it suggests an effective way forward for a U.S. president who must first cope with the domestic employment crisis if he is to advance an inspiring global agenda .
What it can't be is a whiny Canadian protest against legislation now speeding through Congress .
Wrong - headed and as flagrant a breach of trade pacts as the law would be , Canada 's best course is to be a problem - solving partner , not an aggrieved supplicant .
That strategy – smart , not spineless – accepts two realities .
America is commendably single - minded in protecting its hegemony .
Canada is dependent on a trade deal with a dispute resolution so slow and vulnerable to special interests that winning is a distant mirage .
Faced with those truths , Ottawa can get mad or find ways to pull even .
It can yammer about linking oil exports to U.S. market access or it can be as creative as it was after 9/11 in finding mutually beneficial responses to communal threats .
In this case , Canada has a good case .
Building trade barriers is a feel - good reflex that would slow U.S. recovery and hurt Americans .
When economies are integrated , determining what 's made where is a slow , high - cost , low - return exercise .
It will inflate prices for consumers , infrastructure projects and taxpayers .
It will put at risk the estimated 7 million U.S. jobs dependent on Canadian trade .
Those compelling arguments are supported by a reassuring principle .
Economic growth has the infinite quality of parental love :
It does n't decrease with division ; it expands with multiplication .
How that works is theoretical .
But the opposite practice has been tested often enough , most notably in the Depression , to make the assumption that prosperity is n't a zero sum game where one country must lose for another to gain .
Canada is now perfectly positioned to take advantage of that accumulated experience .
Barack Obama 's first foreign trip , a one - day whistle - stop scheduled for Feb. 19 , is an opportunity to rise to an occasion .
Instead of defending the cross - border status quo , Canada should be promoting how much more the Three Amigos can achieve together by fulfilling NAFTA 's promise as a trading bloc .
That would mean talking more about a continental perimeter than American protectionism .
It would recognize that the U.S. is worried more about imports from China and India than Canada .
Best of all , it would identify this country as an active supporter , as well as a potential beneficiary , of Obama 's overarching objective of leading his country out of the recession greener , smarter and more competitive .
Harper 's capacity to command the magnanimous heights of open trade policy is only enhanced by the position now being proselytized by some captains of U.S. industry .
As well as accepting that there 's no unscrambling of the continental trade egg , they accurately forecast American protectionism will lead only to destructive tit - for - tat global parochialism .
The Prime Minister need only agree .
When they meet , Harper can , and should , tell the president that there 's nothing whatever wrong with buying American as long as America is North America and that Canada is inside , not outside , the U.S. trade tent .

Reviewers have often beat around the Bush in describing , or failing to describe , the body part . [...]
The AP reports that CIA Director - nominee Leon Panetta has stated categorically that there will be no prosecutions for torturers .
Asked by The Associated Press if that was official policy , Panetta said , " That is the case . "
It was the clearest statement yet on what Panetta and other Democratic officials had only strongly suggested : CIA officers who acted on legal orders from the Bush administration would not be held responsible for those policies .
On Thursday , he told senators that the Obama administration had no intention of seeking prosecutions for that reason .
Panetta , in an interview with the AP after a second day of confirmation hearings with the Senate Intelligence Committee , said that he arrived at that conclusion even before he began meeting with CIA officials .
" It was my opinion we just can't operate if people feel even if they are following the legal opinions of the Justice Department " they could be in danger of prosecution , he said .
Panetta demurred on saying whether the Obama administration would take legal action against those who authorized or wrote the legal opinions that , for a time , set an extremely high legal bar for an action to constitute torture .
" I 'll leave that for others , " Panetta said .
... Panetta formally retracted a statement he made Thursday that the Bush administration transferred prisoners for the purpose of torture .
" I am not aware of the validity of those claims , " he said .
As I 've written before - and Scott Horton in particular has done a great job in pointing to the correct legal precedents for - being told torture and other war crimes were legally justified ( especially when they cannot be ) is no excuse .
International law which was in part established by American prosecutors and judges at Nuremberg is that it is up to each individual to act his conscience and to bear the consequences of so doing .
Worse , not prosecuting the torturers sets up a malicious feedback that fatally undermines prosecutions for ordering torture .
If there 's no prosecution for commission of a crime , how can someone be prosecuted for ordering what is apparently admitted is n't a crime ?
No defense lawyer is going to pass up such a gift argument and the Obama administration knows it .
Not prosecuting those who tortured is a " get out of jail free card " not only for the torturers but for those who ordered torture and those who falsely said torture could ever be legal .
It 's a travesty of justice and one that Chris Dodd has sadly admitted Democratic leaders have looked the other way on for purely political reasons .
And with the news that Panetta wants to reserve the possibility of using " enhanced interrogation " techniques which go beyond the US military code - which in turn is simply a retelling of the Geneva Conventions and binding treaties on torture - along with the Obama administration 's complicity in shielding Bush officials from revelations of torture ... well , my Newshoggers colleague Jay McDonough is correct .
" We cannot , despite assurances otherwise , trust our government not to render and torture detainees . "

RICHARD WAGNER in his remarkable centennial essay on Beethoven acknowledges his great indebtedness to the pessimistic philosopher Schopenhauer for his fundamental ideas on music .
Indeed , the philosopher 's influence on the master is apparent all through the nine volumes of Wagner 's literary works , and in the music dramas we find the philosophic relation of music to the other arts worked out into a new and immortal art .
So not only to comprehend Wagner , the man , author , and composer , but also to understand the meaning of " the music of the future " and to gain a greater inspiration from the chamber music and symphonies of the older masters we should be familiar with these suggestive cullings from Schopenhauer 's art chapters in " Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung . "
We must recall the " truth which lies at the foundation of all that " Schopenhauer has " hitherto said about art , " viz : " That the object of art , the representation of which is the aim of the artist , and the knowledge of which must therefore precede his work as its germ and source , is the Idea in Plato 's sense , and never anything else ; not the particular thing , the object of common apprehension , and not the concept , the object of rational thought and of science . "
Beginning his consideration of the fine arts with architecture , whose peculiar end was the objectification of the lower grades of the visibility of the will ( 1 ) in its conflict with gravity and rigidity , Schopenhauer now comes to the highest art of music for whose unique position there has hitherto been no fitting place in the systematic [ 363 ] connection of his exposition .
Music " stands alone , quite cut off from all the other arts . "
What can it be in this great and exceedingly noble art by which it affects the inmost nature of man so powerfully and is so entirely and deeply understood by him in his secretest consciousness ?
After giving himself up entirely to these impressions of all forms of music , which are usually left here as insolvable in their mystery , Schopenhauer then returned to reflection and an explanation of the nature of the imitative relation of music to the rest of the world .
The independence of music and the secret of its influence he found in the explanation that in music we do not recognize the copy or repetition of any Idea of existence in the world .
" Music is thus by no means like the other arts , the copy of the Ideas , but the copy of the will itself , whose objectivity these Ideas are .
This is why the effect of music is much more powerful and penetrating than that of the other arts , for they speak only of shadows , but it speaks of the thing itself . "
Thus is explained the phenomenalism and individualism of the lesser arts as contrasted with the universality of music .
" Music does not express this or that particular and definite joy , this or that sorrow , or pain , or horror , or delight , or merriment , or peace of mind ; but joy , sorrow , pain , horror , delight , merriment , peace of mind themselves , to a certain extent in the abstract , their essential nature , without accessories , and therefore without their motives .
Yet we completely understand them in this extracted quintescence .
Hence it arises that our imagination is so easily excited by music , and now seeks to give form to that invisible yet actively moved spirit world which speaks to us directly , and to clothe it with flesh and blood , i. e. to embody it in an analogous example .
This is the origin of the song with words , and finally of the opera , the text of which should therefore never forsake that subordinate position in order to make itself the chief thing and the music the mere means of expressing it , which is a great misconception and a piece of utter perversity ; for music always expresses only the quintescence of life and its events , and never these themselves , and therefore their differences do not always affect it .
It is precisely this universality , which belongs exclusively to it , together with the greatest determinateness , [ 364 ] that gives music the high worth which it has as the panacea for all our woes .
Thus if music is too closely united to words , and tries to form itself according to the events , it is striving to speak a language which is not its own . "
" The words are and remain for music a foreign addition , of subordinate value , for the effect of the tones is incomparably more powerful , more infallible , and quicker than that of words .
Therefore if words become incorporated in music , they must yet assume an entirely subordinate position , and adapt themselves completely to it .
But , " and here we trace the beginnings of Wagner 's music dramas , " the relation appears reversed in the case of the given poetry , thus the song or the libretto of an opera to which music is adapted .
For the art of music at once shows in these its power and higher fitness , disclosing the most profound , ultimate , and secret significance of the feelings expressed in the words or action of the opera , giving utterance to their peculiar and true nature and teaching us the inmost soul of the actions and events whose mere clothing and body is set before us on the stage .
With regard to this superiority of the music , and also because it stands to the libretto and the action in the relation of the universal to the particular , of the rule to the example , it might perhaps appear more fitting that the libretto should be written for the music than that the music should be composed for the libretto .
However , in the customary method , the words and the action of the libretto lead the composer to the affections of the will which lie at their foundation , and call up in him the feelings to be expressed ; they act , therefore , as a means of exciting his musical imagination .
Moreover , that the addition of poetry to music is so welcome to us , and a song with intelligible words gives us such deep satisfaction , depends upon the fact that our most direct and most indirect ways of knowing are called into play at once and in connection .
The most direct is that for which music expresses the emotions of the will itself , and the most indirect that of the conceptions denoted by words .
Where the language of the feelings is in question the reason does not willingly sit entirely idle .
Music is certainly able with the means at its own disposal to express every movement of the will , every feeling ; but by the addition of words we [ 365 ] receive besides this the objects of these feelings , the motives which occasion them .
The music of an opera , as it is presented in the score , has a complete independence , separate , and , as it were , abstract existence for itself , to which the incidents and persons of the piece are foreign , and which follow its own unchanging rules ; therefore it can produce its full effect without the libretto .
But this music since it was composed with reference to the drama , is , as it were , the soul of the latter ; for , in its connection with the incidents , persons , and words , it becomes the expression of the finer significance of all those incidents and of their ultimate and secret necessity which depends upon this significance ......
If now we cast a glance at purely instrumental music , a symphony of Beethoven presents to us the greatest confusion , which yet has the most perfect order at its foundation , the most vehement conflict , which is transformed the next moment into the most beautiful concord .
It is rerum concordia discors , a true and perfect picture of the nature of the world which rolls on in the boundless maze of innumerable forms , and through constant destruction , supports itself .
But in this symphony all human passions and emotions also find utterance ; joy , sorrow , love , hatred , terror , hope , etc. , in innumerable degrees , yet all , as it were , only in abstracto , and without any particularization ; it is the mere form without the substance , like a spirit world without matter .
Certainly we have a tendency to realize them while we listen , to clothe them in imagination with flesh and bones , and to see in them scenes of life and nature on every hand .
Yet , taken generally , this is not required for their comprehension , or enjoyment , but rather imparts to them a foreign and arbitrary addition ; therefore it is better to apprehend them in their immediacy and purity . "
" According to all this we may regard the phenomenal world , or nature , and music as two different expressions of the same thing " — will , the fundamental world - stuff , expressing itself as nature indirectly and indistinctly as through Platonic Ideas , but immediately and subtilely in music as will - in - itself .
" Music , therefore , if regarded as an expression of the world , is in the highest degree a universal language , which is related indeed to the universality of concepts , much as they are related [ 366 ] to the particular things .
Its universality , however , is by no means that empty universality of abstraction , but quite of a different kind , and is united with thorough and distinct definiteness .
In this respect it resembles geometrical figures and numbers , which are the universal forms of all possible objects of experience and applicable to them all à priori , and yet are not abstract but perceptible and thoroughly determined .
All possible efforts , excitements , and manifestations of will , all that goes on in the heart of man and that reason includes in the wide negative concept of feeling , may be expressed by the infinite number of possible melodies , but always in the universal , in the mere form , without the material , always according to the thing - in - itself , not the phenomenon ; the inmost soul , as it were , of the phenomenon , without the body .
This deep relation which music has to the true nature of all things also explains the fact that suitable music played to any scene , action , event , or surrounding seems to disclose to us its most secret meaning , and appears as the most accurate and distinct commentary upon it .
This is so truly the case , that whoever gives himself up entirely to the impressions of a symphony , seems to see all the possible events of the world take place in himself , yet if he neglects , he can find no likeness between the music and the things that passed before his mind .
For as we have said , music is distinguished from the other arts by the fact that it is not a copy of the phenomenon , or , more accurately , the adequate objectification of the will , but is the direct copy of the will itself , and therefore exhibits itself as the metaphysical to everything physical in the world , and as the thing - in - itself to every phenomenon .
We might , therefore , just as well call the world embodied music as embodied will ; and this is the reason why music makes every picture , and indeed every scene of real life and of the world , at once appear with higher significance , certainly all the more as the melody is analogous to the inner spirit of the given phenomenon .
It rests upon this that we are able to set a poem to music as a song , or a perceptible representation , as a pantomime , or both as an opera .
Such particular pictures of human life , set to the universal language of music , are never bound to it or correspond to it with stringent necessity ; but they stand to it only in the relation [ 367 ] of an example chosen at will to a general concept .
In the determinateness of the real , they represent that which music expresses in the universality of mere form , for melodies are to a considerable extent , like general concepts , an abstraction from the actual .
This actual world , then , the world of particular things , affords the object of perception , the special and individual , the particular case , both to the universality of the concepts and to the universality of the melodies .
But these two universalities are in a certain respect opposed to each other ; for the concepts contain particulars only as the first forms abstracted from perception , as it were , the separated shell of things .
This relation may be very well expressed in the language of the schoolmen by saying that concepts are the universalia post rem , but music gives the universalia ante rem , and the real world the universalia in re . "
" The unutterable depth of all music by which it floats through our consciousness as the vision of a paradise firmly believed in yet ever distant from us , and by which also it is so fully understood and yet is so inexpressible , rests on the fact that it restores to us all the emotions of our inmost nature , but entirely without reality and far removed from their pain .
So also the seriousness which is essential to it , which excludes the absurd from its direct and peculiar province , is to be explained by the fact that its object is not the Idea , with reference to which alone deception and absurdity are possible ; but its object is directly the will , and this is essentially the most serious of all things , for it is that on which all depends . "
The kinship of music and philosophy Schopenhauer shows strikingly after reminding us again that he has " been trying to bring out clearly that music expresses in a perfectly universal language , in a homogeneous material , mere tones , and with the greatest determinateness and truth , the inner nature , the in - itself of the world , which we think under the concept will , because will is its most direct manifestation .
Further , according to my view and contention , philosophy is nothing but a complete and accurate repetition or expression of the nature of the world in very general concepts , for only in such is it possible to get a view of that whole nature which will everywhere be adequate and applicable .
Thus whoever [ 368 ] has followed me and entered into my mode of thought will not think it so very paradoxical if I say , that supposing it were possible to give a perfectly accurate , complete explanation of music , extending even to particulars , that is to say , a detailed repetition in concepts of what it expresses , this would also be a sufficient repetition and explanation of the world in concepts , or at least entirely parallel to such an explanation , and thus it would be a true philosophy .

The counterterrorism programme followed by the UK and US undermines the law , a report by judges and lawyers has said .
The independent International Commission of Jurists ( ICJ ) also concluded most of the measures were counterproductive .
The report highlights how many countries with poor human rights record now point to UK and US anti-terror plans as justification for their actions .
It also describes the pre-September 11th 2001 system as adequate to deal with the current terrorist threat , and calls for the justice system to be strengthened .
Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Edward Davey said : " This is damning testament to just how much liberty has been ineffectually sacrificed in the ' war on terror ' .
" Britain cannot afford to become further isolated in terms of its international reputation .
The Government must heed the advice of these eminent jurists and come clean now . "
Among the policy areas subject to criticism are control orders , weak diplomatic assurances in relation to deportations and pre-charge detention .
The Home Office responded to the report by reiterating the level of terrorist threat against the UK .
" We recognise clearly our obligations to protect the public from terrorist atrocities whilst upholding our firm commitment to human rights and civil liberties , " a spokesperson said .
" Our policies strike that balance , with new legislation facing rigorous scrutiny through external consultation and in parliament as well as being subject to the Human Rights Act , which the UK government enacted . "
But Arthur Chaskelson , chairman of the panel , said : " In the course of this inquiry , we have been shocked by the extent of the damage done over the past seven years by excessive or abusive counter - terrorism measures in a wide range of countries around the world .
" Many governments , ignoring the lessons of history , have allowed themselves to be rushed into hasty responses to terrorism that have undermined cherished values and violated human rights .
" The result is a serious threat to the integrity of the international human rights legal framework . "
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Juliana Redding was 21 , an aspiring actress and model who , like so many others before her , had moved from Arizona to southern California in pursuit of the Hollywood dream .
She wound up the victim in a real life murder mystery -- one few people are willing to talk about in any detail .
Juliana Redding , an aspiring model and actress , was found murdered in her Santa Monica apartment .
By the age of 18 , Redding had earned her first film credit , appearing in a 2005 independent film called " Kathy T Gives Good Hoover , " about college students and the graffiti culture .
In 2006 , she moved into a one - bedroom apartment in Santa Monica , California , with her pet Yorkshire terrier .
She was also taking college courses while working part - time in a trendy Venice Beach bar .
Friends grew worried in March when they could n't reach Redding for a few days .
They called her mother in Redding 's hometown of Tucson , Arizona .
Her mother called the Santa Monica police .
Watch why this case is so baffling »
Police found Redding dead inside her apartment .
" The manner of death is homicide , " said Sgt. Rinaldi Thruston of the Santa Monica Police Department .
Although there are unconfirmed reports that the cause of death was blunt force trauma , the Los Angeles County Coroner 's Office denies that .
" Those media reports are not accurate .
The cause of death was not blunt force trauma .

Police also would not disclose whether a weapon was used or whether Redding 's apartment had been broken into , which would give clues as to whether she knew her assailant and opened the door for him or her .
Thruston also refused to say whether Redding had been sexually assaulted .
" We have made no arrests in this case nor do we have any suspects or persons of interest at this time , " Thruston said .
He said police have collected evidence from the crime scene that could link a potential suspect to the crime .
Police are hoping they will continue to get tips and leads from the public .
According to friends , Redding had been dating another actor for two years and they had broken up about six months before her slaying , but remained friends .
It is unclear whether she had a new boyfriend , but police have been interviewing all of Redding 's known friends and neighbors .
" We believe the police are doing what they can to solve this case , but we really prefer no media attention , " her mother said .
Early in the investigation , there were reports of blood found on the sidewalk or wall outside Redding 's apartment .
Police will not comment on the forensic results of that blood or any specific evidence at the crime scene .
They also will not reveal whether any of Redding 's neighbors heard screams or other sounds of a struggle .
At this point , there are more questions than answers .
If anyone has any information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for Juliana Redding 's death , please call the Santa Monica Police Department tip line at ( 310 ) 458-8449 .

Internet scoundrels have begun abusing Google code hosting projects to distribute malware and promote smut .
The assault follows a bout of the same kind of abuse against Microsoft 's comparable MSN Spaces beta site dating back a year , net security firm McAfee reports .
Misuse of Google code is much more recent and something that intensified over the festive season , McAfee researcher Chris Barton writes .
In a blog posting on Wednesday , Barton explains how " new projects " on Google code offering illicit thrills redirect users to fake codec download sites and mucky video havens .
" The difference between this and the MSN Spaces abuse that now about a year old is that Google appears to automatically index code projects , " Barton explains .
Barton , who points to an incident of continued abuse on MSN Spaces beta ( specially a rogue " project " that links to a penis pill site ) , hopes Google is more proactive in cleaning up its act .
He offers a few preliminary suggestions on how the problem might be nipped in the bud , or at least mitigated against .
" I trust Google would like to appear less evil and will take more decisive action .
I ’d suggest mashing code and safe browsing together but it appears not to find anything wrong with the clickable links , though it did catch on after some redirection took place . " ®
Washington , DC Last September , the Law Project for Psychiatric Rights filed what is sure to become a landmark case against the State of Alaska aimed at stopping the over - prescribing of psychiatric drugs to children covered by public health care programs in that state .
" The massive over - drugging of America 's youth is an unfolding national horror , " says attorney Jim Gottstein , the leader of the Law Project .
The lawsuit seeks an injunction to stop Alaska from authorizing or paying for psychotropic drugs prescribed to children in foster care or children covered by Medicaid " without safeguards being in place to make sure proper decision making occurs .
" Specifically , the complaint is asking for a court order prohibiting the State from giving or paying for these drugs unless and until : ( i ) evidence - based psychosocial interventions have been exhausted , ( ii ) rationally anticipated benefits of psychotropic drug treatment outweigh the risks , ( iii ) the person or entity authorizing administration of the drug(s ) is fully informed , and ( iv ) close monitoring of , and appropriate means of responding to , treatment emergent effects are in place .
"
The corrupt influence of the pharmaceutical industry in illegally promoting much of this drugging has been well established , " Mr Gottstein says , " yet the state continues to inflict great harm on the children it has taken away from their families by giving them these drugs . "
" It is absurd to think all these children have a mental illness , " he adds .
" They are being drugged because they are upset and bothering people ... because decisions to administer medication to children are not made by the children themselves , the administration of psychotropic drugs is involuntary .
" Under the Alaska Constitution , he says , involuntary administration of such drugs infringes upon fundamental rights and the state must have a compelling state interest in doing so .
They must be in the best interest of the children and there must be no less intrusive alternatives , the lawsuit notes .
Governor Sarah Palin is named as a defendant in the lawsuit because she is ultimately responsible for the protection of children as Governor of Alaska .
" I doubt anyone on the Governor 's staff has even let her know about the problem despite my trying to bring it to her attention ever since she took office , " Mr Gottstein notes .
In fact , as far back as March 14 , 2007 , he emailed Governor Palin about children in custody in other states dying from the administration of psychotropic drugs , and stated : " The massive over - drugging of America 's children and youth is a titanic health catastrophe caused by the government 's failure to protect its most precious citizens , who rely on the adults in their lives to shield them from harm , not inflict it upon them .
Perhaps the worst of all is the State inflicting this harm on children and youth it has taken from their homes " for their own good .
" Mr Gottstein concluded by asking her to , " Please correct this situation . "
On February 4 , 2008 , he wrote to Governor Palin again , in hopes of avoiding a lawsuit , and sent copies to the Attorney General and others , conveying scientific evidence regarding the harm being done by the over - prescribing of psychotropic drugs to children , and stated in part : " Children and youth are virtually always forced to take these drugs because , with rare exception , it is not their choice .
PsychRights believes the children and youth , themselves , have the legal right to not be subject to such harmful treatment at the hands of the State of Alaska .
" We are therefore evaluating what legal remedies might be available to them .
However , instead of going down that route , it would be my great preference to be able to work together to solve this problem .
It is for this reason that I am reaching out to you again on this issue . " " Fewer than ten percent of psychotropic drugs are FDA - approved for any psychiatric use in children and youth , " the lawsuit alleges .
In the February 2009 New York Review , former New England Journal of Medicine editor and Senior Lecturer in Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School , Dr Marcia Angell , wrote : " Although it is illegal to promote drugs for use in children if the FDA has not approved them for that use , the law is frequently circumvented by disguising marketing as education or research .
Eli Lilly recently agreed to pay $ 1.4 billion to settle civil and criminal charges of marketing the anti-psychotic drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the FDA ( known as " off- label " uses ) .
Zyprexa , which has serious side effects , is one of the drugs frequently used off - label to treat children diagnosed with bipolar disorder .
" She went on to state : " Unlike migraines or shyness , hypertension or high cholesterol can be defined by an objective measurement — a blood pressure or cholesterol level .
One can dispute the threshold chosen as abnormal , but the measurement is easily verifiable .
The fact that psychiatric conditions are not objectively verifiable underscores the necessity for both diagnosis and treatment to be as impartial as possible .
That is why conflicts of interest are more serious in this field than in most others .
" Mr Gottstein 's complaint lays out the evidence of harm to children caused by psychiatric drugs as documented by a program titled , " Critical Risk Rx , A Critical Curriculum on Psychotropic Medications , " designed by a team led by Dr David Cohen , a Professor at Florida International University .
The purpose of the " Critical Think Rx " program is to promote critical thinking skills about psychiatric medication issues related to the authorization of the administration of psychotropic drugs to young patients .
The program was developed under a grant from the Attorneys General Consumer and Prescriber Grant Program through the multi-state settlement with Pfizer of consumer fraud claims regarding the off - label promotion of Neurontin , one of the anti-seizure drugs marketed as a mood stabilizer .
Critical Think Rx is funded at the Florida International University , and is the only project targeting non-medically trained professionals in child welfare and mental health .
All investigators and consultants involved in the program have agreed to forego pharmaceutical industry funding for the duration of the project in order to maintain complete independence .
The " best practices " recommended in the lawsuit were assembled by the Critical Think team and have been proven effective , Mr Gottstein advises .

There is also the issue of what a country becomes when it loses its ability to question power , views military values as the highest ideals , ignores international law , and becomes indifferent to the suffering of the most innocent and defenseless …. we are witnessing a crime against humanity for which indifference and silence makes one deeply complicit with the killing and disappearance of young children .
Gaza reminds us that the “ dark times ” that haunted Arendt ’s generation can now be seen in the images of wounded and dead children and should serve as a desperate reminder of what it means when politics , social responsibility , and justice , as the lifeblood of democracy , become cold and indifferent in the face of death .

There ’s a clear chill in the air .
And it ’s not just coming from the deep freeze of winter that ’s descended on us .
It ’s coming from the targeted silencing of many people world - wide concerned about human rights violations — myself included — who have dared to speak out against the Israeli state ’s military offensive against the people of Gaza .
Opposing and targeting the policies of the Israeli state is not opposing and targeting Jews .
Neither is criticizing Israel synonymous with challenging Israel ’s existence .
Yet , criticize the State of Israel and face individually targeted and unprecedented criticism , threats and personal attacks — tantamount to a new form of McCarthyism .

More than twenty years ago we in the United Nations took the lead from civil society when we agreed that sanctions were required to provide a nonviolent means of pressuring South Africa to end its violations .
Today , perhaps we in the United Nations should consider following the lead of a new generation of civil society , who are calling for a similar non-violent campaign of boycott , divestment and sanctions to pressure Israel to end its violations .

Occupied Minds
A university , in a democracy .
A dome of silence , an absence of criticism .
I have to wonder how institutions that boast of enhancing and developing individuals ’ capacities for citizenship , for appreciation of diversity , and sensitivity to humanity , can so quickly turn a cold face to genocide .
Something is seriously wrong , and it ’s not just Israel , it ’s us .
That is , it has been us , all of us , until recent years .
There has been a growing movement of academics across the U.K. and North America to begin to take the only action available , in an international system that is heavily skewed in favour of a handful of powers , where double standards , false promises , and empty charters prevail .
We have to take action , because no one else will .
First , the British Association of University Teachers ( AUT ) voted to boycott Haifa and Bar - Ilan Universities in April , 2005 , and repealed the boycott a month later ( link ) , but the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education ( NATFHE ) continued to seek an academic boycott up to a year later .
Then , also in the U.K. , on 16 January 2009 , over 200 academics , musicians , writers and artists signed a petition that expressed outrage against Israel and called not just for a ceasefire , but for a boycott , divestment , and sanctions .
There was no ambiguity nor ambivalence in the statement , it was direct and unequivocal :
The massacres in Gaza are the latest phase of a war that Israel has been waging against the people of Palestine for more than 60 years … .
The goal of this war has never changed : to use overwhelming military power to eradicate the Palestinians as a political force , one capable of resisting Israel ’s ongoing appropriation of their land and resources .
Israel ’s war against the Palestinians has turned Gaza and the West Bank into a pair of gigantic political prisons .
There is nothing symmetrical about this war in terms of principles , tactics or consequences .
Israel is responsible for launching and intensifying it , and for ending the most recent lull in hostilities .
Among the names of scholars that I recognized are internationally prominent and respected ones such as Ernesto Laclau , Etienne Balibar , Eric Hobsbawm , Slavoj Zizek , Paul Gilroy , and John Hutnyk ; anthropologists such as David Graeber , Alexander King , and Martha Mundy ; and Caribbeanists such as Diana Paton and Paul Sutton .
They were among those who expressly took sides in this conflict , specifically the side of the people of Gaza :
Israel must lose … .
If we believe in the principle of democratic self - determination , if we affirm the right to resist military aggression and colonial occupation , then we are obliged to take sides … against Israel , and with the people of Gaza and the West Bank … .
We must do what we can to stop Israel from winning its war .
Student actions , protests , and petitions for boycotts against Israel are to be found even in the United States ( source ) .
While we have spoken of universities being “ occupied ” in protest here on this blog , whether in Greece , New York , or across the U.K. , I think that we are making a mistake in speaking in terms of occupation .
Occupation , annexing territory , monopolizing space , is what oppressors do .
When we “ take ” a university , we are liberating it , restoring it as a free zone , reasserting its autonomy .
We urgently need autonomy when it comes to a university system tied up with the goals of state ( not the public , except only in name ) , serving international power on the side of Israel .
It is urgent because it is abundantly clear that virtually every single point that the Israeli state has advanced as a justification for this war has been completely debunked .
Even commonly held and widespread myths have fallen to pieces , whether they be the “ human shields ” tale , or that Hamas is seeking the destruction of Israel .
Indeed , with respect to the latter , Hamas ’ leader , Ismail Haniyeh told European parliamentarians : “ Our conflict is not with the Jews ; our problem is with the occupation . ”
There is nothing outlandish , repugnant , nor unreasonable about that position , but it happens to be the kind of statement that gets buried by the Western mass media , deliberately .
Likewise , Hamas made repeated attempts to extend the truce , and accepted a two - state solution .
And likewise , Israel has continued to reject such efforts , yet boasting that it alone wants “ peace ” ( the peace of the dead , obviously . )
Liberated Minds
As academics , trained to ask questions , to think critically , to search for reasons and unearth evidence , some of us can no longer take the official justifications of the leading war states at face value , those states being the U.S. and Israel .
Some will notice that Israeli government and military spokespersons repeat a consistent doctrinaire line , regardless of masses of contrary evidence that they are made to confront , and assume that rights are only Israel’s .
In addition to dogmatic recitations of the “ facts ” as the Israeli state wishes to cast them , there is a quick embrace of any technicality that can provide cover for justifying mass slaughter .
This kind of inhumane pounding of a people , on the thinnest of pretexts , the mentality and practice of genocide , is absolutely unacceptable and repugnant when conducted in the name of “ liberal democracy ” and in the names of all us who are said to live in “ liberal democracies . ”
For those who missed some of the supporting material on which these observations rest , please read : An Unfolding Pattern of Genocide : Notes from Gaza .
This then is our fight too .
Let us now turn our attention to some of the reasons various persons and institutions have given in order to challenge the call for an academic boycott of Israel .
(1) The Academic Freedom Debate
A boycott violates our academic freedom
James L. Turk , executive director of the Canadian Association of University Teachers , said in an interview with Inside Higher Ed on 7 January 2008 that “ we do n’t see that the way to express our opposition to what a government is doing is by penalizing academics in that country . ”
Turk seems to be making two possible mistakes .
One is to say “ we ” — I also belong to CAUT , as do most of the signatories to the petition that was circulated recently among Montreal universities and colleges .
Clearly , “ we ” are divided .
Clearly ,
Turk needs to stop talking for the rest of us , before consulting the rest of us .
On the other hand , by “ we ” he may have meant the CAUT executive body , which does not necessarily solve the problem .
The second mistake comes in the form of an assumption , and that is that Israeli academics are disconnected from the state .
It seems to be a mighty step backward , in terms of all that we have learned of knowledge and power , the political economy of academia , the benefits of domination shared by those who produce knowledge for domination , and of the many binding ties between academia and the state , to suddenly agree that we can neatly separate the two .
For her part , Costanza Musu , a professor at the University of Ottawa , echoes some of the same concerns in , “ University of Ottawa professor Costanza Musu :
Why boycotting Israeli professors is wrong , ” National Post , 06 January 2009 , which in the interest of full disclosure , is Canada ’s leading right - wing newspaper .
Musu states :
“ Another immediate consequence of such a boycott is of course giving the students the false impression that Israel is a monolithic country , where dissent does not exist and debate does not include criticism of the government .
As in any democratic country , professors in Israel have differing opinions of the government ’s actions ” .
The problem with Musu ’s statement is this : we boycotted South Africa , which was even less monolithic , as it included vigorous internal opposition movements in all sectors of society .
Musu goes further , and ridicules the call for the boycott , by suggesting that the boycott call issued by the Canadian Union of Public Employees ( Ontatio ) would require visiting Israeli astrophysicists to stand before a class and deliver a political denunciation of Israel before proceeding to lecture .
While Musu lampoons one single tactic of the proposed boycott , she spares the rest of the proposed boycott actions from any criticism .
Musu emphasizes the issue of our pedagogical practices , the need to bring in speakers to her class that represent all sides , and again the issue of academic freedom .
With all due respect , this strikes me as a selfish and narrow way of thinking .
Our academic freedom , and our props for class , do not trump everything else on earth .
Academic freedom is vital , but not so paramount that it rises above the interests of human beings subject to genocidal practices .
I would rather live in a world with justice , and no concept of academic freedom , than the reverse .
Incidentally , a few days later , again in the National Post , a Jewish - Canadian professor supported the call for a boycott ( source ) .
Musu referred to CUPE ’s boycott call ( more on that to follow ) .
It must be noted that CUPE restated its position on 10 January 2009 , saying the boycott would be aimed at institutions , and not individuals , as part of the international boycott , divestment and sanctions ( BDS ) campaign :
“ In the process of examining academic boycott initiatives by other organizations around the world , and similar actions that helped end apartheid in South Africa , it has become clear that the position is not banning individuals .
Rather an academic boycott should focus on issues of investment , partnership , fundraising and joint projects , ” said Ryan .
“ That will also be our approach . ” ( source )
What about academic freedom for Palestinians ?
There is another side to academic freedom that has not been considered so far : the Palestinian side .
Dr. David Lloyd ( U.S. Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel ) told Inside Higher Ed , “ Israeli institutions are complicit in immense infringement on Palestinian academic freedom , so it ’s really hard , it seems to me , for Israeli institutions to claim the rights of academic freedom that they are so systematically denying to their Palestinian counterparts . ”
In addition , he argued : “ We feel that we should not collaborate with Israel as long as it is refusing academic freedom to Palestinians .
It is really a profoundly moral issue . ”
Lloyd also observed , “ Presidents of universities have spoken out against the boycott of Israeli academics in the past .
They are not speaking out against the systematic and gradual destruction of Palestinian institutions by Israel . ”
What does academic freedom have to do with divestment ?
There is no argument , based on academic freedom , that can be used against a university ’s divestment from companies that do business with Israel .
To divest is to merely achieve a neutral position for the university .
To invest is an active stance , and it demands direct challenge .
The question will be : do our universities in Canada , and here in Quebec , have any investments and are those companies in which they invest doing business with Israel ?
Moreover , and along the same lines , it impinges on no one ’s academic freedom to insist that the university finally begin to reject donations from private and corporate donors with an active pro-Israel agenda .
Not to do so is to compromise the neutrality of the administration , which in the case of Concordia saw the last president , Claude Lajeunesse , intervening in rare political debate , against a boycott of Israel .
He was silent on almost all other political issues , except this one .
We cannot have an administration beholden to one particular set of especially sanguine and virulent special interests .
We also have had administrations that defended invitations to Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak to speak at Concordia — many of us view these two as accomplised war criminals , whose only right to speak should be before a human rights tribunal .
It is in the defense of no one ’s academic freedom to have such figures dirty our doorstep , but it is an offense against those of us who think of the university as our home , and who worry about how we may all be represented in the wider world if our university is used to provide cover for genocidal heads of state .
We should be serving humanity , be concerned for humanity , and Concordia ought to show more sensitivity and respect for humanity if it is to be taken seriously and to be protected as an institution worth preserving in very uncertain times .
I am not even introducing here the contextual reality that American imperial and Israeli genocidal causes are vastly unpopular in Quebec , the political state in which Concordia must work , but which the senior executives in charge seem to ignore .
(2) “ Boycott me , please ! “
If my state were to engage in an open slaughter of people living on First Nations reserves , I would deeply resent foreign states and consumers backing up and supporting the government in my country .
I would want a total boycott , I would not want further propping up of an unjust situation — let me be clear : as an academic , and as a citizen of this state , I would demand that everyone overseas boycott me .
I would not want your “ solidarity . ”
I would not be giving my first and most important thoughts to selfish concerns about my career , my publishing , my research funds , my prestige , my ability to travel to conferences , etc .
I would want to be banished , so I could also manifest how vastly unpopular our country had become in the eyes of the world and that we need to do something drastic to change our situation .
I therefore do not understand , nor do I accept , the notion that out of concern for academic freedom , all other freedoms must be drowned .
Academic freedom is neither just individual , nor is it absolute and paramount .
And as with all rights , responsibilities are attached .
Instead of academic selfishness , common as it is , let us see greater academic social responsibility .
Having said that , it is very important to note that at least some Israeli academics have in fact called to be boycotted :
“ We , as Israeli citizens , raise our voices to call on EU leaders : use sanctions against Israel ’s brutal policies and join the active protests of Bolivia and Venezuela .
We appeal to the citizens of Europe : please attend to the Palestinian Human Rights Organisation ’s call , supported by more than 540 Israeli citizens ( http://www.freegaza.org/en/home/658-a-call-from-within-signed-by-israeli-citizens): boycott Israeli goods and Israeli institutions ; follow resolutions such as those made by the cities of Athens , Birmingham and Cambridge ( US ) .
This is the only road left .
Help us all , please ! ”
Along the same lines , and also contrary to the fallacy that a boycott of Israel is , somehow by its very nature “ anti-semitic , ” Naomi Klein who is herself from a Jewish family in Montreal , reported in a recent article ,
“ roughly 500 Israelis [ 540 ] , dozens of them well - known artists and scholars , sent a letter to foreign ambassadors stationed in Israel .
It calls for ‘ the adoption of immediate restrictive measures and sanctions ’ and draws a clear parallel with the anti-apartheid struggle .
‘ The boycott on South Africa was effective , but Israel is handled with kid gloves . …
This international backing must stop ’. ”
(3) On the Nature of an Academic Boycott
The Canadian Union of Public Employees ( CUPE ) in Ontario , representing teaching and research assistants , originally called for barring Israeli academics from speaking , teaching or conducting research at the province ’s universities unless they first condemned Israel ’s actions in Gaza .
The proposed boycott would not have necessarily applied to Israeli - born Canadian academics or to Israeli Arabs .
CUPE ’s boycott plan included calling on Ontario universities and university workers to :
Refuse to participate in academic cooperation , collaboration or joint projects with Israeli universities , such as participating in conferences in Israel , refereeing or editing articles for Israeli journals , or evaluating research proposals for Israeli institutions .
Advocate a boycott of Israeli universities , including suspension of all forms of funding and subsidies .
Promote divestment from Israel by Ontario academic institutions .
Work toward the condemnation of Israeli policies and actions in the occupied territories by pressing for resolutions to be adopted by academic and professional organizations and associations .
CUPE Ontario is taking this action in response to an appeal from the Palestinian Federation of Unions of University Professors and Employees .
Sid Ryan , President of the Canadian Union of Public Employees ( Ontario ) , speaking on 09 January 2009 :
The U.S. Campaign for the Academic & Cultural Boycott of Israel , launched recently , enumerated the following goals :
Refraining from participation in any form of academic and cultural cooperation , collaboration or joint projects with Israeli institutions that do not vocally oppose Israeli state policies against Palestine .
Promoting divestment and disinvestment from Israel by international academic institutions .
supporting Palestinian academic and cultural institutions directly without requiring them to partner with Israeli counterparts as an explicit or implicit condition for such support ( source ) .
The BDS project for an academic boycott , includes the following aims :
Institutionalizing a ban on cultural and academic exchanges , programmes , and visits with Israel .
Using Israeli performances , visits , and film screenings as an opportunity to highlight occupation and apartheid amongst the wider public .
Undermine the academic contribution to the Israeli economy that sustains the occupation and end all cooperation on projects used to create propaganda , know - how and weapons used to sustain the Israeli apartheid structure and to oppress and expel Palestinians .
Forging ties of cultural and academic support and solidarity with Palestinian universities and academics as well as with Palestine by artists and performers from across the world .
AAUP reactions to some proposed boycott measures
The American Association of University Professors in 2006 issued a statement opposing academic boycotts , “ in view of the Association ’s long - standing commitment to the free exchange of ideas . ”
The AAUP particularly opposes boycotts in which institutions would be boycotted unless they “ vocally oppose ” Israeli policies :
“ We especially oppose selective academic boycotts that entail an ideological litmus test … .
We understand that such selective boycotts may be intended to preserve academic exchange with those more open to the views of boycott proponents , but we cannot endorse the use of political or religious views as a test of eligibility for participation in the academic community . ”
Cary Nelson , president of the AAUP and a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , added :
“ I think it ’s inappropriate to expect institutions to take positions on a nation state ’s policy … .
How would an institution in the United States take a stand on national policy ?
Would the Faculty Senate vote , would the administration impose a policy , would the entire campus vote , would the students have an equal vote ? ”
My question is : when is there ever a boycott that does not contain an “ ideological ” test ?
In addition , universities always take positions on a nation state ’s policy , as a matter of course , as a vital function of their very existence when they depend on state funds especially .
So why is there a problem only when we take positions that are critical of a nation state ’s policy ?
I especially object to Nelson ’s absolutist view of the freedom of academic exchange .
And what about , again , South Africa ?
The AAUP noted that , in fact , “ Some individuals , publishers ( University Microfilms ) , and organizations ( the American Library Association , for example ) did engage in an academic boycott , but the AAUP limited its protests against apartheid to resolutions of condemnation and to divestment , because it was considered wiser to keep open lines of communication among scholars in accordance with principles of academic freedom . ”
Resolutions of condemnation and divestment .
Those measures were fine with the AAUP when it came to South Africa ’s apartheid regime , a regime strongly supported by Israel .
These form part of most plans for an academic boycott of Israel .
In addition , the AAUP executive makes a very difficult argument that a boycott would close lines of academic communication .
Unless the AAUP thinks that a proposed boycott is even considering the impossibility of shutting down the whole Internet , it would seem that this is a non-issue , entirely , and the concern can thus be dismissed out of hand .
The AAUP has not rejected the idea for some kind of protest action against Israel , we must note , as it stated :
Other kinds of sanctions and protests ought to be considered .
Some of them are listed in the Palestinian call we cited at the beginning of this report , such as resolutions by higher education organizations condemning violations of academic freedom whether they occur directly by state or administrative suppression of opposing points of view or indirectly by creating material conditions , such as blockades , checkpoints , and insufficient funding of Palestinian universities , that make the realization of academic freedom impossible .
These and similar actions may be more effective in obtaining better conditions for academic freedom .
But if boycotts are to be used at all , economic boycotts seem a preferable choice , both tactically and as a matter of principle .
Colleges and universities should be what they purport to be : institutions committed to the search for truth and its free expression .
Members of the academic community should feel no obligation to support or contribute to institutions that are not free or that sail under false colors , that is , claim to be free but in fact suppress freedom .
Such institutions should not be boycotted .
Rather , they should be exposed for what they are , and , wherever possible , the continued exchange of ideas should be actively encouraged .
The need is always for more academic freedom , not less .
Once more , there is an absolutist conception of academic freedom , premised on the assumption that it is a value that reigns above all others , and comes with no responsibilities .
There cannot be academic freedom of any merit in a social and political context where there is no freedom .
The essential thrust of the AAUP position is easy to discern : condemn , but do not act .
It ’s a selfish position , because if AAUP members were under physical assault , one can be sure that they would be quick to call for concrete action .
(4) Attacking Palestinian Education
The Canadian Association of University Teachers ( CAUT ) outlined the attacks on educational facilities and students in Gaza ( while proposing to take no action of its own ) :
“ On 27 December , Human Rights Watch reported that an Israeli air - to - ground missile struck a group of students leaving the Gaza Training College , adjacent to the headquarters of the UN Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) in downtown Gaza City , killing eight students and wounding 19 others .
Two days later , on 29 December 2008 , Israel bombed the Islamic University of Gaza , destroying the science laboratory block and destroying or damaging other blocks of buildings , including the library .
Although Israel has claimed that the science laboratory facilities were used as “ a research and development center for Hamas weapons , ” this claim has been denied by officials of the Islamic University , and according to the New York Times of January 1 , 2009 , Israel has not produced any evidence for its claim .
On January 3 , the Israeli air force destroyed the American International School , and , on January 6 , 30 people were killed and 55 injured when Israeli artillery shells landed outside a United Nations - run school in Gaza .
“ These latest assaults on Palestinian students and educational institutions raise renewed questions about the ongoing violation of academic rights .
Palestinian students have been frustrated in their right to study , not just in the West Bank and Gaza , but at universities abroad , as most recently demonstrated by the Israeli government ’s refusal to allow Palestinian students awarded prestigious Fulbright fellowships to leave for the United States .
University students living in Gaza have not been able to leave in order to attend universities throughout the world , let alone at Birzeit University in the West Bank .
Students in the West Bank itself have to negotiate roadblocks and checkpoints to get to their classes – often never making it . ” ( link )
Indeed , CAUT is right to say that these are only the latest actions .
Others precede them :
Israeli forces bulldozed the educational studies campus of al - Aqsa University in Gaza on 16 March 2004 .
Over 300 schools have been damaged by Occupation military attacks .
Bir Zeit university was sealed by a military checkpoint for 2 1/2 years between 2001 - 2004 .
In 2003 Hebron University and the Palestine Polytechnic University were closed for 6 and 3 months respectively .
BDS reports that many aspects of Israeli cultural life are directly linked to the occupation , expulsion and systemic discrimination of the Palestinian people .
Israeli architects and designers are engaged in the construction of settlements , roads and facilities on illegally confiscated Palestinian land .
Israeli writers and intellectuals continue to promote the myths of Zionism among a global public via their novels and essays .
In addition , BDS explains that while Palestinian culture is suppressed , Israeli academic institutions offer strategic analysis and advice to military - intelligence agencies .
Israeli scientists have developed technologies for some of the weapons used by the IDF .
Israeli academia provides material and intellectual support to the ongoing occupation and violence against Palestinian people .
At an ideological level , BDS adds , academics such as Professor Arnon Sofer of Haifa University ( who is infamous for his argument that Arab Israelis pose a ‘ demographic threat ’ to the State of Israel ) produce the research , arguments , and new leaders for the Israeli state .
Israeli universities are closely linked to the Israeli economy that supports and enables the ongoing occupation .
BDS makes an excellent point that is being forgotten or ignored by those who resist or question the call for an academic boycott of Israel :
“ Israeli academics cannot exempt themselves from boycott on the grounds of ‘ academic freedom ’ while they fail to speak up for the academic freedoms of Palestinians . ”
If academic freedom is what really mattered in this discussion , it would be made to matter for all , and not just held as the inviolable , paramount , and absolute right of a privileged few .
(5) The Need to Take Action Now
Sid Ryan of CUPE - Ontario thus seems justified in observing the double standards at work in challenging calls for a boycott of Israel .
As he stated :
“ Boycotts have traditionally been used as a non-violent way to protest what is unfair and to affect governments to change .
In the campaign to end colonial rule in India , Gandhi called for a boycott of British universities and colleges as well as all British - made goods .
The U.S. began a boycott of the Moscow 1980 summer Olympics after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan .
There has been a furor in the media during last two weeks over CUPE Ontario ’s human rights stand .
It is as though Israel is beyond reproach despite the human rights violations being perpetrated in Gaza ” ( source ) .
Ryan also noted that , “ Canada played a major role in an international boycott of South Africa .
That highly successful effort included academic , political , economic , cultural and sports boycotts .
The goal was to end apartheid ” ( source ) .
Who is doing anything ?
What else is being done ?
By whom ?
Who will take action ?
Or shall we all stand and stare , jaws dropping ever lower ?
Why does the plight of innocent civilians in Gaza not move more institutions and governments into action ?
There are many reasons of course , and one of the most important reasons is geopolitics , and the official pre-alignment with Israeli policy .
We have thus been fed intolerable idiocies , such as the “ human shields ” fallacy , and the constant refrain that “ Israel has the right to defend itself ” ( and apparently , it ’s an exclusive right , a preserve of the Israeli state alone ) .
Those who have been doing something , on the ground in Gaza , have told us , over and over , accounts that run completely contrary to the official propaganda as mentioned above .
Listen to Norwegian doctor Mads Gilbert at al - Shifa hospital in Gaza :
In the meantime , the position of the Canadian government has been to ignore such atrocities , leaving it up to citizens to take matters into their own hands .
As reported in “ Reactions in the Americas to the Israel / Palestine Conflict “ :
Canada ’s foreign affairs minister , Lawrence Cannon , also issued a statement in which he pointed to Israel ’s “ clear right to defend itself ” against continuing attacks by militants he accused of “ deliberately ” targeting civilians .
“ First and foremost , those rocket attacks must stop .
At the same time , we urge both sides to use all efforts to avoid civilian casualties and to create the conditions to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access to those in need in Gaza ” .
Cannon also urged renewed efforts to reach a truce .
Canada also blamed the Hamas for the UNRWA school incident , in which 40 civilians were killed when Israeli shells hit the school .
Canada ’s junior foreign minister Peter Kent added on Tuesday that there must be a strong , binding resolution to the conflict .
“ Canada believes there must be an immediate ceasefire , but only if it ’s durable ceasefire , and if Hamas is prevented or is willing not to rearm and resume its terrorist rocketing at some point down the road .
On January 12 , 2009 , Canada stood alone before a United Nations human rights council yesterday , the only one among 47 nations to oppose a motion condemning the Israeli military offensive in Gaza .
Thus far , over 300 Canadian academics have signed a petition to the government of Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper , calling for the implementation of sanctions against Israel ( source ) .
I might add that number was nowhere close to the maximum , as the call for signatures was not widely circulated and some of us did not hear of it until after the fact .
In addition , or own movement has started in Quebec , with a similar number of signatures .

Rat With a Teddy Bear
I mean seriously .
Not to be down on rats or anything , but I did n't realize they could be quite so outlandishly cute .
This is preposterous .
Now that we are officially in a recession , and not even a dramatic Fed rate cut can help that , it is important to take stock of your personal finances and do what you can to shore them up .
Look at your situation , and do what you need to do in order to prepare .
It ’s really all about getting back to the basics of personal finance :
In the foreseeable future , it seems , there will be two kinds of nonprofit newspapers — those which are deliberately so and those which are reluctantly so .
Ever since I left the Washington Post , in 2005 — after twenty years there that included a stint in management — and particularly since I joined the nonprofit world at the New America Foundation and started learning about the management and fund - raising issues at tax - exempt organizations , I have been mulling over this idea : that only by turning the Post into a nonprofit trust and raising a university - size endowment to support the newsroom could the paper retain the vitality it requires to serve as a successful watchdog over our constitutional system .
Now David Swensen , the chief investment officer at Yale , and Michael Schmidt , a financial analyst , have come forward with a similar argument .
Their math is the same as that which got me started on this notion .
When I left the Post ’s newsroom , a few years ago , the total cost of its news - gathering operations — salaries , benefits , and cash — was in the neighborhood of $ 120 million .
That was lean compared with the Times , which Swensen and Schmidt peg as a $ 200 - million operation today .
But it was more than enough to maintain a strong investigative - reporting staff of more than a dozen reporters , editors , and researchers , and to support richly detailed beat reporting across a range of local , national , and foreign - policy subjects .
We had about thirty staff foreign correspondents in about twenty bureaus and additional contract writers abroad .
It has been very painful to watch papers like the Post offer buyouts to dozens of talented journalists at the height of their powers while shutting overseas bureaus and even entire sections of the paper .
Not to pick on any one institution , but , from a constitutional perspective , how did we end up in a society where Williams College has ( or had , before September ) an endowment well in excess of one billion dollars , while the Washington Post , a fountainhead of Watergate and so much other skeptical and investigative reporting critical to the republic ’s health , is in jeopardy ?
I ’m sure that Williams - generated nostalgia in the emotional lives of wealthy people is hard to overestimate , but still …
Yes , the dispersal of publishing through digital technology is itself a source of constitutional renewal , and already small digital publishers are proving through their enterprise and investigative reporting that the values underlying the old models will not disappear .
Yes , my thinking is admittedly rooted in an aging generation ’s experience .
Still , there is just no substitute for the professional , civil - service - style , relentless independent thinking , reporting , and observation that developed in big newsrooms between the Second World War and whenever it was that the end began — about 2005 or so .
And those qualities arose from the scale of those newsrooms , and the way the quasi- monopoly business model and high - quality family owners shielded them from political or commercial pressure — not perfectly , but largely .
Yes , the big papers failed , as in the run-up to the Iraq war , but they succeeded much more often .
They practiced a kind of journalism that , on the whole , was better for a democratic constitutional system than any journalism ever practiced before , anywhere .
So sayeth me , at any rate .
The typical spend rate for endowed nonprofits is in the five - percent range .
If the Washington Post had a two billion dollar endowment , it would be able to fund a very healthy newsroom .
And this is before revenue from continuing operations — advertising , circulation , etc. , which could surely cover at least the cost of distribution and overhead , particularly if the form of delivery is increasingly digital .
Two billion dollars , by the way , represents something in the neighborhood of five per cent of Warren Buffett ’s net worth , the last I knew that figure .
( Buffett is a director of the Washington Post Company and one of the great public - minded businessmen of his age , although my impression is that , as someone who is so talented at making money , he is congenitally unhappy about giving it away — so he has asked his friend Bill Gates to do it for him ) .
I ’m glad that Swensen and Schmidt have put this model out there prominently in the discourse .
Obviously , this is not the best time in the world to be raising charitable funds for any cause .
What worries me on behalf of the Post is that whoever moves first in the direction that Swensen and Schmidt have suggested is going to have a big advantage — whoever is first to market will be first to a billion - dollar - plus endowment .
The families that own these papers are understandably reluctant — they are successful business families with great pride and confidence in their ability to turn things around .
At this point , my hypothesis is that the philanthropists have to move first .
Warren ?
Bill ?
You can secure the First Amendment for a generation at a time of historical transformation in national life , and in the country ’s place in the world .
If you ’ll just put up the first billion , the rest of us promise to get busy helping to raise the rest .
On Thursday , Sept. 18 , 2008 , the astonished leadership of the U.S. Congress was told in a private session by the chairman of the Federal Reserve that the American economy was in grave danger of a complete meltdown within a matter of days .
" There was literally a pause in that room where the oxygen left , " says Sen. Christopher Dodd ( D - Conn . ) .
As the housing bubble burst and trillions of dollars ' worth of toxic mortgages began to go bad in 2007 , fear spread through the massive firms that form the heart of Wall Street .
By the spring of 2008 , burdened by billions of dollars of bad mortgages , the investment bank Bear Stearns was the subject of rumors that it would soon fail .
" Rumors are such that they can just plain put you out of business , " Bear Stearns ' former CEO Alan " Ace " Greenberg tells FRONTLINE .
The company 's stock had dropped from $ 171 to $ 57 a share , and it was hours from declaring bankruptcy .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke acted .
" It was clear that this had to be contained .
There was no doubt in his mind , " says Bernanke 's colleague , economist Mark Gertler .
Bernanke , a former economics professor from Princeton , specialized in studying the Great Depression .
" He more than anybody else appreciated what would happen if it got out of control , " Gertler explains .
To stabilize the markets , Bernanke engineered a shotgun marriage between Bear Sterns and the commercial bank JPMorgan , with a promise that the federal government would use $ 30 billion to cover Bear Stearns ' questionable assets tied to toxic mortgages .
It was an unprecedented effort to stop the contagion of fear that seemed to be threatening the rest of Wall Street .
While publicly supportive of the deal , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , a former Wall Street executive with Goldman Sachs , was uncomfortable with government interference in the markets .
That summer , he issued a warning to his former colleagues not to expect future government bailouts , saying he was concerned about a legal concept known as moral hazard .
Within months , however , Paulson would witness the virtual collapse of the giant mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and preside over their takeover by the federal government .
The episode sent shockwaves through the economy as confidence in Wall Street began to evaporate .
Within days , in September 2008 , another investment bank , Lehman Brothers , was on the brink of collapse .
Once again , there were calls for Bernanke and Paulson to bail out the Wall Street giant .
But Paulson was under intense political pressure from conservative Republicans in Washington to invoke moral hazard and let the company fail .
" You had a conservative secretary of the Treasury and conservative administration .
There was right - wing criticism over Bear Stearns , " says Congressman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee .
Paulson pushed Lehman 's CEO Dick Fuld to find a buyer for his ailing company .
But no company would buy Lehman unless the government offered a deal similar to the one Bear Stearns had received .
Paulson refused , and Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy .
FRONTLINE then chronicles the disaster that followed .
Within 24 hours , the stock market crashed , and credit markets around the world froze .
" We 're no longer talking about mortgages , " says economist Gertler .
" We 're talking about car loans , loans to small businesses , commercial paper borrowing by large banks .
This is like a disease spreading . "
" I think that the secretary of the Treasury could not fully comprehend what that linkage was and the extent to which this would materialize into problems , " says former Lehman board member Henry Kaufman .
Paulson was thunderstruck .
" This is the utter nightmare of an economic policy - maker , " Nobel Prize - winning economist Paul Krugman tells FRONTLINE .
" You may have just made the decision that destroyed the world .
Absolutely terrifying moment . "
In response , Paulson and Bernanke would propose -- and Congress would eventually pass -- a $ 700 billion bailout plan .
FRONTLINE goes inside the deliberations surrounding the passage of the legislation and examines its unsuccessful implementation .
" Many Americans still do n't understand what has happened to the economy , " FRONTLINE producer / director Michael Kirk says .
" How did it all go so bad so quickly ?
Who is responsible ?
How effective has the response from Washington and Wall Street been ?
Those are the questions at the heart of Inside the Meltdown . "
You 'll never see anyone get owned as bad as these hillbilly pricks , ever .
If you have n't seen this clip , it 's the must - watch video clip of the day ... if there is a such thing .

Sony Ericsson is working on a touchscreen phone with a 12.1 - megapixel camera it announced on Sunday , but details on the upcoming Idou device was scarce .
The company did say that the Idou will come equipped with a 3.5 - inch touchscreen in the 16:9 format and a Xenon flash .
Just like when the Sony Ericsson launched the Xperia X1 , at Mobile World Congress last year , it will take many months before the Idou -- which is only the concept name , according to Sony Ericsson -- shows up in shops .
The phone will start selling during the second half of 2009 .
Keeping the momentum going from now until then will be a challenge for Sony Ericsson , according to Ben Wood , analyst at CCS Insight .
It also gives competitors like Samsung the opportunity to launch and start selling devices with similar specifications ahead of Sony Ericsson , he said .
The Idou is based on what will become the Symbian Foundation operating system ; the upcoming open source version of the Symbian operating system .
It competes with , for example , the Goggle backed Android platform .
Sony Ericsson is working on a phone based on that platform as well , but is n't ready to announce any details yet .
Closer to being in stores is the W995 Walkman , which will be available during the second quarter .
The phone comes with an 8.1 - megapixel camera , support for AGPS ( Assisted Global Positioning System ) and a bunch of music features , including a 3.5 mm audio jack .
It surfs the using either Wi-Fi or HSPA ( High - Speed Packet Access ) .
Pricing was not announced .
Many upcoming Sony Ericsson phones will , just like the W995 , combine music and camera plus also something extra -- which , for example , can be support for watching movies on the device .
To back that up Sony Ericsson is also working on a movie download service , which eventually will fall under the Play Now umbrella .
But yet again Sony Ericsson is frugal with the details .

OTTAWA – The International Monetary Fund is darkening its outlook for the Canadian and world economies , throwing into question some of the projections made by the Harper government in its budget Tuesday .
The new global outlook , released today , sees the world falling much deeper into recession than previous forecasts , but also projects a more feeble recovery than either the Bank of Canada or the budget assumes .
The IMF says Canada 's gross domestic product will shrink by 1.2 per cent this year while the world economy inches forward by only 0.5 per cent – considered a recession in global terms .
It 's the 2010 forecast for Canada where the international financial group parts company with both Finance Minister Jim Flaherty and Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney .
The IMF says Canada 's economy will begin to grow next year but at a tepid 1.6 per cent pace , barely getting the economy back to where it was last year and still in negative territory if population growth is included .
The Bank of Canada projected last week that Canada will rebound to 3.8 per cent growth in 2010 , now looking astonishingly out of step with almost every other forecaster .
Flaherty 's budget was more cautions , predicting 2.4 per cent growth in 2010 , but it 's also counting on a more springy bounce - back in future years to back his pledge to get Ottawa out of deficit in four years .
As well , Flaherty has pencilled in a rebound for commodity prices , particularly oil to US $ 64 a barrel – $ 22 more than current levels – that allows him to account for a 4.3 per cent bounce - back on nominal GDP from a 2.7 per cent contraction this year .
Nominal GDP is the value of what Canada produces and sells .
" Finance is going with a stronger GDP lift and a stronger terms of trade lift on higher commodities than seems to flow out of the IMF report , and stronger than what we would forecast too on both components , " said Scotia Capital economist Derek Holt .
" The interesting thing is the IMF has lagged behind on the most bearish views of the economy , so the potential is that there may be even more downside risks . "
Overall , the IMF says advanced economies will contract by two per cent this year , the first aggregate retreat since the Second World War .
Only the continuing growth of developing countries keeps the global economy from falling into negative territory , although they too are facing a serious downturn from average growth of 6.25 per cent last year to 3.25 per cent this year .
On oil , the IMF expects the price to average US $ 50 a barrel this year and US $ 60 in 2010 .
The price of crude traded today at US $ 41.53 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
However , the world body cautions that all of its forecasts are uncertain and are more likely to be overly rosy rather than pessimistic .

" Downside risks continue to dominate , " the IMF notes , " as the scale and scope of the current financial crisis have taken the global economy into unchartered waters . "
The IMF says the key to stopping the bleeding and returning to normalcy is solving the financial crisis and subsequent tight credit that plunged the world into recession in the first place .

There were two events recently that made me quite concerned .
First , I was looking through some of the results from the Dromaeo test suite and I noticed a bunch of zero millisecond times being returned from tests .
This was quite odd since the tests should ’ve taken , at least , a couple milliseconds to run and getting consistent times of “ 0 ” is rather infeasible , especially for non-trivial code .
Second , I was running some performance tests , on Internet Explorer , in the SlickSpeed selector test suite and noticed the result times drastically fluctuating .
When trying to figure out if changes that you ’ve made are beneficial , or not , it ’s incredibly difficult to have the times constantly shifting by 15 – 60 ms every page reload .
Both of these cases set me out to do some investigating .
All JavaScript performance - measuring tools utilize something like this to measure their results :
var start = ( new Date ) .getTime ( ) ; /*
Run a test .
*/ var diff = ( new Date ) .getTime ( ) - start ;
The exact syntax differs but the crux of the matter is that they ’re querying the Date object for the current time , in milliseconds , and finding the difference to get to total run time of the test .
There are a lot of extenuating circumstances that take place every time a piece of code is run .
There could be other things running in another thread , maybe another process is consuming more resources – whatever it is it ’s possible that the total run time of a test could fluctuate .
How much that test fluctuates is largely consistent , following somewhere along a normal distribution :
( Performance test suites like SunSpider and Dromaeo use a T - distribution to get a better picture of the distribution of the test times . )
To better understand the results I was getting I built a little tool that runs a number of tests :
Running an empty function , looping 10,000 times , querying and looping over a couple thousand divs , and finally looping over and modifying those divs .
I ran all of these tests back - t0 - back and constructed a histogram of the results .
Here ’s what the results look like for the major browsers on OS X :
The results here are terrific :
There ’s some clumping around 0 ms ( with some results spread to 1 - 4 ms – which is to be expected ) and a bunch of normal - looking distributions for each of the browsers at around 7 ms , 13ms , and 22 ms .
This is exactly what we should expect , nothing out of the ordinary taking place .
I then fired up VMware Fusion to peek at the browsers running in Windows XP :
Huh .
The results are much stranger here .
There are n’t any , immediately , pretty clumps of results .
It looks like Firefox 3 and Chrome both have a nice distribution tucked in there amongst the other results , but it is n’t completely obvious .
What would happen if we removed those two browsers to see what the distribution looked like ?
Wow .
And there it is !
Internet Explorer 8 ( I also tested 6 , for good measure , with the same results ) , Opera , Safari , and WebKit Nightly all bin their results .
There is no ‘ normal distribution ’ whatsoever .
Effectively these browsers are only updating their internal getTime representations every 15 milliseconds .
This means that if you attempt to query for an updated time it ’ll always be rounded down to the last time the timer was updated ( which , on average , will have been about 7.5 milliseconds ago ) .
I was worried that these results were from the virtual machine ( I also loaded up Parallels but saw similar results to running VMware ) so I just loaded Windows XP proper :
Nope , the results are the same as using the VM .
Let ’s think about what this means , for a moment :
Any test that takes less than 15 ms will always round down to 0ms in these browsers .
It becomes impossible to determine how much time the tests are taking with consistently zeroed out results .
The error rate for any test run in these browsers would be huge .
If you had a simple test that ran in under 15 ms the error rate would be a whopping 50 - 750 % !
You would need to have tests running for , at least , 750 ms before you could safely reduce the error overhead of the browser to 1 % .
That ’s insane , to say the least .
What test suites are affected by this ?
Nearly all of the major ones .
SunSpider , Dromaeo , and SlickSpeed are all predominantly populated by tests that ’ll be dramatically effected by the error rate presented by these browser timers .
I talked about JavaScript Benchmark Quality before and the conclusion that I came to still holds true :
The technique of measuring tests used by SunSpider , Dromaeo , and SlickSpeed does not hold .
Currently only a variation of the style utilized by Google ’s V8 Benchmark will be sufficient in reducing the error ( since the tests are only run in aggregate , running for at least 1 second – reducing the error level to less than 1 % ) .
All of this research still left me in a rough place , though .
While I now knew why I was getting bad results in Dromaeo I had no solution for getting stable times in Internet Explorer .
I did a little digging , tried a couple more solutions , and stumbled across ies4osx .
Ies4osx is a copy of Internet Explorer 6 running in Wine , running in X11 , on OS X .
It works ‘ ok ’ , although I ’ve been able to get it crash every so often .
Disregarding that , though , it ’s stable enough to do testing on .
Running the numbers on it yielded some fascinating results :
ies4osx provides some surprisingly stable results – we even have something that looks like a normal distribution !
This is completely unlike the normal version of IE 6/8 running on Windows .
It ’s pretty obvious that the Wine layer is tapping into some higher - quality timer mechanism and is providing it to IE – giving us a result that is even more accurate than what the browser normally provides .
This is fantastic and it ’s dramatically changed my personal performance testing of Internet Explorer .
While I ’m not keen on using anything less than “ IE running on XP with no VM ” for actual testing – this layer of higher - detailed numbers has become invaluable for testing the quality of specific methods or routines in IE .
In Summary : Testing JavaScript performance on Windows XP ( Update : and Vista ) is a crapshoot , at best .
With the system times constantly being rounded down to the last queried time ( each about 15 ms apart ) the quality of performance results is seriously compromised .
Dramatically improved performance test suites are going to be needed in order to filter out these impurities , going forward .
Update : I ’ve put the raw data up on Google Spreadsheets if you ’re interested in seeing the full breakdown .
Senator David Vitter ( R - LA ) is the most hypocritical person sitting in the senate right now .
His love of the DC Madam and New Orleans prostitutes is no surprise , but he ran on the mantra of " family values . "
Now with 2010 around the corner , there are those in his own party ready to try to knock him out .
Here comes Stormy Daniels .
A porn star .
Stormy Daniels is a walking reminder of what Vitter is trying to run away from .
In fact when his number came out on television as part of the DC Madam story , he literally did RUN AWAY .
Anyway , here is Stormy .
Is she serious ?
I do n't know , but she is getting ready for a listening tour for Louisiana .
Again , a damn reminder to Vitter of hisNow I believe more is needed to take Vitter down and I am sure there are others out there who are credible and far more qualified , but Stormy is just the kind ofthat brings all of Vitter ' sback to front .
Experts say many of these errors are not well known
The US National Security Agency has helped put together a list of the world 's most dangerous coding mistakes .
The 25 entry list contains errors that can lead to security holes or vulnerable areas that can be targeted by cyber criminals .
Experts say many of these errors are not well understood by programmers .
According to the SANS Institute in Maryland , just two of the errors led to more than 1.5 m web site security breaches during 2008 .
It is thought that this is the first time the industry has reached agreement on the worst things that can creep into software as it is being written .
More than 30 organisations , including the US National Security Agency , the Department of Homeland Security , Microsoft , and Symantec published the document .
THE TOP 25 MOST DANGEROUS PROGRAMMING ERRORS CWE - 20 : Improper Input Validation CWE - 116 : Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output CWE - 89 : Failure to Preserve SQL Query Structure CWE - 79 : Failure to Preserve Web Page Structure CWE - 78 : Failure to Preserve OS Command Structure CWE - 319 : Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information CWE -352: Cross -Site Request Forgery CWE -362: Race Condition CWE - 209 : Error Message Information Leak CWE - 119 : Failure to Constrain Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer CWE - 642 : External Control of Critical State Data CWE - 73 : External Control of File Name or Path CWE - 426 : Untrusted Search Path CWE - 94 : Failure to Control Generation of Code CWE - 494 : Download of Code Without Integrity Check CWE - 404 : Improper Resource Shutdown or Release CWE -665 : Improper Initialization CWE -682: Incorrect Calculation CWE -285 : Improper Access Control CWE - 327:Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm CWE -259 : Hard - Coded Password CWE - 732 : Insecure Permission Assignment for Critical Resource CWE - 330 : Use of Insufficiently Random Values CWE - 250 : Execution with Unnecessary Privileges CWE - 602 : Client - Side Enforcement of Server - Side Security Source : SANS Institute " The top 25 list gives developers a minimum set of coding errors that must be eradicated before software is used by customers , " said Chris Wysopal , chief technology officer with Veracode .
" There appears to be broad agreement on the programming errors , " says SANS director , Mason Brown , " Now it is time to fix them . "
" We need to make sure every programmer knows how to write code that is free of the top 25 errors . "
" Then we need to make sure every programming team has processes in place to find and fix these problems [ in existing code ] and has the tools needed to verify their code is as free of these errors , " he said .
Patrick Lincoln , director of the Computer Science Laboratory at SRI International , told the BBC that if programmers prevented these errors appearing in their code , it would deter the majority of hackers .
" This list is primarily for people who have first responsibility for designing a system .
Veteran programmers have probably learnt the hard way whereas a brand new programmer will be making more basic errors . "
" The real dedicated serial attacker will probably find a way in even if all these errors were removed .
But a high school hacker with malicious intent - ankle - biters if you will - would be deterred from breaking in . "
Previously , most advice has focused on vulnerabilities that can result from programming errors .
The top 25 list examines the actual programming errors themselves .
The US Office of the Director of National Intelligence , the principal adviser to the President , the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council also lent their support to the list .
In a statement , they said : " We believe that integrity of hardware and software products is a critical for cyber security .
" " Creating more secure software is a fundamental aspect of system and network security , given that the federal government and the nation 's critical infrastructure depend on commercial products for business operations . "
" The top 25 is an important component of an overall security initiative for our country .
We applaud this effort and encourage the utility of this tool through other venues such as cyber education . "

Edward L. Glaeser is an economics professor at Harvard .
Last week the Senate embraced a $ 15,000 homebuyer ’s tax credit , while the plan to give every American access to 4 percent mortgages appears to have fallen by the wayside .
If they had to choose one — and personally , I would have recommended neither — the Senate certainly made the right choice .
A short - term tax credit is likely to do far less harm than another open - ended interest subsidy program .
The homebuyer ’s tax credit allows homebuyers to reduce their taxes by 10 percent of the price of their new home up to $ 15,000 .
While taxpayers have the option of spreading the credit over two years , the house must be bought in 2009 .
One of my favorite features of the program is that it explicitly ends one year after it becomes law .
Why does the tax credit make more sense than an interest - rate subsidy ?
The benefits of either intervention , if any , are likely to be slight .
The big difference between the two policies lies in their costs .
The homebuyer ’s tax credit involves a one - year reduction in tax revenues that is commonly being estimated at $ 35 billion .
Given our current sales rate of about five million homes per year , I would have expected a number closer to $ 50 billion .
However , relative to the unpredictable costs of subsidized interest rates , this level of uncertainty is quite modest .
One of the great problems with any interest rate subsidy program is that costs accrue only over time , and initially reside off - balance - sheet .
Remember the old fiction that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were providing a service to homebuyers at no cost to the government ?
Some proponents of interest - rate subsidies even suggest that as long as the subsidized lending rate is higher than the current Treasury rate , the government is actually making money off the deal .
Such logic conveniently forgets default risks and other costs .
Financing trillions of dollars of mortgages would require the government to borrow trillions , pushing interest rates up and raising the cost of the national debt .
Borrowing to bet is generally not a good financial strategy for governments .
Standard economic reasoning tells us that if the market has priced 30 - year mortgages appropriately , so that their rates reflects default risks and other costs , then the gap between the market rate and the subsidized rate reflects the cost of an interest rate subsidy program .
Current mortgage rates are about 5.35 percent , which is 135 basis points above one proposed subsidized rate .
Americans today have about $ 10 trillion worth of mortgages .
If everyone refinanced into the subsidized rate , this would mean an ongoing annual subsidy starting at $ 135 billion a year , which would last as long as the mortgages do .
The great virtue of the tax credit over the interest rate subsidy is that a one - time cost of $ 35 billion or $ 50 billion is a lot less than a perpetual annual subsidy stream .
The tax credit has other virtues relative to the interest - rate subsidy .
It does not encourage people to borrow as much as possible .
In the wake of the current housing collapse , it is hard to see the sense of subsidizing people to leverage themselves to the hilt to bet on housing .
Mortgage subsidies flow disproportionately to the wealthiest Americans who buy the biggest homes and borrow most to finance them .
The tax credit will still favor people buying expensive homes , but only up to $ 150,000 .
This is far fairer .
What will the effects of the $ 15,000 tax credit be ?
People will certainly try to get their home purchases in before the end of the year , at least if the 1975 homebuyer ’s tax credit is any guide .
The 1975 homebuyer ’s tax credit , the model for this bill , was aimed entirely at new homes .
Between February 1975 , before the announcement of the bill , and May 1975 , when the bill ’s provisions were clear , the seasonally adjusted annual rate of new - home sales increased by 150,000 units .
The tax credit ended at the end of 1975 , and the seasonally adjusted annual rate of new home sales declined by 66,000 units between December 1975 and January 1976 .
Given this precedent , the bill ’s proponents are right to suggest that the bill will increase the level of sales activity in the housing market during 2009 .
Of course , extra sales activity is n’t necessarily a plus .
The current credit encourages extra churning of the housing stock , and arrangements where two homeowners sell their homes to each other next year only to flip them back the year afterward .
That feature of the tax credit could be eliminated if benefits went only to buyers who purchase new or foreclosed homes .
Will the bill do much to increase housing prices ?
The 1975 tax credit provides little guidance .
Real housing prices continued to fall throughout 1975 , and picked up only when the tax credit had run its course .
The fact that the tax credit had little impact on prices is n’t surprising .
Back in those days , lawmakers thought that it was a bad thing if homes got more expensive for ordinary Americans .
The 1975 credit was designed so that the seller had to verify that the sale price of the home was the lowest price at which the home had ever been offered .
( The rule was later adjusted so that the home - sale price was capped at the listing price of February 1975 . )
Standard economics suggests that a temporary $ 15,000 tax credit can , at most , increase prices by $ 15,000 , and will probably have much less of an effect than that .
In places like Las Vegas and Phoenix , prices will be determined by the essentially unconstrained supply of new homes .
In places like New York and San Francisco , the value of the tax credit will be swamped by the other forces buffeting the economy .
Everywhere , homebuyers are constrained by their need to come up with a 20 percent down payment .
If the tax credit temporarily increased prices by $ 7,500 , which would seem like a generous estimate , this will do little to stem the wave of foreclosures or increase the value of all those toxic mortgage - backed securities .
The government should n’t be in the business of trying to inflate housing prices artificially .
As I ’ve discussed here before , pushing up prices just reduces affordability and promotes more overbuilding .
But if the government is going to intervene , then the homebuyer ’s tax credit is far preferable to more subsidized borrowing .
In fact , this Thursday , at a conference at New York University ’s Furman Center on rethinking federal housing policy , I ’m going to argue that a tax credit of this form would be a much fairer and more efficient means of promoting homeownership than the home mortgage - interest deduction .
I ’ll return to that topic in a later post .
SAIC Gets Military Contract to Produce Jet Fuel from Algae
January 27th , 2009 by Dave Tyler
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) has given San Diego - based Science Applications International Corporation a contract to develop an algae - based alternative to petroleum - based jet fuel .
The contract could be worth as much as $ 25 million if all targets are reached .
SAIC says there will be two phases to the project .
The first will involve refining the technology and developing lab - scale production capabilities .
The second phase will involve the construction of what SAIC calls a “ pre-pilot scale ” production facility .
SAIC will do the work at company facilities in Georgia , Florida , Hawaii and Texas .
The company will work with a team of industrial and academic partners , and look to produce an algae - based fuel for about $ 3 per gallon .
DARPA is looking to reduce the military ’s dependence on traditional forms of fuel , which makes sense from both an economic and strategic standpoint .
While it remains to be seen if farmed algae provides an answer to the military ’s energy needs , the production of algae - based fuels is getting a long look from businesses and scientists .
PetroSun opened the first algae to biofuel facility in the U.S. last April .
Such operations do n’t require the crop land that corn or switchgrass use , and can produce as much as 100 times more energy per acre than crop - based biofuels .
It will be worth keeping an eye on all of these activities as they come to full bloom .

Here we describe the sequencing and analysis of a primary human cancer genome using next - generation sequencing technology .
Our patient ’s tumour genome was essentially diploid , and contained ten non-synonymous somatic mutations that may be relevant for her disease .
These mutations affect genes participating in several well - described pathways that are known to contribute to cancer pathogenesis , but most of these genes would not have been candidates for directed re-sequencing on the basis of our current understanding of cancer .
Hence , these results justify the use of next - generation whole - genome sequencing approaches to reveal somatic mutations in cancer genomes .
As we demonstrated in our re-sequencing of the genome of the C. elegans N2 Bristol strain14 , and again in this study , massively parallel short - read sequencing provides an effective method for examining single nucleotide and short indel variants by comparison of the aligned reads to a reference genome sequence .
By sequencing our patient ’s tumour genome to a depth of > 30 - fold coverage , and gauging our ability to detect known heterozygous positions across the genome , we have produced a sufficient depth and breadth of sequence coverage to comprehensively discover somatic genome variants .
A slightly lower coverage of the normal genome from this individual helped to identify nearly 98 % of potential variants as being inherited , a critical filter that allowed us to more readily identify the true somatic mutations in this tumour .
Our results strongly support the notion that hypothesis - driven ( for example , candidate gene - based ) examination of tumour genomes by PCR - directed or capture - based methods is inherently limited , and will miss key mutations .
A further and important consideration is the demand for large amounts of genomic DNA by these techniques ; this is a serious limitation when precious clinical samples are being studied .
The Illumina / Solexa technology requires only ∼ 1 μg of DNA per library , enabling the study of primary tumour DNA rather than requiring the use of tumour cell lines , which may contain genetic changes and adaptations required for immortalization and maintenance in tissue culture conditions .
A total of ten non-synonymous somatic mutations were identified in this patient ’s tumour genome .
Two are well - known AML - associated mutations , including an internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase gene , which constitutively activates kinase signalling , and portends a poor prognosis5,24,25 , and a four - base insertion in exon 12 of the NPM1 gene ( NPMc ) 26,27,28 .
Both of these mutations are common ( 25–30 % ) in AML tumours , and are thought to contribute to progression of the disease rather than to cause it directly 29 .
Notably , the frequency of the mutant FLT3 allele in the primary and relapse tumour samples ( 35.08 % and 31.30 % , respectively ) was significantly less than that of the other nine mutations ( P < 0.000001 for both the primary and relapse samples ) .
These data suggest that the FLT3 ITD may not have been present in all tumour cells , and further , that it may have been the last mutation acquired .
The other eight somatic mutations that we detected are all single base changes , and none has previously been detected in an AML genome .
Four of the genes affected , however , are in gene families that are strongly associated with cancer pathogenesis ( including PTPRT , CDH24 , PCLKC and SLC15A1 ) .
The other four somatic mutations occurred in genes not previously implicated in cancer pathogenesis , but whose potential functions in metabolic pathways suggest mechanisms by which they could act to promote cancer ( including KNDC1 , GPR123 , EBI2 and GRINL1B ) .
We speculate about the roles of these mutations for the pathogenesis of this patient ’s disease in Supplementary Information .
The importance of the eight newly defined somatic mutations for AML pathogenesis is not yet known , and will require functional validation studies in tissue culture cells and mouse models to assess their relevance .
Even though we could not detect recurrent mutations in the limited AML sample set that we surveyed , several lines of evidence suggest that these mutations may not be random , ‘ passenger ’ mutations .
First , somatic mutations in this genome are extremely rare .
The rarity of somatic variants , and the normal diploid structure of the tumour genome , argues strongly against genetic instability or DNA repair defects in this tumour .
Conceptually , this result is further supported by the very small number of somatic mutations discovered in the expressed tyrosine kinases of AML samples 4,5 ; genetic instability does not seem to be a general feature of AML genomes .
Second , on the basis of the equivalent frequencies of the variant and wild - type alleles for the mutations in the tumour genome ( except for FLT3 ITD ) , it is highly probable that all the mutations are heterozygous , and are present in virtually all of the tumour cells ( Fig. 3 ) .
The latter suggests that these mutations may have all been selected for and retained because they are important for disease pathogenesis in this patient .
Alternatively , all may have occurred simultaneously in the same leukaemia - initiating cell , but only a subset of the mutations ( or an as - yet undetected mutation ) is truly important for pathogenesis ( that is , disease ‘ drivers ’ versus passengers ) .
Although we suggest that the latter hypothesis is very unlikely on the basis of our current understanding of tumour progression , many more AML genomes will need to be sequenced to resolve this issue .
Third , the same mutations were detected in tumour cells in the relapse sample at approximately the same frequencies as in the primary sample .
All of these mutations were therefore present in the resistant tumour cells that contributed to the patient ’s relapse , further suggesting that a single clone contains all ten mutations .
Fourth , seven of the ten genes containing somatic mutations were detectably expressed in the tumour sample .
FLT3 and NPM1 messenger RNAs were highly expressed in this tumour sample , as they are in virtually all AML samples .
We detected mRNA from the CDH24 , SLC15A1 and EBI2 genes on the Affymetrix expression array , whereas expression of GRINL1B and PCLKC were detected by PCR with reverse transcription ( RT–PCR ; data not shown ) .
Expression of KNDC1 , PTPRT and GPR123 was not detected by either approach , but we cannot rule out expression of these genes in a small subset of tumour cells ( for example , leukaemia - initiating cells ) .
Furthermore , for the five point mutations where data are available , the mutated base is highly conserved across multiple species ( Table 2 ) .
Although we performed whole - genome sequencing on this cancer sample , we restricted our initial validation studies to the 1 –2 % of the genome that encodes genes .
This raises the issue of whether sequencing the complementary DNA transcriptome of this tumour would have been a faster , cheaper and more efficient way of finding the mutations .
Although this approach will undoubtedly be an important adjunct to whole - genome sequencing , there are several advantages to the approach we used : ( 1 ) coverage models for whole - genome libraries are at present better understood than for cDNA libraries , where transcript abundance can vary over many orders of magnitude ; ( 2 ) even if the transcriptome had been sequenced , extensive characterization of the normal genome would have been required to distinguish inherited variants from somatic mutations ; and ( 3 ) relevant non-synonymous mutations could be missed by cDNA sequencing , including mutations that result in RNA instability ( splice variants , nonsense mutations ) , and / or mutations in genes expressed at low levels , or in only a small subset of tumour cells .
The additional non-coding and non-genic somatic variants in this genome ( which we presently estimate at 500 – 1,000 on the basis of our calculated false positive and negative rates for non-synonymous mutations ) , will provide a rich source of potentially relevant sequence changes that will be better understood as more cancer genomes are sequenced .
In summary , we have successfully used a next - generation whole - genome sequencing approach to identify new candidate genes that may be relevant for AML pathogenesis .
We cannot overemphasize the importance of parallel sequencing of the patient ’s normal genome to determine which variants were inherited ; the identification of the true somatic mutations in this tumour genome would not have been feasible without this approach .
Furthermore , until hundreds ( or perhaps thousands ) of normal genomes and other AML tumours are sequenced , the contextual relevance of the mutations found in this genome will be unknown .
Nevertheless , the somatic mutations that we did find were neither predicted by the curation of previously defined cancer genes , nor by the study of this tumour using unbiased , high - resolution array - based genomic approaches .
For AML and other types of cancer , whole - genome sequencing may therefore be the only effective means for discovering all of the mutations that are relevant for pathogenesis .
Our movie trivia posts have been so popular , we decided to make them a regular feature .
When I talked to our fearless leader about this , he said it sounded like a great idea and nominated The Princess Bride for our first post .
Please - like I needed an excuse to watch The Princess Bride .
It 's great on so many levels .
Enjoy !
Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin were determined to learn to fence so they could film the scene where they square off at the Cliffs of Insanity .
And in fact , they did , both left - handed and right - handed .
The only bits performed by stunt doubles were the somersaults .
The fencing training came in handy for Elwes particularly , because he ended up with roles in movies where he could use those skills - Robin Hood : Men in Tights and Glory .
Even though Andre the Giant was obviously a huge guy , he could n't actually carry Robin Wright or Cary Elwes because he had just had back surgery .
In the scene where Fezzik and Westley are wrestling around and Westley is on Fezzik 's back , Cary Elwes is actually walking up ramps that are positioned just out of the shot .
As a side note , Andre said he loved his filming experience because no one looked at him like he was a freak - he was just one of guys when he was on the set .
Rob Reiner desperately wanted Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits to help write and record the soundtrack for the movie .
Knopfler agreed on the condition that Reiner somehow work a specific item into the movie : the hat he wore in This is Spinal Tap .
My first thought was , " That would be so obvious in this movie . "
But no - Reiner managed to place the hat inconspicuously in the grandson 's bedroom .
Knopfler later saw this and said he had only been kidding .
If you 're looking for it , it can clearly be seen at about 1:09:26 hanging on the lamp in the background between Fred Savage and Peter Falk .
The ROUSes were played by midgets .
The actor who played the giant rat that Westley battles was actually pulled over for speeding and arrested ( why he was arrested for speeding is never clarified ) the day the scene was scheduled to be shot , so the scene was delayed until Rob Reiner and co. could go bail him out of jail .
Chris Sarandon , who plays Prince Humperdinck , is also the voice of Jack Skellington in The Nightmare Before Christmas .
This makes me a little giddy .
Christopher Guest says that when he was sword fighting with Mandy Patinkin , he started making sword noises with his mouth like a little kid would do when play - fighting because he was so excited to be in a sword fight .
Rob Reiner cut the take and informed him that the noises would , in fact , be added in later , so his were n't necessary .
Billy Crystal specified that his character 's makeup should look like a cross between Casey Stengel and his grandmother .
Rob Reiner had to leave the room every time Billy had a scene , because he would laugh so hard he would ruin the take otherwise .
Mandy Patinkin says , " God 's honest truth , " that despite all of his risky fencing scenes , the only injury he sustained during the whole movie was bruising a rib from holding in his laughter during Billy Crystal 's scenes .
Rob Reiner 's dad , Carl , was friends with Bill Goldman , which is why Reiner was familiar with Goldman 's work .
Carl gave the book to Rob to read , and later in life , Rob asked Bill if he could make the movie .
After viewing
This is Spinal Tap and laughing until he " shrieked , " Goldman agreed .
In real - life , Humperdinck 's castle was built by William the Conquerer in 1086 for his illegitimate son .
Reiner 's production team built some extra pieces for the movie to make the castle look like it was currently in use and not abandoned and crumbling .
Rob Reiner once ran into John Gotti at a restaurant .
One of his henchmen , who was outside waiting on Gotti as Reiner was leaving , looked Rob in the eye and growled , " You killed my father , prepare to die . "
Reiner said he about " went " in his pants right there , but then the thug said , " Princess Bride , I love that movie ! "
Rob Reiner was the voice of the ROUSes .
His noises were distorted and mixed and whatnot , but they were his noises .
When the six - fingered man hits Westley on the head with the butt of his sword after he and Prince Humperdinck take Buttercup back , Cary Elwes told Chris Guest to go ahead and hit him for real , so the scene would look realistic .
Guest obliged , and production was held up because Elwes spent the rest of the day in the hospital .
The scene where Inigo Montoya is letting his sword guide him in the forest was incredibly frustrating to shoot .
The wooded area being used for the medieval forest was actually right next to Heathrow airport , so the sound of planes coming in was constantly interrupting the shoot .
If Mandy Patinkin 's performance when he kills the six - fingered man seems particularly inspired , it 's because he had lost his father to cancer several years earlier .
He equated the two and used his anger about his own father 's death to deliver such emotionally - charged lines during that scene .
He later said it was a little like therapy for him .
Anyway , that 's it for The Princess Bride .
If you have a movie you 'd like to see covered , leave it in the comments , or head to the forums and see what others have suggested .
