Well , nobody ’s perfect .
Given that John McCain ’s economic team was headlined by Carly Fiorina and Joe the Plumber , the country would be dodging a fiscal bullet even if Obama had picked Suze Orman .
But I keep wondering why the honeymoon hagiography about the best and the brightest has been so over the top .
Washington ’s cheerleading for our new New Frontier cabinet superstars has seldom been interrupted by tough questions about Summers ’s Harvard career or Geithner ’s record at the Fed .
For that , it ’s best to turn to the business press : Andrew Ross Sorkin at The New York Times , for one , has been relentless in trying to ferret out Geithner ’s opaque role in the catastrophic decision to let Lehman Brothers fail .
No doubt the Pavlovian ovations for the Obama team are in part a reaction to our immediate political past .
After eight years of a presidency that valued cronyism over brains ( or even competence ) and embraced an anti-intellectualism apotheosized by Sarah Palin , it ’s a godsend to have a president who puts a premium on merit .
I also wonder if a press corps that underrated Obama ’s political prowess for much of the campaign , demeaning him as a professorial wuss next to the brawny Clinton and McCain , is now overcompensating for that mistake .
No one wants to miss out a second time on triumphal history in the making .
This , too , is a replay of what happened when Kennedy arrived , beating out the more seasoned Richard Nixon and ending eight years of Eisenhower rule .
“ Rarely had a new administration received such a sympathetic hearing at a personal level from the more serious and respected journalists of the city , ” Halberstam wrote .
“ The good reporters of that era , those who were well educated and who were enlightened themselves and worked for enlightened organizations , liked the Kennedys and were for the same things the Kennedys were for . ”
They could n’t imagine that “ men who were said to be the ablest to serve in government in this century ” would turn out to be architects of America ’s “ worst tragedy since the Civil War . ”

Post - Iraq , we ’re unlikely to rush into a new Vietnam .
But we ignore the past ’s lessons at our peril .
In his 20th - anniversary reflections , Halberstam wrote that his favorite passage in his book was the one where Johnson , after his first Kennedy cabinet meeting , raved to his mentor , the speaker of the House , Sam Rayburn , about all the president ’s brilliant men .
“ You may be right , and they may be every bit as intelligent as you say , ” Rayburn responded , “ but I ’d feel a whole lot better about them if just one of them had run for sheriff once . ”
Halberstam loved that story because it underlined the weakness of the Kennedy team : “ the difference between intelligence and wisdom , between the abstract quickness and verbal facility which the team exuded , and true wisdom , which is the product of hard - won , often bitter experience . ”
That difference was clearly delineated in Vietnam , where American soldiers , officials and reporters could see that the war was going badly even as McNamara brusquely wielded charts and crunched numbers to enforce his conviction that victory was assured .
In our current financial quagmire , there have also been those who had the wisdom to sound alarms before Rubin , Summers or Geithner did .
Among them were not just economists like Joseph Stiglitz and Nouriel Roubini but also Doris Dungey , a 47 - year - old financial blogger known as Tanta , who died of cancer in Upper Marlboro , Md. , last Sunday .
As the Times obituary observed , “ her first post , in December 2006 , took issue with an optimistic Citigroup report that maintained that the mortgage industry would ‘ rationalize ’ in 2007 , to the benefit of larger players like , well , Citigroup . ”
It was months before the others publicly echoed her judgment .

ABC , CBS and NBC declined to speak on the record about their news coverage decisions .
But representatives for the networks emphasized that they would continue to cover the war and said the staff adjustments reflected the evolution of the conflict in Iraq from a story primarily about violence to one about reconstruction and politics .
In Baghdad , ABC , CBS and NBC still maintain skeleton bureaus in heavily fortified compounds .
Correspondents rotate in and out when stories warrant , and with producers and Iraqi employees remaining in Baghdad , the networks can still react to breaking news .
But employees who are familiar with the staffing pressures of the networks say the bureaus are a shadow of what they used to be .
Some of the offices have only one Western staff member .
The staff cuts appear to be the latest evidence of budget pressures at the networks .
And those pressures are not unique to television : many newspapers and magazines have also curtailed their presence in Baghdad .
As a consequence , the war is gradually fading from television screens , newspapers and , some worry , the consciousness of the American public .
The TV networks have talked about sharing some resources in Iraq , although similar discussions have stalled in the past because of concerns about editorial independence .
Parisa Khosravi , CNN ’s senior vice president for international newsgathering , said such talks among the networks were not currently under way .
But journalists in Iraq expect further cooperative agreements and other pooling of resources in the months ahead .
ABC and the British Broadcasting Corporation , longtime partners on polling in Iraq , may consolidate some back office operations early in 2009 , two people with knowledge of the talks said .
The people spoke anonymously because they were not authorized by the networks to talk about the plans .

One result is that , as the war claims fewer American lives , Iraq is fading from TV screens .
The three network evening newscasts devoted 423 minutes to Iraq this year as of Dec. 19 , compared with 1,888 minutes in 2007 , said Andrew Tyndall , a television news consultant .

VANCOUVER — A man has died after Mounties in the Vancouver suburb of Langley used a taser to subdue him after he jumped out of the window of a house .
Police said the man died en route to hospital Tuesday afternoon .
Officers used the stun gun after they responded to reports that an armed bank robbery suspect was holed up in a Langley house .
RCMP Corporal Peter Thiessen told CTV news that shortly after police arrived at the house , the man smashed through the front window and landed on the ground .
He was naked and bleeding from the chest .
Earlier , shouts were heard from the house and police said there were reports that a woman was inside .
Cpl .
Thiessen did not release the name of the man nor say if he was the bank robbery suspect .
Police tried to subdue the agitated man , but he tried to run back into the house , Cpl . Thiessen said .
“ At that point , believing that he was a possible armed robbery suspect , the fact that the firearm was unaccounted for and the fact that there was a known female still inside … officers used their [ taser ] in an effort to restrain this individual , which they subsequently did , ” the officer said .
The bank robbery occurred just a few blocks away , earlier in the morning .
It ’s the second time recently that police in the Vancouver area have used the device to subdue a suspect .
Last Monday , Vancouver police used a taser on a 16 - year - old mentally ill mother , saying they feared she would harm her baby .

Over at Huff Post , David Bromwich argues that Obama should n’t be so fast to make up with Hillary after everything she did to him during the primaries .
First his take , then mine :
It is said that Barack Obama has read Doris Kearns Goodwin ’s book , Team of Rivals , about the war cabinet of Abraham Lincoln .
It is said Obama wants to constitute his cabinet out of former rivals because he liked the book and he models himself on Lincoln .
Implausible as it sounds , this is the best explanation anyone has given of the offer of the position of secretary of state to Hillary Clinton .
Lincoln took William Seward at State , and Seward was a rival indeed , but he had fought for Lincoln with ferocious loyalty and all his eloquence throughout the campaign , and he put his considerable vote - getting power at Lincoln ’s disposal .
What can be said for Hillary Clinton ?
She fought against Obama until the last possible moment , and on the way exploited , for the purpose of discrediting him , most of the devices the Republicans would later tap in the general election .
She said Obama had not shown himself fit to be commander - in - chief .
She pretended not to know for sure whether or not he was a Muslim .
Team of Rivals is a pleasant work of popular history , only harmful to the extent that you weave fantasies around it .
Anyone who cares about Obama ’s fortunes after his first large public mistake ( for even to offer Clinton the position was a mistake ) should close his copy of Goodwin and open the actual words of Hillary Clinton on Iraq , and the things Barack Obama said about those words .
I just do n’t buy it .
And I say this as someone who was rather tough on Hillary during the primaries ( well , that is , after being one of her top defenders in the blogosphere ) .
It was a primary , things get said , things get done , you get over it .
Hillary was vicious at times , and we were vicious back at her .
Yeah , and so what .
Hillary ’s comportment during the primaries , as a primary contender , is a far cry from what Joe Lieberman did in actually endorsing the GOP candidate .
When you are running for office you are granted a certain degree of latitude in how nasty you can be against your fellow primary contenders .
Yes , we get pissed at you at the time , we strike back just as hard , but then we get over it .
But running against , and criticizing , fellow Dems in a primary is not the same thing as joining with the enemy after the primaries are over .
I liked Hillary and Bill before the heat of the primaries , and I ’m starting to like them all over again .
I really believe Hillary would make a fantastic Secretary of State , and her husband ’s international ties would only benefit the Obama administration .
If anyone can fix America ’s tattered image in the world , it ’s President Obama aided by a tag - team of Clintons .
And I really am serious .
I think this could be an incredible opportunity for America .

Photographic evidence of collusion between members of the fascist paramilitary group Golden Dawn and Greek police has been published by a Greek blogger
The photographs , taken in Patras today and published on the greek NEA από όλο τον Κόσμο blog , show fascists armed with blunt weapons brazenly stalking the streets with the police .
In accompanying notes , the blogger said : " The police are using neo - fascists and policemen in plain clothes , with rocks and sticks , pretending to be demonstrators who are targeting either the demonstrators or vandalizing small shops and houses , trying to divert the climate and scare off the everyday citizens .
" The pictures are from Patra city , where Policemen in plain clothes and Neo Fascists were clashing with demonstrators AND caught vandalizing small shops in the city .
This was confirmed this morning by the Mayor of city of Patra , this morning on a major TV channel ( Alpha ) . "
The photographs follow allegations last night that police have been handing tear gas and other weapons to fascists in the city , with widespread assaults taking place against demonstrators .

FSM bless Sarah Palin ; she is the gift that keeps on giving to progressive America .
Now that she is no longer kept sequestered by the McCain campaign , she bursting out into the media , showing us exactly the results of 25 years of conservative rule .
All I can say , is that I think the McCain campaign was smart to keep her away from the cameras as much as they did .
Wolf Blitzer asks Palin to comment on the historic occasion of our first African American presidency ( why ?
Does Palin have some special insight into the African American experience ?
Hell , I 'm pretty sure that she 's only vaguely aware of history ) and Palin trots out the rote talking points that she 's looking forward to working with him , especially on energy independence ( she keeps using that phrase , but I 'm not sure she knows what it means .
Energy independence does n't mean more checks for Alaskans solely , does it ? ) .
But Blitzer points out that Palin 's campaign rhetoric ( oh Wolf , let 's not play the blame game ) and Palin unapologetically reiterates the Ayers smear .
PALIN : It would be my honor to assist and support our new president and the new administration , yes .
And I speak for other Republicans , other Republican governors also .
They being willing , also , to , again , seize this opportunity that we have to progress this nation together , a united front .
BLITZER : Because , you know , during a campaign , every presidential campaign , things are said that 's tough .
As you well know , it gets sometimes pretty fierce out there .
And during the campaign , you said this .
You said , This is not a man who sees America as you see it and how I see America .
And then you went on to say , Someone who sees America , it seems as being so imperfect that he 's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country .
PALIN : Well , I still am concerned about that association with Bill Ayers .
And if anybody still wants to talk about it , I will , because this is an unrepentant domestic terrorist who had campaigned to blow up , to destroy our Pentagon and our U.S. Capitol .
That 's an association that still bothers me , and I think it 's still fair to talk about it .
Yup , there 's your united Republican front all right .
Transcripts below the fold
BLITZER : Let 's talk a little bit about what 's going on in our country right now .
It 's a pretty historic moment , when you think about it , the first African - American president , President - elect Barack Obama .
This is historic .
What does it mean to you ?
PALIN : It 's historic , and I think this time is full of optimism .
And it's an opportunity for everybody to get it together and start working together .
For us , as Republicans , to reach out to Barack Obama and the new administration that will be ushered in , and offer the solutions that we see for meeting some of America 's great challenges right now .
This is an opportunity to all be working together .
And of course President - elect Obama had promised also bipartisan efforts to meet the challenges .
So let 's seize this opportunity .
Let 's take him up on that offer .
And let 's all start working together .
BLITZER : Are you ready to help him ?
PALIN : Absolutely , especially on energy independence , energy security that we need for this nation .
Being the governor of an energy - producing state , knowing that we have the domestic solutions there in our state and in other energy - producing states , I 'm more than willing and able to help President - elect Obama to start tapping into the domestic solutions that we have now so we can quit being so reliant on foreign sources of energy .
BLITZER : So if he reaches out to you and says , Governor Palin , I need your help on energy , or some other issues , kids with special needs , for example , and says , I want you to be part of a commission , you would be more than happy to say , Yes , Mr. President ?
PALIN : It would be my honor to assist and support our new president and the new administration , yes .
And I speak for other Republicans , other Republican governors also .
They being willing , also , to , again , seize this opportunity that we have to progress this nation together , a united front .
BLITZER : Because , you know , during a campaign , every presidential campaign , things are said that 's tough .
As you well know , it gets sometimes pretty fierce out there .
And during the campaign , you said this .
You said , This is not a man who sees America as you see it and how I see America .
And then you went on to say , Someone who sees America , it seems as being so imperfect that he 's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country .
PALIN : Well , I still am concerned about that association with Bill Ayers .
And if anybody still wants to talk about it , I will , because this is an unrepentant domestic terrorist who had campaigned to blow up , to destroy our Pentagon and our U.S. Capitol .
That 's an association that still bothers me , and I think it 's still fair to talk about it .
However , the campaign is over , that chapter is closed .
Now is the time to move on and to , again , make sure that all of us are doing all we can to progress this nation .
Keep us secure , get the economy back on the right track .
And many of us do have some ideas on how to do that , and hopefully we 'll be able to put all that wisdom and experience to good use together .
BLITZER : So , looking back , you do n't regret that tough language during the campaign ?
PALIN : No , and I do not think that it is off base , nor mean - spirited , nor negative campaigning to call someone out on their associations and on their record .
And that 's why I did it .
BLITZER : And just one historic footnote .
Was that your idea or did somebody write those lines for you ?
PALIN : Oh , it was a collaborative effort there in deciding , how do we start bringing up some of the associations that perhaps would be impacting on an administration , on the future of America ?
But again though , Wolf , knowing that it really at this point , I do n't want to point fingers backwards and play the blame game , certainly on anything that took place in terms of strategy or messaging in the campaign .
Now is the time to move forward together , start progressing America .
In a way it is ironic , how many researchers , psychology students , and cognitive neuroscientists worldwide will remember Mr. Henry G. Molaison and he did not remember a single person he met after his brain surgery , circa 1953 .
Henry G. Molaison , formerly known to all as simply HM was one of the most widely studied patients in the field of cognitive neuropsychology for over fifty years .
His participation in several studies provided significant contributions to the understanding of brain function and memory .
HM passed away on December 3 , 2008 in Hartford , Connecticut .
Molaison suffered from seizures for many years , the cause attributed to a bicycle accident he had at the age of nine .
In 1953 , at sixteen years of age , Molaison underwent what would have been cutting - edge surgery at the time , at the hands of Dr. William Scoville .
Scoville localized HM ’s epilepsy to both medial temporal lobes .
During surgery , he removed parts of the affected lobes and the majority of HM ’s hippocampus , parahippocampal gyrus , and amygdala .
Post - surgery , HM ’s seizures were cured but he suffered from anterograde amnesia , an inability to form new knowledge and memories .
However , his working and procedural memory remained intact , as did many of his long - term memories from before the surgery .
As an undergraduate student in an abnormal psychology course , our class had studied HM and his contributions to the field ( as well as the fascinating case of Phineas Gage ) .
I ’d never given it much thought then , but to think of it , Molaison was studied for over fifty years !
He may not have had the opportunity to live a normal life but he did selflessly partake in experiments for the rest of his life .
Maybe it was n’t selfless if he could n’t remember what he was doing there but I can imagine the exchange between him and his caretakers :
HM , you ’re here as a study patient .
You ca n’t form new memories …
Did he have to consent to participation every day ?
Thank you HM .
Your participation in various studies single - handedly revolutionized our knowledge of human memory .

You only have to read two pages into Tim Manner ’s newest book Relevance to read that , “ Demographics Are Dead . ”
If you ’re like me , this was a somewhat jarring declaration .
After all is n’t knowing your customers the foundation of any successful marketing plan ?
But then again , how well do you really know consumers when you spend all your time trolling demographic statistics ?
Chances are not much more than vagaries such as age , gender , ethnicity , along with a few averages in categories like income .
Demographics worked well in the age of splatter - gun marketing to the masses .
At least then demographics made the random messaging a little less random .
If new a majority of your brands ’ customers were white women ages 25 - 35 , then you could be sure to reach majority of women that fit that profile in between the weekly soap operas .
But as we all know , mass - blast advertising is n’t quite as effective as it once was , and now demographics just are n’t making the cut .
Consumers want brands that they can relate to and brands that relate to them–brands founded on core , unchanging principles , beliefs and values –and not on ever changing campaigns and taglines , tweaked to fit perceived changes in demographics .
To quote Tim again ,
Relevant brands often find their focus within a key demographic group but do not base their strategies solely on issues of age , gender , ethnicity , or income .
Demographics are n’t totally extinct …yet .
And sure , there are times when these facts and figures can be helpful .
But if you expect to survive in the new age of brands , a much closer picture of consumers is required , or even better , a relationship .

Rolf Harris says sorry for racist song lyrics ... then goes on to slam ' lazy ' Aborigines
It was the song which made his name both in Britain and his native Australia .
But Rolf Harris came to regret the lyrics in his 1960 hit Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport for their racist slur against Aborigines .
Yesterday , the veteran entertainer apologised for the reference to ' Abos ' in the song .
However , Mr Harris , 78 , then went on to undo all his good intentions by telling Aborigines to ' get up off your arse and clean up the streets your bloody self ' .
Rolf Harris , with his ' wobbleboard ' , has apologised for a racist slur in his Tie Me Kangaroo Down song but then went on to add a new insult to Aborigines
He was referring to communities of indigenous Australians who complain about their poverty and filthy conditions .
The reaction in Sydney 's Redfern district , where many Aborigines live , was anger coupled with calls for a further apology .
' It 's a disgrace .
He 's got to watch his lip , ' said one young man .
' It 's the same old story – kick the Aborigine in the guts and blame him for everything . '
Mr Harris had initially sought to make amends for the lyrics : ' Let me Abos go loose , Lou …
They 're of no further use , Lou . '
He said he had tried to replace ' Abo ' with ' emu ' in recordings over the years but with limited success .
' It was a mark of the times , done innocently with no realisation that you would offend at all , ' he said .

The new racial controversy erupted as Rolf launched a book of illustrations in Melbourne during a visit from his base in London
' I just trying to create a fun song for a bunch of Aussies who were drinking themselves stupid on Swan Lager in London at the time . '
The new controversy erupted as Mr Harris launched a book of illustrations in Melbourne during a visit from his base in London .
He turned the grievances of many Aborigines back on to the people themselves .
' You sit at home watching the television and you think to yourself , " Get up off your arse and clean up the streets your bloody self " and why would you expect somebody to come in and clean up your garbage , which you 've dumped everywhere ?
' But then you have to think that it 's a different attitude to life . '
He said Aboriginal children were never disciplined or expected to adhere to rules until adulthood .
' Till then , they have a totally carefree life to do what they want and that quite often involves smashing everything that they have , ' he told The Age newspaper .
Mr Harris blamed Aboriginal traditional values for the appalling conditions in many communities .
He added : ' The attitude is that , in their original way of life , they would really wreck the surrounding countryside that they lived in and they would leave all the garbage and they would go walkabout to the next place .
' The traditional attitude is still there and I wish there was a simple solution – but I 'm not certain . '
Mr Harris has previously apologised for the song lyrics , telling Radio Scotland in 2006 that he had not sung the offending verse since 1960 .
' I have great love and respect for the Aborigines , ' he said .
The song was recorded in an era when racism against indigenous Australians was rife .

YO , So , on the shirts , I 'm leaning toward the Schrodinger one , though I may end up doing the suicide one just because it'd be easier to do a 4 - color print with it .
If this one sells well , I 'll probably introduce a few more designs , perhaps adding one a month if things go well .
As you guys know , I 've never really sold merch , so I have no idea how well it 'll go over .
Over time , I 'd like to get to where I have a number of solid things going at once , similar to R Stevens or Jeff Rowland .
I figure , if I had a dozen or so designs up , there 'd be at least one that you 'd really like .
Stay tuned .
There should be more info by next week .
Are you constantly pulling up your bra straps ?
Do your shoulders fall forward ?
Do your bosoms bounce when you walk , despite your new balcony bra with lace trim ?
The chances are you are among the majority of women who have never had a proper bra fitting , and whose posture and back health are compromised as a result .
Attitudes about bra fit and function vary by generation .
Younger women are more likely to find that their bra does n't fit properly because , in the good old days , pubescent girls were almost always fitted for bras .
The idea of being fitted for a bra when I was 13 would have been gross , but everything looks different after my bra epiphany , which happened in Night Owls on the Fulham Road , in south - west London .
" Your bra does n't fit properly ! " the lady at the cash register shouted , as I checked out the pink flannel pyjamas .
I pretended not to notice .
" I bet you 've never had a bra fitting in your life ! " continued the voice .
She marched over .
I was wearing an expensive underwired bra , designed to give " lift " .
I had tried it on in the shop , but that was not , I was told , a proper fitting .
" I bet your back strap 's half way up your shoulder blades .
Look at your posture !
Your bust line is sinking ! "
My ear lobes , she said , were almost attached to my shoulders .
I 'd spent years compromising my breast and back health , apparently , and my bra was a load of " shite " .
I told her I 'd always been a 36C .
" Rubbish , " she snorted .
" You 're a 30 - or 32E . "

This was a shock ; I 'd only come in for pyjamas .
As chairman of the PTA , I did not want an E cup .
It sounded huge , like Jordan .
All this is not just a matter of vanity .
Last week , the British Chiropractic Association ( BCA ) warned that wearing the wrong bra size can lead to a number of problems , including back pain , restricted breathing , abrasions , breast pain and poor posture .
The problems are even more acute in large - breasted women .
" Bras are like suspension bridges , " says the BCA 's Tim Hutchful .
" You need a well - engineered bra so your shoulders do n't end up doing all the work .
Bras that do n't fit will affect the shoulders and chest , and will almost certainly cause back pain as you get older . "
The woman prodding , pulling and hoiking introduced herself as Yolanda Ktori .
A passionate advocate of corsetry , she has seen the profession clobbered by our smash - and - grab society .
" Women buy bras off the shelf at M&S [ though it does offer a fitting service ] , and do n't have a clue what size they are .
Some stores offer fittings , but most women do n't bother . "
She pushed my shoulders down and pulled my blades back , showing me where the strap should sit : on the meaty part of the shoulder towards the neckline , locking in with the shoulders and streamlining down the back to stop slipping .
" It 's like the reins on a horse .
You pull everything back , not forward , " she says .
The corsetry experts at Rigby & Peller estimate that 80 per cent of women that come through their doors are wearing the wrong - sized bra , and also stress that badly fitting bras can lead to back problems and bad posture .
The most common bra solecisms are cups that are too small and bands that are loose around the back causing the shoulders to carry the weight of the bosoms , instead of the back .
A bra must be firm ( not tight ) around the back and support the weight of the breasts in the mid to lower back .
Rigby & Peller says the back band should be level with the underwire ( Ktori says an inch - and - a - half lower ) .
Jon-Morton Bell , an osteopath , agrees that properly fitting bras are key to back health .
" Ladies have to do a balancing act with gravity , " he says .
" Proper support for the breasts has a huge impact on back health .
The best place to support the breasts is through the lumbar ( lower back ) , but often , women take the strain through the thoracic ( around the ribcage ) , which can cause a curved back .
If a woman is bending forward because of insufficient breast support , the trapezius overstretches and causes headaches .
All nerve roots come from the back ; stomach upsets and fatigue are common by - products of bad back health .
If ladies have a proper bra-fitting , back problems are often resolved . "
There are even those who have claimed that there is a link between underwired bras and breast cancer .
In their book Dressed to Kill , Sydney Ross Singer and Soma Grismaijer claim that the external pressure of the bra constricts the lymphatic vessels and prevents proper draining of the breast tissue , leading to fluid accumulation in the breast .
Western rates of the disease are 10 times those of developing countries because , they tell us , women in the latter tend not to wear bras , let alone cleavage - heaving cross - your heart - and - hope - to - die wonder bras .
They urge women to abandon bras and embrace freedom , but do n't substantiate their claims with any supportive comparisons in diet , lifestyle or genetic history .
The metal in underwired bras is unpopular with acupuncturists as it crosses the body 's meridians and blocks the flow of chi , they say , which can cause energy to stagnate .
But breast cancer ?
Lynn Daly , from Cancer Research UK , says : " You would need to wear a bra that was painfully and unbearably tight to have any effect on your lymphatic system , but constriction or applying pressure to an area of the body does not cause normal cells to become cancerous . "
" It 's not rocket science , " says Yolanda Ktori .
" Saggy bosoms are bad for your back .
Get a bra that fits properly .
You would n't wear shoes that are too tight , would you ?
Women who have their bra fitted properly tell me it 's changed their lives . "
The wrong bra ?
How you can tell
Kate Horrell , fitting expert for the online lingerie shop figleaves.com , recommends looking closely in the mirror for the telltale signs that you 're wearing the wrong bra size .
The underband is riding up
Lift up your arms to see whether the bra is tight enough .
The underband should fit firmly against the body so that it does not slide about during normal activity .
The shoulder straps are digging in
The underband of a bra provides the majority ( 80 per cent ) of support for the breasts , with the straps providing just 20 per cent .
If the bra straps are digging in , it could be because the underband is too loose and you are over - adjusting the straps to feel supported .
When you do this , the straps pull the bra up at the back , another sign that the band is too loose .
The centre fold is lifting away from the body
The centre front of the bra should lie flat against the body .
If it does n't , the cups could be too small .
The back band is overstretched
If your straps are too far apart at the back ( they should be parallel ) , it may be that your bra band is too small and so is overstretching .
As Economy Plummets , Tips Go Along for Ride
As the economy sags , service workers find their tips decreasing .
Dec. 16 , 2008  -- Ceasar Morales does n't have high hopes for his annual tips this holiday season .
The bellhop at New York 's swank Trump International Hotel , where rooms start at $ 495 a night , told ABCNews.com that since the economy has gone into a recession , tips from guests have plummeted .
" Guests -- even those who stay here once a month -- are now just saying , ' sorry ' and leaving without tipping me , " said Morales , who has worked at the hotel for more than 11 years .
" Or if they used to slip me a 20 , now it 's a 10 or a five - dollar bill , instead -- it 's a big difference . "
Morales , like many workers who count on tips and holiday bonuses to make ends meet , said that he estimates his tips have been slashed in half this year .
He said he 's worried about how he 'll take care of his two children who have just started college .
Construction worker Brian McFarlane said that he , too , feels the pinch this year and knows he wo n't be getting his year - end tips .
" Last year , we got about $ 1,000 in bonuses and tips , " he said .
" This year , they 've basically told us it 's not going to happen .
" I see what 's going on with the economy so I do understand why we 're not getting the money , but it still means less cash for eating out or extra spending , " said McFarlane .
One New York City laborer , who asked not to be named , said that the lack of tipping is " really bad . "
" Nobody is tipping anymore , " he said .
" That extra help we count on is gone . "
Michael Lynn , a professor of consumer behavior and marketing at Cornell University , said that what Morales and McFarlane are reporting is anticipated to only get worse in the coming weeks .
" Wealthier people tip more and people who are less price - sensitive tip more , " said Lynn , who has done research on tipping behavior .
" Both of those things lend support to the idea that tips would go down in the bad economy . "
" People 's wealth goes down and they become price - sensitive when the economy plummets , " he said .
" I 'd anticipate that doormen are going to receive smaller annual gratuities this season , " he said .
" What the norm is this year is probably not higher and maybe even a lot lower than last Christmas . "
But doormen and bellhops , said Lynn , are just some of the many workers who will receive thinner envelopes than in years past .
Servers at restaurants , for example , may be getting hit the hardest .
" Fewer people will be going to full - service restaurants , so there will be fewer people to wait on , " said Lynn .
" And those who are going will probably be spending less , and with lower bill prices mean smaller percentages for tips .
" It 's really a triple whammy for servers , " he said .
A Guide to Tipping : When It 's OK to Skimp and When It's Not
But etiquette expert Lizzie Post , the great - great granddaughter of Emily Post , said tipping servers is one place where it's not OK to scale back -- bad economy or not .
" The regular daily service tipping , like if a [ porter ] hails you a cab and you give him a dollar , or if you go to a restaurant and a server waits on you -- those types of tips should still be happening no matter what , " said Post .
" Especially when it comes to servers in a restaurant because they do n't make minimum wage , which is why it 's mandatory to tip even if you get bad service , " she said .
But when it comes to annual tips during the holidays -- a custom Post says is essentially a generous " thank you " for the year 's services -- scaling back is permissible .
" It 's OK to scale back on holiday tips during tough economic times , " said Post .
" Some people may just cut back or eliminate the tips altogether . "
Post says that when figuring out who gets what at the end of the year , the first thing to think about is your budget and then prioritize by determining which people have helped you the most this year .
Aware that people may be worried about being criticized for being stingy if they decide to give a smaller tip or none at all , Post suggests writing a note explaining your difficult financial situation while still expressing your gratitude for the person 's hard work .
" Send a note along with the [ smaller ] tip and say that you know it 's not what it was in the past , but please do n't let it be a reflection of your hard work , and thank them again , " said Post .
But with the economy hitting everyone hard , Post said she 's heard of fewer backlashes than one might expect from those who might be getting fewer tips this year .
" People have been telling us that when they did call ahead or send notes to warn that tips or bonuses might be less this year , service providers were just grateful to be needed , " she said .
" Many of these people are just happy to have their jobs at this point , " said Post .
DETROIT , Dec 7 ( Reuters ) -
With sport-utility vehicles at the altar and auto workers in the pews , one of Detroit ’s largest churches on Sunday offered up prayers for Congress to bail out the struggling auto industry .
“ We have never seen as midnight an hour as we face this week , ” the Rev. Charles Ellis told several thousand congregants at a rousing service at Detroit ’s Greater Grace Temple .
“ This week , lives are hanging above an abyss of uncertainty as both houses of Congress decide whether to extend a helping hand . ”
Local car dealerships donated three hybrid SUVs to be displayed during the service , one from each of the Big Three .
A Ford Escape , Chevy Tahoe from GM and a Chrysler Aspen were parked just in front of the choir and behind the pulpit .
Ellis said he and other Detroit ministers would pray and fast until Congress voted on a bailout for Detroit ’s embattled automakers .
He urged his congregation to do the same .
Other Detroit - area religious leaders -- including Christian , Muslim and Jewish leaders convened by Cardinal Adam Maida -- have urged Congress to approve an auto aid package .
But the service dedicated to saving Motown ’s signature industry at Greater Grace Temple was the highest profile effort to mobilize support yet .
“ Everybody ca n’t live on Wall Street .
Everybody can’t live on Main Street .
But all of us have lived on the side street , the working class , ” Ellis said .
“ I call it the working class because everything tells me there is no more middle class . ”
Key Democratic lawmakers and the Bush administration were locked in negotiations over the weekend aimed at offering at least $ 15 billion in short - term loans to keep General Motors Corp GM.N and Chrysler LLC from immediate bankruptcy .
Automakers and their political allies contend a collapse by the industry would cost up to 3 million jobs as suppliers , dealers and companies in related industries were hit in turn .
Representing the 150,000 unionized workers at GM , Chrysler and Ford Motor Co F.N , UAW Vice President General Holiefield said the industry had made its case for emergency funding as strongly as it could .
“ We have done all we can do in this union , so I ’m going to turn it over to the Lord , ” Holiefield told the congregation .
Ellis said he started to organize the service last week after hearing from auto workers , retirees and their widows who were all fearful of even harder times .
At one point , Ellis summoned up hundreds of auto workers and retirees in the congregation to come forward toward the vehicles on the altar to be anointed with oil .
“ It ’s all about hope .
You ca n’t dictate how people will think , how they will respond , how they will vote , ” Ellis said after the service .
“ But you can look to God .
We believe he can change the minds and hearts of men and women in power , and that ’s what we tried to do today . ”
Michelle McDade , 50 , who attended the service , said her late father had worked at GM for 30 years and her mother was now living on his pension .
“ I pray in good times and in bad times , but I pray these days because it ’s something that directly affects our lives .
“ Politicians forgot autoworkers for ages .
You ca n’t just forget them .
We ’re also part of the country . ”
Founded in 1927 when Detroit was an automotive boomtown , Greater Grace Temple is one the city ’s largest and most influential black churches .
The church was the site of the 2005 funeral for civil rights figure Rosa Parks .

Entourage did n't exactly jump the shark .
It just slowly sank from a slightly - better - than - mediocre show to an unfunny , repetitive , saccharine , predictable piece of shit .
In fact , it happened so slowly that most of us forgot to stop watching it .
But I guess we ’re all a little OCD , and it 's not like there ’s ever anything that cool to do on a Sunday night .
That said , Entourage will soon be entering it 's sixth season .
By the time it starts airing , we 'll be well into the Obama administration , and change will be in the air .
Here 's how to turn Entourage from an offensively irrelevant waste of time into an old - fashioned guilty pleasure : 1 ) Ari Screentime = 1/3 of the Show .
Too much Ari is n't funny .
Not enough Ari ?
Well , the rest of the show is even worse .
2 ) Ari = Asshole .
Ari is n't Vince 's friend .
Vince is shallow and Ari is a scumbag .
People like that do n't have real friends .
They just get drunk and leech off of each other .
We do n’t need to see how good a dad Ari is , or how loving of a husband he is , or any of that " should I or should n't I become head of the studio " bullshit .
Just make with the racist / gay jokes and move on .
3 ) Fire or promote Lloyd .
We get it .
He ’s gay .
He ’s chinese .
If I have to hear one more motivational speech that Lloyd gives Ari I ’m gonna firebomb HBO headquarters .
I do n’t care if David Simon ’s taking a meeting there or what , I ’m fucking crazy .
4 ) More movie shit .
Is it so wrong to actually show a movie getting made ?
It does happen from time to time in this city .
( We got a little bit with that gay fireman movie , and it was relatively amusing . )
I ’m sure some focus group somewhere said that movie making does n’t play well in the sticks , but let ’s get real : the fly - over states do n’t get HBO , and if they did , they would n’t watch Entourage because it sucks .
5 ) The following lines should never be spoken again : " Did you ever think we ’d make it this far , " " Who ’d have thought this would happen to us ? " , and " Not bad for a couple of guys from Queens . "
Speaking of Queens , never do another episode there .
The season finale was without a doubt the worst episode ever , it was like watching snot drip out of an old man ’s nose .
And could you not end every single episode with the boys toasting to something ?
It ’s getting a little depressing .
Collectively , I think society should give it the first three episodes of next season and if it has n’t shaped up by then , Mark Wahlberg can go fuck himself .

Interview with Naomi Wolf author of “ Give Me Liberty : A Handbook for American Revolutionaries ” given October 4 , 2008 on Mind Over Matters , KEXP 90.3 FM Seattle .
It was inevitable that the Huffington Post would somehow end up sullied by recruiting such a massive army of unpaid contributors .
But few would have imagined something this awful : Valued HuffPo political blogger Carol Anne Burger shot herself Friday , and police now believe she was responsible for the brutal murder of her former lover two days earlier .
Burger was a scuba - diving instructor who brought an amateur 's zeal to her work , and in this sense embodied the best of HuffPo's democratic approach , calling to mind fellow contributor Mayhill Fowler , who broke the " Bittergate " story .
But the website will not be eager to associate itself with Burger 's energy in dispatching Jessica Kalish .
Kalish was stabbed with a Phillips - head screwdriver 222 times , primarily around the back of her head and across her back , arms and face .
Here 's what police believe happened , according to the Palm Beach Post :
On Wednesday night , Kalish exercised at LA Fitness at 2290 N. Congress Ave. and was home by 9:30 p.m.
A confrontation ensued ...
Using Luminol , a chemical agent that causes blood traces to fluoresce under ultraviolet light , [ police ] found a " tremendous amount of blood " splattered throughout the garage , where the attack must have taken place , Chapman said .
The Luminol also revealed Burger 's glowing sneaker prints on the garage floor , mapping her steps after she walked through her old flame 's blood .
" We believe the process of killing Jessica was pretty lengthy , in and out of the car , " Chapman said .
" She obviously was out of her mind . " ... After stabbing Kalish , Burger put her in the BMW and drove her to the Congress Avenue site .
She walked home , a distance of about 2 1/2 miles .
In many ways , Burger had stacked the deck against herself :
She continued to share a home with the former lover , in Boynton Beach , Florida , more than a year after they had broken up .
She refused antidepressants .
She made some crude attempts to lead police off the trail , but quickly came under suspicion .
Her suicide came right before she was to be questioned .
It seems unlikely the incident will prompt HuffPo publisher Arianna Huffington to end her practice , as observed by the New Yorker , of offering unpaid blogging gigs to a bewildering array of friends , acquaintances , friends of friends and random strangers .
Huffington
Post at some point in the recent past incorporated more formal hiring procedures , insiders have said , after editors complained they did not know in advance they would have to run personal chores for Arianna .
But nearly all bloggers are outsiders at HuffPo , not employees , and in any case there are no indications that Burger , a former journalist and public relations executive , had any alarming personal history that might have come up in a background check .
This will probably be chalked up as it should be : Basic human tragedy .
In this close - up view of a region of ancient , eroded terrain in Nili Fossae , carbonates ( bright green ) formed a few billion years ago when water interacted with the mineral olivine ( yellow ) .
Clays ( light blue ) , which also formed in water , lie beneath the olivine and carbonate rocks ( Image : NASA / JPL / JHUAPL / U of Arizona / Brown U ) Small channels in a section of Mars ’s Nili Fossae region were probably carved by liquid water early in the planet ’s history .
The mineral olivine ( yellow ) and clays ( blue ) appear beneath mesas of an overlying rock ( purple ) in this false - colour image .
Carbonates ( green ) also appear in exposed outcrops of rock that each cover less than 10 square kilometres ( Image : NASA / JPL / JHUAPL / MSSS / Brown U )
In this global elevation map ( where blue is low and red is high ) , small green circles show where CRISM detected carbonates on Mars ( Illustration : Ehlmann et al. / Science )
Carbonate minerals , which form in the presence of water and have previously been found only in trace amounts on Mars , have been spotted in outcrops of rock on the Red Planet , new observations reveal .
Advertisement
Since acidic conditions can prevent carbonates from forming , the discovery suggests that the minerals were created in neutral - pH water that might have provided a cosy habitat for life .
On Earth , oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and deposit it as carbonate rock .
But although some evidence points to past water oceans on Mars , only small amounts of carbonates have been found there – in Martian meteorites that landed on Earth and in atmospheric dust and bright soils on the planet .
In 2004 , iron - rich minerals and sulphate salts observed by NASA ’s Opportunity rover suggested an explanation : any oceans were too acidic for carbonates to form .
Indeed , a study in 2006 suggested that Mars may have gone through an acidic phase , triggered by active volcanism , after an early period in which it had a denser atmosphere and large bodies of neutral - pH water on its surface .
Now , a study led by Bethany Ehlmann of Brown University in Providence , Rhode Island , reports the discovery of magnesium carbonate rocks in a region of Mars called Nili Fossae , as well as smaller carbonate deposits in a couple of other sites ( see map ) .
The subtle spectral signature of carbonates was identified by the high - resolution CRISM spectrometer on NASA ’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
‘ Fairly spectacular ’
The carbonates in Nili Fossae are found in rocky outcrops that each cover no more than 10 square kilometres across .
The minerals are thought to have formed when liquid water – either from subsurface groundwater or from shallow , ephemeral lakes on the surface – came into contact with the mineral olivine .
“ In some places , like the Opportunity landing site , Terra Meridiani , it ’s clear that acid waters dominated the region , ” Ehlmann told New Scientist .
“ Because we had n’t seen carbonate bearing rocks before , we extrapolated this could be true over much of the planet . ”
“ But at least in pockets , like where we see the carbonate , it suggests waters were mostly neutral to alkaline , ” she says .
Such waters represent “ a different sort of aqueous environment – potentially a habitat for micro-organisms – on ancient Mars ” .
Mark Bullock of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colorado , is impressed with the results .
“ This is a fairly spectacular paper , ” he told New Scientist .
“ [ These rocks ] are n’t the massive layered limestones we see on Earth , but they are extensive enough to suggest that neutral pH waters in that location were necessary for their formation . ”
Complex history
What ’s more , the carbonates appear in rocks that seem to be younger – between 3.5 billion and 3.9 billion years old – than those in which the sulphates seen by Opportunity formed .
“ What this means is that Mars did n’t just go from wet and pH neutral to drier and more acidic as it got colder , ” Bullock says .
“ There must have been regional climate and chemical conditions that varied in time and space , ” he says , adding that this would occur as the tilt of Mars ’s spin axis changed over tens of thousands of years , a wobble caused by the lack of a massive moon to stabilise the planet .
“ I think it just goes to show that Mars has probably had a pretty wild climate history , what with the pole swinging all over the place . ”
Joshua Bandfield of the University of Washington in Seattle agrees : “ The new results add another interesting piece of information which supports a more complex model for the history of the planet . ”
Hidden carbonates ?
Just how common are carbonates on Mars ?
“ I think that between the dust and the meteorites , it is apparent that carbonates are likely to be widespread , but not at high concentrations , ” says Bandfield , who adds that it is unclear how concentrated the carbonates in Nili Fossae are .
“ We ’re going to keep looking as more CRISM data comes down , ” says Ehlmann . “ [ But ]
I think it ’s unlikely that we will find another big , regional unit like we see in Nili Fossae . ”
Bullock agrees : “ I think there must have been limited times and limited places on Mars where carbonate rocks could have formed , perhaps at the bottom of a lake that persisted for a while . ”
Target site
Bullock adds that Nili Fossae “ seems like a very compelling new candidate landing site for the Mars Science Laboratory . ”
In fact , Nili Fossae was initially considered as a possible landing site for the giant rover because it contains clays that must have formed in water .
Intriguingly , it also might be a source of methane gas detected in the Martian atmosphere that might have a biological origin .
Technical glitches recently forced NASA to postpone MSL ’s launch from 2009 to 2011 .
That means researchers will reconsider the question of where to land the rover in about a year , says MSL project scientist John Grotzinger of Caltech .
“ However , the reason the Nili landing site was not advanced was because it is too high in altitude – too risky for landing , ” he told New Scientist .
The massive lander needs to travel through as much of Mars ’s thin atmosphere as possible to slow down enough to land safely , ruling out sites , such as Nili Fossae , that lie at high altitudes .
“ Unfortunately , this constraint will also apply in 2011 , ” says Grotzinger .

Tuesday , Canadian elections underway Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday October 13 , 2008
Print This Email This by Michel Comte
OTTAWA ( AFP ) - Canadian voters go to the polls Tuesday for a third election in four years , becoming the first G7 nation to cast ballots since the start of a global financial meltdown .
Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his main rival Liberal leader Stephane Dion set off Monday on nationwide blitzes to firm up support and woo many still undecided voters in the dying hours of the campaign .
Harper is predicted to win his second mandate since January 2006 , with the latest polls placing him at five percentage points ahead of Dion .
But with one - third of Canadians still uncertain of their intentions , and three other mainstream parties nipping at the front - runner 's heels , a Conservative victory is by no means assured .
" In this election , ours is the only party running on a strong record and a clear plan ... that in the midst of this world financial crisis have kept our economy creating jobs , kept our budget balanced and kept your bank accounts safe and secure , " Harper said at his first whistle stop in the town of Cornwall , Prince Edward Island .
He urged supporters to push hard to the finish line : " We need every vote we can get . "
" In this close election , there is no guarantee we will win , " Harper said , before flying to Fredericton in easternmost Canada and ending his day in Vancouver on the Pacific Coast .
Dion meanwhile called on voters to " stop Stephen Harper , " saying the incumbent prime minister " has no plan " to safeguard Canada 's economy from the worldwide woes provoked by a collapse in the US subprime mortgage market .
" We have a plan to create jobs , to ensure that we are doing all we can in these tough economic times to protect our pensions , our savings , our mortgages , and our jobs , " he said in Fredericton .
" If we come together , if we pull our votes together , we will win this election , " Dion said , planning to also take his message to Montreal , Winnipeg and Vancouver .
In an interview with the Toronto Sun , Harper said he would step down if he does not win this election .
But he hoped for a minority government , he told broadcaster CTV .
If Dion slips , the Liberals are said to be more likely to trample him than help him up to fight another election campaign .
Early on , Harper had hoped to usher in a new conservative era in Canadian politics while the centrist Liberals tracked left to counter him .
The Canadian election was cast as a colossal struggle between right and left , and a possible bellwether for a November contest in the United States between Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama .
But in the last 10 days , focus shifted to global financial troubles , and Harper lost his early 10 - point lead .
Rivals accused Harper of glossing over Canadians ' fears of US economic carnage splattering this country , despite his and his finance minister 's efforts to reassure them , and " not to panic . "
They attacked Harper 's " stay the course " campaign , and for saying in a recent television interview that plunging stock markets presented good buying opportunities for investors .
Harper shot back , saying the Liberals 's plan for the largest tax shift in recent Canadian history , massively cutting income and corporate taxes to offset a new pollution tax , was too risky in " uncertain economic times . "
Thus , Harper reclaimed a slight lead .
Amid the politicking , the Toronto Stock Exchange took its worst beating in almost 70 years , and a leading Canadian bank predicted a recession in 2009 .
Canada 's economy has actually fared better than that of other Group of Seven industrialized nations , and unlike places like the United States , its banks are not in danger of insolvency .
But some 75 percent of Canadian exports go south to its neighbor and biggest trading partner , and when the US economy stumbled in 1975 , 1982 and 1991 , so too did Canada 's economy .
Analysts noted Harper also faced a resurgence of the separatist Bloc Quebecois in this election , likely dashing his hopes for more seats in Quebec , while Dion seemed to have failed to woo anti-Conservative votes from the leftist New Democrats or the nascent Green Party .
Nearing the finish line , support for both the Conservatives ( 33 percent ) and the Liberals ( 28 percent ) is actually down two percentage points from the last election in 2006 , according to the Strategic Counsel .
" The winner of this election is stumbling over the finish line after a pretty uninspiring race , " the polling firm 's Peter Donolo told CTV .
" Two main parties are really underperforming . "
Update : some keyboard characters corrected :
Just got a new Mac for Christmas and feeling a little bewildered ?
Fear not - Switch to Mac , brought to you by our colleagues over on MacFormat magazine , shows new Mac users how to move comfortably from the familiarity of Windows .
Below are 20 common tasks that PC owners perform without thinking about , and their equivalents on a Mac - just as easy !
On Windows I used to ...
Do a right - click
There 's a myth that Macs can't right - click .
Nonsense !
Since before the days of Mac OS X , Macs have had the ability to use two - button mice to bring up the kind of contextual menu you 're used to in Windows , and you can happily plug a two - button scrollwheel mouse into a Mac and start using it without installing any drivers .
Even without that add - on mouse , it 's easy to do a right - click .
If you have an iMac that comes with Apple 's Mighty Mouse , or add a Mighty Mouse to any other Mac , you can simply use your middle finger to click to the right of the scrollwheel .
Check that side is configured for Secondary Click in the Keyboard & Mouse pane of System Preferences .
The same pane configures how you right - click on notebooks , and if you have an old Mac that really only does have one button , simply hold down the Control key and do a normal click .
On Windows I used to ... Use [ control ] for keyboard shortcuts
The Command key replaces the [ control ] key as the main modifier for keyboard shortcuts .
[ control ] +[ C ] becomes Command +[ C ] , and so on .
Hold down
Alt and type a number to get special characters .
You can either use the Character Palette – enable it from the Input Menu tab of the International pane of System Preferences – or learn the easy - to - remember shortcuts .
For accents , type the shortcut for the accent then the letter you want to be accented .
For example , á is Alt +[ E ] , à is Alt +[ ' ] , â is Alt +[ I ] , ä is Alt +[ U ] , ã is Alt +[ N ] , and ß is Alt +[ S ] .
On Windows I used to ... Configure my PC with Control Panel
System Preferences –accessible from the Apple menu at the top left of your Mac 's screen –does the same thing .
On Windows I used to ...
Use the Start menu
There 's no direct equivalent to the Start menu when you 're on a Mac .
You 'll find everything you 're used to finding there in one of a few places .
The Dock , at the bottom of your screen , holds your favourite applications , and most other stuff .
Recent documents , applications and servers , system preferences , log off and shut down options are all to be found in the Apple menu .
Printers and faxes are in System Preferences .
And the Help and Support equivalents are in the Help menu – always the last menu in the menu bar at the top of the screen .
On Windows I used to ...
Defrag my hard disk
Usually , you do n't have to do this on a Mac.
See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1375 for more information .
On Windows I used to ... Use [ control ] +[ alt ] +[ delete ] to quit unresponsive programs
Command + Alt +[ Esc ] calls up the Force Quit window , which lets you pick an application to force to shut down .
Those that your Mac knows are misbehaving are usually highlighted in red .
On Windows I used to ... Use [ control ] +[ alt ] +[ delete ] to check processes and system resources
The Activity Monitor , found in Applications >
Utilities , provides an overview of what resources are being used on your system , and gives you more granular information about which processes are doing what .
If you know what you 're doing , you can use standard Unix commands in Terminal ( Applications > Utilities ) to kill specific processes using their PID .
There are many languages that are going out of style .
We do not want to mention them here because they have an impact on the culture around us .
To find out what they are , you must dig into history and find the keys to which ones work the best .
In order to preserve their sanctimony , we are reserving from telling you what they are .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Automakers submitted their turnaround plans to Congress Tuesday with the hopes of winning approval for a lucrative loan package they claim is necessary for their survival .
The plans included salary cuts for top executives , the sale of corporate jets by General Motors and Ford and the possible elimination of two GM brands - Pontiac and Saturn .
But the Big Three are also now asking the government for as much as $ 34 billion instead of the $ 25 billion they originally wanted .
General Motors , the nation 's largest automaker , said late Tuesday afternoon that it is seeking up to $ 12 billion to survive into 2010 and that it anticipates using $ 4 billion of that just this month in order to avoid bankruptcy .
But GM said it is also requesting an additional $ 6 billion line of credit to provide more funds should a severe market downturn persist .
Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) is asking for $ 9 billion .
The company said it hopes that it will not need to use the federal loans though and that it should be able to return to profitability by 2011 .
But it said it would like to be able to have access to the funds as a backstop .
Chrysler LLC confirmed its previous request for a $ 7 billion loan that it made at Congressional hearings two weeks ago .
So the automakers are asking for at least $ 28 billion and as much as $ 34 billion under the three plans .
The plans were submitted on the same day that the auto industry reported the worst U.S. sales in 26 years .
Both U.S. and top overseas automakers all reported sales declines of more than 30 % from year - ago sales , increasing the level of urgency for the beleaguered Big Three .
Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , a strong advocate of the bailout , said he is confident Congress will return next week to approve a loan package .
He said he's not concerned about the higher price tag being requested and added that members of Congress wanted an honest accounting of how much might be needed in a worst case scenario .
Speaking at a press conference Tuesday afternoon , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , also said that it was imperative that the automakers get immediate federal assistance .
" Bankruptcy is not an option .
Everyone is disadvantaged by bankruptcy .
It takes too long .
What takes a year we can do in a few weeks .
... I do n't think anyone wants to see bankruptcy , " Pelosi said .
But Pelosi would n't commit to having Congress return next week to pass a Big Three bailout .
She said if Congress does not return , the Treasury Department should use money available under the previous $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout to tide the automakers over until early next year .
It 's not clear if the Treasury Department would do this since the Bush administration has endorsing the idea of aid for the automakers but opposes using the Wall Street bailout money to help them .
Salary cuts :
As part of its plan , Ford announced that the salary of Ford CEO Alan Mulally would be cut to $ 1 a year if Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) actually borrowed money from the government .
General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) said that CEO Rick Wagoner also will accept a $ 1 salary .
Chrysler LLC CEO
Robert Nardelli is already being paid only $ 1 a year , according to the Chrysler plan .
Mulally had a base salary of $ 2 million and total compensation of $ 21.7 million last year , according to the company 's filings .
Wagoner received base pay of $ 1.6 million and total compensation of $ 14.4 million .
Closely - held Chrysler does not disclose executive pay .
Shed brands :
In an effort to cut costs , GM also suggested that two of its brands - Pontiac and Saturn - could essentially be dropped .
GM said it would make Pontiac merely a niche product sold by other dealerships and explore alternatives for Saturn dealers .
The company had previously announced it was looking at a possible sale of its Hummer brand .
Modify union contracts : GM also said it would seek additional changes in the labor contract with the United Auto Workers union to modify retiree health care plans and job guarantees the company cannot afford .
Cut jobs : GM said it will cut approximately 21,000 to 31,000 jobs by 2012 to reduce its total workforce to between 65,000 to 75,000 employees .
Wagoner said GM reviewed its plan with UAW , which approved the measure .
" They know what sacrifices need to be made on both the hourly and salaried side of the ledger , " he said .
Officials with the UAW were not immediately available for comment on GM's and Ford 's plans .
But some local union officials told CNN that national union leaders are planning to hold an emergency meeting in Detroit on Wednesday .
Restructure debt : GM said it would also seek to renegotiate its outstanding debt with lenders and bondholders .
The company had more than $ 30 billion in unsecured debt at the end of the third quarter .
But GM said it expects to make all of the about $ 28 billion in payments it owes to suppliers .
" This is part of an urgent request for federal funding to create ' a new GM ' - a lean and fully competitive company , " said Wagoner in a conference call .
" Taking these tough actions will help us weather the current economic stresses , and will position the new GM to be profitable . "
Chrysler , which was sold by German automaker Daimler a year ago to the U.S. private equity group Cerberus Capital , said it remains focused on " developing partnerships , strategic alliances or consolidations " as part of its long - term plans .
The company said it believes it could save between $ 3.5 billion and $ 9 billion a year from cost savings tied to a merger .
In November , GM said that it had halted discussions about a possible combination with Chrysler to focus on its own turnaround efforts .
Chrysler 's Nardelli said in a presentation to the company 's senior management that he realizes the $ 7 billion bridge loan is a " significant amount of public money . "
But he added that it is " the least costly alternative considering depth of the economic crisis and the options we face . "
More hybrids ... no more corporate jets :
In their plans , all three automakers also made commitments to speed up the introduction of hybrid and electric vehicles .
Ford also pledged to reverse the decades - long trend of losing money on the production of small cars in the United States .
Ford said it would increase the production of smaller vehicles such as the Ford Focus to more than 1 million a year and reduce the complexity of the car 's parts in order to reduce costs .
Ford and GM also announced plans to get rid of corporate jets .
Mulally , Wagoner and Nardelli were all roundly criticized at a House hearing last month when they admitted they had each flown their corporate jets to Washington to ask for help .
Ford said it will sell its five corporate jets .
GM said it plans to sell four of its seven jets and is exploring plans to transfer leases on the other three to another operator .
Chrysler spokesman Ed Garsten says Chrysler does not own any private aircraft but instead leases them on an as needed basis .
Mulally and Wagoner will be driving to Washington in hybrid vehicles made by their companies when they return to Capitol Hill later this week to make their case for loans .
Nardelli is also driving a hybrid to Washington .
Return to profitability in next few years
Ford said that , as a result of its turnaround plan , it believes its core North American auto operations will be breakeven or profitable in 2011 on a pre-tax basis .
The company had previously set a goal of returning those operations to profitability next year but dropped that target in May without giving a new one .
Ford also said it expects industrywide sales of 12.5 million vehicles in 2009 , 14.5 million vehicles in 2010 and 15.5 million vehicles in 2011 .
By way of comparison , U.S. auto sales averaged close to 17 million a year from 1998 through 2006 .
But GM and Chrysler submitted plans with far more conservative sales forecasts .
GM said once its restructuring plans are complete , it thinks it can be profitable even if sales only return to between 12.5 and 13 million vehicles a year .
In the press call , GM president Fritz Henderson said the company 's restructuring plan will make GM fully competitive with Japanese automaker Toyota by 2012 .
Chrysler is forecasting a return to profitability with industrywide sales of 13.7 million in 2011 and 2012 .

I 've dreamed of living off the grid for years .
I 've read how - to books about building root - cellars , passive solar heating , alternative home construction , and grey - water recycling .
From my research , I know there are people out there who 've managed to live off the grid quite happily for years .
But how do they do it ?
And what do they give up for that lifestyle ?
It takes a lot of money to get new technology , to install wiring and plumbing systems that allow for both normal and alternative electricity or drainage .
It takes a lot of money and time to buy the right land and get the right permits to build it all in the first place .
And not all green technologies are legal in the United States .
Most people who do n't have an extra million dollars in their back pocket , and are n't licensed to be their own design architect , start small .
They make one change in their lifestyle and their dependence on utilities , and then they build up and out from there .
Most people slowly and laboriously craft an independent lifestyle .
And many more people than will ever become truly off the grid are living mostly independent lifestyles .
There are tons of books , tons of blogs , tons of how - to websites about living green , and becoming just that one bit more self - sufficient than we were before .
I 'll list a few , but my links and suggestions will only scratch the surface , and for that I apologize .
The biggest challenge to living off the grid is defining what that means to you .
Do you stop drawing on municipal utility systems such as electricity and city water ?
What about city sewers ?
What about the water you use -- what do you do with it after you 've used it ?
Do you still go into the city for foods like grains , flour , sugar , olive oil ?
What about health care ?
Are you going to have a regular job -- and if so , how far are you willing to commute to get there ?
Do you own a car ?
Where do you buy gas ?
Electric cars require as much electricity as running your clothes dryer for twelve hours straight to recharge after just a few hours of use .
They require a dedicated electrical line and a special kind of plug -- just like your clothes dryer does .
How do you wash your clothes ?
Where does the fabric for your clothes come from ?
What about the products used to build your home ?
Concrete , at least for the foundation , is a requirement .
And you 'll need manufactured water pipes and electrical conduit .
What about your furniture ?
Your refrigerator ?
Your fertilizer ?
Exactly how far off the grid did you want to live in the first place ?
And how will these decisions affect your children ?
It is important to define your goals before you decide just how far down the rabbit hole you want to go .
For the purpose of this article , lets focus on utilities : water , sewer , gas , electric .
And , let 's say you live in a city or town .
Your home is hooked up to the city water and sewer systems , and you depend on the city 's electric company for your home 's power .
You use a regular washer , dryer , refrigerator , dishwasher .
Maybe you 've already replaced all your light - bulbs with those new long - life LEDs or something similar , but you want to do more .
And where do all those ineffable watts of electricity GO , anyway ??
Here in Portland , Oregon , some homeowners are experimenting with water collection systems .
One man remodeled his home so that the metal roof actually drains all the rain water it catches through a filter , and into a large cistern buried under the house .
The water is filtered a total of three times before reaching the sinks , shower , and toilets in his home .
It is potable -- drinkable -- and the current system provides enough water for him and one other family member , year - round .
He does not take long showers .
He does not leave the faucet running when he washes dishes , brushes his teeth , washes his hands .
Another person I spoke with recently purchases his family 's drinking and cooking water by the gallon from a local municipal source .
This means he does n't have to filter the rainwater and well water used for other purposes quite so religiously .
My parents get all their water from their well .
The water must be tested twice a year to make sure it is still drinkable , and has not been contaminated by their neighbor 's chemical lawn fertilizer , among other things .
Their well water system requires an electricity - driven pump to draw the water out of the well , so when they lose electric power , they can't flush the toilets or use the faucets until power is restored .
I read an article last year about a family who have managed to get off the grid while living in a large city .
They have used a hand - pump for all their water needs for the past ten years .
It takes a lot of work to pump enough water for a bath or a load of laundry , but the work does n't cost them anything but time .
There is no electric bill for pumping the water , for heating the water , for draining the water away once it 's been used .
The first step to freedom from a municipal water system is using and wasting less water .
Put a barrel under your home 's downspouts , and use the water that collects there to water your garden and wash your car , your bike , and your pets .
Securing a fine mesh across the top of the barrel keeps leaves , debris , and most bugs from landing in the barrel with the water .
Grey water from your roof , and from your shower , your dishwasher , even your laundry , can be reused in other places where you will not imbibe ( eat or drink ) the unpurified water .
The next step in a self - sufficient water - usage system is to reuse the grey water you produce for flushing toilets , watering gardens , etc .
The dishwasher may even heat water sufficiently to make it safe for use in that appliance as well .
If you build from scratch or remodel your home , consider putting in a system that allows you collect and redistribute grey water , in accordance with local building codes -- or in the hope that such codes will eventually change .
Composting toilets or low - flow toilets , low - flow shower heads , and hand - cranked clothes washing machines are all commercially available as well .
We are lucky to live in a time when new and more efficient options for off - the - grid power production and collection are constantly improving and have become commercially available .
Options range from purchasing green energy from municipal power plants to installing your own alternative energy sources and constructing or remodeling your home for passive solar gain as well .
In Portland , Oregon , PGE produces wind energy as well as more traditional energy , and gives each energy - using household the option of purchasing exclusively green energy .
It 's a great place to start .
At a recent alternative energy faire , I was told by one solar power company that a small 3 - person household with average energy needs could power their entire home on an array of three roof - mounted solar panels measuring about 5x10 feet each .
At this level , homeowners can install solar panels that feed their energy needs for most of the year , even in rainy states like Oregon .
In fact , many power companies will buy any extra energy your solar array produces , and use it to power other homes in the community .
However , most households that go this route find themselves using that money the power company paid them to buy energy in the winter months .
Most home - owners with direct solar panel systems choose this route , connecting their system to the local city power grid .
The balance between over - production in summer and over - consumption in winter may even balance out over the course of a year .
Households that want to really disconnect from the city utilities have the added cost of buying huge battery systems for their solar panels to feed into .
The solar panels charge the batteries , and the home uses that energy to run .
Battery life is improving , but this type of independent electrical system requires a certain level of knowledge and effort for the average home owner to maintain .
Families who have elected to go off - the - grid with their electrical power talk about their awareness of the electricity each appliance uses .
Do they want to blow - dry their hair or run the dishwasher today ?
Do they want to turn on another light , or sit by the window ?
Does it need to be 72 degrees in the house , or 62 degrees plus a sweater ?
Since heating and cooling are the two largest and most constant energy drains in the modern household , it is important to plan ahead and minimize these power - sucks .
Double the insulation in walls , floor , and especially the attic or roof .
Replace old , poorly sealed or condensation - prone windows .
Install highly efficient water heating and furnace systems .
Be aware that most refrigerators are not built to work with direct solar energy systems .
There are a few brands of refrigerators and other appliances that have been manufactured with extreme energy efficiency and solar panel power sources in mind .
Use power strips or configure the electrical system in your home so that you can turn off all electronic devices when they are not in use -- from your cooking stove with its built - in clock to your computer with its " sleep " mode to your DVD player with its handy stand - by feature which means it never really turns off , even when the " power " is off .
Unplug your cell phone recharger when not recharging your phone , too .
Just because it's not plugged into the phone does n't mean it 's not drawing juice from the wall .
It 's amazing how much energy our convenience appliances use when we are n't actually utilizing them .
If your home is overshadowed by trees or buildings in such a way that the experts tell you to give up on solar panels , consider wind power instead .
While traditional energy - producing wind towers require clearance , and often do n't meet city codes for height and safety restrictions , some of the newest wind - turbine designs are made for back yard use .
Bird - safe , community safe , and very compact , they begin harvesting energy in winds as low as 5 mph !
I have yet to hear specifically of wind turbines hooking into community grids for energy buy - back programs , but that does n't mean it has n't happened .
Start by watching your energy bills , and understanding how much energy your family uses at various times of the year , and why .
With this information , it will be much easier to approach local licensed alternative energy companies , and find out just how much it would cost to take your household off the grid .

The " improved " security situation in Iraq is not benefiting all Iraqis , especially not those who are gay .
Islamist death squads are engaged in a homophobic killing spree with the active encouragement of leading Muslim clerics , such as Moqtada al - Sadr , as Newsweek recently revealed .
One of these clerics , Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , issued a fatwa urging the killing of lesbians and gays in the " most severe way possible " .
The short film , Queer Fear – Gay Life , Gay Death in Iraq , produced by David Grey for Village Film , documents the tragic fates of a several individual gay Iraqis .
You can view it here .
Watch and weep .
It is a truly poignant and moving documentary about the terrorisation and murder of Iraqi lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people .
Since this film was made , the killings have continued and , many say , got worse .
For gay Iraqis there is little evidence of the transition to democracy .
They do n't experience any newfound respect for human rights .
Life for them is even worse than under the tyrant Saddam Hussein .
It is a death sentence in today 's " liberated " Iraq to love a person of the same sex , or for a woman to have sex outside of marriage , or for a Muslim to give up his or her faith or embrace another religion .
The reality on the ground is that theocracy is taking hold of the country , including in Basra , which was abandoned by the British military .
In place of foreign occupation , the city 's inhabitants now endure the terror of fundamentalist militias and death squads .
Those who are deemed insufficiently devout and pure are liable to be assassinated .
The death squads of the Badr organisation and the Mahdi army are targeting gays and lesbians , according to UN reports , in a systematic campaign of sexual cleansing .
They proudly boast of their success , claiming that they have already exterminated all " perverts and sodomites " in many of the major cities .
You can view photos of a few of the LGBT victims of these summary executions
here and here .
My friends in Iraq have relayed to me the tragic story of five gay activists , who belonged to the underground gay rights movement , Iraqi LGBT .
Eye - witnesses confirm that they saw the men being led out of a house at gunpoint by officers in police uniform .
Yes , Iraqi police !
Nothing has been heard of the five victims since then .
In all probability , they have been executed by the police – or by Islamist death squads who have infiltrated the Iraqi police and who are using their uniforms to carry out so - called honour killings of gay people , unchaste women and many others .
The arrested and disappeared men were Amjad 27 , Rafid 29 , Hassan 24 , Ayman 19 and Ali 21 .
As members of Iraq 's covert gay rights movement , for the previous few months they had been documenting the killing of lesbians and gays , relaying details of the murders to the outside world , and providing safe houses and support to other gay people fleeing the death squads .
Their abduction is just one of many outrages by anti-gay death squads .
lslamist killers burst into the home of two lesbian women in the city of Najaf .
They shot them dead , slashed their throats , and also murdered a young child who the women had rescued from the sex trade .
The two women , both in their mid-30s , were members of Iraqi LGBT .
They were providing a safe house for gay men on the run from death squads .
By sheer luck , none of the men who were being given shelter in the house were at home when the assassins struck .
They have since fled to Baghdad , and are hiding in an Iraqi LGBT safe house there .
Large parts of Iraq are now under the de facto control of the militias and their death squad units .
They enforce a harsh interpretation of sharia law , summarily executing people for what they denounce as " crimes against Islam " .
These " crimes " include listening to western pop music , wearing shorts or jeans , drinking alcohol , selling videos , working in a barber 's shop , homosexuality , dancing , having a Sunni name , adultery and , in the case of women , not being veiled or walking in the street unaccompanied by a male relative .
Two militias are doing most of the killing .
They are the armed wings of major parties in the Bush and Brown - backed Iraqi government .
The Mahdi army is the militia of Moqtada al - Sadr , and the Badr organisation is the militia of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( SCIRI ) , which is the leading political force in Baghdad 's governing coalition .
Both militias want to establish an Iranian - style religious dictatorship .
The allied occupation of Iraq is bad enough .
But if the Mahdi or Badr militias gain in influence and strength , as seems likely in the long - term , it could result in a reign of religious terror many times worse .
Saddam Hussein was a bloody tyrant .
I campaigned against his blood - stained misrule for nearly 30 years .
But while Saddam was president , there was certainly no danger of gay people being assassinated in their homes and in the street by religious fanatics .
Since his overthrow , the violent persecution of lesbians and gays is much worse .
Even children suspected of being gay are abducted and later found shot in the head .
Lesbian and gay Iraqis cannot seek the protection of the police , since the police are heavily infiltrated by fundamentalists , especially the Badr militia .
The death squads can kill with impunity .
Pro-fundamentalist ministers in the Iraqi government are turning a blind eye to the killings , and helping to protect the killers .
Some " liberation " .
Iraqi LGBT is appealing for funds to help the work of their members in Iraq .
Since they do n't yet have a bank account , they request that cheques should be made payable to " OutRage ! " , with a cover note marked " For Iraqi LGBT " , and sent to OutRage ! , PO Box 17816 , London SW14 8WT .

女性の7人に1人、男性の4人に1人が生涯独身で過ごす時代です。頼れる親族がいれば良いですが、居ない方は健康でなくなった時のための老後の準備をしておかなければ最悪は路頭に迷うこともあります。
実は、独身の方の終活は、家族が居る方より大変ってことをご存知でしょうか。
配偶者や子供がいれば介護や病気の世話をしてくれたり、葬儀やお墓の手配をしてくれたりしますが、独身の方はそうもいきません。
1人ぐらしのため誰にも気づかれずに死んでいく独身の方も昨今少なくありません。日本では孤独死をする方が年々増えているのが実情なんです(^^；
そこで、独身者が始める終活の進め方をまとめましたのでご覧ください。
独身者の終活の進め 方
生涯独身で過ごす女性や男性が増える昨今、心配されるポイントとして「孤独死」のリスクが挙げられます。
万が一、親類縁者がいない方や、親戚と疎遠な方が孤独死してしまった場合は行政がお葬式の手配をしてくれます。
ですが、行政が行う送葬は、直接、火葬され公営の共同墓に納められます。ですので、葬儀はされないただ火葬されるだけなんです(^^；
法律上は24時間以内に火葬することができないので、24時間どこかに安置された後火葬されることとなります。
このような終焉を迎えたくない方は、生前から葬儀社と相談したり、お墓を準備したりして終活をしましょう。
終活は残された人生をより良く生きるための活動です。葬儀やお墓のことだけではなく、身辺整理や老後の介護なども考えておく必要があります。
身辺整理では、使わなくなった電気製品や着なくなった衣類の整理・家具などから土地や家などの財産にいたるまで整理を行っていきます。
家族や親類が複数人いると法律にしたがった分割手続きなども必要となってきますが独身者の方はその必要がありません。ですが、亡くなったあとそれらの財産をどうするかを考えておかなければなりません。
法定相続人がいない場合は、家庭裁判所が相続財産管理人を選定し、管理人が官報で相続人捜索の広告をすることになります。
広告をしてから一定期間経過しても相続人が現れなかった場合は「相続人の不存在」が確定し、故人が生前深くかかわった方に遺産分与することになります。
それでも残った財産は最終的には国のものになりってしまいます。
ですので、独身者の方でも遺言書を残しておくことをオススメ致します。
生前お世話になった方や介護をしてもらった方に財産を分けることができるんです。
ちなみに、法律で定められた遺言の方式としては，「自筆証書遺言」・「秘密証書遺言」・「公正証書遺言」などがあります。
自筆証書遺言は、民法968条1項でこのように定められています。
第 968 条 自筆証書によって遺言をするには、遺言者が、その全文、日付及び氏名を自書し、これに印を押さなければならない。
２ 自筆証書中の加除その他の変更は、遺言者が、その場所を指示し、これを変更した旨を付記して特にこれに署名し、かつ、その変更の場所に印を押さなければ、その効力を生じない。
ですので、遺言者が自筆で遺言書の全文を作成すること、遺言者が作成した遺言書に作成日付と遺言者の氏名を自書すること、遺言書に遺言者が押印することが必要になります。
秘密証書遺言は、民法970条1項でこのように定められています。
一 遺言者が、その証書に署名し、印を押すこと。
二 遺言者が、その証書を封じ、証書に用いた印章をもってこれに封印すること。
三 遺言者が、公証人一人及び証人二人以上の前に封書を提出して、自己の遺言書である旨並びにその筆者の氏名及び住所を申述すること。
四 公証人が、その証書を提出した日付及び遺言者の申述を封紙に記載した後、遺言者及び証人とともにこれに署名し、印を押すこと。
２ 968条第２項の規定は、秘密証書による遺言について準用する。 第970 条 秘密証書によって遺言をするには、次に掲げる方式に従わなければならない。一 遺言者が、その証書に署名し、印を押すこと。二
遺言者が、その証書を封じ、証書に用いた印章をもってこれに封印すること。三
遺言者が、公証人一人及び証人二人以上の前に封書を提出して、自己の遺言書である旨並びにその筆者の氏名及び住所を申述すること。四
公証人が、その証書を提出した日付及び遺言者の申述を封紙に記載した後、遺言者及び証人とともにこれに署名し、印を押すこと。２
968条第２項の規定は、秘密証書による遺言について準用する。 ［参照条文］
（自筆証書遺言 ）
第 968条２ 項 自筆証書中の加除その他の変更は、遺言者が、その場所を指示し、これを変更した旨を付記して特にこれに署名し、かつ、その変更の場所に印を押さなければ、その効力を生じない。
また、公正証書遺言は、民法969条でこのように定められています。
第 969 条 公正証書によって遺言をするには、次に掲げる方式に従わなければならない。
一 証人二人以上の立会いがあること 。
二 遺言者が遺言の趣旨を公証人に口授すること。
三 公証人が、遺言者の口述を筆記し、これを遺言者及び証人に読み聞かせ、又は閲覧させること。
四 遺言者及び証人が、筆記の正確なことを承認した後、各自これに署名し、印を押すこと。ただし、遺言者が署名することができない場合は、公証人がその事由を付記して、署名に代えることができる。
五 公証人が、その証書は前各号に掲げる方式に従って作ったものである旨を付記して、これに署名し、印を押すこと。
独身者の終活には、これらの財産に関わることだけではなく、身辺整理もあります。
使わなくなった電気製品や着なくなった衣類の整理・家具などから土地や家などの財産にいたるまで整理を行っていきます。
身体が自由に動いて、精神も健康なうちにそれらを処分したりして少なくしておきましょう。
また、老後の住まいや介護などもどうすのかも準備しておく必要があります。

Hardening the Linux server
An introduction to GNU / Linux server security
Linux already claims a large share of the server market , and forecasts show that this share will increase because of the demands of cloud computing .
Enterprise IT shops concerned with security need to take a look at the vulnerabilities these servers pose to the network and how these machines can be secured .
This article demonstrates how to tighten Secure Shell ( SSH ) sessions , configure a firewall , and set up intrusion detection .
Plan the server installation
Securing the desktop and operating system Although many core security concepts apply to both the desktop operating system and the server operating system , the ways they 're secured are different .
By default , a desktop operating system provides the user with an environment that can be run out of the box .
Desktop operating systems are sold on the premise that they require minimal configuration and come loaded with as many applications as possible to get the user up and running .
Conversely , a server 's operating system should limit access to the minimal level that will allow normal functioning .
The first step in hardening a GNU / Linux server is determining the server 's function , which determines the services that need to be installed on it .
For example , if the server in question is used as a web server , you should install Linux , Apache , MySQL , and Perl / PHP / Python ( LAMP ) services .
If the server is used for directory services , the only applications and services that should be permitted to run on it are those required for the task it 's meant to perform .
Nothing extra should be installed for two reasons :
Installing extra software or running extra services creates unnecessary vulnerabilities .
For example , if you run Lightweight Directory Access Protocol ( LDAP ) on a server for directory services , both the operating system and LDAP must be up - to - date with security fixes and patches .
If LAMP ( or any other software ) were installed on this server , it also would require updates and attention , even if it were n't used .
Its mere existence on the server gives an attacker another avenue into your system .
Installing extra software on a server means that someone will be tempted to use that server for something other than its intended use .
Using the server for tasks other than its main task diverts resources from its primary job and exposes it to potential threats .
GUI login
Some people who rely on a GUI such as GNOME or KDE might be inclined to install a graphical login such as the GNOME Display Manager .
This is n't necessary , because you can log in from the command - line interface just as easily as you can through a GUI - based login screen .
The only difference is that you have to use the sudo startx command if you need to administer your server through a GUI .
You need to decide if you want to install a graphical user interface ( GUI ) .
GNU / Linux admins have long held a certain pride in administering their networks and servers from a command - line interface .
But some systems administrators have begun administering their GNU / Linux servers through a GUI .
A GUI can tax a system 's resources and , because it's an extra service that is n't necessary , create vulnerabilities .
However , the GUI process can be killed when it's no longer in use , and it makes certain tasks , such as working with a database , much easier for the administrator .
If you decide you want to install a GUI , the following instructions show you how to install GNOME as a desktop GUI :
Log in to your system .
To install the GNOME core , type the following at the command prompt and press Enter :
sudo aptitude install x - window - system - core gnome - core Type your sudo password , and then press Enter .
You 're informed about what is being installed .
Type Y , and then press Enter .
This installs a scaled - down version of GNOME that keeps the features of the desktop environment to a minimum and saves system resources .
To install the full - featured version of GNOME , type :
sudo aptitude install x - window - system - core gnome Press Enter and follow the process until GNOME is installed on your system .
When either package is finished installing , you 're still at the command prompt .
To open GNOME , type sudo startx .
Tighten the Secure Shell protocol
SSH gives a user a connection to a remote computer ; systems administrators commonly use SSH to log in to their servers from a remote computer to do maintenance and administrative tasks .
Even though SSH provides a much greater level of security than the protocols it replaced , you can do some things to make it more secure .
Security by obscurity
Install Emacs
To install Emacs , use sudo aptitude install emacs .
Now , locate the portion of the file where you set the port number .
When you 've found it ( the default is port 22 ) , you can change it to an arbitrary number .
More than 65,000 ports are available : Choose something at the upper end of the scale , but a number you 'll remember .
Remember , skilled attackers know how people think .
Changing the port number to 22222 or 22022 is a common mistake , so choose a number that is n't easily guessed .
One of the most common methods for hardening SSH is to change the port number used to access it .
The theory is that an attacker using the default port or TCP 22 to establish a connection will be denied access because the service is running on a secure port .
However , changing the port number wo n't prevent an attacker with a port scanner from finding the SSH port if he takes the time to scan all of the ports on your server .
For this reason , many systems administrators do n't bother changing the port .
But this approach does prevent script kiddies from attacking SSH with automated tools dedicated to finding open TCP 22 ports , and impatient attackers may grow weary of scanning your server if they do n't find SSH running in the first range of ports they scan .
To change the SSH port address , first install SSH on your server .
Type the following command , and then press Enter :
sudo aptitude install openssh - server
Type your password .
This command installs openssh to use for remote logins to your server .
When you have an SSH file to configure , copy the file — just in case something happens during configuration .
You can always revert to the original .
Then :
At the command line , type the following command , then press Enter :
sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config
/ete/ssh/sshd_config.back
Type your password to complete the backup of this file .
Now , you need to change the permissions for the sshd_config file so you can change it .
To do so :
Type the following command , then press Enter :
sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Now you can use a text editor such as Emacs or vi to change the file :
emacs
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
Leave Emacs or vi open as you make more changes to this file .
Root login permissions
The root user in all Ubuntu distributions is disabled , but you can activate this account .
If you 're using SSH , you should deny the root account permission to log in to the server remotely in the event that you or an attacker has activated this account .
While you have the editor open , scroll down to the line that reads PermitRootLogin .
The default is yes .
Whitelist users
Another step you can take to harden SSH on your server is to allow only certain people to use this service .
This process is known as whitelisting .
To create a whitelist , you first need the user names of the people who will be allowed to use SSH to access the server remotely .
Then , perform these steps :
Add this line to your sshd_config file :
# Allow only certain users AllowUsers username username username Substitute user names from your list in place of the word username .
Alternately , you can allow groups access to SSH logins by using :
# Allow only certain groups AllowGroups group group Again , substitute your user groups for the word group in the example .
Save your configuration file , and exit your editor .
Restart SSH for the changes to take effect .
You do n't need to shut down your computer — just type sudo service ssh restart .
Press Enter and provide your password .
The service restarts and tells you [ OK ] .
You can secure SSH in other ways , although those are for more advanced users .
When you 've had more experience working with GNU / Linux and SSH , consider taking those steps .
Write firewall rules
You can deny access to your server through your firewall .
Ubuntu Server uses a firewall called Uncomplicated FireWall ( UFW ) , which is a management tool for iptables .
Iptables filters network packets based on rules the systems administrator writes .
Iptables can be complicated for beginners , but UFW simplifies it .
Using UFW can help you harden your server , but if you write rules for iptables , you can fine - tune a server 's security .
There was a time when the systems administrator had to install UFW using sudo aptitude install ufw .
However , Ubuntu and many other GNU / Linux distributions come with this application installed ; it 's just not enabled by default .
To enable UFW , type the command sudo ufw enable into an open terminal and press Enter .
Now , type :
sudo ufw status verbose
Press Enter .
The output you see should look similar to that of Listing 1 :

youruser@yourcomputer :~$ sudo ufw status verbose [ sudo ] password for youruser : Status : active Logging : on ( low ) Default : deny ( incoming ) , allow ( outgoing ) New profiles : skip youruser@yourcomputer : ~ $
Notice that by default , all incoming traffic is denied .
You can change this to allow all incoming traffic , but that would defeat the purpose of the firewall .
Instead , you can create rules that specify which traffic you 'll allow by :
Port and protocol
IP address
Service
Firewall rules by port and protocol
The easiest — and most common — way to write a firewall rule is to block traffic on a specific port .
For instance , if you would like to allow incoming traffic on port 80 , you would enter this command in the terminal :
sudo ufw allow 80
You also have the option of specifying which protocol is allowed .
If no protocol is specified , then both TCP and User Datagram Protocol ( UDP ) are covered under the rule .
However , to allow only TCP traffic on port 80 , the command is :
sudo ufw allow 80 / tcp
To allow incoming traffic on port 80 for UDP , the same syntax applies :
sudo ufw allow 80/udp
To deny traffic for all of these examples , enter :
sudo ufw deny 80 sudo ufw deny 80 / tcp sufo ufw deny 80/udp
Firewall rules by IP address
You can also write rules that pertain to specific IP address and even subnets .
To block a specific IP address , the rule is :
sudo ufw deny from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
To block an entire subnet , you need to enter the entire range of addresses .
For example , for this class C network , you would type :
sufo ufw deny from 192.168.1.0/24
The same syntax applies should you need to allow traffic from only one IP address or subnet — just substitute deny for allow .
Firewall rules by service
Firewall rules can also be written to govern an entire service .
For example , if you want to deny SSH traffic , the rule would read :
sudo ufw deny ssh
To allow SSH traffic , state this fact by typing :
sudo ufw allow ssh
Stopping the firewall
In the event you need to undo a firewall rule that you have written , you can delete the rule as follows :
sudo ufw delete deny ssh
To stop the firewall altogether , you have the option of disabling it using :
sudo ufw disable
Disabling a firewall that runs essential services or houses sensitive data is inadvisable .
Even taking down this protection for a moment could open the server and its resources to threats .
Monitoring your system
After you take steps to prevent intrusion , you need to set up a monitoring system to detect whether an attack against your server has taken place .
If you 're alerted to an attack , you 're better prepared to handle it .
Tripwire ( see Related topics ) alerts you to unauthorized activity that takes place with system files on your server .
Use Logwatch ( see Related topics ) to create reports you can analyze .
Tripwire
Tripwire sets up a baseline of normal system binaries for your computer .
It then reports any anomalies against this baseline through an email alert or through a log .
Essentially , if the system binaries have changed , you 'll know about it .
If a legitimate installation causes such a change , no problem .
But if the binaries are altered as a result of a Trojan horse - type installation , you have a starting point from which to research the attack and fix the problems .
To install and configure Tripwire through the command line , type the following command and then press Enter :
sudo aptitude install tripwire Choose Yes to all of the questions during the installation .
You may be asked to create a passphrase .
If you are , make note of it for future use .
When you reach the screen shown in Figure 1 , Tripwire has been installed .
Click OK .
Tripwire installation complete
Open your text editor to make the configurations shown in Listing 2 , substituting your server name for hostname ( you 'll be using Emacs here ) :
Tripwire configurations hostname ~ # emerge tripwire hostname ~ # cd /etc / tripwire hostname ~ # emacs - nw /etc/ tripwire/twpol.txt hostname ~ # emacs -nw /etc/tripwire/twcfg.txt
Enter the following command to create keys and sign the policy :
hostname ~ # cd /etc/ tripwire ; sh ./twinstall.sh
Initialize everything , and create the database using the next command ( you should be asked to supply your passphrase here ) :
hostname ~ # tripwire -- init
When this process is complete , Tripwire has created a snapshot of your system .
This baseline will be used to check whether any critical files have been changed .
If they have , you 'll be alerted to it .
You can run reports from Tripwire , as well .
From your editor , type this command :
sudo twprint -- print - report -r\
Now , your prompt changes to a single carat ( > ) .
At this new prompt , type :
/var/lib/tripwire/report/[hostname]-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.twr| less
If you do n't know the exact time you ran your report , navigate to the directory / var / lib / tripwire / reports to see the complete file name .
To fine - tune the capabilities of Tripwire , you can look to twadmin .
You can also set a cron job to email you a copy of this report each day or configure Tripwire to email you if an anomaly is reported .
Logwatch
Logwatch helps you monitor your system 's log files .
This program requires a working mail server on your network to email the logs to you .
If you want to change the .conf file , you need to open /usr / share / logwatch/default.conf/logwatch.conf and look for the line that reads MailTo .
Change user.name.domain.tld to your email address .
You can install Logwatch with this command :
sudo aptitude install logwatch
To email the logs to yourself , type :
logwatch -- mailto email@youraddress.com -- range All
Pressing Enter sends a copy of the report to the email address specified .
If you are n't running a mail server on your network but would still like to see a Logwatch report , the following command provides it on your screen :
logwatch -- range All -- archives -- detail Med
The output spans several screens ; press Shift - Page Up to move to the beginning of the report .
Users and groups
On a GNU / Linux system , you can organize users into groups for easy administration — but you also need to provide access to files and folders through permissions .
No blanket " power user " gives users access to everything on a computer or network , as it does on a Windows operating system .
The GNU / Linux system was designed to be more secure ; it works off a 3x3 system for granting permissions :
Do n't run as root Never , never , never run anything as the root user in a GNU / Linux system .
When you need to run something as root , use the sudo command .
Any systems administrator can use the sudo command if you give him or her the password .
To see how and when the sudo password is being used , check out / var / log / messages .
Because you 're looking for all uses of sudo , use the grep command to find them .
File permissions .
Read ( r ) , write ( w ) , and execute ( x ) .
Each of these permissions is also given a number : read = 4 , write = 2 , and execute = 1 .
Read ( r ) , write ( w ) , and execute ( x ) .
Each of these permissions is also given a number : read = 4 , write = 2 , and execute = 1 . Directory - level permissions .
Enter , which gives permission to enter the directory ;
Show , which gives permission to see the contents of the directory ; and Write , which gives permission to create a new file or subdirectory .
Enter , which gives permission to enter the directory ;
Show , which gives permission to see the contents of the directory ; and Write , which gives permission to create a new file or subdirectory .
How permissions are assigned .
Permissions are assigned in three ways : by user level , group level , and other level .
The user level defines the user who created the file or directory ; the group level defines the group the user is in ; and the other level is for any user outside of the user 's group .
The user permissions are granted first :
For example , r/w/ x means the user can read , write , and execute the file or files in the folder .
You can apply the number value to each permission .
Thus , if a user can read , write , and execute , you add the corresponding numbers 4 , 2 , and 1 for a total of 7 .
Next come the group permissions .
For instance , the other members of the user 's group may be able to read and execute but not write .
Adding up the corresponding values gives you 5 .
Those in the others category can only read the files , so their numerical value is 4 .
Thus , the permissions for the file or folder are 754 .
When permissions are set to 777 , everyone is given the ability to read , write , and execute .
The chmod command changes permissions for files and directories .
If you want to change ownership of a user , use the chown command .
To change group ownership of a file or directory , use the chgrp command .
Encryption
Encryption is the process of scrambling data stored on a computer in a manner that makes it unreadable to anyone who does n't possess the key to re-create the data in its original form .
Data that has been encrypted can be stored on the local computer , stored on a network share , or transmitted to other users and computers .
You can encrypt an entire hard disk or the partitions of the disk .
This should be done at installation .
You can also secure data through encryption by creating a directory and encrypting it .
For example , if you 've set up a file server , you may want to encrypt a directory that holds sensitive information .
Before you go forward with protecting your data , you need to install eCryptfs from the Ubuntu repositories by typing :
sudo aptitude install ecryptfs - utils
When installed , set up a private directory where you can store your encrypted files and folders .
To do so , type this command in the terminal :
ecryptfs - setup - private
You 'll be asked to enter your login password and then to create a mount pass ( or have one generated for you ) .
Write down this passphrase :
You 'll need it to recover data manually .
Log out of your computer , and then log back in .
When you are logged in , any folders or files you write in ~ / Private will be encrypted .
Recovering data
In an emergency , you may need to recover your encrypted data .
You can do so automatically by making sure that your hard drive is mounted , and then opening the terminal .
At the prompt , run :
sudo encryptfs - recover - private
Follow the prompts , and you 'll be able to access your data after it has been decrypted .
Make sure you save it in another location so you can access it again .
Additional security steps
Now that you 've created a solid foundation for hardening your server , take a few more steps to enhance the security measures you 've put into place .
Never install updates and patches on a production server until they 've been tested on a test , or development , server .
Because a GUI may not be installed on your server , you have to download any updates and patches through the terminal .
When you 're ready to install updates , enter the command sudo apt - get update , and then sudo apt - get dist - upgrade .
In some cases , you need to restart your server .
Malware
Although viruses do n't pose much of a threat to the GNU / Linux server , if you run Samba to share Windows files , make sure an antivirus scanner like ClamAV is installed so infected files do n't spread throughout your system .
In addition to viruses , worms , Trojans , and the like , there is also the danger of a hacker installing a rootkit on your system and gaining root - level permissions to capture passwords , intercept traffic , and create other vulnerabilities .
To combat this threat , install tools such as the Rootkit Hunter , ( rkhunter ) , and chkrootkit on the server ( see Related topics for a link to " Hardening the Linux desktop , " which contains instructions ) .
Backup and recovery
Servers that house terabytes of information , corporate websites , or catalogs for directory services need to have a backup and recovery strategy in place .
Not only does this make sense , but sometimes e-discovery laws and regulations require that you hand over information upon request .
Most corporate networks can afford redundancy through multiple servers , and smaller networks can find peace of mind through virtualization and backup and recovery software .
If you 're planning to run backup and recovery software from the Ubuntu repositories , Simple Backup ( SBackup ) is an excellent choice , because it can be run from either the command - line interface or a GUI .
When backing up server data on a corporate network , it 's important to store your backup files outside the server .
Portable storage devices provide large amounts of storage space at reasonable prices , and they 're excellent options for storing backed - up files and directories .
Passwords
As the systems administrator , you 're required to set passwords for your server 's root account and possibly other sensitive accounts in your organization , such as MySQL databases or FTP connections .
You can't force strong passwords for your users with Ubuntu Server , but you can be sure you train users on how to create a strong password .
Network password policy
If you run directory services like OpenLDAP , you have the option of enforcing strong passwords across your network with some of the configuration options available .
Passwords should be at least eight characters long and contain at least three of the following : an uppercase letter , a lowercase letter , a number , or a symbol .
One way to teach users to use strong passwords but keep them from writing down complex passwords on sticky notes is to have them use passphrases .
Something like Myf@voritecolorisBlue ! is much easier to remember than M$iuR78 $ , and both meet minimal complexity standards .
The immutable laws of security
Scott Culp of Microsoft drafted what he called the 10 Immutable Laws of Security ( see Related topics ) .
The 10 laws for administrators are an excellent foundation for hardening any system if applied correctly .
Security is n't about risk avoidance , he says , it 's about risk management .
Things happen .
There may be a malware outbreak , your website may be attacked , or a natural disaster might strike .
At some point , the security of your system will be tested .
Make sure you 've done everything you can to protect it , and deal with the threat in a way that keeps your server and its resources available to the users who count on it .
And remember : Throwing more technology at a security problem wo n't solve it .
Vigilance on the part of the systems administrator , buy - in on the part of management , and acceptance on the part of users must all be in place for a security policy to work effectively .
Conclusion
The tasks outlined in this article and " Hardening the Linux desktop " should give you a solid knowledge base on the topic of system security .
Keep in mind that these articles are aimed at beginners to provide a foundation for learning more about GNU / Linux security .

( NaturalNews )
Making public predictions about the economy , terrorism , politics and health care is always risky business .
There are too many variables to track with much certainty , and nobody has a crystal ball that really works .
But by looking at the big picture and monitoring trends , we can make some educated guesses about what 's likely to happen in 2009 .
The list that follows describes my best predictions for 2009 .
They are based on the honest observation of reality combined with the intelligence to see patterns in the chaos .
As usual , most of these predictions will seem outlandish right up to the day they occur , at which point they will seem obvious .
Disclaimer :
Do not make financial decisions based on this information .
All financial decisions involve risk .
I make no warranty about the accuracy of this information , as they are just educated guesses .
Confidence in prediction : 90 % Big Pharma is headed for tough economic times in 2009 and beyond .
In fact , I predict a long , steady contraction in the pharmaceutical business from here forward , and in the 2009 - 2011 timeframe , you 'll see several large drug companies undergo mergers , acquisitions or layoffs .
There are several big trends to pay attention to here .
First , Big Pharma 's research pipeline is scarce .
They do n't have any more blockbuster drugs that would help them cash in on disease in the years ahead .
Second , the Big Pharma scam is finally starting to be understood by more and more people , including some journalists , scientists , lawmakers and even many doctors .
They 're realizing that the Big Pharma / FDA conspiracy is based on fraud , not science , and that The third big trend that 's bringing down Big Pharma is the internet .
Through truth - telling websites like NaturalNews , consumers are learning the truth about the dangers of pharmaceuticals and the promise of safe , natural remedies that cost a fraction of the price .
The more people who get online and read journals like PLoS ( or websites like Natural News ) , the more customers the drug companies lose .
In essence , the pharmaceutical industry has been a fraud , and the fraud is on the verge of being uncovered by the mainstream .
When that happens , you can expect a sharp contraction of the pharmaceutical industry , followed by a similar increase in the sales of natural health products and nutritional supplements .
Big Pharma can only survive at its current size by doing three things :
1) Achieving legal immunity for all its products ( which could be decided soon by the U.S. Supreme Court ) 2 )
Outlawing natural health websites ( there is an effort underway to accomplish this , too ) 3 )
Eliminating the competition by outlawing nutritional supplements ( this is the whole point of Codex ) If those three fail , Big Pharma will suffer a prolonged contraction as more and more patients say no to drugs and turn to safe , natural remedies to enhance and protect their health .
This brings me to prediction # 2 ... Confidence in prediction : 75 %I predict the U.S. Supreme Court will rule in favor of Big Pharma in a pending court case , betraying the American public by taking away its right to sue over dangerous pharmaceuticals that harm or kill .
The victory will be short - lived , however , as a Democratic - controlled Congress will pass new legislation in 2009 that will reestablish the right of consumers to sue drug companies for dangerous products that cause harm .
Confidence in prediction : 80 % This prediction is already well underway , so perhaps it's not a fair prediction to include in this list , but I did publicly predict this in early October , 2008 , in myaudio seminar , which took place long before the commercial bankruptcies started to take place ( http://www.truthpublishing.com/Health_Ranger... ) .
For 2009 , I predict the post - Christmas economy will see accelerating bankruptcies of even more retailers and shopping malls , and many commercial real estate holders will go belly up , causing a liquidity crisis in the commercial markets just like we say in the private homes real estate market .
The only retailers immune to this will be the low - cost , " value " retailers like Wal - Mart and Costco .
Confidence in prediction : 50 % All the trillions of dollars the Fed has been dumping into the money supply will start to cause noticeable inflation by the end of 2009 .
Food prices will spike 20 - 40 percent compared to December , 2008 prices , and the cost of other goods ( clothing , services , etc. ) will increase somewhat less .
By 2010 , food prices could be 50 % higher than they are right now in late 2008 .
A related prediction on this matter is that if food prices get too high , the Obama Administration will likely put price controls in place for basic food items like milk and bread .
Although this may not take place until 2010 or 2011 , when it does it will result in widespread food shortages , setting off a humanitarian crisis as poor families in America face starvation for the first time in many generations .
Who will bail out the hungry ?
Too bad the Federal Reserve can't print food , huh ?
Confidence in prediction : 60 % The melamine scandal will widen in 2009 , and trace amounts of melamine will be found in popular meal replacement products , all of which are essentially " adult infant formula " made by the same companies that make the infant formula now found to be contaminated with trace amounts of melamine .
Manufacturers will resist recalls , and the FDA will be under increasing fire to revoke its 1 ppm " safe level " announcement , replacing it with a decision based on science , not business interests .
Sub- prediction : Eventually , it will be discovered that the melamine contamination is caused by animal feed used at dairy farms .
Although this discovery may not come until 2010 - 2012 , it will result in calls for widespread changes in the feed practices of dairy farms .
Sales of milk products will plummet temporarily , then recover steadily as American consumers forget about the scandal and keep chugging contaminated cow 's milk .
Confidence in prediction : 90 % The U.S. financial crisis is n't just national , it 's also .
( Or should I say ) Before the end of 2009 , I predict at least three U.S. cities or states will declare bankruptcy ( or the equivalent of bankruptcy ) .
California is already in a huge fiscal crisis , and several major U.S. cities have asked for bailout funds to continue their operations .
The problem , you see , is that city and state governments all ramped up their spending in the midst of the lucrative housing bubble , during which record property taxes were flowing into their coffers .
But with the housing bubble implosion came the sudden loss of property tax revenues ( and sales tax revenues on property sales , in some states ) .
And that has landed these cities and states in a financial situation from which there is no escape other than reduced spending or higher taxes .
And that brings me to the next prediction ... 2009 will see new taxes explode across America .
Cities , states and the federal government will all initiate record tax increases in an effort to stave off financial collapse caused by excessive spending .
But rather than cutting the spending ( because government hates to cut spending , since that means it would have to shrink ) , government authorities across the nation will resort to record tax increases in order to meet budgetary requirements .
All this brings up an interesting question :
Why could n't states just whip out a printing press and print their own money ?
Could n't California declare a new currency called the " California Dollar " and simply print a hundred billion dollars and use that to finance its operations ?
That would be stupid , of course .
The currency would eventually be worthless and anyone investing in the currency would lose money .
You might even call it counterfeiting , right ?
And yet , think about it :
That 's exactly what the federal government is doing on a much larger scale , to the tune of over sevendollars .
It 's the greatest counterfeiting scandal that 's ever been witnessed in the history of money !
By 2012 , if the United States government even exists by then , you can expect taxes to have risen so sharply that for many people it will no longer make sense to even hold a job .
With government confiscating as much as 70 % of your paycheck , what 's the point of working at all ?
You might as well do nothing and collect welfare .
That 's where the U.S. is headed .
As taxes sharply increase , you can also expect a ballooning black market economy , where cash , barter and gold are the primary means of exchange .
Confidence in prediction : 85 % This is n't really a difficult prediction to make .
Now that Coca - Cola and PepsiCo are behind stevia , it 's only a matter of time before the FDA approves it .
( In fact , its approval may arrive before the end of 2008 , although there 's no certainty of that . )
Once stevia is approved , a wave of stevia - sweetened products will be unleashed .
You 'll find stevia used in " diet " products , " diabetic " products and " natural " products covering everything from low - sugar breakfast cereals to zero - calorie gelatin treats .
It will be a boon for consumers and diabetics who will now finally have a safe , natural sweetener to replace aspartame , sucralose and saccharin .
Confidence in prediction : 25 % by 2009 , 60 % by 2012 The only reason the United States is still able to get cheap money loaned to it by other countries ( China , Japan , UK , etc. ) is because it somehow manages to keep a relatively high credit rating .
This effectively allow the U.S. Treasury to pay lower rates of interest on the debt it owes the central banks of other countries .
Even then , the interest on the national debt is somewhere in the neighborhood of 25 % of the federal budget right now .
Well , folks , it 's about to get much , much larger .
Why ?
Because the Moody 's credit rating of the U.S. Treasury will be downgraded before 2012 , and possibly even in 2009 .
Currently , Moody 's continues to give the U.S. Treasury an " AAA " credit rating .
This rating , of course , is complete nonsense in my opinion , and it has most likely been enforced with some kind of threat .
Any honest assessment of the U.S. financial situation would immediately result in a declaration of " junk bond " status .
But Moody's , like most other conventional credit rating companies , seems more interested in protecting the power of the United States than in telling the truth to investors , and thus the U.S. Treasury remains at a ridiculous " AAA " rating .
In fact , I defy Moody 's to produce any financial logic or criteria by which the U.S. Treasury could possibly have a triple - A rating .
With the nation now $ 10 trillion in debt and bleeding another $ 7.7 trillion in bailout promises , with its economy now well into a depression and its manufacturing base all but gutted , it would be nothing short of a Biblical miracle to see the U.S. ever pay back its debt .
And yet the AAA credit rating somehow persists .
Like I said , I must be enforced with threats of some kind , because it sure is n't enforced based on honest accounting .
In any case , 2009 could very well be the year that even Moody 's can no longer lie about the U.S. Treasury , and it could downgrade the credit rating to something more realistic .
After all , even Moody 's must realize it 's losing credibility each and every day it claims the Treasury has a triple - A credit rating .
If this continues , investors will eventually realize Moody 's can't be trusted , and the company 's entire business could collapse sort of like Arthur Anderson in the wake of its own accounting scandal .
Should the U.S. Treasury rating be reduced , that 's a sign to head for the hills , because it means the U.S. debt will , from that point forward , suffer from .
Imagine owing $ 100,000 on credit cards and paying 25 % of your monthly take - home pay just to meet the interest payments on what you owe the credit card companies , and then suddenly the credit card companies double the interest rate on you .
Your monthly payments skyrocket .
And since you can't afford to pay any more than you 've already been paying , you start taking out cash advances on those cards , even while you 're losing ground on the interest payments .
Now you 're paying interest on the interest of the debt , and the debt continues to multiply in a hellish geometric pattern until you 're so deep in debt that every penny you earn is spent just to keep the creditors away , and you have nothing live on : Nothing for food , medicine , clothing or even a house .
Eventually , you 'll have to do exactly what the U.S. Treasury will do : Declare itself bankrupt , abandon the dollar and tell the creditors it will no longer make payments at all .
And that will be the beginning of the end of the U.S. government .
That day is coming .
It probably wo n't happen in 2009 , but certainly within the next 20 years if something drastic does n't change with U.S. government spending .
Confidence in prediction : 85 % Throughout 2009 , yet more psychiatric doctors will find themselves caught up in financial scandals for failing to report their financial ties to Big Pharma .
This year has already seen stories about Dr. Joseph Biederman ( https://www.naturalnews.com/023408.html ) and other psychiatric doctors being caught with their hand in the drug money cookie jar .
Amazingly , none of these corrupt doctors have yet been fired from their jobs !
( Which just goes to show you that the industry remains incapable of policing itself . )
In 2009 , we 'll see at least one major breaking scandal involving drug money and psychiatric doctors , and it will add to the growing consensus that the psych drug industry is based almost entirely on fraud and corruption .
The push for mandatory medication of the population will gain momentum in 2009 , thanks to Big Pharma efforts to criminalize citizens who say no to medication .
They 'll focus on mental health first by pushing for mandatory mental health screening programs that will force children , expectant mothers and adults to be medicated with expensive , mind - altering pharmaceuticals .
Those who refuse such mandatory medication efforts will either be sent to mental institutions or forcibly medicated essentially at gunpoint ( with the threat of arrest ) .
Those with children will be threatened with having their children taken away by C.P.S.
Related prediction :
Although this may not happen in 2009 , sooner or later some citizen is going to use firearms to protect themselves from medical tyranny .
You can expect to see a case where a mom or dad trying to protect their children from vaccines or chemotherapy ends up shooting medical personnel or law enforcement authorities out of self defense .
The case will be all over the tabloids , and the jury will find the defendant guilty of murder ( because jury members are all medicated , too , and violence is no way to solve this problem ... )
Confidence in prediction : 40 % in 2009 , 70 % by 2012
The day is coming , and I think 2009 might be the year for the American Dental Association to finally abandon mercury fillings ( which are deceptively called " silver fillings " by the way ) .
The evidence of mercury toxicity is simply too great to continue ignoring , and even the ADA is finding it increasingly difficult to keep lying about mercury .
It 's not just the toxic effects on the patients , either :
It 's also the severely damaging environmental effects of the thousands of tons of mercury being swept into the environment each year due to dental work .
The American Dental Association will eventually lose all credibility if it does not cut ties with mercury and abandon its decades - long promotion of this highly - toxic , poisonous heavy metal .
After the decision , the ADA will appear foolish for having not made it sooner .
Confidence in prediction : 20 % In 1999 , I predicted terrorist attacks on New York and Washington .
Today , I 'm predicting the small possibility of a terrorist - style attack on either New York or Los Angeles .
And rather than attacking national symbols like the World Trade Towers , these new terrorist attacks would likely focus on Why ?
Because terrorists no doubt realize the U.S. economy ( and banking system ) is on shaky ground .
It 's no exaggeration to say that Wall Street is just one dirty bomb away from collapse .
So the most likely action on the part of terrorists would be an attack in New York that would impact Wall Street , or an attack in Los Angeles that would likely target the shipping container port ..
That 's why my confidence level on this one is only 20 percent .
It could be that an Obama presidency helps repair international relations and diminishes the risk of terror - related events in the United States .
But if he fails to repair international relations , we could experience yet more terror events in 2009 and beyond .
If an attack takes place in New York , the most likely targets , in my estimate , would be : • A dirty bomb being set loose on Wall Street • A chemical attack in the NY subway system •
An EMP attack designed to shut down computers on Wall Street • A hacking attack designed to shut down the stock exchanges
There 's also an outside chance that an attack could be waged on southern oil refineries in an attempt to clobber the economy by shutting down the fuel pipeline .
If waged , such an attack would likely be pulled off with either chemical explosives or airborne biologicals , rendering the oil refinery work areas uninhabitable .
( Note : Please , readers , do n't send me hate mail claiming " You just gave the terrorist ideas ! "
If I can figure this out on my own , so can the terrorists .
And you can bet the U.S. government already has contingency plans for each of these scenarios .
You can find these exact same plots in a fiction novel .
All this stuff is fairly obvious , actually .
I 'm mentioning this here in the hope that we can PREVENT these attacks from ever taking place .
And if we can't , I at least hope the citizens will be PREPARED to survive the days following such an attack . )
An EMP attack would be the most devastating to the economy , probably , as it could destroy computer equipment in a fairly large radius from the point of detonation .
A dirty bomb , on the other hand , would create more of a humanitarian disaster and a much larger fear factor , so if the terrorists are looking to create maximum terror , they would opt to use dirty bombs .
But there 's more of a risk of being caught due to the radiation emitted by dirty bomb devices .
It 's the radiation , after all , that makes them " dirty , " and there are already radiation scanning devices being used at U.S. ports in an effort to thwart precisely such an attack ( thank goodness , too ) .
Straight chemical explosives are not likely to be used in an attack on Wall Street because their blast radius is too small to wreak the degree of chaos the terrorists are hoping to achieve .
If an attack takes place in the Los Angeles port , it would most likely be a dirty bomb attack that 's detonated immediately after a container is offloaded , before it 's screened for radiation .
This capability is well within the technological grasp of well - funded terrorist groups .
I do n't know if Homeland Security has radiation detectors that work at a distance of anything greater than , say , 100 meters .
I doubt they do , and that means dirty bombs can get well into the port area without being detected .
This is one prediction , by the way , that I hope I 'm completely wrong about .
Why ?
Because such attacks tend to concentrate power in Washington , giving presidents the popular support to wage wars and pass new laws that destroy the freedoms of U.S. citizens .
Thus , from one point of view , it is actually in the interests of the power holders in Washington to see such attacks take place ( although they would never admit that ) .
Bush took full advantage of the 2001 terrorist attacks to gut the U.S. Constitution and pass new domestic surveillance laws that cause your phone lines and emails to be surveilled right now .
The ghost of 9/11 continues to haunt the remaining freedoms of Americans today .
I cannot say whether Obama will take the same opportunistic approach to grab power in the wake of terror events , but if there 's one thing that seems to be universally true about governments , it 's that power always breeds the desire for more power .
Rarely , if ever , has any government in the history of the world retreated from the centralization of power and given control back to its people .
So what can we do as a nation to stop such terror attacks against the U.S. ?
I completely disagree with those who say we need more national security , more military personnel walking the streets , more surveillance and more police state tyranny .
I think what we really need is to .
That would be DU ( Depleted Uranium ) , which the U.S. military has been using against civilian targets in Iraq and Afghanistan .
DU pollutes the ground for 10,000 years , causing radiation poisoning and genetic mutations for generations .
It is an illegal weapon that 's been outlawed by the United Nations , yet the U.S. military continues to use it on civilian targets like hospitals and civilian infrastructure buildings such as water treatment plants , television stations and manufacturing shops .
I know the U.S. military does n't intentionallyhospitals , but for some strange reason , a whole lot of DU shells end up there .
( Firing blind , anyone ? ) Think about it :
If some foreign nation invaded the U.S. and dropped a few million tons of highly radioactive DU on your back yard , killing your children and poisoning your land for 10,000 years , you might get a little angry , too .
The source of terrorism in this world is not that people hate the USA for its " freedom " ( as Bush likes to say ) , but rather that people hate the USA for being an outlaw , imperialist , war - mongering nation that kills innocent civilians using weapons of mass destruction and fights wars to protect corporate interests .
People hate the USA because the nation acts like an international bully ( and that 's saying it politely ) .
Want to know the real history of the imperialist USA ?

You may not know this , but a few years ago when the economy was better , I personally donated $ 5,000 to a Disabled American Veterans group in Montana so that they could buy a transportation van to take WWII vets to the VA hospital for medical care .

Confidence in predictions : VariesSome of the following predictions are " no- brainers " because they happen automatically , every year , as part of the traditional disinformation efforts pursued by Big Pharma and the mainstream media .
Others are more insightful .
The success of these predictions will vary .
I 'm not staking my reputation on these predictions , I 'm just offering them as possible insights into what may be headed our way : •
The press will attack antioxidants and vitamins , declaring them to be worthless .
( No brainer . ) •
New laws will limit junk food advertising to children .
They 'll be bogus " compromise " laws , of course , and they 'll leave all sorts of loopholes for the big food companies to exploit .
It will all be a finely choreographed song and dance designed to paint food companies and lawmakers in a positive light while the children continue to be poisoned . •
Drug companies will engineer yet another " miraculous " finding about statin drugs or other pharmaceuticals and use it to push for the widespread medication of the population . •
Obama will call for new gun control measures and the Democratic Congress will pass new laws restricting the gun ownership rights of U.S. citizens .
( No brainer . ) •
Another food contamination recall will occur that involves salmonella or e.coli contamination of fresh produce .
The FDA will once again attempt to propose mass food irradiation . •
Another study will denounce any link between vaccines and autism .
And yet , at the same time , drug companies will continue pushing for more mandatory vaccination policies , even as autism rates continue to escalate .
( No brainer . ) •
The anti-Federal Reserve movement will gain power , and Ron Paul will continue to play a pivotal role in the financial education of U.S. citizens , and if he's not arrested first , he will serve as one of the key revolutionary figures following the demise of the U.S. government .
His new nickname ?
" Ron Paul Revere . " •
Beyond the Bisphenol - A and melamine scandals we 've already witnessed , 2009 will see yet another food contaminant chemical surface , possibly a solvent chemical or some other food processing element .
The FDA will once again declare it to be perfectly safe . •
The raw foods movement will continue to grow , but it will shift away from its hippy drug - culture past and move into more mainstream circles where the term , " plant - based diet " will be used . •
More studies on Vitamin D will tout the incredible health benefits of the nutrient , but the American Cancer Society and the AMA will continue to avoid recommending it as a way to prevent cancer , since the cancer industry is so incredibly lucrative . •
Municipal water fluoridation will meet with increasing resistance in 2009 as better - educated citizens fight back against mandatory fluoridation policies .
Fluoride proponents , of course , will continue their efforts to poison the population , relying on disinformation and false authority to try to crush dissent . •
Well - known freedom personalities like Alex Jones , Jeff Rense , the Health Ranger and others will continue to be attacked on public message boards by covert workers who are paid for each negative post .
It 's now a well - known fact that most of the negative comments directed at freedom champions are the result of a well - funded internet disinformation campaign that pays people to post negative comments on message boards , news aggregation sites and in article comments .
Virtually all the hatred directed towards Alex Jones , for example , is fabricated .
( You do n't think the enemies of freedom play fair , do you ?
They have HUGE budgets and lots of free time to pollute the internet with false information ... ) •
Moxxor , the direct sales company that makes a potent marine omega - 3 oil supplement , will reach 10,000 distributors .
It is currently at 2,500 , which has happened only since early October .
NaturalNews is an active member of Moxxor .
See https://www.naturalnews.com/moxxor_health_ben... •
Monavie , one of the most successful direct sales health product companies , will actually see a decline in total membership due to the widespread availability of competing , lower - cost acai berry juices .
The company wo n't disappear , but it will begin trending downward unless it can reinvigorate its product line with something new and exciting .
Its flagship product was once new and exciting , but now acai berries are hardly exotic .
Even its most recent product , is hardly exciting .
Plant sterols ?
That 's it ? •
Speaking of direct sales companies , I anticipate a surge with ShopToEarn / ShopToEarth , which is an affiliate portal through which members get paid multi-tier affiliate commissions when others shop for health products like Dr. Bronner 's soap , Nutiva hemp seeds , Delicious Greens superfoods and many others .
It 's a no - brainer organization that 's easy to join and easy to introduce to others , since nobody has to buy anything new .
Contact [ email protected ] or call Suzy at 209-710 - 8299 to learn more . •
The FDA will be sued over its censorship of truthful health claims for nutritional supplements .
Although I can't predict the outcome of such a lawsuit , the very idea of it taking place is significant .
It will be the first time the People begin fighting back against the oppression of the U.S. government 's Food and Drug Administration . •
The ocean 's dead zones will continue to spread as pesticides , agricultural fertilizers and pharmaceuticals continue polluting the waterways .
Expect the number of ocean dead zones to grow by another 5 % in 2009 . •
Massive health care reform efforts will be underway in 2009 , but real reform laws wo n't be passed until 2010 or later .
A universal care system where the government pays for all health care wo n't be passed .
Rather , it will be some sort of compromised hybrid system that keeps health insurance companies profitable and employers penniless .
In other words , the new reforms will be nothing more than a new rip - off that puts money into the hands of the ultra rich while soaking working - class citizens with higher taxes and higher costs of employment ( which translate into lower wages ) .
Expect to seelaws put in place , turning you into a criminal if you do n't buy expensive health insurance .
UNHAPPY THANKSGIVING
A November 19 , 2001 story in Canada 's National Post revealed that " dumb farm animals " are smarter than they look and that they actually feel pain .
Duh .
According to the Post : " Cows have the ability to reason .
Sheep have remarkable memories .
Pigs have sensitive feelings . "
http://www.canadapost.com
Canadian researchers have demonstrated that dairy cows are more sophisticated than farmers realize .
Even more remarkable is that this story has been re-posted in the " NEWS " section of one of the largest Internet dairy websites , Dairy Action .
http://www.dairyaction.com
In other words , farmers no longer have any excuse or rationale to deny that their pain - inflicting use of brutal and inhumane farm techniques ultimately end the lives of 27 million feeling , reasoning , sensitive living creatures each day with sharp knife blades sliced through the flesh and muscles of these animal 's equally sensitive throats .
According to the Post report : " Sheep , for instance , have remarkable memories , a recent British study suggests .
Pigs have sensitive feelings , Canadian research shows .
They engage in clever , even deceptive , behaviour -- such as when young bulls feign disinterest in cows in heat until dominant bulls are out of sight .
And , when over - stressed , they can exhibit disturbing social behaviour ... "
The Canadian animal scientists study farm practices that milk drinkers and meat eaters would rather not know , such as : " The pain felt by 12 million piglets castrated in Canada each year without painkillers ; the trauma and distress experienced by young heifers thrown into milking parlours a day after they give birth ; the plaintive calls of hungry , lonely calves in their stalls . "
Scientists have analyzed the unusually high - pitched squeals of young piglets being castrated within two weeks of birth and conclude that the animals are in enormous pain and should be given painkillers .
Take a moment to appreciate the source of each food item on today 's Thanksgiving plate .
If you are a canine - eating Korean , did the dog yelp in pain during death ?
If you are an ice cream - slurping American , did the calf cry in fear when she was separated from the cow so that her mother 's milk could then be sold to fatten the unweaned human ?
In the spirit and consciousness of a universal force that unites all creatures into an eternal oneness and recognizes greater degrees of similarity between mammalian species than difference , does it matter who causes pain to another and who ends up eating who ?
Is there a cumulative scorecard tallying the pain and suffering that you individually inflict upon all others ?
Do you give thanks to the turkey or the lamb or the piglet ?
I was coasting through the long weekend on Friday morning , going through the daily dose of reading with the muted TV on CNN when I noticed the word “ Cricket ” on the screen .
This grabbed my attention since this sport is unheard of in this part of the world and I realized that CNN was breaking the news about a series of attacks in Mumbai at various locations and was showing a feed from a local Indian news channel .
As appalled as I was about these attacks , I was also surprised by the unprecedented level of coverage of the events by the news channels — fueled , no doubt , by the large number of Americans involved and the fact that most of their regular reporters were on vacation .
Now that the reporters and analysts are back on air , they have gone on to suggest that this is the test that Al Qaeda has sent to Barack Obama , as predicted by Joe Biden .
Also , I have heard some one mentioning that the terrorists went after the Americans in Mumbai because they could not get them here in America .
All I have to say is : Sorry , it is not always about America .
This was an attack against India and targeting American , British and Israeli citizens was just a ploy to garner worldwide attention and further the embarrassment of India .
Having been born and raised in India , I do not find these attacks unimaginable .
As a country , India has been under an incessant assault from Islamic fundamentalist organizations ever since its formation in 1947 .
It was not America 's problem until the late 90s when these terrorist organizations , especially Al Qaeda , started turning against American interests .
Also , the pundits have already named this the 9/11 of India .
I beg to disagree .
Just because you were n't paying attention until now does not make it any more significant than the previous attacks .
The city of Mumbai itself had sustained a loss of 260 lives in 1993 and more recently , 200 lives in 2006 during various terror attacks .
I do not intend to trivialize this horrible , horrible massacre but this is not something that India has not seen before .
Yet it is good to see the West recognize India 's six - decade with fight with terrorism .
Also , Indian security forces face many difficulties while dealing with terrorism .
The lack of well - kept records poses a challenge to tracking individuals that may prove to be dangerous .
Even dealing with people , profiling becomes a challenge when there is n’t much that can be used to identify a possible terrorist at various situations .
India is home to the second largest Muslim population in the world , which is larger than even the entire Arab population .
This community had been the ruling class for many centuries before the British Empire assumed power .
From that point , the Muslim community has been in a downward spiral due to institutional discrimination and the resulting poverty and despair .
The branding of Pakistan and the entire Muslim community as agents of terrorism by Hindu extremist leaders has not helped either .
This has given the Islamic terrorist organizations easy recruiting grounds among the disenchanted youth in the community ; even if they get a few hundred young men out of the 150 million , the damage is done .
Sure , the picture that I drew shows an incredibly permeable country .
In fact , the media has already been discussing how unsafe India is .
The main lessons that were learned from these incidents can be condensed as the following : First , India needs to reform its fragmented intelligence system and build a system for the competent individual agencies to share information on a real time basis .
Also , it has to improve the emergency management system with well - equipped SWAT teams with the ability for quick response and effective action .
Nevertheless , this is the first time that the terrorists have taken an approach this vastly different from the usual fare of suicide bomb attacks or car bombs .
But for an average Indian , the chances of getting involved in a terrorist attack is still slim .
In short , India is not Afghanistan .
It is a success story — a stable democracy over six decades .
This does not mean that people are without fear , of course .
Travel agents have been reporting cancellation of trips to India .
My family has some interests in the tourism - related hospitality industry in India and already there have been many cancellations and a total dearth of new reservations at various hotels and resorts that cater to Western tourists .
This could take a toll on the tourism industry , which has about six percent share of the GDP and had already taken a blow by the soft economy in the West .
This will be quite a concern if tourists opt out of India in the long run .
However , the rising ranks of the Indian middle class have already begun contributing to a bigger share of domestic tourism and they should be able to sustain the industry from going under completely .
But this also depends on the vigor of the Indian economy .
That brings to us the question of what effect these attacks would have on the Indian economy in the long run .
Other than the very short - term effect on tourism , I doubt there will be an effect on the economy directly .
Even with the global economic downturn , the Indian economy ’s growth of has not slowed down significantly .
The GDP is projected to grow by 7 - 7.5 percent in 2009 and does not appear to be very threatened by the global downturn due to a solid cushion of domestic consumption .
As I have mentioned , India has seen this kind of atrocity before .
Even as the media want you to believe that this event has the same effect on India that 9/11 had on America , it is simply not the case .
India will take this blow in the stride and will move on faster .
The people of India have always been resilient .

Reports are coming in that T - Mobile has finally admitted that the T - Mobile G1 does indeed have a battery problem as we stated in our review of the Android - powered device .
With the inability to end background processes which kill the battery in less than a single day , T - mobile is giving lucky G1 owners an extended life battery .
While this is still just a rumor , T - Mobile may just be doing a little preventative maintenance under our nose in preparation for the stereo Bluetooth and video recording coming to handsets in January .
T- Mobile is reportedly sending a new extended life battery and a compatible back cover within the month to all T - Mobile G1 owners .
You know what this means , having an even larger device .
It pains us to hear that the back cover is going to make the device even larger now .
The T - Mobile G1 currently has a 1150 mAh battery which will more than likely be replaced with a 1400 mAh battery which holds about 20 % more charge .
T - Mobile G1 owners are suppose to be getting a notice about this within the next few weeks .
We have not heard anything confirming this to be true , please let us know if you have received such a notice .

Plywood covers the doors and windows of two abandoned houses in Minneapolis in April .
As foreclosures mount around the country and vacated homes slowly turn into neighborhood eyesores , governments from California to Chicago to Rhode Island are cracking down on owners in a variety of ways .
Chicago started banning plywood .
Providence can now fine up to 10 % of the assessed value of the home .
Garland , Texas , is requiring a $ 2,500 bond the city can use to keep up the property .
The aim is to prevent the crime and declining home values that accompany rows of boarded - up homes .
Richard Monocchio , acting commissioner of the Chicago Department of Buildings , said the new rules are purposefully stringent .
" It puts a little more of a financial bite on the owner and hopefully gives some impetus to do something with the property , " he said .
Among the new laws : • Owners of vacant properties in Chicago will only be allowed to use plywood on doors and windows for six months .
Owners will have to use more expensive metal panels or outfit the home with working doors , windows and an alarm system .
• Providence Planning Director Thomas Deller said his department could begin imposing the new fines — which can be up to 10 % of the assessed value of the property — within months .
• California passed a law that allows areas to fine owners up to $ 1,000 a day if they fail to maintain the lawn , keep out squatters or allow standing water , a breeding ground for mosquitoes .
• Garland approved an ordinance that requires owners of " abandoned and distressed " properties to post a $ 2,500 bond the city can tap into to maintain the property .
At least 93 cities around the country have passed vacant property laws this year , according to Rob Hicks of FIS Field Services , a company that helps lenders manage properties that have defaulted and gone into foreclosure .
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , at least six states have passed or are considering similar laws this year .
Dustin Hobbs , a spokesman for the California Mortgage Bankers Association , said it is difficult for his members to track all the laws being passed .
He said if states do n't implement uniform rules it will be cumbersome to stay on top of them .
" If every city and county comes up with their own solution , it 's absolutely going to drive up the cost of lending , " Hobbs said .
Hicks said some of the requirements — like maintaining water and electricity at unsold properties — are becoming too expensive .
He hopes governments will consult with lenders to find compromises .
" The solution is cooperation , " he said .

Tokyo Metro's monthly campaign utilizes bold , cartoon - like depictions of certain antisocial behaviors subway riders should avoid doing ... , at least .
Barfing after passing out drunk , loud cellphone yakking and practicing golf swings with wet umbrellas - normal activities on North American subways - are no -no's on Tokyo Metro 's sprawling subway system , though perfectly all right if done in the privacy of your home .
This characteristicmessage is reminiscent of Japan Tobacco 's long - running series of Smoking Manners ads .
Both gently ( if obviously ) remind those who have let their societal skills slide to shape up in the interest of society as a whole .
Here are the first nine Manner Posters , beginning with April 2008 : It 's interesting that the ( literally ) poster boy for being an obnoxious seat hog is a young dude wearing low - riding gangsta jeans .
Let 's enjoy stereotyping !
In any case , even if he was n't so expansive with his Doritos , beer and girly mag , would you really want to sit beside him ?
As for thetitle , no worries , he probably already does .
Is that what the young lady is doing ?
Looks more like self eye surgery - which is also discouraged by the way .
I 'm not sure why Tokyo Metro is picking on these girls ; putting on make - up in public is n't that offensive , is it ?
This is n't the 1960s when women solidified their hairdo's with half a can of Final Net .
Here 's one we all can get behind - though they should add Bluetooth earpieces to the list .
Curiously , most Japanese cellphones are a generation ahead of foreign ones yet subway lines in Canada and the U.S. are in the process of introducing cellphone service to their lines .
Lovely .
Ah yes , boomboxes may be history but at the volume some listen to their iPods at you 'd never know it .
And once again , the featured culprit is a Japanese Gen-Xerannoying our long - suffering , tie - wearing salaryman .
Hey Pops , the way the Japanese economy 's going these days , the kid 's likely taking home more yen thanare .
Suck it up !
Indeed .
Then again , Tokyo subway cars are often so packed with passengers , uniformed " pushers " have to cram in the latecomers .
Rushing into an unexpectedly empty car would be like breaking down an unlocked door ... you might find yourself in the backyard .
I did n't mention thestatement because , well , what the heck is going on at Japanese beaches ??
Bringing bulky belongings on the Tokyo subway is just asking for trouble , even if " trouble " means two dozen fellow travelers staring you down with daggers in their eyes .
Then there 's... maybe they meant to say .
At least it 'll distract attention from your ridiculously bulky belongings .
A dangerously provocative statement that , considering the frequency ofincidents on Japanese subways .
This is one time whenwould be entirely appropriate .
Seriously though , has there been a problem with Tiger Woods wannabes teeing off with rain - soaked brollies on Tokyo subway platforms ?
Never mind then .
Yes please , you 're making our hard - working , bug - eyed salaryman feel left out .
Speaking of which , what 's with the dude 's blank , bulbous blinkers ?
Is the Little Orphan Annie look back in style ?
Am I dating myself by using a Little Orphan Annie reference ?
But I digress ... partying on the subway is to be avoided .
Nobody have fun on Japanese subway , Japanese subway have fun with you !
Here it is , the PSA poster of the year !
Millions of Japanese housewives would like a word or two with whoever dreamed this one up .
Kudos to the epic Japan - bloggers at 3 Yen who highlighted this poster asAnd so ends this series of , and Tokyo Metro SHOULD end them here as the Drunken Behavior poster is gonna be really hard to beat .
Is aposter next ?

Terminator Salvation does n't hit theaters until May but producers have already decided to make a follow - up slated for release in 2011 .
Salvation director McG will be involved in this fifth picture in the machine freak franchise , with star Christian Bale contractually committed to play John Connor in up to three movies .
When Terminator rights were acquired last year by Halcyon bosses Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek , they hoped to make a new trilogy of films to complement the original Arnold Schwarzenegger threesome .
According to Variety , fan buzz encouraged Anderson and Kubicek to pull the trigger even before they saw how Salvation did at the box office .
Speaking over the weekend at the Dubai International Film Festival , Kubicek said : " We feel the time is now to start shaping the next part of this . "

Wesley Cox Arrested : Police Seek Owners of Stolen Underwear ( PHOTOS )
Boulder police arrestedon November 20 for suspicion of misdemeanor trespassing , unlawful sexual conduct and invasion of property after discovering that he had been secretly videotaping couples having sex and breaking into homes to steal women 's undergarments .
Cox was first arrested on Halloween , when two neighbors discovered him crouched outside a nearby home , videotaping a couple having sex in their bedroom .
The neighbors wrestled him to the ground until police arrived on the scene .
Officers found in his possession a police radio - frequency scanner , flashlight , digital video camera , and a concealed microphone inside his jacket .
He was released on bond and came under renewed scrutiny on November 15 , when police obtained a search warrant and made a visit to his home .
During their search of his premises , they viewed a video tape showing two different couples engaging in sex in the privacy of their home , as captured by him outside of their bedroom windows .
The video images also showed three women getting dressed or stepping out of the shower , and Cox masturbating with women 's undergarments in the bedrooms of two different homes .
Police have confiscated three computers in an effort to obtain additional evidence and they are also investigating the possibility that he may have put some of his tapes on the internet .
According to police spokeswoman Sarah Huntley , Cox's ' M.O. ' appears to be that he breaks into homes , steals underwear , becomes fixated on the women , returns and videos them .

Could Parry Gripp be the best thing that ever happened to YouTube ?
The man behind Buffy the Vampire Slayer 's theme song is turning Internet - video disaster into visual punk rock .
Everything that makes
YouTube a time - wasting creative desert is just fodder for Gripp 's brilliant mind .
Take " Young Girl Talking About Herself , " which remixes clips of well , exactly that , paired with lyrics of a frenetic energy that reminds me of They Might Be Giants or Weird Al Yankovic .
" If this catchy tune were made into a real 3 minute song I 'd download it , " one commenter writes in a YouTube comment .
But that misunderstands Gripp 's genius .
If he were just copying Yankovic 's schtick , he'd do classic three - minute rock songs about the Internet , designed for radio play ; or he'd just carelessly slap a bunch of viral - video references into a song , like Weezer .
How backwards !
Three minutes might be right for archaic formats like the LP , but it 's wrong for the Web .
Most of Gripp 's video - mashup songs are one minute or less in length — exactly right for the YouTube attention span .
The joke does n't get played out .
It 's over before you know it , and leaves you hungry for more — click , click , click .
But enough words .
Behold the brilliance of Parry Gripp !

That would be George Bush , the known alcoholic who has long been rumored to still be drinking , and was just caught in just the last two weeks having an alcoholic beverage at the summit .
But no one in the media asked our alcoholic president during war time if and why he was drinking again .
But the smoking Democrat , they ask away .
Now , I ’m not going to defend Obama ’s smoking .
I loathe smoking , it ’s a public menace unless it ’s done in a sealed home .
But it would be nice if the media bothered pressing our current president as to why he still appears to be drinking .
They asked , and the White House refused to answer if our alcoholic president drank alcohol during his recent trip .
How do you “ rebuff ” a question as to whether the president is still a drunk ?

Wandering through Meerut ’s narrow streets , amid hundreds of cyclists , rickshaw pullers , three - wheelers , cars , and pedestrians , I asked shop owners and lemonade vendors where I could find other people who had sold their kidneys .
They pointed me toward a rundown building across from the tower .
Behind a tall iron gate , groups of men were playing cards in the shade of a tree , among them Rakesh , Mahesh , and Om Prakash — all of whom would later raise their shirts to show me long scars above the waist .
Thin as a rail , with some of his front teeth missing and the rest stained brown by tobacco , Prakash paints for a living .
“ I took the day off today , ” he said as we sat down on an empty cart to talk .
Nearby , Rakesh toasted a pellet of hash in a matchstick flame .
Sharing a joint , the two men told me that they were paid $ 1,000 after their kidneys were taken , in 2006 .
Prakash said he had been lured by a man posing as a contractor who offered him a month - long painting job for $ 4 a day .
He was put up in a high - rise apartment in nearby Gurgaon with other workers .
The next day , he was taken for an ultra­sound and a blood test — and even though he found this puzzling , he went along for fear of losing the job .
He was then tempted with more cash in exchange for his kidney .
The surgery took place nine days later .
With a sheepish grin , Prakash said he had spent all the money on alcohol and prostitutes .
The Indian government ’s case against Kumar includes complaints from seven men who allege that they were cheated out of their kidneys .
Their stories are similar : Gyasuddin or other agents of Kumar took them to Gurgaon on the pretext of employment as masons , waiters , or cooks .
They were kept at safe houses and medically tested .
Some were forced to undergo surgery ; others were falsely diagnosed with ailments like gall stones that required surgical treatment .
Dozens of other victims had been willing donors but they were n’t paid what they had been promised .
Because Kumar ’s agents had to pay for the ultrasound and other tests needed to match each donor to a recipient , they shortchanged many donors .
The result was a bunch of disgruntled kidney sellers , some of whom complained to police in Jaipur and Mumbai .
On the morning of January 24 , a climactic fight broke out between two men near a busy street - crossing in Morādābād , a town in Uttar Pradesh .
A crowd gathered , and the already slow traffic of cars , scooters , and cycle - rickshaws came to a halt .
One of the men was Gyasuddin , the donor - turned - agent from Meerut .
The other was Vidya Prakash , who was accusing Gyasuddin of having stolen his kidney .
A constable on street duty found the allegation so odd that instead of letting the men off with a warning , he took them to a nearby police station .
And thus did Amit Kumar , India ’s self - taught and self - made kidney king , with clients from Europe , Asia , the United States , and the Middle East , and with homes and properties in Mumbai , Toronto , Hong Kong , and Australia , end up in a Haryāna prison .
I 'm of the belief that government should provide the public with essentials instead of leaving them up to the private sector .
Electricity , Water , Roads , Sewage .
Do Internet / Telecommunications belong in that group ?
I 'm not completely convinced yet that that 's the case , but we 're definitely headed in that direction for the future .
If the government does not provide these essentials , and instead leaves them up to privatized corporations , then eventually a greedy , self - centered set of individuals could wreak havoc on entire economies just to make themselves richer .
Just look at what happened to the world economy with oil .
Can you even imagine if that huge price fluctuation would have happened to electricity , or worse yet , water ?
The Republican philosophy ( small government , let the private sector handle everything ) would work if people were actually decent human beings and did the right thing when they got into powerful corporate positions .
But that 's just not the way of the world .
HOWEVER ;
That does n't mean I agree that we should leave everything up to the federal government .
State and Local government should bear the vast majority of all this responsibility .
The federal government was only created to serve as an arbiter between states when disputes come up .
We need to get back to that formula .
( obviously the federal government needs to continue with foreign policy and military duties as well , but it seems that lately the federal government is taking away responsibilities from State and Local government that it has no business taking . )
That 's my 2 cents .

Watertiger notices that the Preznit had himself a drinky - poo at this weekend 's Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation gathering in Lima .
It 's described in this AFP report too :
Even teetotalling US President George W. Bush , who famously quit drinking at 40 , was spotted apparently sipping a pisco sour during the summit on Saturday .
It was unclear whether he actually drank any , or whether it was an alcohol - free version .
The White House rebuffed questions about the matter .
Libby Spencer at The Reaction observes that this is n't the first time in recent months that Bush has appeared have been drinking .
Of course , the whole " Bush as a teetotaler " story always had the appearance of being more propaganda than reality .
Jane has written convincingly that Bush evinces the classic symptoms of the " dry drunk " .
But I 've always wondered , honestly , just how dry he 's really been these eight years .
Certainly the wreckage he 's leaving behind is n't the mark of someone in full command of his faculties .
But that may be another story .
John Amato :
I do n’t think I have posted this snipped of code here yet .
It is old as hell , but I use it all over the place lately so I figured I just post it here for future reference .
The script below solves the age old problem of making bunch of files accessible to your users without dumping them in a publicly accessible directory ( files , not users ) .
For example , you have bunch of PDF documents you do n’t want to be indexed by Google , or directly linked to from other websites .
What you want is to allow certain users to download them after logging into your web app and checking their cridentials .
How do you do that ?
Well , the simplest thing to do is to put them in some directory outside of your web root .
Set up .htaccess ( or whatever you use ) to disallow any connection to that folder from the outside world .
The only machine with access to these files should be localhost .
Then you do some PHP magic in your application to stream the file into the browser upon successful authentication .
The streaming part is actually pretty straightforward – it is a simple combination of the print and fread commands .
The convoluted part is convincing your browser to actually initiate file download instead of just dumping ASCII gibberish onto the page for binary files .
This is accomplished by sending bunch of headers to the browser prior to streaming the files .
The headers are different for IE and the rest of the world but this is pretty much what I ended up with after a lot of trial and error :
// change these to whatever is appropriate in your code $ my_place = " / path/to/the/file / " ; // directory of your file $ my_file = " filename.ext " ; // your file $ my_path = $ my_place.$my_file ; header ( " Pragma : public " ) ; header ( " Expires : 0 " ) ; header ( ' Cache - Control : no - store , no - cache , must - revalidate ' ) ; header ( ' Cache - Control : pre-check=0 , post - check=0 , max - age=0 ' , false ) ; header ( ' Last - Modified : '.gmdate ( ' D , d M Y H:i:s ' ) . ' GMT ') ; $ browser = $ _SERVER [ ' HTTP_USER_AGENT ' ] ; if ( preg_match ( '/ MSIE 5.5 / ' , $ browser ) || preg_match ( '/ MSIE 6.0 / ' , $ browser ) ) { header ( ' Pragma : private ' ) ; // the c in control is lowercase , didnt work for me with uppercase header ( ' Cache - control : private , must - revalidate ' ) ; // MUST be a number for IE header ( " Content - Length : " .filesize ( $my_path ) ) ; header ( ' Content - Type : application / x- download ' ) ; header ( ' Content - Disposition : attachment ; filename= " '.$ my_file . ' " ' ) ; } else { header ( " Content - Length : " .( string ) ( filesize ( $my_path ) ) ) ; header ( ' Content - Type : application / x- download ' ) ; head er (' Content - Disposition : attachment ; filename= " '.$ my_file . ' " ' ) ; } header ( ' Content - Transfer - Encoding : binary ' ) ; if ( $ file = fopen ( $ my_path , 'rb ' ) ) { while (!
feof ( $ file ) and ( connection_status ( ) ==0 ) ) { print ( fread ( $ file , filesize ( $ my_path ) ) ; flush ( ) ; } fclose ( $ file ) ; }
I found these headers to work for me .
Your millage may vary .
I tested the script above in IE 6 and 7 , Firefox 2.x and 3.x , Konqueror 3.5.8 and Chrome 0.2.149.30 and experienced no problems .
As usual , I ’m always open to constructive criticism and better solutions in the comments .
Let me know what you think !
Houston 's HIV infection rate nearly twice national average Ethnic populations are especially hard hit , new figures show
Houston 's HIV infection rate is nearly twice the national average , according to figures the city health department cited Monday as its most accurate estimate ever .
In 2006 , about 1,700 Harris County residents became HIV - positive .
" In one year , one in 2,000 Houstonians becomes infected with HIV , " said Dr. Tom Giordano , medical director at the Harris County Hospital District 's Thomas Street Health Center , which treats about 4,000 HIV patients a year .
" That 's a pretty alarming statistic . "
Houston 's rate of new HIV infections is higher than figures in Dallas and San Antonio but below the rates calculated for New York City , Philadelphia and Chicago .
The local numbers , released Monday on World AIDS Day by the city health department , represent a more accurate way to determine how many people were infected in a given period of time :
They are based on a calculation method that caused the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August to revise the nation 's 2006 infections to 56,300 — about 40 percent higher than the earlier estimate .
Previous CDC measurements suggested about 40,000 new cases every year .
The amended figures do not represent an actual increase in the number of new HIV cases .
" The new estimate is based on direct measurement of new HIV infections using a new technology that can distinguish recent from long - standing infections , " said Houston health department spokesman Porfirio Villarreal .
There are 44 new infections for every 100,000 people in Harris County , compared with 23 per 100,000 nationwide .
In Harris County , black people account for more than half of those new cases for HIV , the virus that causes AIDS .
There are more than 1 million people living with HIV / AIDS in the United States and almost 18,000 have been diagnosed in Harris County , according to the Houston Department of Health and Human Services .
As many as 6,000 other county residents are living with the virus and do not know it .
Using the new method , the Houston health department is still calculating the number of Harris County residents who were infected in 2007 , Villarreal said .
The number of 2006 cases surprised Giordano , also a professor at Baylor College of Medicine and an HIV patient care researcher .
" It 's good to finally have a number , " he said .
" You were never sure with the old numbers . "
Personal battle
Danny Harris , 46 , discussed his decadelong battle with the illness Monday night at the city 's candlelight vigil to remember those lost to AIDS .
His partner died in 2002 .
Harris , who was diagnosed in 1997 , marveled that tests can return results in 20 minutes .
When he first started testing in 1993 , the wait was two weeks .
" Everyone should get tested .
I do n't care who you are , " said Harris , who once took 56 pills a day to treat the illness .
He was diagnosed with full - blown AIDS last year , but he now has an undetectable virus and takes just three pills daily .
Blacks and Hispanics are hard - hit in Harris County , accounting for 78 percent of the 2006 cases but are roughly 60 percent of the population .
That 's why local health officials have spent the last few years targeting prevention efforts in black and Hispanic communities , Villarreal said .
Testing has become the key weapon against HIV in the Houston area .
Working with community groups and worship centers , the city health department has expanded HIV testing through mobile vans assigned to areas with the highest HIV rates .
With a CDC grant , the city this summer began offering HIV tests to emergency room patients at Ben Taub General Hospital and Memorial Hermann Hospital - The Texas Medical Center , as well as a Legacy Community Health Services location .

Home :: Pre July 2006 :: Roughly two - thirds of top U.S. Catholic leaders have allowed priests accused of sexual abuse to keep working http://www.dallasnews.com//cgi-bin/bi/dallas/2002/priests.cgi
Roughly two - thirds of top U.S. Catholic leadershave allowed priests accused of sexual abuse to keep working , asystematic practice that spans decades and continues today , athree - month Dallas Morning News review shows .
The study - thefirst of its kind - looked at the records of the top leaders of thenation�s 178 mainstream Roman Catholic dioceses , including actingadministrators in cases where the top job is vacant .
Excluded from the study were auxiliary bishops who , in larger dioceses , serve in subordinate roles but still can vote on many matters beforethe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , the 17 bishops who leadeparchies , which are diocese - like entities that worship according tothe Eastern rite .
In checking whether a bishop had protected priests or other church representatives accused of sexual abuse , reporters Brooks Egerton and Reese Dunklinrelied on published reports , court records , interviews and churchrecords obtained in civil litigation .
Most protected priests wereaccused of sexually abusing minors - primarily adolescent boys , butalso younger ones , and a sizable number of girls of various ages .
Thenewspaper�s study also covered behavior that indicated a sexualattraction to minors , such as viewing child pornography or , in onecase , trading sexually charged e-mails with someone a priest believedwas a minor .
Diocese location Bishop 's name Allegation Burlington , Vt. BISHOP KENNETH ANGELL
The Diocese of Providence , R.I. , where he was auxiliary bishop from 1974 to1992 , has paid more than $ 1 million to settle lawsuits that accused himand other leaders of covering up abuse by several priests .
BishopAngell testified in a 1990 lawsuit that he did not take seriouslyallegations - made by both parishioners and assistant priests - thatthe Rev. William O'Connell was molesting boys .
The priest wasconvicted , served a short sentence , moved to New Jersey , committed morecrimes and died in prison .
In another Rhode Island case , Bishop Angellin 1989 promised to " take care of it " when the Rev. Normand Demers wasaccused of misconduct with boys while working at a Haitian orphanage , according to a former orphanage staffer .
The priest was brought back towork in the Providence diocese ( see more under that listing ) .
Morerecently , Bishop Angell allowed six accused priests to stay on the jobin Vermont , then later gave their names to the state attorney generaland suspended them .
He would not identify them publicly .
Austin , Texas BISHOP GREGORY AYMOND
Asa New Orleans auxiliary bishop in 1998 , he kept Catholic schoolteacherBrian Matherne on the job despite an allegation that he 'd molested astudent years earlier .
Bishop Aymond has said he dropped the matterwithout alerting police because the alleged victim would n't speak tohim .
That young man later went to police himself , and authorities saidmore children had been molested in the meantime .
Mr. Matherne has sincebeen sentenced to prison after admitting that he abused 17 boys .
Lawsuits against the New Orleans archdiocese are pending .
Bishop Aymondhas said he would do things differently today .
Charleston , S.C. BISHOP ROBERT BAKER InFebruary , a spokesman denied a lawsuit 's allegation that the diocesewas employing a " known priest - pedophile . "
Later , the spokesmanacknowledged that an accused priest remained on the job , after havingbeen suspended in the mid-1990s , moved to a smaller parish and orderednot to be alone with children .
The Rev. Paul Seitz has since resigned , for what the diocese said were unrelated health reasons .
The man whoaccused Father Seitz already has provided crucial testimony in the caseagainst another priest , the Rev. Eugene Condon , who pleaded guilty toabuse in 1998 and was sentenced to probation .
The accuser told the FBIthat as a teenager in the 1960s he went to Father Condon for confessionafter Father Seitz abused him .
Father Condon gave him alcohol and triedto molest him too , he said , and years later showed him a trunk full ofphotographs of naked boys whose pictures had been taken in a churchrectory .
In another instance , Bishop Baker two years ago moved totransfer the Rev. John Bench to a diocese in Florida , after paying asettlement to the family of a young girl the priest admitted abusing .
The bishop dropped the idea after the family protested .
Earlier thisspring , Bishop Baker was criticized by Atlanta Archbishop John Donoghuefor not immediately reporting abuse allegations to governmentauthorities .
The Charleston diocesan spokesman said it investigatesinternally first to " be sure we have a credible allegation . "
Green Bay , Wis. BISHOP ROBERT BANKS Asa top aide to Boston Cardinal Bernard Law , he helped the Rev. PaulShanley transfer to the Diocese of San Bernardino , Calif. , in the early 1990s .
The Boston archdiocese had been receiving allegations for manyyears that Father Shanley had molested children and publicly advocatedsex between men and boys , but Bishop Banks wrote a counterpart inCalifornia that the priest " has no problem that would be a concern toyour diocese . "
Bishop Banks has said he was unaware of Father Shanley 'sproblems .
" Maybe I dropped the ball , but it did not come to myattention , " he recently told Wisconsin newspapers .
" I know it seemsstrange to you that you could have 800 pages in a personnel file andthat I , as the vicar for administration , would not know about it , but Idid not know about it . "
In Green Bay , Bishop Banks recently suspendedat least one priest , whom he described as devastated by a molestationaccusation .
" We 're presuming that it 's false , " the bishop said .
In lateMay , a task force he appointed said that seven priests accused ofsexually abusing minors remained in active ministry ; they were notnamed .
Some were said to have been accused by people who withdrew theirallegations , for reasons that were not explained .
Six unnamed priestswere said to be under criminal investigation , but it was n't clearwhether any of this group remained on the job .
Bishop
Banks respondedby promising reform , saying that past policies were " at best inadequateand at worst scandalous . "
San Bernardino , Calif .
BISHOP GERALD BARNES
BishopBarnes , who was the diocese 's No. 2 official for much of the early1990s and became its head in 1996 , let four priests remain active untilthis spring despite abuse allegations kept in the diocese 's records .
His spokesman identified only two - the Rev. Peter Luque and the Rev. Peter Covas - but would not say specifically what they had been accusedof , when the alleged abuse occurred and when the diocese had beenalerted .
Complaints about the priests were forwarded to police inApril , along with information about 16 inactive clerics .
Among the 16 was the Rev. Joe Fertal , whom the diocese has allowed since 1995 tolive at a church complex used by high school students for overnightretreats .
The diocese confidentially settled a lawsuit in 1996 thataccused Father Fertal of sexually abusing a 16 - year - old boy .
Thepriest , who denied wrongdoing , was expected to relocate this spring .
Oklahoma City , Okla .
ARCHBISHOP EUSEBIUS BELTRAN In1994 , he got a written warning from the Diocese of Lansing , Mich .
, where one of his priests formerly worked and had just been sued .
" Wefear that more victims are going to emerge , " the Michigan bishop wrote .
"
In light of these developments , I am obliged to alert you to potentialdangers of Father [ James ] Rapp continuing in the ministry . "
ArchbishopBeltran sent the priest for a therapeutic evaluation - something he 'dreceived at least twice before , while in other parts of the country - but allowed him to remain pastor of a church in the southern Oklahomatown of Duncan .
Father Rapp subsequently abused more boys and wassentenced to prison in 1999 ; the archdiocese and the priest 's religiousorder , the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales , have paid one victim a $ 5 million settlement .
Archbishop Beltran has declined to comment , citinglitigation that is still pending .
In a deposition obtained by TheWashington Post , he blamed the head of the order for not doing more tostop Father Rapp .
Philadelphia , Pa. CARDINAL ANTHONY BEVILACQUA
Hehas said he did not know that the Rev. John P. Connor , who was leaderof a local parish from 1988 to 1993 , had previously admitted in courtto molesting a 14 - year - old boy from a Catholic school in nearby CamdenCounty , N.J. , where the priest once taught .
After leaving the Camdendiocese and before going to Philadelphia , Father Connor also worked inthe Pittsburgh diocese - at a time when Cardinal Bevilacqua was bishopthere .
Early this year , the cardinal dismissed six priests known tohave abused minors over the years and said that the archdiocese hadidentified a total of 35 priests who had sexually abused children since1950 .
Initially he refused to give names of those priests toauthorities , saying he was concerned about protecting victims ' confidentiality .
He later relented under pressure from prosecutors .
Archdiocese officials have said the dismissed priests had been workingin administrative jobs and have been told to seek lay status from the Vatican .
That would strip them of the right to perform sacramentalduties .
Kansas City - St. Joseph , Mo. BISHOP RAYMOND BOLAND
Heis among several bishops who were accused in a racketeering lawsuit inApril of protecting Bishop Anthony O'Connell , who recently resigned ashead of the Diocese of Palm Beach , Fla. , after admitting he had abuseda seminary student years ago in Missouri .
Bishop Boland wasspecifically accused of doing nothing after one of Bishop O'Connell ' svictims alerted him to abuse in late 1993 or early 1994 .
Bishop Bolanddoes not recall " any conversation with anyone claiming sexual abuse byBishop O'Connell , " his spokesman has said .
This spring , Bishop Bolandtold parishioners that " we presently have no priest , teacher or youthminister in a parish or school who has ever been accused of any form ofchild sexual abuse . "
The following month , the diocese said that the Rev. Thomas O'Brien had been a hospital chaplain for more than 15 years , since being forced into therapy over allegations that he touchedboys inappropriately and supplied them alcohol at parties .
MonsignorO 'Brien retired in April and has denied wrongdoing , the diocese said .
Greensburg , Pa. BISHOP ANTHONY BOSCO
Hehas suspended at least three priests this spring after reviewinginformation that was already in their personnel files .
Bishop Bosco , who has headed the Greensburg diocese since 1987 , has refused toidentify the men but has turned over their files to local prosecutors .
One priest had more than one abuse complaint on record , a diocesanspokesman said .
San Diego , Calif .
BISHOP ROBERT BROM
Heis one of about a dozen U.S. bishops who have been accused of sexualmisconduct in recent years .
Catholic leaders in Minnesota , where BishopBrom once headed the Diocese of Duluth , have paid a settlement to aformer seminarian who alleged that he was coerced into sex .
Aspokeswoman for the bishop recently told The Boston Globe that " minimal insurance " money was paid to the accuser , who agreed toretract his claim .
Two archbishops who helped negotiate the deal in themid-1990s said the man received roughly $ 100,000 .
The man alleged thatin the 1980s , Bishop Brom and other high - ranking clergymen pressuredhim and other young men to have sex at a seminary in Winona , Minn .
Bishop Brom has denied any sexual misconduct and has said that aninvestigation disproved what the former seminarian " thought heremembered . "
In San Diego after Bishop Brom took over , questions aroseabout how his top aides handled the 1993 case of the Rev. EmmanuelOmemaga , who was accused of raping a 14 - year - old girl after hergrandfather 's funeral , tying her to a bed and photographing her inbondage .
The diocese has said it suspended the priest when it firstlearned of the accusation , then let him go home to the Philippines onvacation .
Police , meanwhile , began investigating and asked a priest whowas one of the bishop 's aides to alert them immediately upon FatherOmemaga 's return .
" He agreed to do so " but instead waited five days , according to a police report .
At that point , according to the report , the aide left a message saying that he had told the wanted man to callpolice and to consult an attorney .
Father Omemaga vanished and remainsthe target of an arrest warrant .
The aide has said he did everything hecould do to bring his fellow priest to justice .
Orange , Calif .
BISHOP TOD BROWN
Inlate March , after a lengthy review of personnel files , he proclaimedhis diocese a " safe haven " - a place free of priests with molestationrecords .
The review , required under a $ 5.2 million settlement reachedlast year with the victim of a former priest in the diocese , had led toremoval of at least two clerics who'd been working for years afteradmitting abuse .
Then in April , local media reported that the Rev. Denis Lyons had been accused of sexual misconduct for the third timeand suspended .
Bishop Brown 's predecessor had sent Father Lyons intotreatment after both previous allegations arose , in 1993 and 1994 .
Thebishop had n't fired the priest during the review , officials said , because one allegation involved misconduct with two adults and theother , involving two boys , could not be substantiated .
The priestsremoved because of the review included the Rev. Michael Pecharich , whoadmitted six years ago that he molested a teenage boy in the early1980s ; and the Rev. John Lenihan , who admitted more than a decade agothat he had sexually abused a teenage girl .
The diocese paid onesettlement then and another this year to a woman who said FatherLenihan abused her when she was a teen in the 1970s and paid for herabortion .
Seattle , Wash .
ARCHBISHOP ALEXANDER BRUNETT

Hehas come under criminal investigation in connection with a pendingchild - pornography possession case against one of his priests andrecently admitted negligent supervision of another , the Rev. DanielHerek , who 's been convicted of manufacturing pornography and abusing analtar boy .
Archbishop Curtiss has said he took immediate action againstFather Herek when pornographic evidence first surfaced in 1997 , butdocuments now emerging in civil court show several prior warnings ofinappropriate behavior with children .
The archbishop also suspended athird man this spring , the Rev. Thomas Sellentin , after the priestadmitted molesting boys in parishes years ago .
A spokesman said thearchbishop learned of that abuse only recently , though another priestand a former state Supreme Court judge said it was documented decadesago .
In mid-May , the chief prosecutor in Madison County , Neb. , saidArchbishop Curtiss could face witness - tampering charges because hesought the resignation of a Catholic schoolteacher who'd told policethat the Rev. Robert Allgaier viewed child pornography at work .
Thedistrict attorney has since said he would not charge the archbishop .

We had it handled .
You ruined aman 's life . "
Archbishop Curtiss has said he was n't trying to swaytestimony .
He has said that the priest was not accused of abusingchildren and was deemed by experts not to be attracted to them .
Earlier , Madison County prosecutor Joe Smith criticized the archbishopfor not coming to authorities when Father Allgaier admitted , in early2001 , that he had been viewing child pornography .
Instead , thearchbishop sent the priest to counseling and removed him from a highschool teaching job - then let him teach at a middle school until hisarrest in February

Springfield , Mass .
BISHOP THOMAS DUPRE
TheRev. Bruce
Teague says the bishop 's administration reprimanded him in1997 when he told police that a convicted child molester - the Rev. Richard Lavigne - was hanging around his church .
Father Teague has saidhe got authorities to issue a trespass order only after alertingdiocesan leaders and getting no response .
At the time , Father Lavignewas on probation , under church suspension and trying to help hearchildren 's confessions , Father Teague has said .
Bishop Dupre has saidthat Father Teague was not punished for going to police .
The bishop hasalso said that his diocese is ahead of some others in dealing withclergy sexual abuse , though he has at least two previously accused menon the job .
One is the Rev. Edward M. Kennedy , who paid a secretsettlement in the early 1990s to one accuser and was sent to atreatment center .
Father Kennedy celebrates
Mass at some parishes on afill - in basis , serves as chaplain at a retirement center and helpsdecide annulment cases at diocesan headquarters .
He recently told the Union - News of Springfield that he was grateful for the therapy he 'dreceived .
The diocese also sent him away to get a master 's degree inchurch law .
Another accused priest , the Rev. Richard Meehan , has beenworking as an archival researcher for the diocese .
Bishop Dupre alsohas been accused of not waiving confidentiality agreements in civilsettlements so that victims could speak freely with criminalauthorities .
He has disputed that charge New York , N.Y. CARDINAL EDWARD EGAN
Inhis previous post as bishop in Bridgeport , Conn. , he let some priestskeep working after they were accused of sexual abuse .
In closedtestimony in a 1997 lawsuit , he expressed doubt about the veracity ofmost allegations , saying that " very few have even come close to havinganyone prove anything . "
One priest he supported was the Rev. RaymondPcolka , who had been accused as far back as 1966 .
Father Pcolka ' salleged victims included more than a dozen boys and girls - some asyoung as 7 - who described being spanked and forced into oral and analsex .
Cardinal Egan kept him on the job until 1992 , when another accusercame forward and the priest refused orders to remain at a treatmentcenter .
The diocese has since settled lawsuits against Father Pcolka , who refused to answer lawyers ' questions during the litigation .
Anotherpriest protected by Cardinal Egan was the Rev. Laurence Brett , who hadfirst admitted abuse in 1964 - biting a boy 's genitals .
After CardinalEgan became Bridgeport 's bishop in the late 1980s , he met Father Brettand endorsed him for continued ministry .
" In the course of ourconversation , " he wrote , " the particulars of his case came out indetail and with grace . "
Further accusations led to Father Brett 'ssuspension in 1993 .
In a recent letter to New York parishioners , Cardinal Egan said his policy in Bridgeport was to do a preliminaryinvestigation of accused priests , then send them for psychiatricevaluation and heed doctors ' advice .
The Connecticut Postlater showedthat the policy was n't followed in the case of the Rev. Walter Coleman , who stayed on the job for more than a year after the Bridgeport dioceseconcluded in early 1994 that he had abused the son of a woman with whomhe had an affair and bought a house .
In early June , the pope appointedCardinal Egan to the Vatican 's highest court .
In mid-May , the Westchester County district attorney convened a grand jury toinvestigate New York archdiocesan leaders ' handling of sex- abuseallegations .

The priest refusedthe new job , his attorney has said , and remains off the job .
FatherMalicki and the archdiocese have asked a judge to order publicidentification of the plaintiffs , who are anonymous in court filingsbut whose names are known to the defense team .
The archdiocese made asimilar demand in a lawsuit filed in April against the Rev. JosephMaroor , who is accused of seducing a woman he counseled at adrug - treatment center .
The plaintiffs ' attorneys have accused the Favalora administration of trying to embarrass their clients intodropping the cases and discourage other victims from coming forward .
The defendants have said fairness dictates that all parties beidentified publicly .
Meanwhile , Archbishop Favalora has beennegotiating for months with local prosecutors over how much informationabout accused priests he will give them .
He recently suspended twopreviously accused priests , the Rev. Ricardo Castellanos and the Rev. Alvaro Guichard , after a new lawsuit alleged that they forced an altarboy to take part in orgies in the early 1970s .
The two priests facedsimilar allegations in the late 1970s , before Archbishop Favalora cameto Miami .
That accuser later recanted .
Father Castellanos and FatherGuichard have denied wrongdoing .

He was sent back to Dallas to avoid acourt martial and became the diocesan scouting director .
" We made thebest decision at the time in view of the circumstances , " BishopFellhauer told The Dallas Morning News in 1994 .
" There are alsomatters of confidentiality and people 's reputations . "
Mr. Peebles wasforced out of the priesthood in the late 1980s after he acknowledgedabusing other boys , but he was not prosecuted .
The diocese has paidmillions to his victims and also paid for him to get a law degree inNew Orleans .
Bishop Fellhauer has acknowledged making a mistakeregarding Mr. Peebles .
He has also testified that as early as 1985 hehad reports that boys were spending the night with the Rev. Rudy Kos , who is now imprisoned for life for sexually assaulting boys in the Dallas diocese .
But during the trial of several Kos victims ' civil suit - which ended in the largest clergy - abuse verdict in history - thebishop told jurors that he did n't suspect abuse .

Galveston - Houston , Texas BISHOP JOSEPH FIORENZA
Inthe late 1970s and early 1980s , as bishop of San Angelo in West Texas , he employed a priest who'd been forced from three other diocesesbecause of molestation accusations .
Bishop Fiorenza wrote in a 1982 letter that he knew of the Rev. David Holley 's " past difficulties " andstated : " With our shortage of priests , I am willing to riskincardinating him " - formally making him a priest of the Diocese of SanAngelo .
In 1997 , when The Dallas Morning News obtained thatletter and the rest of Father Holley 's personnel file , Bishop Fiorenzarefused interview requests .
He recently told The Houston Chronicle , through a spokesman , that he had n't known about the priest 's pedophiliawhen he employed him and that the " past difficulties " reference was to " poor people skills . "
Later , the bishop added that the reference alsocovered " problems with alcohol " - something that is not in thepersonnel file .
Father Holley is now imprisoned for molesting boys inNew Mexico , where he served before coming to Texas .

Superior , Wis. BISHOP RAPHAEL FLISS
Assecond in command of the diocese in the mid-1980s , he persuadedauthorities to let the church handle a parent 's allegations that the Rev. David Malsch had touched his 14 - year - old son and offered the boy $ 10 for oral sex .
" I did n't want to have a lot of scandal , " the bishoptestified years later .
Over the next seven years , Father Malsch wassent on a series of treatment stops and was transferred to parisheswhere he had contact with children .
After a mother came forward in1991 , police began investigating allegations that Father Malsch hadmolested a 14 - year - old boy with learning disabilities and had given himX - rated videos .
Bishop Fliss , by then head of the diocese , suspendedthe priest and ordered more treatment .
Two years later , Father Malshpleaded no contest to one count of child enticement , but denied otheraccusations against him , including that he had offered two brothersliquor and had repeatedly molested them over a five - year span .
Afterviolating terms of his probation , Father Malsch was sent to prison fornearly two years .

He has said he did n't remember anearlier complaint from a man who warned that he had seen the priestnaked in a swimming pool with two young girls .
Father Fernandez wasalso criminally charged in the late 1980s , but the case was dismissedat the request of an alleged victim .
St. Paul - Minneapolis , Minn .
ARCHBISHOP HARRY FLYNN
Asbishop of the Lafayette , La. , Diocese , he was credited with cleaning upone of the nation 's earliest clergy abuse scandals in the 1980s .
Thatrecord , in part , led to his April appointment as chairman of a keybishops ' committee that drafted the proposed national policy onhandling clergy sex abuse .
But since 1995 , Archbishop Flynn has allowedat least five accused priests - three who remain active - to continueworking in the Twin Cities despite past lawsuits or criminal chargesagainst them .
Although the Rev. Gil Gustafson pleaded guilty tosexually assaulting a young boy in the 1970s and spent six months in aworkhouse , he has been celebrating Mass four times a week at amonastery and serving as an administrative aide .
The Rev. MichaelStevens pleaded guilty in the late 1980s to sexual misconduct with aminor , and he has been working in the archdiocese 's computerdepartment .
Archbishop Flynn defended his decisions to keep thememployed , as well the Rev. Joseph Wada , who was accused in lawsuits ofabusing teenage boys .
" None of the three are in positions , now , inwhich children may be harmed , " he said .
Early in his tenure , thearchbishop kept the Rev. Robert Kapoun on duty despite claims that hehad molested four boys .
After a jury in 1996 awarded more than $ 1 million to one victim , the archdiocese announced that Father Kapoun , dubbed the Polka Priest for his use of the music in Masses , had agreedto step down .
An appeals court later overturned the decision , saying the victim had waited too long to come forward .

Dailyrecounted allegations against the priest .
Bishop Foley said he actedafter more victims came forward with " substantial and credible " complaints .
Father Cross has denied the allegations but agreed toretire in June .
In a 1995 lawsuit , Robert Wilford accused Father Crossof repeatedly molesting , sodomizing and beating him when he was ateenager in the 1960s - and alleged that the priest had confessed tochurch officials .
A judge later dismissed the case because the claimswere too old .
Father Cross said the suit was financially motivated .
Mr. Wilford had taken his complaints to the diocese in 1993 - eight yearsafter Father Cross was ordered to undergo treatment because of othermisconduct claims - but then - Bishop Raymond Boland kept Father Cross inhis administrative job at diocese headquarters ( see the Kansas City - St.Joseph , Mo.

The cardinal removed a former topaide , the Rev. R. Peter Bowman , from a parish .
in late May .
That was amonth after a man accused the priest of molesting him many years ago - and at least a year after the archdiocese dismissed another complaintagainst Father Bowman because , in a church spokesman 's words , itinvolved merely " horseplay that could have been misinterpreted . "
Thisspring , Cardinal George suspended a priest who had been a top aide tohis predecessor , Cardinal Joseph Bernardin .
The Rev. Robert Kealy hadremained a pastor after being accused last year of abusing a teenagerin the 1970s , then was removed in March after more informationsurfaced .
He used to help Cardinal Bernardin handle abuse allegationsagainst colleagues .
Neither he nor Father Bowman has respondedpublicly .
A third priest accused in April of abuse in the 1960 sremained on the job for more than a month ; the church spokesman saidinternal investigations have lagged because so many complaints areemerging .
There are also allegations of recent abuse and archdiocesanmisconduct .
One lawsuit , for example , has charged that the archdioceseknew three years ago that the Rev. Walter Strus was sexually harassingparishioners but let him keep working .
Father Strus has since fathereda child with a Polish immigrant , who has accused him of raping her andpressuring her to have an abortion .
He has denied the allegations .
" Wehad no indication of [ the priest 's ] propensity for sexual assault , " thechurch spokesman said .
Another recent scandal involves the Rev. SleevaRaju Policetti , who fled to his native India in May after being accusedof abusing a girl .
Church officials waited two days after learning ofthe allegation to call criminal authorities , who " advised us not toconfront him ... until they had the chance to gather more informationand question him , " the spokesman said .
" Somehow he found out ... anyway , and he left the country . "
Portland , Maine BISHOP JOSEPH GERRY
A1990 letter from one alleged victim of the Rev. Raymond Melville beggedBishop Gerry to " please stop this from happening again . "
The bishoppledged " to address the matter vigorously and expeditiously . "
He putFather Melville in therapy for a few months , then moved him to anotherparish .
While there , according to a pending lawsuit , the priestcontinued to molest a teenager whom he 'd started abusing years before .
Father Melville , who has n't commented publicly , was sent to one morechurch before leaving the ministry in 1997 .
A diocesan spokeswomanrecently said his departure had nothing to do with abuse allegations .
But last year , a former spokesman said the priest had quit afterrefusing further treatment .
The spokeswoman also said the diocese 's new " zero tolerance " policy would prevent someone similarly accused fromreturning to a parish .
Until it was implemented this year , at least twoadmitted abusers remained on the job : the Rev. Michael Doucette , forwhom the diocese paid a confidential settlement a decade ago ; and the Rev. John Audibert , a victim of whose spoke out publicly as long ago as1993 .
Evansville , Ind. BISHOP GERALD GETTELFINGER
Hetold parishioners in late March that priests who sexually abusechildren are guilty of " grave sins " that he would not tolerate .
At thetime , his spokesman would not say whether any complaints had beenreferred to criminal authorities or whether any priests had beenremoved .
Shortly afterward , news accounts detailed the backgrounds ofthree men who were working as pastors in the diocese : the Rev. JeanVogler , who spent 10 months in federal prison in the 1990s on a childpornography conviction ; the Rev. Michael Allen , who admitted that in1974 he initiated a series of sexual encounters with a 16 - year - old boywho was hospitalized for depression ; and the Rev. Mark Kurzendoerfer , who was transferred to a different teaching job in 1981 after beingaccused of abusing a 14 - year - old student .
Soon after coming toEvansville in 1989 , Bishop Gettelfinger ordered Father Kurzendoerfernot to have a youth ministry - although he let him work at a parishwith a school .
In May , the bishop suspended the priest and sent him tocounseling , saying that he had been violating the order , in part byhaving private counseling sessions with 11 - year - old students .
Parentsand the school principal had not been told about the restriction .
Bishop Gettelfinger acknowledged that he had also sent FatherKurzendoerfer into " extensive therapy " after he admitted soliciting a 17 - year - old in 1998 .
The young man then identified himself to the Evansville Courier & Pressas the priest 's nephew .
Meanwhile , Father Vogler and Father Allen haveremained on the job .
Bishop Gettelfinger has been publicly supportiveof Father Allen , saying he did n't think anyone was at risk .
" The peoplehave come to love him because of his pastoral gifts , his ministering tohis people , his presence to his people , the attention given to them , " the bishop said .
" He really has been the priestly leader that they werelooking for , yearning for , and now have . "
Raleigh , N.C. BISHOP F. JOSEPH GOSSMAN
Hesuspended the Rev. Thomas
Watkins from a parish this spring after a manalleged that he had been repeatedly sexually harassed by the priestwhile a college seminary student in Ohio many years ago .
Father Watkinshad been accused of inappropriate contact with three other peopleduring Bishop Gossman 's 27 - year tenure , but the diocese would notelaborate .
Father Watkins has denied the allegations .
Several yearsago , Bishop Gossman employed the Rev. Joseph LaForge after the priestwas charged in New Jersey with helping a cleric accused of childmolestation to flee the country .
Father LaForge admitted giving $ 5,000 in church funds to the Rev. Florencio Tumang , but said he had no ideathe priest would flee .
Charges against Father LaForge were dismissedafter he completed a pretrial intervention program for first - timeoffenders .
He has since died ; Father Tumang remains a fugitive .
Dallas , Texas BISHOP CHARLES GRAHMANN
Hisdiocese was found liable for conspiracy in 1997 after covering up yearsof abuse by the Rev. Rudy Kos ; jurors assessed the largest clergy - abuseverdict in history .
Bishop Grahmann had let Mr. Kos keep working in theearly 1990s after the priest ignored repeated orders to stop lettingboys sleep over at church residences .
The bishop testified that " therewas no reason " to remove Mr. Kos in spring 1992 after a social workerwho specializes in child abuse said Mr. Kos sounded like a " textbookpedophile . "
Bishop Grahmann also refused experts ' requests to testwhether Mr. Kos was aroused by pictures of children , saying he had " moral problems " with the procedure .
After jurors returned theirverdict , the bishop did not stay in the courtroom to hear a statementthey had written that said , in part , " Please admit your guilt . "
A topaide who did hear the statement said he did n't know how to respond toit , explaining that " I do n't know what ' admit your guilt ' is . "
Mr. Koshas since been defrocked , convicted of criminal charges and sent toprison .
In a recent interview , Bishop Grahmann gave this assessment ofthe pedophile priest scandal : " Bishops are accused of covering up andmoving people from one parish to another .
That 's a bunch of bull . "
Columbus , Ohio BISHOP JAMES GRIFFIN
Herecently said that some priests who 've been treated for sexualmisconduct - he would n't identify them - remain on the job but not inparishes .
Yet Bishop Griffin also acknowledged that he had put the Rev. Joseph Fete in a pastor 's job last year , after earlier removing himfrom another church , sending him to treatment and paying a settlementto a victim who was molested for years in the late 1970s .
MonsignorFete , who admitted the abuse , recently was put in charge of thediocese 's newly created office of ecumenical affairs .
Bishop Griffinalso acknowledged that the Rev. Phillip Jacobs had been allowed totransfer to a church in Victoria , British Columbia , after being accusedof molestation in 1994 .
The bishop said he sent Father Jacobs intotherapy for " improper sexual touching " of a boy .
Dubuque , Iowa ARCHBISHOP JEROME HANUS In2000 , he kept the Rev. Michael Fitzgerald on duty for weeks at a ruralparish after the diocese was shown evidence that the priest had tradedsexually suggestive e-mails with and arranged to meet a 13 - year - old boy - who turned out to actually be an investigator working for a privatechild - protection group .
After criminal authorities were notified , Archbishop Hanus suspended Father Fitzgerald and sent him to anout - of - state treatment center , which police said stymied theirinvestigation .
The archbishop later said he expected to return thepriest to his parish .
He dropped that idea after an allegation was madethat Father Fitzgerald had molested an adolescent from the church .
Thepriest died in a car crash last year while training near Chicago to bea hospital chaplain .
Norwich , Conn .
BISHOP DANIEL HART Alawsuit accuses him of ignoring several warning signs that could havestopped the Rev. Richard Buongirno from continuing to assault a youngboy .
The abuse allegedly began in the early 1990s , when the child was9 .
State officials were notified through an anonymous complaint , butthey stopped investigating because the boy denied being abused .
Stateand diocese officials never questioned the priest , according to theplaintiff 's lawyer .
In 1994 , a second allegation of abuse , made by aman , surfaced against Father Buongirno .
The cleric admitted to it , leading the bishop at the time to suspend him and order him intotreatment .
After Bishop Hart arrived in 1995 , he reviewed FatherBuongirno's file and returned him to ministry , sometimes aroundchildren .
Within a few years , Father Buongirno had allegedly begunagain abusing the boy , who was by then a teen - ager .
The abuse wasdiscovered after parish workers learned the boy was on an out - of - statetrip with Father Buongirno ; the priest had told colleagues he wastraveling with an adult .
The boy shared details with a counselor andpolice , who arrested Father Buongirno in 1999 .
Father Buongirno pleadednot guilty , and the charges were later dropped because of statutes oflimitation .
He has since left the priesthood .
Bishop
Hart 's lawyer saidthe bishop had reinstated the priest after a treatment clinic had givenits approval .
But records obtained by The Hartford Courant show that the diocese did not tell the center all the allegations against Father Buongirno .
Lafayette , Ind. BISHOP WILLIAM L. HIGI
Indianapolisnewspapers concluded in a 1997 series that Bishop Higi had concealedknowledge of several abusers and returned some to ministry .
Oneexample : the Rev. Ron Voss , who got therapy after being accused offondling teenagers in the late 1980s and was transferred to Haiti , where he sometimes worked with young people .
When fellow priestscomplained , one of the bishop 's aides ordered them to " cease fromjeopardizing the name and reputation of Ron Voss . "
Father Voss resignedfrom ministry in 1993 but continued to identify himself as a priest inthe Caribbean island nation .
Church officials have said Father Vossregrets his past behavior and has changed .
Bishop Higi initially calledthe newspaper 's reporting " a product of clever spins and a preconceivedagenda . "
Later , though , he hired a sexual - abuse counseling expert toinvestigate allegations and acknowledged that the news reports " foundme and my predecessors deficient . "
Toledo , Ohio BISHOP JAMES HOFFMAN
TheRev. Robert J. Fisher spent 30 days in jail after pleading guilty in1988 to molesting a 14 - year - old girl from his own parish .
After fouryears of church - ordered therapy Father Fisher was found fit to returnand Bishop Hoffman appointed him pastor at a another parish .
In March , as the clergy abuse crisis spread nationally , the diocese acknowledgedthat he remained on the job , but it did n't name him or his parishpublicly .
At the same time , officials said two other unnamed priests , who were described as having been involved in " improprieties " withadults or older teens , also were still active .
Bishop Hoffman suspended Father Fisher in May , to the displeasure of some parishioners .
He cited " the media climate " in the country as a factor in his decision , butsaid he had no plans to remove others .

We believe in forgiveness . "

And he has brought in a convicted childmolester , the Rev. Gary Berthiaume , who had served as an associatepastor under him at a Detroit church years ago ( see more under the Cleveland Diocese listing ) .
The Chicago Tribune recently reported thatin 1980 , early in Bishop Imesch 's career in Joliet , the diocese movedthe Rev. Lawrence Gibbs while he was under criminal investigation andrefused to tell investigators where he was .
The bishop told parentswhose children had been interviewed in the case that authorities hadfound no evidence to charge Father Gibbs , who got a new parish andallegedly molested again .
He has since left the priesthood .
Meanwhile , the Archdiocese of St. Louis recently removed two priests it hadaccepted from Joliet , the Rev. Fred Lenczycki and the Rev. J. AnthonyMeis , saying that Bishop Imesch had not disclosed past allegationsagainst them when recommending them for transfers .
The bishop hasdenied that assertion .
In recent months , he has said that some peopleare n't traumatized by sexual abuse and that some priests who molestadolescents should be allowed back into ministry after therapy .
But inlate May , he changed course and said he would support a " zerotolerance " policy if the nation 's bishops approve it in Dallas thisweek .

The parents also said that when theyreported the incident to Bishop Jacobs , he told them that FatherAndries was n't supposed to be around children .

Father Melanconhas since been convicted in that case and sentenced to life in prison .
Before the trial , the district attorney said he would seek to have Bishop Jarrell held in contempt of court for refusing to say whetherchurch authorities were investigating other complaints of sexual abuseagainst priests .
The bishop then answered that they had not .
One of hisformer top aides , the Rev. Albert Bergeron , pleaded guilty to lying toa grand jury investigating Father Melancon .

A panel Cardinal Keeler hadappointed to review such matters criticized the reinstatement , sayingthat the accusations against the priest were " consistent and credible . "
Father Blackwell was suspended again in 1998 after admitting sexualabuse of a minor that predated the 1993 case .
The 1993 accuser , DonteeStokes , was charged this spring with shooting and seriously wounding the priest .
Afterward Cardinal Keeler acknowledged that the 1993accusation had been credible , saying he regretted his earlier decisionand apologized for the first time to victims of clergymen , Thedetective who investigated at the time was constrained by prosecutors , according to records obtained by The Washington Post .
Anunidentified prosecutor 's notes say : " Priest known to prey on youngboys .
[ The detective is ] trying to pressure me into letting him speakwith the priest .
... I reiterated no arrest and no talking to priest .
" Cardinal Keeler also has long let the Rev. Michael Spillane work for agroup that advises the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on worshippractices .

Therapists hadwarned the diocese in writing that the Rev. Edward McKeown should bekept away from adolescents .

Boston , Mass .
CARDINAL BERNARD LAW
Hisrecord of protecting pedophile priests - in Boston and his previousdiocese in Missouri - has made headlines around the world in recentmonths , fueling numerous lawsuits and demands for his resignation .
Inthe 1990s , Cardinal Law and his aides helped the Rev. Paul Shanley getjobs in other dioceses despite psychiatric advice that he was dangerousand reports that he had publicly advocated sex between men and boys .
Church officials in New York and California say the Boston archdiocesewithheld this information from them .
Cardinal Law also repeatedlyreassigned the Rev. John Geoghan through many years of molestationcomplaints , letting him work until the early 1990s .
Mr. Geoghan hassince been convicted on molestation charges and sent to prison .
FatherShanley is under indictment and has pleaded not guilty .
In 1998 , afterdefrocking Mr. Geoghan , Cardinal Law reassigned the Rev. Ronald H.Paquin to a hospital chaplain job .
At that point , according todocuments obtained by The Boston Globe , the archdiocese alreadyknew of more than a dozen complaints from boys who accused the priestof molestation and rape - and had reached financial settlements withsome of them .
Father Paquin has been suspended and indicted ; he haspleaded not guilty .
One priest who assisted in his reassignment was the Rev. C. Melvin Surette - who had been removed from a parish in themid-1990s after the diocese settled several cases that alleged that heand yet another priest abused boys in a ministry for troubled teens .
Earlier , as the bishop leading the Springfield - Cape Girardeau , Mo. , diocese , Cardinal Law transferred an accused priest to several parishesin the early 1980s after misconduct complaints arose ( see more underthat diocese 's listing ) .
And before he was in Missouri , the cardinalwas a high - ranking priest in the Diocese of Jackson , Miss . - and therehe also helped two priests stay in parish jobs after abuse accusations , according to his recent deposition testimony .
One was George Broussard , whom a witness has identified as a close friend of Cardinal Law sincethe two attended seminary together in Ohio .
Mr. Broussard has left thepriesthood and declined to comment .
Springfield - Cape Girardeau , Mo. BISHOP JOHN LEIBRECHT
Whenthe diocese received a letter in alleging that the Rev. Amel Shibleyhad molested a boy in the 1980s , the priest admitted it was true .
Bishop Leibrecht let him stay on .
But when a second letter levyingcharges against Father Shibley arrived in 1995 , the priest was asked tostep down .
Two years later , however , Bishop Leibrecht offered thepriest part - time work .
The arrangement lasted until March , when BishopLeibrecht changed the diocese 's approach to claims of sexual abuse byclergy .
He again dismissed Father Shibley to " make sure everybodyunderstands how serious we are taking this . "
The bishop has alsoemployed another priest , the Rev. Leonard Chambers , who was accused inthe 1980s of abuse .
The man leading the diocese at that time - CardinalBernard Law , who is now in Boston - sent Father Chambers to treatmentand then assigned him to two parishes .
When Bishop Leibrecht took overin 1984 , he kept Father Chambers with conditions .
In 1998 , the priestwas found alone with a minor , and Bishop Leibrecht sought hisretirement .
The bishop said the incident did n't involve sexualmisconduct .
San Francisco , Calif .
ARCHBISHOP WILLIAM LEVADA
The Rev. John Conley told diocese officials and authorities nearly fiveyears ago that he had walked in on a colleague straddling a kneeling 15 - year - old altar boy in a dark rectory room .
A few months later , Father Conley was placed on administrative leave .
He has filed alawsuit that accuses Archbishop Levada of retaliating against him forreporting the other priest , the Rev. James Aylward , to police .
Thearchdiocese has denied any wrongdoing , and Father Aylward described the November 1997 incident as " horseplay and wrestling . "
During a meetingwith Archbishop Levada in late 1997 , Father Conley , a former federalprosecutor , tried to record a conversation as directed by his lawyer .
But the archbishop refused and , when Father Conley persisted , accusedhim of insubordination .
Father Conley was then put on leave , a move thechurch said was unrelated .
He remains on leave .
As for Father Aylward , police said they could not find sufficient evidence for charges , and achurch inquiry ruled his behavior inappropriate but not sexual .
Father Aylward continued to deny wrongdoing until 2000 , when he admittedduring a deposition to a history of touching boys , including wrestlingwith them for sexual pleasure .
After the deposition , Father Aylward wasplaced on leave from his parish job , and later that year , thearchdiocese paid a plaintiff $ 750,000 .
Bridgeport , Conn .
BISHOP WILLIAM LORI
UntilApril , he allowed two priests to work despite long - standing molestationallegations .
The Rev. Stanley Koziol and the Rev. Gregory Smith bothacknowledged misconduct .
The two priests were among seven who hired anattorney in the mid-1990s , before Bishop Lori came to town , andprevented plaintiffs ' attorneys from obtaining their personnel files .
Three of the seven remained on the job this spring and have never beenpublicly identified , The Hartford Courant reported .
" The evilof sexual abuse of minors calls for a radically new approach , " BishopLori said recently .

Springfield , Ill .
BISHOP GEORGE LUCAS
Hehas allowed his predecessor , Bishop Daniel Ryan , to celebrate Mass andpreside at funerals , despite accusations of sex with teenage boyprostitutes and priests that preceded his early retirement in 1999 .
Aformer altar boy has filed a lawsuit alleging that such activitycreated an atmosphere of tolerance for the child molestation hesuffered at the hands of the Rev. Alvin Campbell , who served severalyears in prison for abuse .
Bishop Ryan has denied any sexualmisconduct .
Bishop Lucas recently wrote that he knew of no credibleevidence of abuse by any active clergy in the Springfield Diocese .
St. Petersburg , Fla . BISHOP ROBERT LYNCH
Thisspring , as police hunted for the Rev. Robert Schaeufele , the bishoprefused to give prosecutors information about church officials ' recentquestioning of the priest .
Father Schaeufele resigned from a parish inApril and moved out of state after the diocese confronted him withabuse allegations .
Officers found him in Michigan and charged him withsexually battering two 11 - year - old boys in the 1980s .
A diocesanattorney has said Father Schaeufele admitted he " crossed boundaries " with minors .
Last year , the diocese paid $ 100,000 to its formerspokesman to settle claims that Bishop Lynch had sexually harassed him .
The bishop characterized the payment as a severance package .
The formerspokesman , Bill Urbanski , said he initially appreciated Bishop Lynch ' slavish gifts - stereos , cameras , upscale clothes .
But he began to feelincreasingly uncomfortable when Bishop Lynch would touch and massagehim , or would walk around naked in their hotel room during trips .
Bishop Lynch described the matter as a misunderstanding : " I did notintend anything .
We were close friends . "
A diocesan investigation , ledby three close Lynch aides , found no evidence to back Mr. Urbanski 'sallegations of advances .
Mr. Urbanski said investigators neverinterviewed him .
Los Angeles , Calif .
CARDINAL ROGER MAHONY
Morethan 30 current and former archdiocesan priests are under criminalinvestigation , and the district attorney has said he would callCardinal Mahony before a grand jury unless he divulges his files onthem ; he has vowed to cooperate .
One of the cases involves the Rev. Michael Stephen Baker , who admitted to the cardinal in 1986 that he hadmolested boys but was kept on the job , in several parishes , until 2000 .
The cardinal later approved a confidential $ 1.3 million settlement withtwo of Father Baker 's victims who say they were abused as recently as1999 .
" I offer my sincere , personal apologies for my failure to takefirm and decisive action much earlier , " Cardinal Mahony recently wroteto the priests he supervises .
Father Baker is accused of molestingboys , some as young as 5 , from 1976 to 1999 .
In another case , thearchdiocese let the Rev. G. Neville Rucker remain in the ministry untilthis year despite abuse allegations that first surfaced 35 years agoand led to an out - of - court settlement of a 1993 lawsuit .
FatherRucker 's alleged victims included 9 - year - old girls ; he has deniedwrongdoing .
In the early 1980s , when he was bishop of Stockton , Calif. , Cardinal Mahony moved the Rev. Oliver O'Grady to various parishes .
During a civil trial , the cardinal said he did n't know about FatherO ' Grady 's abuse , but his testimony was contradicted by a psychiatristhe had hired to evaluate the priest .
Father O'Grady was later sent toprison , and Cardinal Mahony 's dealings with him have become the subjectof a federal racketeering lawsuit .
Detroit , Mich .
CARDINAL ADAM MAIDA
Thisyear , the archdiocese gave local prosecutors the names of 51 clericsaccused of abuse over the years and disclosed that four , whom it wouldnot identify , remained on the job .
Prosecutor Carl Marlinga of MacombCounty , in suburban Detroit , said that keeping the priests active letthe church and clerics " benefit from the cover - up they 've engaged infor so long . "
Cardinal Maida 's spokesman said an internal reviewdetermined that the allegations were n't credible and that none of thefour was working in Macomb County , so " it should n't be a concern to the Macomb County prosecutor . "
Two other priests , whose conduct had led tosecret cash settlements , remained at work until this spring .
The Rev. Walter Lezuchowski , for example , was barred from working in churchesafter the archdiocese concluded in the early 1990s that he had abused agirl .
In early May , Cardinal Maida 's spokesmen said he was still onrestricted duty , then acknowledged the next day that Father Lezuchowskihad been serving at a church for the last five years .
The spokesmensaid they could n't explain the situation .
Father Lezuchowski has sincebeen removed from ministry after prosecutors said they had received acriminal complaint against him , alleging abuse that occurred before hewas sent to treatment in the early 1990s .
In March , before thecontroversies arose , Cardinal Maida acknowledged that " some priests - even bishops - have betrayed the trust of the people . "
He added : " Iapologize for their mistakes . "
Buffalo , N.Y. BISHOP HENRY MANSELL
In1986 , as a high - ranking personnel administrator for the Archdiocese ofNew York , he encouraged a colleague who had been treated for pedophiliaand barred from working with children to seek a promotion .
" The futureis bright with promise , " he wrote to the Rev. Edward Pipala , who got tolead his own parish two years later .
Mr. Pipala has since served sevenyears in prison for molestation and no longer works as a priest .
InBuffalo , Bishop Mansell has refused to identify accused priests topolice .
State law does n't require him to do so , and the bishop saidthat divulging names could chill efforts to uncover wrongdoing byclergy .
Washington , D.C. , District of Columbia CARDINAL THEODORE McCARRICK
Asbishop of the Metuchen , N.J. , diocese in 1985 , he accepted the Rev. Eugene O'Sullivan 's transfer from Boston - even though he knew thepriest had pleaded guilty to raping an altar boy in 1984 .
FatherO'Sullivan had been sentenced to five years ' probation and ordered notto have contact with young people .
His first assignment in New Jerseywas to a parish with an elementary school .
During his seven years inMetuchen , Father O'Sullivan was transferred to other churches in whichhe continued to serve around children , including a youth group , butparishioners were n't told of his background .
The priest was called backto Boston in 1992 and directed to stop his ministry .
A year later , whenCardinal McCarrick was questioned about Father O'Sullivan , heacknowledged he was aware of the priest 's background .
In agreeing totake Father O'Sullivan , Cardinal McCarrick said , he had receivedassurances from Boston and a treatment center that the priest wasrehabilitated and was told there were no work restrictions on him .
Thecardinal has said he would not agree to accept such a priest again .
Manchester , N.H. BISHOP JOHN McCORMACK
Amongthe former aides to Boston Cardinal Bernard Law who have been promotedto top leadership positions elsewhere , Bishop McCormack has faced someof the harshest criticism .
Documents obtained in civil lawsuits showthat he let the Rev. Paul Shanley keep working in a parish after a 1985 complaint that the priest had endorsed man-boy sex in a speech , asking Father Shanley only if he cared to comment on the allegation .
Thebishop recently said he did n't know of any misconduct with a minor by Father Shanley until 1993 - but the archdiocese had settled an abuselawsuit that named the priest in 1991 , and Bishop McCormack had writtento a colleague that same year " that Paul Shanley is a sick person " whoshould n't be allowed to return to Boston from California .
FatherShanley was recently charged with raping a young boy and has pleadednot guilty .
New allegations about Bishop McCormack 's handling of abuseallegations have emerged in litigation - including that as a priest inthe late 1960s he did nothing after seeing the late Rev. JosephBirmingham take a boy into a rectory bedroom and hearing complaintsabout similar behavior from several women .
Bishop McCormack has deniedthose allegations and added that , in dealing with Father Shanley , hewas " firm while still at the same time kind . "
In early June , the BostonHerald reported that the bishop had ignored his top Boston aide ' surgings that he notify parishes about priests who had been removedbecause of abuse allegations .
Bishop McCormack recently stepped down ashead of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops abuse committee butremains a member of the panel .
San Jose , Calif .
BISHOP PATRICK McGRATH
Thebishop let two priests work despite their criminal convictions forsexual abuse of children - until this spring .
The Rev. Leonel Noia wasa pastor at a parish with a school until he recently went on asabbatical .
In 1976 , two brothers , ages 12 and 14 , testified that Father Noia had shown them X - rated magazines while on a camping tripthat year , offered them a drug that can enhance sexual sensations andmolested them on subsequent nights .
He also performed oral sex on theoldest .
After two nights , the brothers sought help from other campers , who called sheriff 's deputies .
Father Noia , who was arrested afterpolice found the drug and magazines in his truck , pleaded no contest toa felony in 1976 and was sentenced to six months in jail .
He blamed theepisode on being drunk .
After attending treatment and serving part ofhis probation , he was reassigned to a parish .
Three years later , he wona court petition to clear his record .
" I have lived in a faithful anddignified manner for 26 years , " he told the San Jose Mercury News inMay .
The second priest , the Rev. Robert A. Gray , pleaded no contestafter one of his karate students complained to police in 1993 that thepriest had massaged him in the nude .
Investigators found other studentswho said they were also fondled .
Father Gray was sentenced to 160 daysin jail and underwent treatment .
Upon his return , he was given anadministrative job at diocesan offices .
He was also permitted tocelebrate Mass at two parishes and preside at weddings until this spring Owensboro , Ky. BISHOP JOHN McRAITH
Hesaid in early June that he had kept priests on the job after theyadmitted sexually abusing children and got treatment .
Bishop McRaith , who has been in office since 1982 , would not name the priests and wouldsay only that they were in " specialized ministries " and had no contactwith children .
He could not elaborate , he said , because of confidentialsettlements reached with victims .
The diocese did not notify police , the bishop said .
Since 1988 , state law has required reporting of childabuse ; Bishop McRaith did not say when he had learned of incidents .
" Imay well have , or should have , reported them , " he told the EvansvilleCourier & Press .
" At the time , I did n't even think to report them . "
Lansing , Mich .
BISHOP CARL MENGELING
In1998 , Bishop J. Keith Symons resigned as head of the Diocese of PalmBeach , Fla. , after admitting that he'd molested several altar boysearly in his career ( see more under the Trenton , N.J. , Dioceselisting ) .
A year later , he returned to the ministry in Michigan , withapproval from Bishop Mengeling and the Vatican .
Bishop Mengeling gavehim " permission to lead spiritual retreats for adults who seek to knowand love God , " a spokesman told a reporter in 1999 .
Great Falls - Billings , Mont.
BISHOP ANTHONY MILONE
Whenthe Rev. John Houlihan was accused two years ago of sexually harassingand discriminating against a priest under his supervision , BishopMilone said the allegations were not credible and left him on the job .
Another priest had made a sexual assault allegation against FatherHoulihan in 1994 , but the bishop said that alleged victim had refusedto talk .
However , Gene Jarussi , a Billings lawyer who has representedboth accusers , said the first claim " was settled on its merits " for aconfidential sum .
His current client , the Rev. Anandan Elangovan , has afederal lawsuit pending against the diocese and Father Houlihan , whodeny wrongdoing .
A state human rights investigator has dismissed acomplaint from Father Elangovan , who was himself accused of sexuallyharassing a female parishioner .
Tucson , Ariz .
BISHOP MANUEL MORENO
Lawsuitsfiled in recent years by nearly a dozen people have alleged that BishopMoreno failed to act on complaints against at least four priestsaccused of sex abuse .
One suit , involving the Rev. Robert Trupia , accused Bishop Moreno of keeping the priest on the job with young boys , trying to discourage whistle - blowers and shielding him from policeinvestigators .
Bishop Moreno has denied that he or his staff covered upfor any priest , although after settling several suits this year heacknowledged that " there have been failings in the past . "
In FatherTrupia 's case , the bishop had known of allegations against the priestfor years , but did not investigate until he was directed to do so in1992 by an out - of - state archbishop who had been contacted by a victim 'smother .
According to court records , Father Trupia initiallyacknowledged molestation to Bishop Moreno in April 1992 , called himselfa " loose cannon " and said he was " unfit for the priesthood . "
But thepriest also threatened to reveal sexual relationships he said he'd hadwith other high - ranking church officials , if Bishop Moreno disclosedhis admissions and did n't allow him to retire .
The bishop suspended Father Trupia and ordered treatment .
During the next few years , BishopMoreno told victims ' families that Father Trupia had denied theallegations .
More recently , the bishop changed his deposition testimonyto deny that the priest admitted abuse or made threats .
According tocourt records , the diocese refused to cooperate with police - firstfrom Tucson , then from Yuma - when they tried to investigate thepriest .
The priest was arrested in late 2000 , but prosecutors decidedthe charges were too old to prosecute .
The priest has maintained hisinnocence .
In a separate case , Bishop Moreno has approved work forBishop Patrick Ziemann , who resigned in 1999 as head of the Diocese ofSanta Rosa , Calif. , after accusations that he coerced a priest intohaving sex .
He found a new home at a monastery in southern Arizona , working with young priest candidates and counseling other people .
Alawsuit against Bishop Ziemann was settled in 2000 for more than $ 500,000 .
Syracuse , N.Y. BISHOP JAMES MOYNIHAN
Hehas allowed three priests to have a role in ministry despite pastsex - abuse accusations and , in two cases , financial settlements .
Afterarriving in the mid-1990s , Bishop Moynihan let a retired monsignor , the Rev. Charles Sewall , teach part - time at a Catholic school - althoughthe diocese had settled in 1988 a complaint that he abused a boy whileserving as a school principal decades earlier .
After the out - of - courtsettlement , Monsignor Sewall underwent treatment but remained a pastorand an administrator until he retired , then continued to teach some .
When the case resurfaced this year , Monsignor Sewall admitted to themolestation .
The victim , Lincoln Franchell , who is now an adult , hassaid he is among the three men who recently filed a lawsuit againstMonsignor Sewall .
The diocese is also named as a defendant .
The menallege that the abuse happened on school grounds in the 1970s and 1980 sand that Monsignor Sewall offered them money in exchange for silence .
In a separate case , police have charged a teenage boy who recantedclaims that Monsignor Sewall recently abused him .
Although diocesesacross the country have drafted new guidelines to tell authoritiesabout allegations , Bishop Moynihan 's recently updated policy doesn ' trequire such notification .
Providence , R.I. BISHOP ROBERT MULVEE
Hesuspended the Rev. Normand Demers in March - but the diocese had knownabout sexual misconduct allegations against the priest since 1989 , whenboys complained at a Haitian orphanage he helped establish .
They saidhe touched them inappropriately and brought them to his bedroom , one ata time , to disrobe in front of him while trying on clothing .
FatherDemers , who denied wrongdoing , was forced to resign and left Haiti toavoid prosecution , a former orphanage official told The ProvidenceJournal - Bulletin .
He came back to the Diocese of Providence and workedunder Bishop Mulvee for seven years , since the diocesan leader came totown .
He was removed this year after being accused of abusing a boylong ago while working as a hospital chaplain long .
The bishopannounced a " zero tolerance " policy early this year , shortly aftersuspending a priest charged with assaulting a 16 - year - old boyrepeatedly in 2001 .
That cleric , the Rev. Daniel Azzarone Jr. , had beenkept on the job despite allegations made in 1985 and the late 1990s ; the diocese said it could n't substantiate those claims .
Bishop Mulvee , who was n't in Providence in 1985 , said his staff did n't tell him aboutthe late - 1990s accusation .
Kalamazoo , Mich .
BISHOP JAMES MURRAY
Heemploys and has expressed strong support for the Rev. Thomas DeVita , who has admitted sexual misconduct with a boy .
Father DeVita has saidhe had a few consensual encounters with a 16 - year - old parishioner in1978 , when he worked on Long Island , N.Y. , for the Diocese of RockvilleCentre .
The accuser 's family has said the sex started earlier , lastedlonger and was coerced .
Father DeVita also has denied asexual - misconduct allegation made by an adult in 1995 , after he'd beentransferred to the Diocese of Palm Beach , Fla. , and before he came toKalamazoo .
St. Thomas , U.S. Virgin Islands BISHOP GEORGE MURRY
Despitethe Rev. John Calicott 's admission that he engaged in sexual misconductwith two teenage boys in the mid-1970s , the Chicago archdiocesereinstated him in 1995 - contrary to its policy against letting knownabusers work .
Bishop Murry , then an auxiliary to the late CardinalJoseph Bernardin , was supervising the archdiocesan region where FatherCalicott was stationed .
And he led Father Calicott 's reinstatementceremony .
Bishop Murry said at the time that church members had assuredhim that they wanted Father Calicott returned to their parish .
Afterthe victims had come forward in 1994 and an archdiocesean review panelrecommended removal , Father Calicott was placed on leave and sent totreatment .
Evaluations prepared during his treatment concluded that hewas n't a sexual predator , clearing the way for his reinstatement .
Uponhis return , Father Calicott described himself as " angry " that thechurch removed him and put him through " rigorous " counseling .
Thearchdiocese did order that a monitor be present whenever he had contactwith children , which today includes his work as a Boy Scout master anda grammar school teacher .
Palm Beach , Fla . ADMINISTRATOR JAMES MURTAGH
Alongtime diocesan manager , he has been the acting bishop since hisformer boss , Bishop Anthony O'Connell , resigned in March afteradmitting he abused a seminary student years ago .
Parishioners havecomplained about Father Murtagh getting the temporary appointment , saying that he played a key part in past administrations that protectedabusive priests .
As interim leader during a previous diocesanleadership transition in the early 1990s , Father Murtagh reassigned apriest who had been accused for years of sexually harassing women andhad been the subject of at least one secret settlement .
The Rev. FrankFlynn was later accused of sexually abusing a woman who came to him forcounseling , and he transferred to Ireland .
Father Murtagh has describedthe priest 's accusers as women who had been in " consensualrelationships gone sour . "
This spring , a woman accused Father Flynn ofmolesting her in the late 1970s and early 1980 , beginning she was 12 years old .
The priest denied her allegations ; police are investigating .
One prominent church fund - raiser has called on Father Murtagh to resignbecause of the Flynn matter and that of the Rev. William White .
FatherWhite was allowed to teach at a South Florida seminary and help out atparishes for more than four years after church officials in New York , in 1997 , reached a settlement with one of his former students , whom headmitted molesting .
The acting bishop has defended the diocese ' shandling of both priests .
Newark , N.J. ARCHBISHOP JOHN MYERS Duringhis time as leader of the Diocese of Peoria , Ill . - which he left lastyear - at least one priest was accused of sexual abuse and reassigned .
A Peoria diocesan spokeswoman said the Rev. John Anderson was firstaccused of abuse in 1993 and removed from a parish .
The archbishop , whowas recently appointed to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops abusecommittee , said he had no knowledge of the matter .
Father Anderson , whoserved until recently as director of the diocesan office forPropagation of the Faith , has not commented publicly .
He was amongseven priests suspended in May by the Peoria Diocese .
After thosesuspensions , accusers of a previously suspended Peoria priest said that Archbishop Myers had not responded to their complaints in the early1990s until , after months of frustration , they talked to a localnewspaper .
And then - Bishop Myers later moved to reinstate the Rev. Francis Engels , then backed off when alleged victims complained .
" Idid n't realize they would be so upset , " the archbishop recently said .
Venice , Fla . BISHOP JOHN NEVINS Despitenumerous complaints about the Rev. Ed McLoughlin's " touchy - feely " nature , a doctor 's directive that he stop working near children andseveral treatment stays , the longtime bishop kept the priest at work .
Alawsuit alleged that Bishop Nevins ignored the warnings until 1996 , when a former altar boy 's lawyer approached the diocese about sexualassaults .
The bishop then suspended Father McLoughlin from his job at aparish with a school and later paid $ 500,000 to settle the case .
Theboy , in his early teens at the time , said he first turned to FatherMcLoughlin in 1992 after a church choir director had repeatedlyassaulted him .
Father McLoughlin told the boy that he needed punishmentand spanked him , starting years of molestation .
In 1993 , a year afterthe abuse began , an Atlanta doctor cautioned the diocese that " it wouldbe inappropriate " for the priest to work near children , yet he stayedon duty .
Father McLoughlin 's personnel file also included complaintsfrom parents , his co-workers and children about his inappropriatetouching since the mid-1980s , when Bishop Nevins took over .
Phoenix , Ariz .
BISHOP THOMAS O'BRIEN
Hehas a 20 - year record of sheltering priests accused of abuse but haslargely remained out of the national spotlight .
Criminal investigatorssay he has been uncooperative - and a district attorney recently openeda preliminary inquiry into the diocese 's handling of sex- abuseallegations .
Since the mid-1980s , at least four Phoenix priests haveserved jail time in connection with molesting children .
The bishop hasadvocated lighter sentences and let one priest work after he wassentenced to probation .
When the most recent abuse case surfaced thisyear , Bishop O'Brien criticized the Phoenix press for reporting a 1999 psychological evaluation that said the Rev. Patrick Colleary 's " historywill be repeated in some way " and that he should n't " work with minorsor women . "
Bishop O'Brien kept Father Colleary active until May despiteknowing of six complaints - including that he raped and impregnated ayoung woman and that he fondled an altar boy .
Father Colleary , who hasreceived therapy , denied most of the wrongdoings and said hisrelationship with the woman was consensual .
In the case of the Rev. Joseph M. Lessard , Bishop O'Brien dismissed previous complaints andassigned him to a teaching job .
Father Lessard was later accused ofperforming oral sex on a 13 - year - old in the boy 's room while hisparents were down the hallway .
When police investigated in themid-1980s , Bishop O'Brien refused to tell them about a confession thepriest made to him , according to court records .
Father Lessardeventually admitted the molestation and was put on probation .
Aftertreatment , he transferred to the Midwest as a hospital chaplain .
Thediocese denied knowing his exact location not long after he left .
Brownsville , Texas BISHOP RAYMUNDO PENA
Policesay that Bishop Pena and his staff did n't help them find a priest whovanished last summer during their investigation into allegations thatthe priest had raped a 16 - year - old mentally disabled incest victim .
"
It 's been like hitting a brick wall , " Lt. Guadalupe Salinas recentlytold The Brownsville Herald .
" Church officials referred us totheir legal counsel .
That did n't help anything . "
The Rev. BasilChukwuma Onyia , who is from Nigeria , is the target of an arrestwarrant .
A lawsuit filed in connection with the case alleges that thediocese has and continues " to cover up the incidents of priest sexualabuse of minors and prevent disclosure , prosecution and civillitigation . "
Through his attorneys , Bishop Pena has denied wrongdoing .
The lawyers have responded to the civil suit by saying that the courtsystem has no jurisdiction over a church .
The bishop also said in apublished letter that the diocese has documentation showing that itcooperated with police .
San Angelo , Texas BISHOP MICHAEL PFEIFER
Churchdocuments now emerging in civil litigation show that the diocese letseminary candidate Agusti Huerres come to Texas from Spain in 1999 without getting what the bishop once called " the most importantdocument " - a recommendation from the r

While stem cells exhibit the capacity to differentiate and self - renew , their ability to do so is now known to decline with age .
The stem cell niche plays a key role in this decline , particularly in the case of embryonic stem cells .
At the level of individual cells , replicative capacity is to reason that telomere dynamics should be intimately involved with this age - related decline in stem cell function .
To this end , Holmes et al. have recently investigated telomere dynamics in a longitudinal study of fetal and early post-natal subjects :
Telomere length dynamics differ in foetal and early post-natal leukocytes in a longitudinal study Haemopoietic stem cells ( HSC ) undergo a process of self renewal to constantly maintain blood cell turnover .
However , it has become apparent that adult HSC lose their self - renewal ability with age .
Telomere shortening in peripheral blood leukocytes has been seen to occur with age and it has been associated with loss of HSC proliferative capacity and cellular ageing .
In contrast foetal HSC are known to have greater proliferative capacity than post-natal stem cells .
However it is unknown whether they undergo a similar process of telomere shortening .
In this study we show a more accentuated rate of telomere loss in leukocytes from pre term infants compared to human foetuses of comparable age followed longitudinally for 8 - 12 weeks in a longitudinal study .
Our results point to a difference inHSC behaviour between foetal and early postnatal life which isindependent of age but may be influenced by events at birth itself .
To compare telomere dynamics between fetal and adult stem cells , theauthors carried out a longitudinal analysis of peripheral blood .
Obtaining serial fetal samples from healthy subjects would be fraught with ethical issues , hence alloimmune fetuses ( AF ) undergoing intrauterine transfusion were utilized .
Venous samples from age - matched fetuses undergoing termination of pregnancy ( TOP ) for non-hematological reasons served as controls ; no significant differences in terms of MNC behavior were noted , hence the AF samples were considered to be representative .
MNC telomere length in the AF samples was then compared with pre-term infants ( PTI ) of equivalent gestational age to assess the impact of the different environments ( in utero vs. post - natal ) .
In 7 of the 8 fetal samples , comparison between the first and last serial samples revealed either an increase in mean telomere length , or no “ detectable “ change in length ( overall , the average gain in length was 19 bp / week ) .
A similar analysis was performed on the PTI samples with equivalent gestational ages ; in contrast to the fetal samples , 4 out of 5 PTI samples demonstrated considerable age - related telomere length decline ( 238 bp / week ) .
No significant changes in sub-sets of peripheral blood cells occurred between time points or between AF and PTI groups .
The paper supports the notion that stem cells lose efficacy with increasing age — even very early age .
Furthermore , regarding the environmental influence on stem cell efficacy , these data extend the scope of the term “ environment ” beyond the stem cell niche and into the macroscopic world : in utero , fetuses continue to extend their telomeres — even though their cells are rapidly dividing – whereas once they are ex utero , babies start to shorten their telomeres .
During the discussion , the authors suggest that “ different mechanisms of telomere length maintenance operate … in foetal compared to post- natal life ” .
Unfortunately , these differences are not investigated further in this study .
I would have liked to see the authors measure telomerase activity and correlate this with the differing rates of attrition .
Furthermore , the physical weight of the PTI samples should be included : it is recognized that babies born small - for - gestation age ( SGA ) are prone to developing problems in adulthood ( including hypertension ) , possibly as a result of increased growth ( with concurrent telomere loss ) during the first year of life .
In light of this , omission of weight data makes the interpretation of the results less robust .
Leaving the mechanisms aside for the moment , the data indicate that fetal HSCs may provide a superior source of cells for use in the clinical setting — assuming , that is , that removing them from the in utero context is n’t the event that flips the switch from telomere elongation to telomere attrition .

Experts urge shift from Bush surveillance abuses Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday December 3 , 2008
Print This Email This As Barack Obama continues to fill out his prospective cabinet , attention on Capitol Hill is turning to rectifying some of the abuses that occurred on President Bush 's watch .
The House Committee on Homeland Security Wednesday convened a daylong series of discussions among privacy , civil liberties and national security experts exchanging ideas to improve the nation 's efforts to combat terrorism while protecting Americans ' constitutional rights .
At a midmorning panel examining the increased collection and sharing of information on Americans , experts recommended refocusing the efforts of the law enforcement and intelligence communities to avoid ineffective , time - wasting reliance on massive data collection .
" If you want bloated government , then continue to investigate law abiding citizens to find the terrorist in the haystack , " said Laura Murphy , one of the panelists .
Michael German , a former FBI agent now with the American Civil Liberties Union , said the government is too eager to rely on new technologies to collect and analyze massive amounts of information , rather than old - fashioned techniques that have proven most effective .
" It 's regular police work that gets results , " he said .
Among the problems highlighted during the morning panel were fusion centers that encourage state and local police to collect information on Americans and share it with federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies , increasing reliance on government and privately owned databases for data - mining , and an overall shift away from emphasizing the importance of protecting innocent Americans ' privacy in pursuing national security policies .
Panelists advanced several recommendations for Congress and the next administration , primarily a refocusing on ensuring enforcement of the Privacy Act and mandating strict privacy safeguards in post - 9/11 programs like the Information Sharing Environment .
Kate Martin , who directs the Center for National Security Studies , said Congress needs to launch a wholesale investigation of the government 's domestic intelligence gathering and surveillance activities .
Such a review should not simply focus on hot - button topics like the Patriot Act or the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping but the complete picture of authority granted to collect , share and use information about Americans .
There have been numerous documented instances of law enforcement resources being used improperly to target innocent individuals , such as the Maryland State Police investigation of peace activists .
German said that law enforcement agencies should not receive a free pass when they are found to have participated in such activities .
" Demanding accountability from national security and law enforcement agencies is essential to our ensuring security , " he said .
" Investigating and collecting information on innocent people wont help them stop guilty people . "
The Association for Civil Rights in Israel ( ACRI ) warned Sunday that " the Israeli democracy is in danger " .
The stark warning was noted in an Association report on discrimination in Israel , published on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the UN human rights decree .
The report examined civil rights observations and breaches in Israel and the territories in 2008 , and its finding indicate severe detriment to basic human rights , the likes of the right dignity , privacy , healthcare , education and housing .
Sanctioned Bias ?
Olmert : Discrimination against Arabs deliberate Sharon Roffe - Ofir Prime Minister Ehud Olmert says longtime discrimination against Israeli Arabs seeking public service posts deliberate ; PM says that complete absence of Arab employees at Bank of Israel ' terrible ' Olmert : Discrimination against Arabs deliberate
The report also warns of new threats of freedom of speech , racism and the erosion of democracy .
According to the team which compiled the report , the problem stems form the lack to true internalization and constitutional anchoring of quality as a value in Israeli society .
Exploring the matter of discrimination , the report states that since the inception of the State of Israel , Israeli Arabs have been subject to discrimination via legislation , the allocation of resources and through the existence of bodies such as the Jewish Agency and Jewish National Fund .
With some 90,000 Arabs living in mixed cities , the differences between the Jewish and Arab neighborhoods is evident is all aspects of life and the fabric of the relations between the Arab and Jews living in these cities is riddled with violence and racism , as seen in the Yom Kippur riots in Akko .
The report goes on to note severe discrimination in the allocation of housing land , saying that while the Arab population had grown seven times over since 1948 , about 50 % of the land previously owned by Arab has been confiscated .
Moreover , while 600 Jewish communities have been established since 1948 , no new Arab ones have been formed .
Arabs make up 20 % of Israel 's population , added the report , but the entirety of the Arab authorities ' jurisdiction , comes to only 2.5 % of the State .
As for the situation in east Jerusalem , the report states that Israel is adamant to keep a Jewish majority in the city by pushing its Arab residents out .
Furthermore , 67 % of the Palestinian families living in the area – including 77.2 % of children – live under the poverty line ; compared to 21 % of the Jewish families and 39.1 % of Jewish children .
An apartheid State ?
The West Bank settlements , continues the report , have created a situation of institutionalized discrimination in the area , which houses two separate populations living under two separate and contrasting judicial systems .
The discrimination noted in the allocation of funds and services in the area , said the report , " is in clear violation of the principle of equality and is very much reminiscent of the apartheid in South Africa . "
Settler violence against Arabs has been steadily increasing , and abusing Palestinian property has become the norm .
From the onset of 2008 , said the report , 430 people were killed in the West Bank by the Israeli security forces and over 1,150 were wounded .
Many of the casualties were bystanders no involved in the fighting .
According to the ACRI , Israel is making extensive use of administrative arrests measures against Palestinians :
By the end of September 2008 , Israel had 599 Palestinians in administrative custody .
Furthermore , the restrictions Israel has places on movement across the West Bank often hinders patients from getting to medical facilities and the closing of the crossing is preventing patients from getting treatment in Israel , even if they have the proper permits .
The reports counted 360 checkpoints and roadblocks across the West Bank , and said that an additional 85 random roadblocks are set up every week .
Bias against women , handicapped
The report next examined discrimination against women in Israel , noting that they are still widely discriminated against in the workplace .
Women still make less money than men in all corporate levels and in nearly every profession .
Unemployment rates for woman are significantly higher than those of men , and the women 's representation in the Israeli academia is 10 % lower that the average in any of the European Union nations .
Women , said the report , are still highly exposed to sexual harassment in the workplace and the law enforcement authorities seem powerless against the phenomenon .
Legislative Measures Ultra-Orthodox , immigrants discriminated by local authorities Zvi Lavi Troubling results from poll conducted by Knesset Research and Information Center pushes MK Ophir Pines to revise anti-discriminatory bill to include Haredim , immigrants on after women , Israeli - Arabs , disabled Ultra - Orthodox , immigrants discriminated by local authorities
As for communal discrimination , the report notes that discrimination between the Ashkenazi and Sephardic populations is virtually nonexistent , with the exception of the ultra-Orthodox school system ; however , the socioeconomic gap between the two has grown , which cements the historical notion of discrimination .
The report than tackled discrimination against the handicapped public .
Many services remain physically inaccessible to them , and the unemployment rate remains high , compared with the rest of the population .
The socioeconomic state of Israel 's handicapped had gravely deteriorated over the past few years , and is now considered the worst among Western nations .
The average income of a handicapped person in Israel , said the report , was 70 % lower that the average income in the market .
The report further cites that despite progressive labor legislation , employees ' rights are still violated , mostly due to lack of enforcement .
The State commitment to an equally - implemented public health system has also lapsed over the years , to the point of having two different caliber healthcare systems – one for the rich and one of the poor .
And what of immigrant assimilation within the Israeli society ?
The ACRI noted that the wages earned by immigrant from the former Soviet Union is 30 % lower than that of Israelis and that the language barrier prompts employer exploitation .
Ethiopian immigrants do not fare better :
Their wages are lower than both that of the Soviet Union counterparts and Israelis , and their overall employment rate is 10 % lower that that of the entire population .
Moreover , 65 % of Ethiopian immigrants have active case files with social services .
Ethiopian children have a harder time assimilating in the Israeli school system , added the repot .
The community has a 4 % dropout rate for students in grades seven to 12 ; and only 39.14 % graduate high school , as opposed to 63.8 % of Jewish students .
One step forward , two steps back
Israel , added the report , practices religious coercion , in the sense that it enforces the Orthodox marital decree and does not allow its citizens to marry or divorce in civil procedures .
The ACRI does note one proverbial ray of light in the form of gay rights , saying Israel has a relatively progressing gay rights doctrine compared to other Western counties , and that the Israeli law now allows gay couples the same legal statues as common - law couples .
When in comes to observing freedom of speech and expression , the report a reproaches the Shin Bet for menacing journalists and political activist whose public activities were deems " unacceptable . "
Moreover , the threat to cyber free speech has increased over the last two years , following various bills brought before the Knesset .
The Israeli Freedom of Information
Act is not implemented properly , and the authorities are still hindering access to information .
As for refugee rights , the report said the Israel has yet to formulate a clear refugee policy , and so it has one of the lowest recognitions rates in the Western world .
The ACRI quotes a Refugee Forum report stating that there were 12,500 refugees who sought asylum in Israel in 2008 , and that " the ways in which the State has chosen to deal with those seeking asylum varied from disregard and neglect through the odd humanitarian gesture , to taking severe measure of deterrence .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
For years , bad loans and their aftershocks have been sending homeowners into foreclosure .
Now it 's lost jobs that are putting troubled borrowers over the edge .
As the economy tanks , unemployment is the major factor driving a much larger proportion of foreclosures now than in the earlier stages of the mortgage meltdown .
In June , 45.5 % of all delinquencies reported by Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) were due to unemployment or the loss of income , according to the company .
That 's an increase from 36.3 % in 2006 .
" The two economic factors that most contribute to foreclosures are falling home prices and rising unemployment , " said Richard DeKaser , chief economist for National City Corp ( NCC , Fortune 500 ) .
" It 's hard to pay your mortgage when you do n't have a job . "
And that 's a situation that more and more people are finding themselves in .
Nearly one million Americans have lost their jobs in 2008 .
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in early October that 159,000 private sector jobs were lost in September , and on Friday , economists expect the BLS to report that 200,000 jobs were lost in October .
" The rise in job losses will increase and extend the delinquency trend , " said Doug Duncan , the chief economist for mortgage giant Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) .
Foreclosures spiked 71 % in September alone according to RealtyTrac .
A double whammy
Chris Berio of Long Island , N.Y. , worked in two industries that have been hit particularly hard by layoffs .
During the boom he worked in construction as a steam fitter , while also moonlighting as a mortgage broker .
Berio , 28 , was very confident when he bought a $ 350,000 fixer - upper in Deer Park in 2006 and took an 11 % mortgage to finance it .
In 2007 , he lost both of his jobs in quick succession .
" I went from making good money to nothing , " said the married father of two .
Berio was one of the lucky ones :
His mortgage was modified in September and its interest rate reduced to 5 % .
" The number of people we 're helping has tripled , " said Sal Pane , founder of the for - profit Amerimod Modification Agency , which helped Berio .
" And much of the increase in our business is due to job loss . "
Berio has found a new job in what should be a growth industry for years :
He 's become a foreclosure prevention counselor .
Of course the housing crisis is driving unemployment , which in turn has exacerbated the housing crisis - particularly in bubble states like Florida , Nevada and Arizona .
The unemployment rate in Florida was just 3.3 % in May 2006 , when the subprime crisis began to emerge - far below the national average of 4.7 % at the time .
Today Florida 's rate stands at 6.6 % , well above the current national average of 6.1 %
Jacksonville , Fla. , resident Paula Seabrooks lost her mortgage brokerage company this year in the wake of the Florida economy 's deterioration .
She has worked in the industry since 2001 , first as a contract underwriter for companies such as Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) .
She then opened her own business .
Her income dropped from nearly six figures in 2006 to less than $ 20,000 last year .
Seabrooks bought a $ 165,000 home in March 2006 and financed it with a hybrid adjustable - rate mortgage , which recently reset to 8.375 % interest .
" I thought I 'd be doing well , " she said , " I took the low rate , intending to refinance within two years . "
Seabrooks has a new job , but it pays only $ 38,000 a year .
That is not nearly enough to afford her $ 1,400 monthly mortgage bill , much less make up the five months of missed payments and fees that now total about $ 11,000 .
She 's seeking a loan modification with the help of counselors from the National Community Reinvestment Coalition .
Ironically , her new job involves handling applications from people seeking to refinance their own unaffordable mortgages into FHA - insured loans .
" Every other loan application I get , it seems , either the wife or the husband is unemployed , " Seabrooks said .
Dark days in the Golden State
Like Florida , California has seen its economy devastated by the housing meltdown .
Foreclosure prevention counselors now have far more clients seeking help because their jobs disappeared , rather than because their adjustable - rate mortgages are resetting .
Wes Lobo , a foreclosure counselor for the Community Housing and Credit Center in Chico , Calif. , said that his last three clients on Wednesday were victims of job or income loss .
Lobo says that his clients are mostly middle - class Americans who have lost their jobs and exhausted their savings and investments and can't pay their bills .
One of his clients was employed for years by a used car dealer and had worked his way up to a management position .
With auto sales way down , he got laid off and now can't pay his $ 240,000 mortgage or his $ 60,000 home equity loan .
With the auto industry on the ropes , his chances of finding work in his original line of work are diminishing .
The unemployment rate in the Chico metro area has climbed to 8.1 % , up two percentage points over the past 12 months .
If that keeps up , more Chico homeowners will be visiting both the unemployment office and their local foreclosure prevention counselors .
Interview with Author Neal Stephenson ' I 'm Choosing to Be Left Behind '
Some see science fiction author Neal Stephenson as a prophet .
But the writer of New York Times bestselling novel " Anathem " says that even though many of his books have been prescient , he has trouble even accessing Facebook .
SAN FRANCISCO -–
The Bush administration on Tuesday urged a federal judge to dismiss lawsuits against the nation 's telecommunications companies accused of complying with the government 's once - secret spy program adopted in the wake of the 2001 terror attacks on the United States .
" That was designed to protect from a terrorist attack , " Deputy Assistant Attorney General Carl Nichols told U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker .
Walker was hearing oral arguments on whether to uphold legislation barring lawsuits against the telecoms for violating Americans ' privacy if they forwarded electronic communications to the government .
" I do n't think it would be appropriate for this court to look back and second - guess the administration , " Nichols added .
In July , Congress passed legislation immunizing the telecoms from lawsuits brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , the American Civil Liberties Union and others accusing the companies of funneling electronic communications to the National Security Agency without warrants .
The government has neither directly confirmed nor denied the allegations , but Bush in late 2005 acknowledged a limited warrantless spy program of eavesdropping on Americans ' international phone calls and e-mails .
Still , Walker was concerned that the immunity law , which also authorized continuing the admitted eavesdropping , gives the attorney general too much power .
" It gives the attorney general * carte blanche * to immunize anyone who in his judgment or view should be immunized from possible liability , " Walker said from the bench .
President - elect Barack Obama was among the majority in the Senate voting for the immunity provision in July , as part of a broader domestic spying bill .
At the close of a two - hour hearing here , Walker did not say when he would rule .
Richard Wiebe , an EFF attorney , said the immunity provision allowed for a Justice Department " camouflage " or a " smokescreen , " adding that it 's inherently unconstitutional to immunize unconstitutional behavior .
He said the companies should face lawsuits for what he termed " mass unwarranted surveillance . "
" Congress recognized these cases created a risk to national security , " Nichols countered .
" Congress has spoken . "
At several points during the nearly two - hour hearing , Walker appeared to agree with the government .
He noted that Congress often strips judges of their power to hear cases , like in 2005 when Congress immunized gun manufacturers from liability .
He told Wiebe his complaint should be made with Congress .
" I'm the wrong person to be making that argument to , " Walker said .
Walker also wondered aloud whether he should decide the case before the Obama administration takes office in January .
" It would be very , very unlikely for any future Department of Justice to decline to defend the constitutionality of the statute , " replied Nichols , who conceded the law was unprecedented .
Congress passed the immunity measure after Walker dismissed the government 's claim that the lawsuits against AT&T , Sprint and others filed in 2006 should be dismissed because they threatened to expose state secrets .
Walker 's decision was on appeal to the San Francisco - based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals when lawmakers passed the immunity measure .
The appeals court , noting the legislation , dismissed the appeal as moot .
Assuming for the sake of argument the carriers and the government engaged in illegal eavesdropping , Walker wondered aloud what would be wrong with the litigation being solely directed at the government .
" Let 's assume that 's exactly what happened .
Then why should n't the government just be on the hook for any harm or damage ? "
Walker asked .
Cindy Cohn , the EFF 's legal director , replied that the 9th Circuit could still throw out the cases against the government under the State Secrets Privilege .
In any event , she said , the telecoms should be held responsible .
" Carriers have an independent duty to protect their customers . "

A new study presages a real aim of genetics : to look at whole populations to in order determine the significance of individual genetic variants for individual health .
A research team says they found six novel genetic variants that are associated with lipid levels , a common indicator of heart or artery disease .
The power of ' genetic microscopes ' has increased because the methods are in place to study many thousands of DNA samples .
This study , involving over 20,000 samples and researchers from a dozen European countries , is the first to find such lipid–gene links by looking at the general population , rather than patients .
A search for a lipid–gene link through such large numbers of unselected people has not been published before .
The findings increase hopes for improved predictive diagnosis , which could lead to improved public health measures and early prescription of effective treatments .
" Since 2007 , human genetics has achieved results that would have been unimaginable only five years ago , " explains Professor Leena Peltonen , Head of Human Genetics at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and senior author on the study , " but this is merely the dawn of new understanding .
New , more powerful studies , such as our work on lipid levels , will illuminate the areas and the variants of our genome that play an important part in human disease .
" Human geneticists often carry out case - control studies : researchers examine the genetics of people with a given disease ( the ' cases ' ) and compare them to the genetics of apparently unaffected people ( the ' controls ' ) .
Such studies have been hugely successful in trailblazing discovery of genetic variants associated with common disease .
However , because the people participating are not drawn at random , researchers are cautious about extrapolating their findings .
If we wish to understand the real impact of the identified gene for a disease risk at the population level for disease risk we need to study population cohorts .
A population - based study , in which no selection is made , should address most of the concerns over case - control studies .
However , in these studies , scientists are searching for signs of a genetic effect in a much wider group , most of whom will not have any susceptibility to a particular disease .
"
It was important that we should be able to find previously known genetic associations with lipid levels : of the 22 regions we describe , 16 have been described previously , " explains Cornelia van Duijn , from Erasmus University in Rotterdam , the Netherlands .
" This impressive result shows that not only can we find the known genetic associations , but we can also find novel associations in this large - scale collaboration of very diverse population - based cohort studies spanning populations from Lapland to the Dalmatian Islands .
"
We will be able to move forward much more quickly if we can look at other diseases in studies such as ours , pooling resources across European populations .
"
The team were also able to show differences between the sexes : lipid values are known to differ for males and females , as does the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases .
The team found significantly different sex -specific effects for some genome regions : the two strongest signals were in near HMGCR and NCAN .
HMGCR produces an important enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis and is the drug target for statins , commonly used for treating high values of ' bad cholesterol ' , LDL .
The region around NCAN gene has previously been associated with both LDL and triglyceride levels , associated with coronary heart disease .
The results are part of an emerging portrait of genes determining lipid levels : a major aim is to predict more efficiently those at risk of coronary heart disease .
The profiles developed using the new genetic variants are better at identifying those at risk of increased lipid levels , but do not yet improve the prediction of artery or heart disease .
Screening for a person with high lipid levels and early treatment with statins is one of the major strategies in the prevention of cardiovascular risk in clinical practice while a healthy diet , weight control and physical activity is the major population level prevention strategy .
" We can be confident that the increased understanding of the control of lipid levels that will come from these genetic discoveries , will , in time , lead to improved ways of treating and preventing heart disease and stroke " explains Mark McCarthy , Robert Turner Professor of Diabetes at the University of Oxford .
" In addition , as we become better at identifying those individuals who are at most at risk of these diseases , we should be able to target our therapeutic and preventative efforts more efficiently , perhaps focusing on changing lifestyles in those most likely to benefit " .
The study has been funded by an EU project , ENGAGE ( www.euengage.org ) and is a collaborative effect of a large group of researchers that was brought together by a research grant from the European Union ( Framework 7 ) and included thousands of participants of the various studies in the European Union and Australia .

After a further exchange , in which Cohn - Bendit compared Klaus unfavourably with his predecessor , President Havel , he gave way to an Irish MEP , Brian Crowley , who began by saying " all his life my father fought against the British domination [ of Ireland ] …
That is why I dare to say that the Irish wish for the Lisbon Treaty .
It was an insult , Mr President , to me and the Irish people what you said during your state visit to Ireland . "
Klaus repeated that he had not experienced anything like this for19 years and that it seemed we were no longer living in a democracy , but that it was " post - democracy which rules the EU " .
Take the Internet Addiction Test
Think you ’re spending too much time surfing the Net ?
Chinese doctors have come up with an official test to see whether you have a real problem .
All right , ready ?
Take a deep breath … here we go .
1 ) How many hours do you spend online a day ?
If the answer is less than six , you ’re clear .
No addiction whatsoever .
Go home .
More than six ?
Keep going .
2 ) Which of the following symptoms do you experience ?
Difficulty sleeping
Difficulty concentrating
A constant yearning to get online
Irritability
Mental distress
Physical distress
Have at least one ?
You , my friend , are an addict — at least , by the now - official Chinese definition .
( If you have four or more , then , we assume you are the online equivalent of a raging crackwhore .
Congrats . )
China has actually had a clinic for Internet addiction for about three years now and also runs “ boot camps ” for those who feel hooked on the digital drug .
The nation reports about 10 percent of its population as being “ addicts . ”
Ten percent ?
That number seems a bit low , given the generalized nature of these standards .
Of course , I ’ve been online for about eight hours now , did n’t sleep enough last night , and am feeling rather irritable at the moment — so I might just be having too much difficulty concentrating to be able to fully comprehend .
Hi ,
I 'm sorry to tell you that for some legal reasons ( I live in France ) , I have to stop working on Freenet .
I 've learned a lot with you guys and I 'm sad to have to say goodbye , but that 's how it is when you live in a so - called democracy ...
I 'm sure pOs will be able to finish the WoT plugin and make something usable with it .
Dieppe is OK to continue the french translation .
Nextgens has already removed my mirror from the DNS .
I 'm still looking for a server to host the french forum ( punbb ) .
It has a very low traffic ( about 10 messages per week ) .
Please revoke all my accesses to emu ( shell , svn , email ) , remove my name from the People page and remove my node from the freenode list .
Keep up the good work guys !

( The symbol " ( ∃! φ ) " reads " there exists a unique φ such that ... " )
14.5 DO : Let dim ( V ) = k and dim ( W ) = m .
Let e be a basis of V and f a basis of W. Let Hom ( V , W ) denote the set of V → W linear maps .
( a) Prove that the function φ ↦ [ &phi ] e , f defines a bijection between Hom ( V , W ) and Fm × k .
( b) Prove that Hom( V , W ) is a vector space of dimension mk .
14.6 DO ( change of basis : change of coordinates ) : Let e =(e 1 , ... , e k ) and e' =(e 1 ' , ... , e k ') be two bases of V ( the " old " basis and the " new " basis ) .
We define the basis change transformation σ : V → V by setting σ (e i ) = e i '.
Let S = [ σ ] e ( the " basis change matrix " ) .
( a) Prove that S is invertible .
( b ) Prove : ( ∀ v ∈ V ) ( [ v ] e' = S - 1 [ v ] e ) .
14.7 DO ( change of bases : change of matrix ) : Let φ : V → W. Let e , e ' be two bases of V and f , f ' be two bases of W .
Let S be the basis change matrix corresponding to the basis change e ↦ e ' in V and let T be the basis change matrix corresponding to the basis change f ↦ f ' in W. Let A be the matrix of φ in the " old bases " ( i.e. , A = [ φ ] e , f ) and A ' the matrix of φ in the " new bases " ( i.e. , A = [ φ ] e' , f ' ) .
Prove : A ' = T - 1AS .
Hint. Use Exx . 14.2 and 14.6 .
Start by writing φ ( v ) = w .
Translating this to matrix form you get matrix equations of the form Ax = y ( in the old bases ) and A'x ' = y' ( in the new bases ) ( explain the meaning of x , x ' , y , y ' ) .
Now x ' = S - 1 x and y' = T - 1y ( by Ex. 14.6 ) .
Therefore A'S - 1x = T - 1y , so TA'S - 1x = y = Ax. Now use Ex. 14.2 .

( b ) Prove : in a field , αβ = 0 ⇔ α = 0 or β = 0 .
14.12 DO : Review the definition of a vector space V. Define a basis as a linearly independent list of vectors that spans V. Prove : a list L of vectors is a basis if and only if it is a maximal linearly independent set if and only if every vector is a unique linear combination of the vectors in L . ( Prove from the definition , do not use theorems such as the first miracle . )
14.13 DO : Prove : if φ : V → W is a linear map then φ ( 0 V ) = 0 W .
14.14 DO : Prove : if f : V → W is an isomorphism , then f- 1 : W → V is an isomorphism ,

Prove : ( a ) Ker ( φ ) is a subspace of V ; ( b ) Im ( φ ) is a subspace of W ; ( c ) * ( rank plus nullity theorem ) dim Ker ( φ ) + dim Im ( φ ) = dim ( V ) .
Note : dim Im ( φ ) is called the rank of φ and dim Ker ( φ ) the nullity of φ .
This explains the name of ( c ) .

It 's pretty amazing what Peter Callesen is able to create from a simple sheet of white paper that many of us use everyday .
He has an uncanny skill to transform one of the most common office staples into intricate little mini-dramas .
“ I find the A4 sheet of paper interesting to work with , because it is probably the most common and consumed media and format for carrying information today , and in that sense it is something very loaded .
My paper works have been based around an exploration of the relationship between two and three dimensionality .
I find this materialization of a flat piece of paper into a 3D form almost a magic process – or maybe one could call it obvious magic , because the process is obvious and the figures still stick to their origin , without the possibility of escaping .
In that sense there is also an aspect of something tragic in most of the cuts . ”

Author , Independent Nation : How Centrists Can Change American Politics
The McCain campaign 's latest round of attacks on Senator Obama 's association with Weather Underground founder Bill Ayers represents an unwelcome return to a constant distraction in American politics over the last 40 years – reigniting the culture debates of the 1960s .
The baby - boom generation 's coming of age was tumultuous and at times violent .
The counterculture chaos and at times outright anti-Americanism of the far left led directly to the election of Richard Nixon in 1968 and the ascendance of the conservative movement that has won seven out of ten presidential elections over the past 40 years .
It 's no surprise then when things get desperate the Republican Party tries to re-litigate the 1960s , sticking a knife in the cultural divide to reopen the wounds and air old grievances .
There was a time when this was appropriate :
At the height of the cold war the conflicts between the far left and the right seemed at times central to determining our future as a free and independent nation .
In the Presidential election of 2004 , it was perhaps inevitable that the competing baby - boomers George W. Bush and John Kerry would escalate that debate seeing as how they were on opposite sides of that generational divide ,
But the nomination of Barack Obama promised a break with the politics of the past .
Born in 1961 , he is not a product of those fights – and that is in part why he 's been able to campaign as a candidate of change : not just racial , but generational .
Senator McCain , for his part , is part of a pre-baby boom generation that came of age in the 1950s , not the 1960s .
These two men represent different philosophies of governing , but they have in the main been united by a desire to elevate our political discourse and take it in a more honorable direction outside of the gutter fights which have divided us for too long .
With our nation at war on two fronts , facing unprecedented global fiscal crisis , diverting attention to a despicable 1960s domestic terrorist who Obama has not seen or spoken to since being elected to congress , deserves to be seen for what it is – an attempt to distract us by reigniting cultural wars which long ago lost their ability to illuminate .
They have become all heat and no light , and we need to move past them if we are to move forward as a nation .
what are the Dangerous Drugs again ?
The party 's over .
Consumers are way in over their head in debt and the financial markets are overstretched for having stretched the lending rules .
When the cards begin to fall , confidence games are exposed .
Multi-million dollar Ponzi Scheme prosecutions are up because wherever there is greed , there 's the potential for fraud .
The history of the one of the world 's largest ponzi schemes of 7 years prior , the Reed Slatkin Investment Club , included a lax SEC and hundreds of greedy investors with an abundance of money to invest .
Many of the investors who benefitted from the scam included members of the Church of Scientology and the Church of Scientology itself .
In then the end , those funds received in excess of contribution to the ' club ' were deemed avoidable and recoverable as fraudulent transfers .
This resulted in millions and millions of dollars in recoverable judgements against or settlement agreements with the Scientology entities and it's involved members and staff .
It 's not surprising to see the cult of greed , as Time Magazine called Scientology , involved in the receipt fraudulent transfers .
What is surprising is how Scientology managed to keep this information from hittin g the front pages of the media in 2006 .
Recent news is rife with Ponzi cases and convictions , where some investors made out like bandits while the rest lost every cent they invested .
Among them is the the Tom Petters 3 billion dollar investment scam ; the SEC vs .
Hu case where the SEC just charged former Democratic fundraiser Norman Hsu with " operating a $ 60 - million Ponzi scheme in a civil lawsuit filed Monday in Los Angeles . " .
In another , a Fargo , ND insurance agent has been charged with 78 felony counts , for stealing over $ 5 million in client funds , engaging in fraudulent practices and selling unregistered securities .
These are just a few of the multiple ponzi schemes that have emerged as we grapple with a collapsing economy build with to much greed and encompassed with weak regulations that invite fraud and deception .
7 years ago Business Week asked " The Reed Slatkin Case : Did the SEC Drop the Ball ? " and here we are again today , asking the same question about a what appears to be a ponzi scheme of worldwide proportions .
When will America learn to protect itself and it's comsumers from such destructive scams ?
Sadly , greed seems to get in the way of logic time after time and history repeqts itself .
There is a technology of sorts to understanding the mechanics of how one becomes a victim of fraud and how to avoid it ( for starters try Fraud Tech expert and author Dennis Marlock 's site ) ;
Detecting deceptive trade practices is not as complicated as one would think .
This applies to institutions as well as to individuals .
Perhaps there are still more lessons to be learned from how the Reed Slatkin ponzi scheme case is being resolved in US Bankrupcy Court by one of the most skilled forensic accountants and persistent court appointed bankrupcy trustees in the US today , R. Todd Neilson .
On April 30th,2000 many hundreds of dismayed investors with a combined total of nearly $ 600,000,000 of invested funds were gathered together and informed that their " money manager " , Earthlink co-founder and Scientology minister Reed Slatkin , was filing for bankrupcy .
You would have thought that investors would have checked up on whether Slatkin even held a broker or advisor license but apparently none had or cared until it was too late .
The shock had not yet set in when on May 11 , 2001 the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service agencies raided Slatkin 's home office in Santa Barbara , CA to locate assets and documentation that would become the subject of multiple subpoenas of people and organizations including the noninvesting Church of Scientology .
Slatkin was charged with , among other things , running a ponzi scheme : collecting monies from new investors to pay the " earnings " and prinicple owed to earlier investors .
You see , most of the investors who gained high profits from the ponzi scheme just happened to be * scientologists or employees of the church of Scientology .
So , what has Scientology itself have to do with this and the recent " bail out " of financial institutions ?
Well many have likened the " bail out " to a pouring of money into an already out of control ponzi scheme and the Slatkin ponzi scheme was evidence of a church and it's members consistently benefitting financially at the expense of those who lost all they 'd invested .
Keep in mind that Scientology is the only religious organization in the United States whose members are allowed by the IRS to deduct as charitable contributions for all religious instruction fees and material costs , in violation of the first amendment .
Despite that favored position , the ' chickens had finally come home to roost ' on this Slatkin matter as bankrupcy trustee R. Todd Neilson persisted over the last 7 years in making sure the church , it 's involved members along with a minority of nonscientologists who gained in this ponzi scheme are held responsible for repaying avoidable and recoverable fraudulent transfers of funds received directly or indirectly from Slatkin pursuant to US and CA state civil codes .
This was not an easy task by any means .
Trustee Neilson had to deal with many of the ponzi scheme ' winners ' who did not want to repay the favorited illegal gains received , despite the threat of adversarial rulings that would have raised the rate of interest due and had potential to refer cases for criminal charges .
The court is still in hearings related to recovery of funds that will be split according to preset percentages amongst those who lost their investments or benefit because of the ponzi scheme .
Since the inception of this case and those related to it , much money has been recovered and there are multi-million dollar judgements on record and being pursued .
But more than money was at stake here .
To my knowledge , at least 2 relatively young defendent / scientologists died within weeks of each other while enduring the lengthy court process : businessman Ivan ( Ike ) KEZSBOM and attorney Michael KANANACK .
Another scientologist , Arthur D Gordin aka Arlo Gordin , DC turned in his license and fled the country with his gains - over $ 4 million worth - refusing to pay back anything at all to the bankrupcy estate .
And yet another , Anthony Hitchman and wife , are in the process of being busted for using other people to funnel undeclared income to and for himself .
Many of the investors were audited by the IRS because of discrepancies found or in bankrupcy cases filed by the investors themselves .
Scientologist and former Grateful Dead manager Ron Rakow is currently in prison on tax fraud charges which resulted indirectly from the Slatkin case .
Anthony Hitchman may well wind up in prison because the trustee has witnesses and evidence that he was funneling unreported income via friends and relatives while under bankrupcy to avoid paying on his Slatkin case judgements .
All of these these people are Scientologists , Hitchman being one of the most influential and earliest devotees of founder L Ron Hubbard 's cult .
On September 25 , 2006 , the Church of Scientology entities , including it 's front groups Narconon , Criminon , Celebrity Center , CCHR as shown below , agreed to pay back $ 3,500,000 after the church refused to allow the trustee access to theit 'd financial records to effect a better settlement .
The church was not cooperating in supplying financial records and documents and Trustee Neilson knew a hyperlitigious company when he saw one and he negotiated what he could use to settle the case rather than tying the case up in court .
Neilson has faired alot better than the many who have challanged this controversial organization in a court setting .
The former FBI forensic accountant is ever pesistent and discontented investors can be assured that Neilson will do all he can to recover the fraudulent transfers .
Take a look at the links provided below for the individual PDF files and further information and documentation .
Lermanet.com 's Index of Fraud Slatkin - related files include names of Scientologists such as Arthur Hubbard ( son of Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard ) former Grateful Dead manager and Jerry Garcia business partner Rakow , Anthony " Tony " Hitchman , former chiropractor to the stars , Arthur D " Arlo " Gordin ( who fled the country rather than pay back his illicit gains ) , Rakows girlfriend , Denise Del Bianco , CoS = Church of Scientology , Joseph Mancuso and Christopher Mancuso of World Wide Telecommunications Corporation and Clear World Communications Corp , author James Monroe Justice who is still fighting having to repay his gains , along with attorneys John Coale & wife Greta Van Sustern ( who quietly repaid their illegally gotten gains despite claiming they would fight it ) , Michael & Anne Kananack , Rosser Cole et al , Joel Kreiner and wife Stina Hans , and Scientology attorney Helena K Kobrin , George W Murgatroyd III and spouse , James Q Fisher & spouse , who settled or were judged guilty and ordered to repay .
These scientologists are among the many other scientologists considered themselves among the most ethical people on the earth because Scientology taught them they are entitled to anything they can get away with , as long as they do n't get caught and it 's Fair Game to anyone who opposes them .
The real victims of Slatkin 's fraud where those who believed in his ministerial collar , his use of Scientology ' communication routines ' and skill as a trained " counselor " ( which really is about using mild but consistent amounts of hypnosis to gain cooperation of the counselee ) and his association with Earthlink and the power that association implied .
he was a con man and some of the players in his ponzi scheme were con men as well .
Scientologist Ron Rakow , in particular , had a history of ripping people off , including Jerry Garcia , and yet Garcia never wiped his hands of him .
It take a good deceptor to make something like that happen , and happen over and over again .
Scientology gave Slatkin the means and methods of conning others and the connections to get away with it .
In his ear was Ron Rakow , encouraging him to go for more and bringing more victims into the fold .
Both are in prison .
Will they be better people when they get out ?
That remains to be seen .
In the meantime , consumers need to get a grip on greed and stop allowing themselves to be conned by weakly regulated con men and institutions .
Learn how fraud & deception works and consider what you have learned as you watch this worldwide recession unfold , wherever the cards may fall .

Falling fuel prices could help the U.S. airline industry turn a profit in 2009 , but most carriers are making cuts in passenger capacity to deal with a slowdown in business and leisure travel .
Delta Air Lines Inc. said it would shed 8 % to 10 % of available domestic seats next year and cut international flights by 3 % to 5 % .
Delta is already reducing U.S. capacity by 12 % this year as it and other airlines trim unprofitable routes .
On the international front , Delta 's cutback is a reversal from its average annual capacity growth ...

UNITED NATIONS ( Reuters ) - The U.N. Security Council called early on Sunday for an immediate halt to all violence in Gaza after a day of Israeli air strikes in response to rocket and mortar fire by Gaza militants against Israel .
“ The members of the Security Council expressed serious concern at the escalation of the situation in Gaza and called for an immediate halt to all violence , ” said a statement read to reporters by Croatian Ambassador Neven Jurica , president of the council .
“ The members called on the parties to stop immediately all military activities . ”
Palestinian medical officials said on Sunday that 271 Palestinians had been killed in 24 hours of Israeli attacks in the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip .
Since the operation began , one Israeli had been killed by Palestinian rocket fire .
Diplomats said the Security Council meeting had been convened at the request of Libya , the only Arab country on the council .
The statement , agreed upon after four hours of closed - door council discussions , called on all parties to address “ the serious humanitarian and economic needs in Gaza . ”
It urged them to take necessary measures , including the opening of border crossings , to ensure Gaza ’s people were supplied with food , fuel and medical treatment .
Council members “ stressed the need for the restoration of calm in full ” to open the way for a Palestinian - Israeli political solution .
Satellite photos reveal the extent of Amazonian deforestation Hackers have helped logging firms in Brazil evade limits on tree felling , says a Greenpeace report .
The hi-tech criminals penetrated a computer system designed to monitor logging in the Brazilian state of Para .
Once inside the system , hackers issued fake permits so loggers could cut down far more timber than environmental officials were prepared to allow .
Greenpeace estimates that 1.7 m cubic metres of illegal timber may have been removed with the aid of the hackers .
Massive attack Drawing on information released by Brazilian federal prosecutor Daniel Avelino , Greenpeace believes hackers were employed by 107 logging and charcoal companies .
" Almost half of the companies involved in this scam have other law suits pending for environmental crimes or the use of slave labour , " said Mr Avelino in a statement issued by Greenpeace .
Mr Avelino is suing the companies behind the mass hack attack for two billion reals ( £ 564 m ) - the estimated value of the timber illegally sold .
The Brazilian investigation of the hackers began in April 2007 and more than 30 ring leaders were arrested during the summer of that year .
The ongoing investigation means that now 202 people face charges for their involvement in the subversion of the logging system .
The hack was made possible by a decision in 2006 to do away with paper forms to help monitor whether logging and charcoal firms were keeping to the quotas they were set .
Instead , the Amazon state of Para turned to a fully - computerised system that issued travel permits for the timber logging firms were removing .
The intent was that travel permits would stop being issued once logging companies had reached their annual quota .
With the help of the hackers , Brazilian logging firms were able to issue fake permits allowing them to bust through these caps .
" We 've pointed out before that this method of controlling the transport of timber was subject to fraud , " said Andre Muggiati , Greenpeace campaigner in Manaus .
" And this is only the tip of the iceberg , because the same computer system is also used in two other Brazilian states . "

For the past few days , university students in the Southern Chinese resort town of Hainan have been quarantined on the grounds of the Hainan University campus with little food or water .
Apparently there 's been an outbreak of cholera , and the local officials dealt with it Resident Evil style : Lock everybody in , give them no information , and see if they survive .
But one woman student has been blogging about the ongoing ordeal , posting pictures and giving status updates several times a day .
Luckily , the bloggers at EastSouthWestNorth have translated her blog for people who do n't read Chinese .
The incident started quietly enough , with the student blogging about her friend Jiajia feeling sick and throwing up .
But within hours , things started to get weird :
In class today , Yuanyuan said that Jiajia felt sick and has gone to the hospital .
At noon , Jiajia came back .
She was feeling good enough and she told us that the hospital is filled with Hainan University students with diarrhea .
There were many people there waiting to see the doctors .
The doctors were so busy that they had to arrange for queues .
Everybody laughed but then we realized that this is serious .
I began to wonder whether I have cholera too .
I went on the Internet and looked up all sorts of materials about cholera .
Then I fell asleep .
By around 5 pm , I was awaken by several phone calls to say that I had to go down to the school office and get some medicine .
Then a series of events made me dizzy : the school was put under a quarantine ; the three entrances were manned by police .
Two persons from the School of Tourism were confirmed to have cholera .
Many others people were placed under isolation .
Jiajia was taken away !

What 's interesting about this is how much this student and her friends are communicating about this online , especially using the popular Chinese social network QQ .
She is constantly checking her friends ' status on QQ , and writing down what they say .
One of her friend 's QQ signatures reads " TERRIFYING . "
Another says , " Socialism is good .
Socialism cannot feed us . "
It 's hard not to see this event in the context of growing fears about a SARS - like pandemic breaking out in China and spreading worldwide .
In fact , the student keeps talking about how she 's terrified that this is going to be like SARS , even though she knows cholera can be treated with a three - day course of medicine .
Apparently the authorities were treating this like a beta test for a more dangerous epidemic .
As things developed Monday , the student wrote more :
Cholera has become a part of our my life , along with taking medicine and eating instant noodles .
The air smelled like disinfectant and instant noodles . . .
I finally decided to go out .
I left at 430 pm in the hope of being able to get into one of the cafeteria .
Today , another cafeteria opened up .
There are now two small cafeterias plus the Muslim restaurant to keep the university going .
I read in the Intenet news that the university has been placed under quarantine .
It is said that the teachers and students at Hainan University are living normally and remaining mentally stable .
But nobody in the entire university campus has told me what the situation is .
There are only people coming and going , spraying disinfectant and washing the walls .

Despite the visibility online of people writing about the frightening quarantine , few Western media sources have picked up the story .
There was an item in the China Post yesterday , which made it sound as if the event was contained and over .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250

But yesterday , our student blogger wrote :
I did not think about going down to the cafeteria at all .
Perhaps I was scared off by what I saw when I walked past the cafeterias after class .
There were crowds out the entrance and the university workers were yelling : " Do not enter .
Please do not push .
It is already full inside .
Even if you get in , you wo n't get any food . "
There were many students dressed in camouflage uniforms trying to maintain order .
They chased waves and waves of students back out .
Even the temporary stands outside the cafeteria for instant noodles were mobbed .
There was a notice which said that the cafeteria which re-opened yesterday is closed today because of water stoppage .
The workers watched the people from the second floor .
As I walked past this cafeteria , I heard a male student yell from the second floor : " I want to eat food , I want to drink water . "
When I got back to the dormitory , there were more notices downstairs .
Two notices were new : water was stopped and the Internet will be down tomorrow .
Everybody howled in collective agony again .
I do n't think cholera is scary .
But the lack of supply of the various essential things in daily life is the true terror .

She 's right .
And in fact her ongoing coverage of this quarantine reads like a near - future science fiction story because what she 's going through is just a small - scale version of what many of us would deal with if a pandemic did break out .
In such circumstances it 's possible that if a disease does n't kill you , the quarantine conditions will .

Than Shwe : " Foolish with power " , says Nay Phone Latt A Burmese blogger has been sentenced to 20 years in jail for posting a cartoon of the military leader Than Shwe .
Nay Phone Latt , 28 , was sentenced by a court in Rangoon 's Insein prison , said his mother , Aye Than .
Nay Phone Latt 's colleague Thin July Kyaw was sentenced to two years imprisonment , Aye Than reported .
Another dissident , Saw Wai , was sentenced to two years in jail for publishing a poem mocking Than Shwe in the weekly Love Journal .
The first words of each line of the Burmese language poem spelled out the message " Senior General Than Shwe is foolish with power " .
Nay Phone Latt was arrested in January ; the sentence delivered on Monday included 15 years for offences under the Electronics Act , two years for " creating public alarm " and three and a half years for offences under the Video Act , his mother said .
One of his offences was apparently the possession of a banned video .
His blogs during the September 2007 uprising provided invaluable information about events within the locked - down country .
Aye
Than said she was not allowed to attend the trial and Nay Phone Latt was not represented by his defence lawyer , Aung Thein , who began serving a four - month prison sentence for contempt of court last Friday .
" My son is a computer expert and he has not violated any criminal law .
It is very unfair that he was given 15 years ' imprisonment under the Electronics Law for a crime he did not commit , " said Aye Than .
A spokesman for the opposition National League for Democracy party , Nyan Win , described Nay Phone Latt , a former party member , as " a young and intelligent blogger and computer expert . "
Spreading arrests
" The government is expediting the trials of political prisoners and many have been given lengthy prison sentences , " said Nyan Win.
Nyan Win said party youth member Tun Tun Naing , who was arrested last year , was given 19 years in prison on Friday .
Tun Tun Naing and Khin Maung Aye , of the privately - owned weekly News Watch , were arrested on 5 November and are being detained in Insein prison .
The media rights organisations Reporters Without Borders and Burma Media Association have demanded their immediate release , adding this brings to 10 the number of journalists arrested so far this year .
Irrawaddy magazine , an exile Burmese news organisation , said the current crackdown is also aimed at silencing legal attempts to ensure fair trials for dissidents now appearing before judges in closed court sessions .
Two weeks ago , three defence lawyers , Nyi Nyi Htwe , Aung Thein and Khin Maung Shein were imprisoned for between four and six months for contempt of court after complaining of unfair treatment .
Four other defence lawyers , Kyaw Hoe , Maung Maung Latt , Myint Thaung and Khin Htay Kyew have been barred from representing their clients , who include members of the 88 Generation Students group .
The US State Department has criticised the imprisonment of the four defence lawyers and urged the Burmese regime to drop all charges and release them .
President Bush announced that he will nominate one of his former senior Asia advisers as special representative for Burma .
' No legitimacy '
The European Union said on Monday that multiparty elections scheduled for 2010 in Burma will be seen as illegitimate unless the ruling military junta frees all political prisoners - particularly Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi .
The 27 EU foreign ministers deplored the lack of progress in Burma since the violent repression of peaceful protests .
Suu Kyi , a Nobel Peace Prize laureate , has been under house arrest for more than 12 of the past 19 years .
The junta has announced general elections in 2010 as part of its " roadmap to democracy " .
The junta came to power in 1988 after crushing a nationwide pro-democracy uprising , killing as many as 3,000 people .
It organised multiparty elections in 1990 but refused to honour the results after Suu Kyi's party won overwhelmingly .

One of xdebugs lesser known features is its function traces .
In case you have n’t heard of it before , it “ allows you to log all function calls , including parameters and return values to a file ” , to quote the manual .
After playing around with it for a while , I realised that this information could be parsed and used to determine parameter types and return types of functions .
So , as a proof on concept , I wrote a script to parse the function traces from xdebug and use this to process a php source - file , and inject docblock comments , with @param and @return tags .
I had to combine the dynamic analysis ( function traces ) with some static analysis , to be able to collate different sub - types into their supertype , which made the whole deal a bit more complicated than first anticipated .
There are still some room for improvement , but last Thursday at the local php meetup , I demo ’ed the project and it ’s now available through github .
The usage is split into two steps .
First you run the code , using xdebug instrumentation to generate a trace .
I ’ve created a wrapper script to make this simpler .
Just invoke the php script with trace.sh foo. php , rather than php foo. php .
This will run the script as normal , while generating a trace in the file dumpfile.xt .
The intention is to use the tool together with an existing test - case .
If you do n’t use unit tests , you can just put a simple integration test together ;
The important thing is that the script should get around in all corners of the code , to generate a good basis for the analysis .
The next step is to analyse this data and use it to generate the docblock comments .
This is done with the tool weave .
php .
You ’d likely want to call weave .
php multiple times ( For each file in your project , that you want to generate documentation for ) .
Here ’s an example , to show the process :
We ’ll start with a very simple file , without any docblock comments :
<? php class Foo { function stuff ( $x ) { return 42 ; } } class Bar {} $ f = new Foo ( ) ; $ f -> stuff ( new Bar ( ) ) ;
The first step is to run the file , using trace.sh :
$ / path/to/php-tracer/weaver/trace.sh foo.php
Running script with instrumentation : foo.php TRACE COMPLETE
Next , we ’ll weave the documentation back into the file :
$ / path/to/php-tracer/weaver/weave.php foo.php foo.php
And that ’s it ..
Our file now looks like this :
<? php class Foo {
/** * @param Bar * @return integer */ function stuff ( $x ) { return 42 ; } } class Bar {} $ f = new Foo ( ) ; $ f -> stuff ( new Bar ( ) ) ;
The implementation is memory - efficient , rather than cpu-efficient , which means that it ’ll work with large code bases , but it will take some time to process .
In a matter of hours the “ Gina Carano Actually Has A Life Outside The Ring ” blogger - gasm has gone into full effect .

Very Serious Tom Friedman :
If I had my druthers right now we would convene a special session of Congress , amend the Constitution and move up the inauguration from Jan. 20 to Thanksgiving Day .
Yes , Mr. Friedman .
Good idea !
Let 's give the next president , you know , four days to hastily assemble his entire cabinet and staff in time to govern the world through the worst financial crisis since whenever ... starting Thursday .
Smart -- then again , it would certainly help the establishment press to build their " failed Obama presidency " narrative .
Or how about this :
Why do n't the very serious commentariat demand that our current president do his damn job for a change rather than running out the clock .
Naturally , this wo n't happen because the current narrative is all about Clinton drama .
And notice the end of the article -- Friedman closes with a quote about a potential Obama mistake .
Very serious !
By the way , notice that Friedman is also channeling our favorite financial diva Suze Orman .
Nag people about their spending !
I go into restaurants these days , look around at the tables often still crowded with young people , and I have this urge to go from table to table and say : “ You do n’t know me , but I have to tell you that you should n’t be here .
You should be saving your money .
You should be home eating tuna fish ... "
Eight month emergency fund , young people !
Eat tuna !
No mention whatsoever that the Iraq invasion and occupation , which Friedman vocally supported and endorsed , is helping to bankrupt America .
We 're still spending $ 10 billion a month over there , but eat tuna sandwiches , you lazy stupid young people !
Friedman , Drudge , Halperin and the like are writers who everyone in Washington reads .
Now that 's a good reason to panic .

The ruins of an entire city have been discovered in northern Peru , researchers say .
Archaeologists say the find could provide the missing link between the ancient cultures of the Wari people and the earlier Moche civilisation .
The site , near the Pacific coastal city of Chiclayo , probably dates to the Wari culture which ruled the Andes of modern Peru between the 7th and 12th Century .
The once buried city showed evidence of human sacrifice .
The remains of the victims were thrown over the nearby cliff , Cesar Soriano , the chief archaeologist on the project , told the Andina news agency .
" It provides the missing link because it explains how the Wari people allowed for the continuation of culture after the Moche [ died out about 600 AD ] , " Cesar Soriano was quoted by Reuters as saying .
Mr Soriano said the find provides the first evidence of Wari culture , which was based in the south of the country , at the northern site .
A New Muslim ( Virtual ) World Muslims will now have a version of Second Life .
DUBAI , United Arab Emirates , Dec. 10 , 2008  --
For the world community of Muslims , known as the " umma , " this might be the dawning of the " e- umma . "
This week Muxlim.com , an Islam - focused Web portal based in Finland , launched what it calls the world 's first virtual Muslim world .
The application , Muxlim Pal , allows users to create avatars or alter egos that interact with other players while following a proper Muslim lifestyle .
Users can design their online pal to wear a " hijab " ( or head scarf ) and choose to pray in their custom - designed room .
" We 're giving users an extra channel to express themselves .
You have a virtual friend and you can develop that virtual friend , " Mohamed El - Fatatry , Muxlim 's founder and CEO , told ABC News a day after the application 's launch .
Through Muxlim Pal users can have their online persona shop , play sports , go to concerts and socialize around the virtual town .
As the pal prays or engages in other religious activities its spirituality meter rises .
Elements deemed un -Islamic , like drugs and sexual references , are banned from the virtual world .
Muxlim 's basic portal launched in 2006 and calls itself the world 's largest Muslim online community , with 1.5 million visitors per month across 190 countries .
Most users are based in the United States and Europe -- less than 15 percent are from the Middle East , said El - Fatatry -- though the application has the potential to bridge a broad swath of Muslim lifestyles .
" One of the benefits of the Internet in the Muslim world , which is a generally closed society , is this ability to interact and connect in a way that is n't improper , " said Mahdis Keshavarz of the MAKE Agency , a public relations firm focused on the Middle East .
" It means that people in more secular societies are in contact with the more traditional ?
planting new ideas in places where that exposure has n't traditionally existed , " she said .
Muxlim Pal has a huge potential user base in the young Middle East , where an estimated 65 percent of the population is younger than 24 years old .
Other portals like Mecca.com , likened to an Islamic Facebook , are geared toward the same demographic .
" We 're much more connected , " Mohamed Kadry , 23 , said of fellow Muslims in his generation .
Kadry , who grew up in Detroit and now lives in Dubai , says technology also bridges the gender divide .
" There are a lot of social boundaries we have in our religion . ?
You can't just speak to someone of the opposite sex as easily as you can in the West , and technology lets us connect in ways that are still modest and acceptable . "
Muxlim 's success to date and its hopes for Muxlim Pal rest on what a recent study called the " new age Muslim , " whose lifestyle is both religious and modern .
Research published by advertising firm JWT found that the highest percentage of new age Muslims live in the United Arab Emirates .
From Muxlim.com to the malls of Dubai , that joins moderate Muslim values and global consumer culture .
" We often try to describe an Islamic or a Muslim consumer as Westernized or not Westernized , which is totally stupid , " said Roy Haddad , the chairman of JWT MENA told the National newspaper .
" Yes , we want to be modern .
But we are not Western . "
It ’s faster than a jet , can out handle a roller coaster , and it is environmentally friendly .
How , you ask ?
Starting with only the most exciting super car to drive EVER , the Atom , then adding an electric motor .
What you have then is a beautifully designed engineering masterpiece , the Wrightspeed X1 .
With its minimalist design , consisting of merely a frame to hold everything in place , 3 pedals , a steering wheel and a seat , its more like a stripped down motorcycle with 4 wheels than it is a car .
Its basically a street legal go cart .
But what does that do for it ?
It makes it incredibly light !
Pair that with an AC Propulsion 3 - phase AC induction motor and inverter , and you have rocket - like propulsion from the on - demand torque .
Unfortunately , there are no plans to make this particular design a production vehicle , heck , its hard enough just to get a regular Atom , but they do hint that there will be a production version of the X1 .
I ’m not sure what that means , but i’m still interested .
For those who like specs , check out these numbers :
In recent track testing , on street tires , it achieved the following performance :
0 -30 mph : 1.35 sec
0 -60 mph : 3.07 sec in 117 ft
0 -100 mph : 6.87 sec
0 -100-0 mph 11.2 sec
Lateral g : 1.3
Braking g : 1.2
Hopefully high performance automobiles like this will strike a nerve with car enthusiasts , sparking a bigger desire to own a car ‘ just like the ones on TV ’ .
In a way , its already working .
Greenhouse gases play an important role in North American climate , but differences in regional ocean temperatures may hold a key to predicting future U.S. regional climate changes , according to a new NOAA - led scientific assessment .
The assessment is one in a series of synthesis and assessment reports coordinated by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program .
This latest assessment , Reanalysis of Historical Climate Data for Key Atmospheric Features : Implications for Attribution of Causes of Observed Change , describes what has changed — and why — in North America ’s climate over the past half century .
The assessment addresses the likelihood and extent to which human activity or natural variations have driven surface warming , precipitation , droughts , and floods .
“ A major implication of this assessment is that improving predictions of regional sea-surface temperatures will be crucial to predicting climate variability across the U.S. from years to decades , as well as projecting long - term regional climate changes , ” said Randall Dole , lead author and a scientist at NOAA ’s Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder , Colo .
Some regional temperatures rose sharply , while others held steady ; drought impacts worsened ; and precipitation swung widely — all within the continent ’s gradually warming climate .
Changes in sea-surface temperature patterns likely played an important role in determining differences in U.S. regional temperature trends .
They also contributed to large precipitation swings from year to year or decade to decade during the past 50 years .
While a general trend toward warmer ocean conditions is expected with increasing greenhouse gases , regional differences in sea surface temperature trends can be either natural or human - caused , according to Dole .
The assessment found that an increase in greenhouse gases is likely responsible for more than half of the average continental warming of 1.6° Fahrenheit observed during the past 50 years .
Greenhouse gases , emitted by fossil fuel burning and natural sources , trap heat in Earth ’s atmosphere and warm the surface .
Drought impacts have likely become more severe as surface temperatures warmed , increasing evaporation , reducing soil moisture , and causing other water stresses .
The scientists found no long - term trends in where or how often droughts occur or in how much rain or snow has fallen on average each year .
The assessment also describes in detail how climate scientists use enormous amounts of data in a powerful method for examining past climate , called “ reanalysis . ”
Another section illustrates how they systematically probe cause - and - effect relationships to find the most likely cause of a climate trend , a prolonged drought , or an unusually hot year – a process termed ‘ attribution ’ .
In a reanalysis — or retrospective analysis — a high - quality climate record is constructed from past observations collected over a period of time from many different observing systems and combined with a climate model .
Reanalysis data , which currently extend as far back as the mid-twentieth century , are important in helping researchers understand how climate evolved .
“ Using reanalysis and attribution methods we can now say with more confidence what ’s driving some of the extreme climate conditions of the past few years : whether it ’s global warming , El Niño , La Niña , or some other pattern , ” said NOAA scientist Martin Hoerling , also of the Earth System Research Laboratory and a lead author on the report .
“ That ’s the information policymakers and the public ask for . ”
Hoerling also heads NOAA ’s climate attribution team .
Art can be found in anything depending how you perceive it .
Artists have explored their creative sides to share their visions since prehistoric men painted on cave walls with berries .
Many modern artists have produced some incredible pieces using atypical and unusual media and presented here is just a small sampling of some of their works .
I encourage everyone to explore further as there are more to be found .
Perhaps nothing is more subjective than art so the list is in no particular order .
Should you know of other interesting works please post them as I am sure many would be interested in checking them out .

Summary Outlook : NO CLUE
Forecasting is more of a moving target than we have ever experienced .
Intel ’s big negative surprise on Wednesday eve implying - 16 % Y/Y revenue
growth for CQ4E ( the worst Y/Y trend since CQ4:01 ) and - 12 % Q/Q growth
( perhaps the worst growth ever for Intel ’s seasonally strong CQ4 ) is
the speediest / most draconian negative adjustment driven by consumer
fundamentals we ever recall seeing .
Current industry commentary related to Google tends to reflect a weak
October with a basic mindset adopted by many of flat - lining last week ’s
business trends - subsequently there seems to be almost no expectation
of an end - of - November / beginning - of - December seasonal uptick factored
into current thinking .
It ’s notable that the four weeks ending
mid-December often account for the largest portion ( perhaps 40 - 60 % ) of CQ4
sales .
While we do n’t know for sure if consumers will celebrate Christmas with
gifts , or not , we do know - to paraphrase ‘ Crazy Eddie ’ - prices will
seem insane .
Unlike previous nasty recessions , consumers will have the
ability to search and find great prices online .
The question is not
whether they will search and shop ( or in Google parlance - click and
convert ) , it ’s how much they will buy .
General industry commentary , for the moment , seems to assume flat Y/Y
online ad spending in 2009 in what will likely be a down year for
overall advertising spending .
Assumptions , for now , imply search ( 45 - 50 % of
online ad spend total ) should gain share and grow at 5 - 15 % Y/Y with
display / other online advertising declining by 10 - 15 % .
Commentary we have heard regarding sequential CQ4E search spending /
cost - per-click ( CPC ) trends falls into three categories , ranking in order
of volume : 1 ) big brands - search / CPC tend to have upward bias ; 2 )
mid - sized businesses - mixed ; 3 ) local - down .
Data we have seen
regarding sequential search traffic imply modest growth .

Summary Outlook : DEAD MONEY FOR A WHILE
# Per our note published this morning , " GOOG : Lowering Estimates On Negative ' Net EPS Datapoints " we believe there are no near - term catalysts for the stock .
Hence , we are removing GOOG from Top Picks Live ( TPL ) as our favorite Large Cap Internet idea .
# Why Now ?
Given Weak ' Net EPS Datapoints , We 've Cut Our Estimates - Since GOOG 's Q3 on 10 / 16 , Internet Q3 EPS datapoints have been very negative .
The growth rate for Online Advertising is likely to slow materially in Q4 for the top four ecommerce companies ( AMZN , EBAY , EXPE , PCLN ) - from an average of 25 % Y/Y growth in Q3 to 8 % Y/Y in Q4 .
At some level , GOOG will be impacted as overall marketing budgets are slashed and search budgets are highly scrutinized .
As a result , we 've reduced net revenue by 3 % to $ 4.16B , up 3 % Q/Q ; and reducing EPS by 3 % to $ 5.03 .
Flowing changes through to our '09 estimates , we 've reduced net revenue by 5 % to $ 17.46B , up 11 % Y/Y and reducing EPS by 5 % to $ 21.18 .
# Pushback / Concerns -
At 7.6 x our '09 EBITDA and 16.1 x our '09 GAAP EPS , GOOG is tradingbelow historical levels .
However , given weak Q4 retail expectations and ad budgets ( including search ) shrinking , we believe there are no near - term catalysts for the stock .
# Bottom Line - Unprecedented macro environment trumps all .
BUT , our Long - Term Long
Thesis for GOOG still remains intact .
Also , GOOG is showing some recessionary insulation - Search is gaining share .
And a market that is indiscriminately selling High and Low Quality ' Net stocks is setting up High Quality stocks for eventual outperformance .

Summary Outlook : MAYBE SOME HOPE
While Google has typically not been a FCF story , we think FCF will become more of a focus over the next couple quarters as capex is likely to moderate , potentially providing some near - term support for shares .
While opex cost controls have received more attention , we think GOOG is focused just as much or more on capex spending , not just bc of the existing slowdown , but bc GOOG has likely reached a point of meaningful over - capacity , thereby enabling it to moderate spending w/o impacting the user experience .
GOOG currently trades at 16 x 2009E FCF of $ 5.7B , or 6 % yield .
This FCF multiple may not seem particularly cheap relative to some other names ( i.e. AAPL ) , & we do n't claim to know exactly what cheap means in the current environment , but we think GOOG 's FCF can grow 20 % in 2009 & 16 % annually 2008 - 2011 .
GOOG P/ FCF to 3 - YR growth = 1.0 x vs. 1.2 x for AMZN & 2.5 x for both YHOO & EBAY .
We also think there is some evidence to suggest that shares may perform better during / just after periods in which rev growth > capex growth i.e. mid-2007 & perhaps mid-2005 .

Summary Outlook : FUNDAMENTALS HORRIBLE BUT MAYBE SOME HOPE LONG TERM
Google 4Q and FY09 results should be negatively impacted by further
deterioration in commerce and ad demand in the seasonally strong 4Q ,
prompting us to lower our estimates for the third time in two months .
We remain bullish on the stock long - term given the mkt opportunity and
a 14x P/E .
Based on Oct. data and checks with several industry insiders , we're
lowering our FY08 rev. and NEPS estimates to $ 15.7B and $ 19.39 , from
$ 15.9B and $ 19.62 , respectively .
Our new FY09 estimates are $ 17.5B and
$ 21.26 , well below consensus of $ 19.1B and $ 22.63 .
Our PT goes to $ 420

Summary Outlook : LOUSY BUT WILL SOMEHOW SOAR EVENTUALLY
¡ We are now assuming flat CPC growth Q/Q for Q4-08
We are cutting our estimates for Google due to further weakening of retail and advertising environments and the resulting CPC pressure dilemma .
Our Q4 net revenue now implies 5 % Q/Q growth on constant currency basis and 2 % Q/ Q on FX adjusted basis and ’09 implies 20 % net rev growth .
We believe that the high CPC inflation Google has been experiencing for the past 6 quarters is not sustainable and will pressure core search growth in Q4-08 and ‘ 09 .
Though in the current economic environment search budgets are still holding better than perhaps any kind of advertising categories , the sponsored clicks growth started to slow down in Q4-07 and starting from Q3 -08 we witnessed the slowing CPC growth .
However , Google is currently trading at 13.6 x our ’09 PF EPS and 7.5 x our ’09 EBITDA and can provide material upside in the event of even a modest recovery in the macro economic outlook .
¡ The CPC dilemma at Google
In our view , the prior CPC hikes Google achieved were a function of two factors – 1 ) bid density ( number of advertisers for a keyword determined the CPC ) and 2 ) quality scoring ( higher minimum bid for low quality keywords ) .
We think that due to a weaker economy bid density is now getting affected and quality scoring by nature has diminishing marginal returns .
As per our estimates , going forward bid density will deliver 2 % - 4 % Y/Y lift in CPC and quality scoring perhaps 1 % - 2 % vs. average of 6 % Y/Y each for the past six quarters .
¡ In spite of headwinds GOOG can outperform ‘ Net ad market
During our conversations with several advertisers and media buyers we have been hearing that overall ad budgets continue to come down but ‘ Net ad continues to see secular growth trends , albeit at a lower pace .
Advertisers / media buyers continue to find Search to be the most compelling online ad format .
In our view Search will very likely outperform the overall ‘ Net ad growth and a modest market share gain by Google means GOOG can be one of the fastest growing online ad companies .
¡ Our new vs. old estimates
For Q4-08 we are at net rev of $ 4.26 bn ( prior $ 4.37bn ) , adjusted EBITDA of $ 2.54bn ( prior $ 2.58 bn ) , and pro-forma EPS of $ 5.10 ( prior $ 5.21 ) .
¡ How do we break down Google ’s top - line growth for 2009 ?
Our ’09 net revenue growth of 20 % assumes 15 % growth in core search and 5 % growth in non-core search i.e. mobile Internet ( $ 250 mm incremental ) , YouTube ( $ 200 mm incremental ) , Google Apps ( $ 175 mm incremental ) , & DoubleClick ( $ 90 mm incremental ) .

Vice President Dick
Cheney gets off the hook for ordering war crimes ?
Since America cheers and the mass media agrees , then US President George W. Bush needs to pardon many more people for war crimes before leaving office .
Yes , Mr. Bush , let this be a plea for you to forgive these war crimes committed by those who , with good hearts , and good intentions , tortured fellow human beings , not by choice mind you , but because we were dealing with a savage and inhumane enemy that the record shows were bloodthirsty murderous savages .
Our boys committed those war crimes because it was the only way they could try to protect those poor , innocent , women and children at home from the terrorists .
If you hear my plea , Mr. Bush , please pardon them .
Yes , it was wrong .
We should n’t have tortured .
But when our leaders did it , they had good reasons for doing it .
Our leaders ordered war crimes committed for all the right reasons .
Therefore ; they should be pardoned for the war crimes they committed .
History will show that breaking of International Law and the committing of the war crime of torture was not only unfortunately necessary , it did n’t actually prevent the terrorist killing of thousands of our innocent men , women , and children .
But , who knows ?
Perhaps it did prevent the killing of many more ?
It ’s easy to have 20 / 20 vision with hindsight .
But we did n’t have that luxury back then .
No .
If I am to understand US Vice President Dick Cheney ’s logic — as well as the logic of the mass media , of which I am a proud member — then what we did could not have been helped ; in fact , if you were us you would have done the same thing ; you would have done anything , even torture , to protect your citizens .
History proves that I am 100 % correct on this point and not to be argued with .
We were in a war for survival ; a Clash of Civilizations ; we tortured because we had to .
We did n’t mean to be bad guys , we were merely trying to obtain the necessary information we needed to prevent a calamity .
Too bad , we failed .
The world was different then and it ’s hard to remember , with mere hindsight , what the people felt at that time .
We did what we had to protect our people and our homeland .
In fact , I agree with Cheney and think it ’s too bad that we did n’t torture more to catch the main people who were running the show for the enemy and prevent the disaster that occurred .
Yes , .." .sure , some of this might have been excessive and arguably wrong , but it was all done for the right reasons , by people who are good at heart . ”
I absolutely agree ; especially about the part of the “ people who are good at heart . "
I seriously doubt if you could ever find a mother of any of these patriots we ’re talking about who would n’t insist that their son was n’t pure at heart and absolutely dedicated to the freedom of the homeland .
Yes .
Fair is fair .
What ’s good for the goose is good for the gander , no ?
So besides pardoning the people for crimes committed , there are seven more people you need to pardon , Mr. Bush .
Let me give you a rough background about the people that I demand that the US president pardon .
We were in a war with a savage enemy .
This enemy had just committed the “ worst human holocaust the world had ever witnessed , roaring across two continents non-stop for four centuries and consuming the lives of countless tens of millions of people ” in the last 400 years .
In fact , these savages wiped out at least 300 men , women and children — nearly 75 % of a native population — in a single day !
— during their imperialist expansionism .
This genocide played heavy on our hearts and our minds .
We knew we were dealing with the devil himself .
We had no choice but to do anything to win the war ; that included , unfortunately , torture .
Finally , Mr. Bush , I ask for a pardon , by using the one piece of evidence that I promised to show you .
This is the piece of evidence that history shows as undeniable proof that we were dealing with the criminally insane or , at best , savage barbarians who would rape our women and brutally murder our children at any chance they could get .
In fact , they did , and as I say , history proves me right :
In August of 1945 , these animals dropped two atomic bombs on our cities and incinerated nearly a quarter - million old men , women , and children .
Children !
Small six - month old babies and 2 - year - old girls and boys , all incinerated in an instant like a tissue into a bonfire .
This is also an admission of guilt that torture actually did n’t help us to prevent the enemy from committing the war crime of genocide against our people .
As it turns out , and I ’m sure you ’ll agree that my logic is as impeccable as Mr. Cheney ’s , as well as the complicit American mass media , we should have tortured and killed many more American POWs .
Perhaps , by committing atrocities against them we could have prevented them from committing genocide against us .
Perhaps we could have stopped the American terrorists if we had only had the will - power .
I demand that the US president , as well as American society as a whole , pardon the people in the following list .
To not do so would be completely hypocritical if I am to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Bush Administration should not be punished .
The list of seven to be pardoned is :
General Kenji Doihara , spy ( later Air Force commander )
Baron Kouki Hirota , foreign minister
General Seishirou Itagaki , war minister
General Heitarou Kimura , commander , Burma Expeditionary Force
General Iwane Matsui , commander , Shanghai Expeditionary Force and Central China Area Army
General Akira Muto , commander , Philippines Expeditionary Force
General Hideki Tojo , commander , Kwantung Army ( later prime minister )
These patriots were sentenced to death by hanging at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal after the end of World War Two .
Their crimes included torturing Allied prisoners of war .
But , as I quite skillfully pointed out , the circumstances of their crimes were special and , therefore , it is not useful to consider their actions crimes because , well , ask their mothers ; these boys were all good at heart and they only meant to protect their country from murderous terrorist imperialists .
So let American exceptionalism stand .
Let us all bask in the glory of the new reality .

Observations of the cloud around the white dwarf G29 - 38 by a team led by William Reach of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena suggest it is most likely to be the shredded core of a gas - giant planet like Jupiter ( The Astrophysical Journal , in press ) .
The planet ’s outer layers were apparently engulfed by the star ’s preceding red giant phase .
The core survived but may have been dragged close enough to the subsequent white dwarf to be torn apart by its gravity , creating the dust …
In the last 12 months , we ’ve seen some of the most astonishing advances in space exploration technology .
From SpaceX launching the first commercial rocket into Earth orbit to seeing the first Chinese spacewalk , all of our endeavours in space will help develop the future of manned spaceflight .
Even the recently published Time Magazine Top 10 Scientific Discoveries list space and physics endeavours high up the list .
However , there is a flip - side to this coin .
Fortunately there has been no loss of life through manned spaceflight in 2008 , but we ’ve had our fair share of mishaps .
Some have been expensive , some just embarrassing , but each one has taught us what to do , and what not to do , as we begin to venture further from the protective atmosphere of Earth .
So , to recognise our mistakes , and move on from them , here are the Top 5 Space Exploration mishaps of 2008 …
5. The Chinese Shenzhou - 7 Pre-Launch Gaffe
As the world waited in anticipation for the China ’s biggest leap into space , the state - run website caused controversy whilst the Long - March II - F rocket waited on the launchpad to carry three taikonauts into orbit to complete the nation ’s first ever space walk .
Xinhuanet.com posted an article describing the future communications between mission control and the orbiting Shenzhou - 7 spaceship .
In vivid detail , the ‘ script ’ described everything from the excited dialogue by the crew looking down on Earth to describing the round of applause the mission received back on the ground .
This , of course , ignited the conspiracy theories that the whole event was about to be faked , and certainly did n’t help the sustained attempts by the Chinese regime critics to discredit the actual spacewalk .
Alas , it was most likely a script prepared by the Chinese space agency to ensure everybody said and did the right thing on the day .
Still , it was an embarrassment for China , especially as an AP journalist was able to copy the text of the press release and republish it .
Officials pulled the article from the site ( after a couple of hours ) and put it down to a “ technical error ” .
4. The ISS $ 100,000 Toolbag Drop
Astronaut Heide Stefanyshyn - Piper became famous for all the wrong reasons during the STS - 126 November shuttle mission to the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
This operation was dubbed as the “ home improvements mission ” where a team of seven astronauts successfully upgraded the station to cope with an expanded crew of six in 2009 , plus fix a stiff joint attached to one of the solar arrays during a series of space walks .
However , during one of her EVAs , Stefanyshyn - Piper had a grease gun explode inside her toolbag .
As she struggled to clean the mess from her camera , she accidentally lost her grip on the toolbag and it drifted away from the station .
Obviously frustrated , she uttered , “ Oh great ! ” as she saw the $ 100,000 - worth bag o’ tools fall toward the Earth .
That toolbag became one of the largest , and most expensive items of space debris to be accidentally lost from the ISS …
3. The Wallops Island Firework
On August 22nd , a seemingly “ routine ” sounding rocket launch ended in disaster .
However , it did confirm that the “ launch abort ” system was working as it should .
In the early hours of that summer morning , an Alliant Techsystems ( ATK ) ALV X - 1 rocket blasted into the sky and NASA was videoing the whole event .
As the hypersonic rocket zipped through the sky on a sub-orbital trajectory to deliver two NASA atmospheric experiments , the range safety officer hit the big red button and destroyed the rocket .
The vehicle made for a nice firework blast , but it was an expensive loss .
The brand new ALV X - 1 plus NASA payload cost $ 17 million ; it had travelled only 11,000 feet into the atmosphere after 27 seconds of flight .
Presumably , the rocket suffered an anomaly during launch , possibly causing it to travel off - course .
Regardless , the ALV X - 1 was toast and people living near the launch site were kindly asked not to approach any debris in case it was toxic .
Probably the most damaging thing about this loss was that the US news channels played the explosion on a continuous loop for the whole of the day .
Most people probably did n’t know what went on at NASA ’s launch facility at Wallops Island , but on that day it became synonymous with exploding NASA rockets …
2. Falcon 1 Flight 3 Transient Thrust
SpaceX is fast becoming Elon Musk ’s answer to the future of space commercialization .
His company has gone from strength to strength in the last decade , building everything from their rockets to their launch platforms ( first in the Pacific Ocean and now expanding to Cape Canaveral itself ) from scratch .
Of course it helps if you have a vast wealth of personal fortune , but SpaceX ’s vision and drive is truly inspiring .
However , you do n’t become the # 1 in the commercial space launch business without a few knocks along the way .
Anticipation was high for a successful Flight 3 of the SpaceX Falcon 1 from Kwajalein Atoll on August 2nd .
For the most part ( apart from the getting into orbit part ) the Falcon performed flawlessly , travelling over 200 km in altitude .
But then came main engine shut - off and stage separation .
As the first stage separated and began to drop toward Earth , the video showed a strange recoil ( caused by an unexpected “ transient thrust ” ) , and the stage seemed to hang around near the second stage engine just before second stage ignition .
Oh dear .
Disaster struck for the third time running , Falcon 1 exploded high in the atmosphere .
On that day several commercial payloads were lost , but SpaceX regrouped and prepared for another test flight on September 28th .
This time SpaceX made history and got into orbit .
It was all worth it in the end …
1. The Soyuz ( Very ) Hard Landing
The number one space exploration mishap has got to go to the Russian Soyuz hard landing on April 19th .
This is n’t because the Soyuz crew return vehicle suffered an unexpected “ ballistic re-entry ” ; it ’s not due to the fact the capsule entered the atmosphere on its side ; it ’s not even because the capsule caused vegetation around the 400 mile - off target landing site to burn , allowing smoke into the cabin where the crew hung upside down after a particularly violent re-entry .
It was the incredible reaction of the Russian officials after the hard landing that stands out as the biggest mishap of the year .
Initially , Russian space officials attempted to cover up the emergency landing of the descent capsule .
Bad idea .
However , compounding the issue , they wrongly blamed the Soyuz crew for changing the flight plan without permission after they had undocked from the ISS .
Even worse idea .
To top off the whole fiasco , one official cited a bad omen ( i.e. a woman was commanding the mission ) as a contributing factor behind the hard landing .
Did he really just say that ?!
As you ’d expect , this started several weeks of media excitement over the event and the Russian space agency was put in a very bad light .
But did it change anything ?
I doubt it …
In Conclusion
So that was the Astroengine.com “ Top 5 Space Exploration Mishaps of 2008 . ”
There have of course been other setbacks during the year of spaceflight , but these five stand out as being the most … significant ( embarrassing ) .
But after these events , we learn new ways to prevent them from happening again ( take the SpaceX transient thrust issue for example ) .
However , as with the Chinese launch gaffe and the Russian assertion that an old naval superstition may have been the root cause of the Soyuz hard landing , some regimes will always cloud their endeavours in space with secrecy .
Space exploration is a powerful political tool , and it seems some nations of the world are willing to exploit this fact .
Remind me , why are we depending on Russia for manned access to space again ?

7 Ursula From The Little Mermaid
Ursula is a sea witch , which any marine biologist will tell you means " eight - legged obese mermoctopus . "
After the movie 's heroine , Ariel , meets Prince Eric ( " Eric " ?
Really , Disney ? ) , she decides that she absolutely must become human , probably due to the limitations of human / mermaid sex .
Ursula gives her a set of legs in exchange for her voice .
Being evil , she makes the trade at the bottom of the ocean .
Ariel becomes human and almost drowns , barely managing to make it to shore , and Ursula , who 's somehow a heavy smoker , cackles raspily because she totally saw that shit coming .

The Horrific Death :
Near the end of the movie , Ursala blackmails Ariel 's father , King Triton , into giving her his magical trident , the One Ring of The Little Mermaid .
This allows her to transform into a giant super - Ursula and control the weather .

Eric ( ugh ) , deciding that he's had quite enough of this shit , steers a ship through a whirling vortex of doom and uses its bowsprit to freaking impale Ursula right through the gut .

For whatever reason , this causes lighting to strike her for an effective electro - stab combo .
If they 'd only stuck an explosive in her mouth , they would have covered the shark kills from all four Jaws movies .
Ursula screams in agony and falls back into the ocean , the saltwater and electricity searing through the massive open wound in her belly and charring her huge , exposed intestines ( that last part is implied but not shown ) .
The horror of this fresh in everyone 's mind , the king gets his trident back and makes everyone happy and everything better , somehow .
Is there no problem a large - scale impalement can't solve ?
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Blasts at Baghdad ’s police academy and in the northern city of Mosul killed 29 people and wounded dozens more Monday , hours after a roadside bomb wounded a senior Iraqi official , police said .

Violence has fallen sharply over the last year as successive security crackdowns dealt insurgent groups heavy blows , but officials say militants are now concentrating their efforts on attention - grabbing attacks ahead of elections next year .
People were queuing at the back entrance of the police academy in east Baghdad to enroll when a car bomb exploded , followed minutes later by a suicide bomb attack , police said .
Fifteen people were killed and 45 wounded .
Shortly after , a suicide car bomber killed 14 people and wounded 30 in Mosul , the last holdout of al Qaeda and other Sunni Arab insurgent groups in Iraq that once fought U.S. soldiers across swathes of the country .
The attack in Mosul targeted an Iraqi police and U.S. military joint patrol , they said .
Monday ’s blasts came as Iraq tries to prepare its security forces to take over responsibility from U.S. troops , who under a security pact passed by parliament Thursday will have to withdraw from towns by mid-2009 and leave Iraq by end -2011 .
The Iraqi government is also in the process of taking responsibility for largely Sunni neighborhood patrolmen -- who number some 100,000 across Iraq -- from the U.S. military , while also preparing for provincial elections on January 31 .
The attacks are aimed at reigniting sectarian bloodshed between the minority Sunni Arabs who dominated Iraq under former dictator Saddam Hussein and Shi’ites who are now in control .
In a separate attack hours earlier , Major - General Mudhar al - Mawla , who is dealing with the transfer of mainly Sunni patrolmen to government control , was targeted by a roadside bomb as his convoy left his home in the Sulaikh district of northern Baghdad .
The bomb killed three people and wounded 13 others , police said .
Mawla was also seriously wounded , they said .
Baghdad security spokesman Major - General Qassim Moussawi said only one bodyguard had been killed in the blast and six people wounded .
Mawla was only slightly wounded , he added .
Over recent months we ’ve been migrating more and more of GHC ’s build system from make ( + GNU extensions ) into Cabal .
It seemed like the obvious thing to do : Cabal is a generic build and packaging system for Haskell libraries , and GHC ’s build system was duplicating much of the functionality of Cabal .
What ’s more , many libraries needed two sets of metadata to describe them : one set for GHC ’s build system , and another set for Cabal , so that users could build and install updated versions of these libraries outside of the GHC build .
So in changing GHC ’s build system to use Cabal under the hood , we eliminated some duplicated effort , which is always a good thing .
We got to piggyback off the Cabal project , which is ticking along nice thanks to the efforts of Duncan Coutts and many other contributors .
But it was n’t perfect , even from the outset .
We knew we would n’t be able to use Cabal as it stands .
For one thing , Cabal uses ghc -- make , which does n’t build in parallel , and we really want parallel builds ( building GHC can take a while ) .
Secondly , when working on GHC we often want to build individual modules , sometimes with extra flags , just to try something out .
Cabal does n’t support this , it can only build the whole package .
Thirdly , the GHC build system has a lot of configuration information that we need to propagate into Cabal somehow .
So the solution we came up with for all this was to have Cabal generate a Makefile from the package metadata , so that we could build the package using make .
Make knows how to build in parallel , it knows how to make just a single target , and it can import configuration information from other makefiles .
This was a cute hack ( or an ugly one , depending on your point of view ) , but it certainly has its downsides : for one thing , it ’s really hard to modify the code that generates the Makefile , as it ’s part of Cabal .
For someone new to GHC , it ’s even hard to find the code that generates the Makefile .
The build system is getting less maleable .
We had n’t really fixed the duplication problem either , since we ’d had to write another build system , in the form of an auto - generated Makefile .
Users began to complain .
Using Cabal is still morally the right thing to do .
It ’s just that the marriage of Cabal with our existing Makefile - based build system is n’t a happy one .
If Cabal becomes a better make than make , we will be able to use it more effectively , but for now we have decided to back off and redesign the build system in the light of the recent problems we ’ve had .
GHC ’s build system has always been something of a struggle to use .
Building GHC is a 2 - stage bootstrap process , where we first build the “ stage 1 ” compiler , use that to build a bunch of libraries , and then use stage 1 + libraries to build stage 2 , which is the compiler that we actually install .
There are a lot of dependencies between different parts of the tree , most of which are not expressed explicitly in the build system .
Partly this is because we use recursive make , which as many will know is considered to be harmful .
The result is that we often need to “ make clean ” to fix inconsistencies caused by changing parts of the tree without rebuilding enough , or simply by pulling the latest changes into your tree .
We actually recommend doing “ make distclean ” before pulling new changes , which is obviously not ideal .
So we ’re going to try the non-recursive make approach , coupled with a very light use of Cabal for preprocessing the library metadata into Makefile bindings ( that way we do n’t have to keep the metadata in two forms ) .
There ’s a design sketch for the new build system on the wiki .
Over the next few weeks we ’ll be working on the new build system in a repository branch .

Editor 's Note : Each Wednesday LiveScience examines the viability of emerging energy technologies — the power of the future .
With the economic downturn , many job markets seem in peril .
However , investment in energy efficiency and renewable - energy strategies could create 2 million jobs in two years , economists claim .
In a recent report , researchers from the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts propose a $ 100 billion stimulus package that they say would create four times more jobs than would a similar investment in the oil industry .
" Our proposal is a Green Recovery program , " said lead author Robert Pollin .
" It is designed to precisely counteract the forces pushing the economy into a recession . "
Besides reducing carbon emissions , the investment — which would combine tax credits and loan guarantees for envirotech companies — would reduce the country 's dependence on foreign oil .
Moreover , it would create so - called " green collar " jobs that would benefit both traditional blue and white collar workers .
" Green investments will create jobs across the spectrum — from truck drivers , roofers , welders , secretaries , CEOs and research scientists , " Pollin told LiveScience .
Wearing green
As many as one out of four workers in the United States will be working in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries by 2030 , according to a separate recent report from the American Solar Energy Society .
Who makes up the green collar work force ?
" There 's no real hard and fast definition , " said Olivia Anderson of Acre Resources Ltd. , an environmental job recruiter in the United Kingdom .
" But green collar is any role implementing sustainability in business . "
This can include retrofitting buildings , designing new solar cells , organizing recycling programs , carbon trading , or being part of a company 's corporate responsibility team .
Perhaps this breadth explains why Anderson 's company continues to place workers .
" We have n't seen a slowdown in our business , " Anderson said .
" There 's a little bit of caution but people are still hiring . "
She thinks part of this stability stems from the fact that governments and companies have both made public pledges to reduce their carbon footprint .
" They have to stick to it , " she said .
The color of money
Worldwide , $ 148 billion was spent on clean energy technologies and projects in 2007 , according to U.K. - based New Energy Finance , which provides investor information in alternative energy .
This was an increase of more than 60 percent in investments from the year before .
Some foresee continued growth in the future , but it will likely depend on what government policies are enacted .
The Green Jobs
Act of 2007 provides $ 125 million per year to fund green job training programs , but Congress has yet to appropriate the funds .
In the race for the White House , Sen. Barack Obama has proposed spending $ 150 billion over 10 years to help create 5 million new jobs in clean energy .
Sen .
John McCain has a plan to fund low - carbon technologies with proceeds from a cap and trade system .
" These programs are moving in the right direction , " Pollin said .
But " we need more dramatic action .
This will benefit the environment and have a much greater positive impact on job availability . "

ROCHESTER , N.Y. ( AP ) _ A magic wand , a fishing rod or a royal scepter ?
The lowly stick , a universal plaything powered by a child 's imagination , landed in the National Toy Hall of Fame on Thursday along with the Baby Doll and the skateboard .
The three were chosen to join the Strong National Museum of Play 's lineup of 38 classics ranging from the bicycle , the kite and Mr. Potato Head to Crayola crayons , marbles and the Atari 2600 video game system .
Curators said the stick was a special addition in the spirit of a 2005 inductee , the cardboard box .
They praised its all - purpose , no -cost , recreational qualities , noting its ability to serve either as raw material or an appendage transformed in myriad ways by a child 's creativity .
" It 's very open - ended , all - natural , the perfect price — there are n't any rules or instructions for its use , " said Christopher Bensch , the museum 's curator of collections .
" It can be a Wild West horse , a medieval knight 's sword , a boat on a stream or a slingshot with a rubber band .
...
No snowman is complete without a couple of stick arms , and every campfire needs a stick for toasting marshmallows .
" This toy is so fantastic that it 's not just for humans anymore .
You can find otters , chimps and dogs — especially dogs — playing with it . "
Longevity is a key criterion for getting into the hall , which the museum acquired in 2002 from A.C. Gilbert 's Discovery Village in Salem , Ore .
Each toy must not only be widely recognized and foster learning , creativity or discovery through play , but also endure in popularity over generations .
While dolls have been around since ancient times , the Baby Doll with its realistic newborn features emerged in the late 18th century and has been through hundreds of incarnations .
Today 's models can crawl , drink and even talk via voice - activated commands .
" It is generally thought of as lovable and cuddly , even if it can doze off or cry during play , " said Susan Asbury , an associate curator .
" Toy designers have spent decades making it ever more lifelike and true to form .
...
It promotes imaginative play and brings out the nurturing side in all of us . "
The first skateboarders in the 1950s cruised walkways on California beaches trying to match the speed , turns and tricks performed by surfers they watched offshore .
Apart from being fun , practicing ollies , grinds and primos " promotes individualism ... artistic expression and it's also very athletic , " skateboard icon Tony Hawk said in a video message played at the induction ceremony .

UCSB Housing and Residential Services and the Resident Hall Association ( RHA ) are discussing a proposal to restrict the use of table tent advertisements to Housing and Residential Services only , following the rejection and subsequent approval of an advertisement for Scientific Understanding and Reason Enrichment ( SURE ) .
The proposal to change the policy comes after SURE told Dining Services they could go to court over the rejection claiming it was a violation of free speech .
Dining Services later approved the ad and intends to place an up - to - date version in the new year .
The advertisement featured information about the club , which promotes secularism , next to an image of Adam from the Sistine Chapel ceiling , and promoted a Nov. 12 lecture by Dan Barker , an evangelical preacher turned atheist .
Table tents , the three - sided , standing paper advertisements placed on tables in the dining commons , must be approved by the RHA president and Dining Services in order to be placed .
Tyler Santander , Director of Public Outreach for SURE , said the club was at first informed its advertisement would be placed , but that Dining Services told him the approval had been overruled , claiming the ad was “ controversial and potentially upsetting . ”
“ UCSB is a 100 percent free speech zone , ”  said Santander .
“ You can say anything , advertise anything , and no one can do anything about it , so turning something down on the basis of being , controversial and possibly upsetting , defies free speech . ”
The Director of Residential Dining Services could not be reached for comment , but Director of Housing and Residential Services Willie Brown offered an explanation for why the ad was initially rejected .
“ I think our staff was following the generally accepted social norm of not promoting the discussion of politics or religion while dining , ”  he said .
“ The Dining Commons are an extension of our residents , living area and we want students to have a relaxing experience while eating .
SURE was offered the alternative of leaving flyers at the residence hall front desks . ”
Brown also said the idea of changing the table tent policy is not new .
“ Our Dining Services administration has considered changing the policy for some time now due to the logistics , labor , and time needed to distribute the table tents to four Dining Commons , ”  he said .
“ One of our department values is “ being environmentally sensitive . ”
The amount of paper being used to make the table tents has always been a concern of ours from a sustainability standpoint . ”
Joseph Navarro , Associate Dean of Students and SURE adviser , examined the Dining Services ’ table tent policy and determined that the ad rejection infringed on the group ’s right to free speech .
“ The policy did n’t specify any guidelines by which outside groups would have their table tents approved , ”  he said .
“ There was only the administrative practice that table tents would be rejected if they were political , religious , or controversial .
Rejection based on content is , I believe , unconstitutional . ”
Santander said he does not believe SURE was discriminated against , and hopes the situation can be worked out .
“ I wo n’t jump so far as to say it was intentional discrimination and [ Dining Services ] does not want to see secularism in the Dining Commons , ” he said .
“ I suppose to some people [ the ad ] could be offensive , but it could alwaysÂ justÂ be a misunderstanding of secularism . ”
Santander said if the table tents are not placed , SURE is prepared to go to court .
“ People might say , ‘ Why are you making such a big deal about table tents ? ” but it ’s the principle of it , ”  he said .
“ Anytime constitutional rights are threatened , it ’s important to fight no matter how small the issue . ”
RHA President Charlie Arreola did not wish to comment on the matter until an agreement on the policy has been reached .
Europe ’s ruling elite fear the “ contagion ” from Greece
15 December 2008
It is necessary for working people , especially the young , to consider the broader implications of the past week ’s events in Greece .
It is , after all , a question that is occupying the thoughts of senior figures within the ruling elites of Europe and the United States .
The rioting that has engulfed Greece had its spark in the police killing of a 15 - year - old boy , Alexis Grigoropoulos .
But this ignited a seething mass of discontent , especially amongst Greece ’s youth and its student population .
Despite the efforts of the New Democracy government and its nominal opponents on the official left to blame anarchist agitators , only this social opposition can account for the sustained character of the protests and their spread throughout the country , even in the face of brutal repression .
Numerous reports have drawn attention to the dire situation facing the younger generation in Greece , even those who have graduated from university .
Unemployment affects one in four 15 - to - 24 - year - olds , even in advance of the full impact of the slump in the world economy .
Post - graduates are routinely forced to take minimum wage jobs at just €600 a month , if they are lucky .
Some work two jobs in order to survive .
Andre Gerolymatos wrote in Canada ’s Globe and Mail that “ the predominant factor for the actions of such young people is a sense of hopelessness , ” noting that unemployment for those between 15 and 20 is “ just over 22 per cent . ”
He continued : “ It ’s no coincidence that most of the rioters fall within that age group .
In effect , one in four young men and women face a future of low - paying jobs and poverty . ”
The situation in Greece is dire , but it is by no means the exception .
Across Europe a similar picture is developing .
Hence the commentaries to the effect that Greece is emblematic of what the Wall Street Journal acknowledges to be “ growing discontent among youths in many European countries . ”
The Journal noted that young people in Greece have been “ dubbed ‘ Generation 600 ’ — referring to the country 's national minimum wage of € 600 . ”
It then listed similar designations :
In Germany it is “ Generation Intern ” because graduates “ have found themselves working as interns for no or low pay for long periods . ”
In Spain , young people are referred to as “ mileuristas ” — “ loosely , those who scrape by on a thousand euros a month … entering the workplace with few benefits or protections , often moving between temporary contracts . ”
In a more extensive December 9 comment on Spain , Bloomberg noted that its “ Best Generation ” is being hit hardest as “ boom turns to bust . ”
Some 28 percent of Spain ’s young people are out of work , twice the European Union average .
Fully 63 percent of those between the ages of 15 and 24 who were working were on temporary contracts last year , “ so the young people are the first ones to lose their jobs and they ’re losing them massively , ” explained Gayle Allard , vice - rector of the Instituto de Empresa business school in Madrid .
The average net monthly salary for people under age 29 is just €964 .
Only 55 percent of young workers can afford all their costs , according to a government report .
The day before Alexis Grigoropoulos was killed , Forbes ran a report by Selcuk Gokoluk warning , “ Rising unemployment among young Turks threatens to fuel social unrest . ”
Bulent Pirler , general secretary of an employers ’ group , stated , “ Turkey has a young population .
If they are not educated and employed , it means you have a bomb in your hands . ”
Forbes continued : “ Data shows that 1.09 million people are registered at the state unemployment agency , but it is advertising only 14,526 job offers .
More than one third of the jobless claims registered last month were made by people aged 15 - 24 . ”
The Telegraph in Britain featured an article in its December 8 business pages by Constantine Courcoulas insisting , “ Investors are wrong to ignore the Greek riots . ”
After warning that the present “ uproar is unprecedented ” and “ no longer limited to an anarchist fringe ” due to “ widespread anger at the government , ” Courcoulas wrote that “ the tensions created by unemployment , marginalised youth and incompetent governments are far from exclusively Hellenic .
Similar outbreaks are possible in other countries .
Recessions are always tough on the young .
And while the Greek rioters ’ slogan — ‘ bullets for your youth , money for your banks ’— may not qualify as sound socioeconomic analysis , it has a catchy ring . ”
He concluded , “ Social protests have sometimes changed the world .
Think of the French and Russian revolutions . ”
Writing for the Associated Press , a similar appraisal was made by Paul Haven , who stated that the “ authorities in Europe worry conditions are ripe for the contagion to spread ” as the continent “ plunges into recession . ”
Most tellingly , the Scotsman newspaper drew attention to the response of French President Nicolas Sarkozy to the Greek events .
Rejecting budget proposals from his own party that he considered too obviously biased toward the wealthy , he remarked , “ Look what is going on in Greece . ”
Sarkozy expressed concern that unrest could spread to France , the Scotsman reported .
“ The French love it when I ’m in a carriage with Carla , but at the same time they ’ve guillotined a king , ” he said .
The citations above are drawn from leading financial journals , newspapers with a distinctly right - wing colouration and organs generally designated as newspapers “ of record . ”
They are serious appraisals made of a growing threat to the capitalist system posed by a generation of young people , often educated , highly intelligent and articulate , who are living on next to nothing .
Told for years that an education was all that was required to succeed , they have no prospects for the future despite their sacrifices and those of their parents .
Faced with governments of the official left and right seeking to make working people shoulder the full weight of the economic crisis , and opposition parties that offer no real opposition to this agenda , young people in Greece have taken to the streets in a mass display of anger and frustration .
But make no mistake .
We are witnessing the beginning of a profound social shift that must assume political forms that will not be confined to the compromised and discredited trade unions and organisations of the official left .

Vancouver , B.C. , Canada A Starbucks on both the East ( background ) and West ( foreground ) corners of Robson and Thurlow
Walking around the ritzy ( relatively speaking ) area of downtown Vancouver during our recent trip there , I came across a scene that I thought existed only in the world of late - show monologues : a street corner with two Starbucks Coffees .
I kid you not .
The photo above is horrible , of course , but all I have to show for the slightly - memorable event .
You can sort of see the green Starbucks awnings on the building catty - corner across the street .
Despite some odd quirks ( which I 've written about ) , I like the coffee at Starbucks , but while in Vancouver , we sought out small , local cafes when we could , and were never disappointed .
Wall Street Jokes , Please

Valve Teases Left 4 Dead DLC Reveal Soon , Simultaneous Xbox 360 Release
Along with the " new stuff , " the download will bring Versus support to the Dead Air and Death Toll campaigns , a move that will finally allow players to experience all four of the game 's campaigns in the competitive mode .
Owners of the PC version can also expect the long - promised SDK at some point , which should allow for the creation of custom maps , scenarios and other mods .
" We should be announcing that before Christmas , what the DLC is , " said Faliszek in a Kotaku video podcast , seemingly recorded December 15 .
" The holidays are n't actually so much delaying it as the press guys --[ marketing VP ]
Doug [ Lombardi ] 's been taking some time .
We 'll have an announcement shortly , I do n't know exactly when . "
As for a movie editor that would let users capture and edit in - game footage -- something Valve apparently hinted at in an E3 interview -- Faliszek merely noted that the team wants to make sure that playable content will be " the first out -- after that , I hate to speculate . "
While pricing was not discussed , the new content is expected to be free for PC owners , continuing in Valve 's tradition of providing PC gamers with free post - release support .
However , it is uncertain if the Xbox 360 DLC will be free , as Microsoft is reportedly forcing Valve to charge for the upcoming Team Fortress 2 DLC on Xbox 360 .
Stone
Age string : Unearthed , the twine that was twisted into shape 8,000 years ago
How old is a piece of string ?
In this case , 8,000 years - making it the oldest length of string ever found in Britain .
Our ancestors made it by twisting together what seem to be fibres of honeysuckle , nettles , or wild clematis , and used it in their struggle for survival as the last ice age ended .
This early piece of technology , measuring about 41 / 2in must have been a revolutionary advance at the time , useful for binding together weapons or tools .
Found in the mud :
The ancient string
It has only survived thanks to the huge floods that followed the melting of the ice caps that once covered much of Britain .
It was discovered by archaeologists examining an undersea site 200 yards off the coast of the Isle of Wight , some 30 feet below sea level .
The experts say that 8,000 years ago , in the Stone Age , hunter gatherers had a camp there .
They believe the string was found in the remains of what could be Britain 's oldest boat yard .
When the glaciers melted , however , the whole area was inundated as sea levels rose - a scenario repeated in coastal areas across the globe , providing , some claim , the source of the Noah 's Ark story .
This underwater dig was carried out by the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology , led by Gary Momber .
The prehistoric village - wooden remains of which were seen by chance by divers - seems to have been close to where the Solent estuary once was .
Divers cut blocks of sediment from the sea bed and brought them to the surface for analysis .
Preserved within one was the string .
The results of the underwater dig have now been published in British Archaeology magazine .
Editor Mike Pitts said of the string : ' It is a fantastic find .
I do n't think the average person realises what an important piece of technology string has been over the ages . '
Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology expert Jan Gillespie said : ' The string was found with wooden planks and stakes and some pits containing burnt flint .
We believe they may have been heated up to help work timber into boats .
' This inundation followed the retreat of glaciers at the end of the Ice Age .
It is a fascinating time in our pre-history . '

Women in the Netherlands who are deemed by the state to be unfit mothers should be sentenced to take contraception for a prescribed period of two years , according to a draft bill before the Dutch parliament .
The proposed legislation would further punish parents who defied it by taking away their newborn infant .
" It targets people who have been the subject of judicial intervention because of their bad parenting , " explained the author of the bill Marjo Van Dijken of the socialist PvDA .
" If someone refuses the contraception and becomes pregnant , the child must be taken away directly after birth . "
When I see how some parents treat their children and come across adults who wish they 'd never been born because of the abuse they endured as kids , I get some idea of where Van Dijken is coming from , but her proposed solution strikes me as far too draconian .
In fact , I have serious misgivings about the implications of this proposed law , and it raises a torrent of questions in my mind .
Is it really the state 's role to protect the unborn and does it have the right to control people 's bodies in such a way and to deprive them of the basic right to procreate ?
Whatever happened to the presumption of innocence ?
Just because a parent was bad with one child , does it mean ( s ) he will repeat the offence ?
Have we got the right to exercise pre-emptive " justice " – and could this be the first step towards a " minority report " approach to parental " precrime " ?
And , perhaps , given the Dutch penchant for social engineering , this could prove to be the prelude for the professionalisation of parenting , where in the distant future only certified and trained " fathers " and " mothers " would be allowed to raise children in special facilities .
Less fantastically , could this not be the first step down a slippery slope ?
This government may have all the best intentions , but what 's to guarantee that a future government does n't use the law , or an amendment of it , to target " undesirable " groups , such as Roma , gays , religious minorities and immigrants ?
More immediately , there 's the question of how we would define the " unfit parents " who should be deprived from the right to bear children .
Should the law apply only to parents who pose a clear and present danger to potential offspring or could it be more loosely interpreted to apply to those of whose parenting style the state disapproves ?
Even if the law does save legions of notional children the trauma of neglectful parenting and abuse , how about all those parents it unfairly condemns ?
Surely , not all people who have ill - treated their children will raise their future offspring badly .
Some will learn from their mistakes or be prompted by remorse to do better .
Others will have mistreated their children because of temporary factors , such as depression or a nervous breakdown , the break - up of a relationship , or the loss of a job and other social deprivations .
" I find this is going way too far , " exclaimed one Dutch blogger .
" That 's may be because I experienced how my own sister could not take care of her son as a consequence of postnatal depression …
Was she such a bad mother that , in the future , she can't determine for herself whether or not to have another child ? "
I must admit that it shocked me that this law was the brainchild of a socialist .
As a confounded psychiatrist friend who deals with troubled children put it , this bill is vaguely reminiscent of the eugenics and sterilisation programmes of the fascist era .
Rather than the altruistic goal of protecting children , one friend thinks that this legislative proposal , which is likely to be defeated , is an attempt to steal the populist thunder of the far right in a society that has veered significantly rightwards in recent years .
Another hidden objective could be to reduce the cost to the state of caring for abused children .
Luckily , this ill - conceived law , according to legal experts , contravenes the Dutch constitution and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights , and will hopefully be defeated on the floor of the parliament .
Blowing for gold : does this really look like Lisa Simpson ?
Photograph : London 2012 / PNS
A quietly spoken and clearly thoughtful boy at an infant school interviewed for the 10.30 pm news last night got it exactly right .
He told ITV 's reporter in no uncertain terms what he thought of the newly unveiled London 2012 Olympics logo .
" Rubbish " .
And , who could possibly disagree ?
Surely not those who have likened the image to cartoon character , Lisa Simpson , giving London a blow job .
Oh dear .
I 'm sorry .
But , it does look like that .
And who , even the cleanest minded among us , is going to think anything else now ?
Yesterday was not April 1 , although you might have had to pinch yourself as you checked the calendar .
Surely the graphic designers ( sorry , " brand consultants " ) who came up with this dismal £ 400,000 design had been playing around in the studio .
It 's all been a joke , 100 per cent visual satire , a smutty - minded game played , one can't help thinking , by young designers , fed up with the whole bullying , secretive , puerile London Olympics fiasco as this desperately " well wicked " and " down with kids " juggernaut , this Millennium Experience Mk2 , with gangs of imaginatively paid consultants and fawning toadies in search of CBEs and knighthoods , hanging from its money - shedding sides , rumbles towards Stratford and 2012 .
Sadly , the logo , already likened to a " broken swastika " - a very punk swastika - may yet be with us for another five desperate years .
This is the way we want to be seen by the rest of the world now that we live , according to Olympics executives and government ministers , in a world in which we are all " modern " , " flexible " , " brand savvy " and young people ( ie " kids " , those baseball - capped , consumer - crazy , skateboarding yoof we need to get down with ) " no longer relate to static logos . "
Innit .
Look at the throwaway word " London " plonked inside the logo ; the lettering appears to be based on the kind of crude , knife - carved scrawl most often found on the walls of public lavatories .
It stinks .
And , it implies that London is little more than , if not one big toilet , the façade of a high street chain store .
The logo fails the Olympics spirit completely .
Its component parts are broken apart , while the Olympics are all about athletes , spectators and nations joining together .
Now look at the original Olympics symbol , designed by Pierre de Coubterin , founder of the modern Games , in 1913 and first displayed at the Antwerp Olympics of 1920 .
This is a superb design , its five intertwined rings evoking the idea of continents linked together .
It is far from being " static " , and is as eye - catching and as appropriately expressive of the Olympics today as it was in those unfortunate days gone by when people ( no " kids " then ) eeked out a savvyless living without , like , " brands " to sustain them .
The problem with all this is that the new logo is fundamentally patronising .
Would - be adults in charge of events like the London 2012 Olympics should put childish things , language and " brand savvy " logos aside .
No child is impressed by parents who try to dress like infants in , for example , all - day pyjama outfits and baseball caps , or who try to speak in the latest , and supposedly fashionable , jargon .
The Olympics should exist to raise our collective hopes , expectations and sights .
This logo , though , is one of the saddest modern sights of all , and this from a city that produced the rightly world - famous London Transport logo .
There are no medals here .
Only " rubbish " .

Diamond retailer De Beers is targeting Joker.com , the Swiss domain name registrar that is hosting the fake New York Times '
Web site , because an ad in the fake Web site suggests the company 's policies have prompted violence against Africans caught up in the diamond conflict .
When copies of a fake New York Times and an accompanying Web site started making the rounds on the morning of November 12 , many people believed that the move would result in a legal firestorm from the newspaper .
" Iraq War Ends ! " the main headline screamed .
Save for the July 4 , 2009 dateline and the improbable content , the real and fake versions were virtually indistinguishable .
Two weeks later , however , the fake paper 's
Web site at www.nytimes-se.com remains intact , and the real New York Times referred to the prank as a " Grade - A caper . "
Not everyone was amused , however .
Diamond retailer De Beers is targeting Joker.com , the Swiss domain name registrar that is hosting the fake New York Times '
Web site , because an ad in the fake Web site suggests the company 's policies have prompted violence against Africans caught up in the region 's diamond conflict .
" Your purchase of a diamond will enable us to donate a prosthetic for an African whose hand was lost in diamond conflicts , " reads a tagline displayed below a picture of a disembodied prosthetic hand reaching for the hand of a woman sporting a glittering diamond ring .
The use of the De Beers name constitutes trademark infringement , according to the company .
De Beers said it is targeting Joker.com instead of Harold Schweppes , the owner of the fake newspaper Web site , because it could not locate Schweppes .
" We have not been able to identify any individual named Harold Schweppes , and it appears that the address ' 80 Infinity Place , Son of Triumph , Pennsylvania ' appears to be entirely made up , " Brian McGinley , a partner with Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal , wrote in a November 19 letter to Joker.com .
" As a result we believe that Joker.com should immediately disable the offending Web site and cancel the registration . "
The fake De Beers ad is " offensive , disparaging , damaging , and inaccurate , " according to McGinley , and the company " will not hesitate to take appropriate action to protect is valuable name and goodwill . "
De Beers did not elaborate on what that action might entail .
McGinley did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Though Son of Triumph , Pa. may not exist , Harold Schweppes does , and he is being represented by the San Francisco - based Electronic Frontier Foundation , which argues that the fake paper is clearly parody and that use of the De Beers name is fair use .
" De Beers is demanding that Joker.com disable Mr. Schweppes ' domain name based on De Beer 's alleged belief that the Web site associated with that domain name contains materials that infringe De Beers ' trademark , " EFF attorney Corynne McSherry , wrote in a Tuesday letter to McGinley .
" These threats are improper and baseless and we demand that you withdraw them immediately . "
" Courts have noted that nominative fair uses are particularly likely to be found in parodies , " according to McSherry .
The U.S. Trademark
Act is irrelevant , she wrote , because www.nytimes-se.com is " fully noncommercial ; it neither offers for sale nor even links to advertising for any actual goods or services . "
Even if there was some sort of infringement liability , De Beers should target Schweppes , not Joker.com , McSherry continued .
Joker.com is also protected by a section of the Communications Decency Act , which protects Internet intermediaries from the actions of their customers , she wrote .
Fifty protesters with anti-aviation climate change activist group Plane Stupid have chained themselves together near the runway at Stansted airport .
The group aims to draw attention to the CO2 emissions attributed to air travel , claiming each flight from the airport emits an average of 41.58 tons of CO2 .
[ social_buttons ]
Flights have been delayed while police deal with the situation and four protesters have already been arrested .
The group chose Stansted airport because the government recently approved a massive expansion project which will increase the number of passengers from 25 million to 35 million by adding 23,000 commercial flights a year .
“ We ’re here because our parents ’ generation has failed us and it ’s now down to young people to stop climate change by whatever peaceful means we have left , ” one anonymous activist told the BBC .
“ We ’re afraid of what the police might do to us , we ’re afraid of going to jail but nothing scares us as much as the threat of runaway climate change . ”
All true , but what should truly frighten people is how easy the activists gained access to the runway .
One told reporters that all it took was a pair of bolt cutters .

( CNN ) -- Archaeologists in Russia have discovered an " extraordinary " group of Stone Age artworks which appear to have been carefully buried in pits and covered with mammoth bones , researchers announced this week in a paper published in the academic journal , Antiquity .
Archaeologists uncovered this Stone Age figure -- seen here from four angles -- buried in pits in Russia .
At least some of the 21,000 - 22,000 - year - old objects appear to have been regarded as magical , the scientists surmise .
The collection includes the only example of engravings of images found to date at the site -- what appear to be three overlapping mammoths only a few centimeters long and carved onto the rib of a mammoth .
" The main lines of the image are clear , not ragged ; they were made by confident , unbroken movements , " Hizri Amirkhanov and Sergey Lev write .
The carving may have been part of a hunting ritual , Amirkhanov and Lev told CNN .
The objects they describe in their new paper " show an extraordinary repertoire of incised carving on mammoth ivory plaques and carving in the round , including representations of women and large mammals , and geometric decoration on bone utensils , " they write .
Do n't Miss Scientists map DNA of prehistoric animal
They also uncovered two female figures , including one 16.6 centimeters tall with a head they call particularly accurate in shape .
The figures , which Amirkhanov and Lev called Venus statuettes , had been carefully placed in pits and surrounded with colored sand , Amirkhanov and Lev said .
The archaeologists uncovered the objects in 2005 at a site called Zaraysk , which was discovered in 1980 .
The site is about 100 miles southeast of Moscow .
Researchers have been excavating the site since 1995 , and have found a necklace made of teeth of the arctic fox and a carving of a bison made from mammoth ivory .
Zaraysk is the northernmost known location for a style of Stone Age artwork called Kostenski - Avdeevo after two other Russian locations where art of that type has been found .
Amirkhanov and Lev said the Zaraysk site was on a par with Kostenski and Avdeevo " in terms of the splendor and variety of its art . "
The site dates from the Upper Paleolithic period , which began about 40,000 years ago and lasted until roughly 10,000 years ago .
Amirkhanov and Lev's article , " New Finds of Art Objects from the Upper Palaeolithic Site of Zaraysk , Russia , " is to be published in the December issue of the magazine Antiquities , a York , England - based journal that describes itself as a quarterly review of world archaeology .
A version of their article appeared on the journal 's website on Monday ; the print version is due out soon , reviews editor Madeleine Hummler said .
The researchers are associated with the Institute of Archeology of the Russian Academy of Sciences .

Advertisement Lessons about personal , social and health matters including sex and relationships will be compulsory in all England 's schools from ages five to 16 .
But the government is setting up a review of how best to achieve this , saying there are " complicated issues " .
Schools Minister Jim Knight said this would factor in the ethos of schools , pupils ' needs and parents ' values .
A BBC poll of more than 1,000 people found two thirds would support sex lessons from the age of 11 .
Reviews of education about sex and relationships and about drugs and alcohol were ordered after ministers said teaching was " patchy " .
What they have not yet given is the detail of what compulsory personal , social and health education ( PSHE ) will involve , to allow local flexibility .
We are not suggesting that five and six - year - olds should be taught sex
Jim Knight , Schools Minister
What the review said Are better lessons the key ?
The Department for Children , Schools and Families said the review of sex lessons had identified " a need to challenge the perception that sex and relationships education happened in a ' moral vacuum ' in schools and says that parents and schools can and should work together to decide how best topics should be taught . "
It said updated guidance would also be produced covering the content of the PSHE curriculum , based on the existing non-statutory programme .
Lessons should be " age appropriate " .
In primary schools , Sir Jim Rose would look at how PSHE should best be delivered as part of his ongoing review of the curriculum .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The new review of how to make PSHE compulsory will be led by a London head teacher , Sir Alasdair MacDonald .
Mr Knight told BBC
News : " We are not suggesting that five and six - year - olds should be taught sex .
" What we are saying is we need to improve in particular the relationship education , improve the moral framework and moral understanding around which we then talk about sex later on in a child 's education . "
' Brilliant '
He said what schools would have to follow would be a high - level " programme of study " .
But it would still be up to schools to decide what to teach .
" Faith groups for example will want to produce supplementary guidance on top of our guidance , in order to say to their own schools ... how they should then deliver that programme of study in a way that 's sympathetic to their moral beliefs , their faith beliefs in those schools . "
The Catholic Education Service for England and Wales said it supported the priority given to establishing a " values context " for all sex and relationships teaching , the recognition of the importance of the role of parents , and the clear expectation that lessons would be shaped by Catholic teaching .
The chief executive of the sexual health charity Brook , Simon Blake , said the news that PSHE was to be a statutory part of the national curriculum was " absolutely brilliant " .
He added : " Now , at last , we can put the systems in place to give teachers and others the training and support they need to work effectively in partnership with children , young people and their parents . "
BBC / NOP POLL 87 % say sex and relationship lessons should be compulsory 36 % say no lessons on contraception before 13 Poll results [ 87KB ]
Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here The head of the Association of School and College Leaders ( ASCL ) , John Dunford , has written to the government complaining that secondary schools have only just begun implementing major changes to the curriculum including highly regarded but non-statutory material on PSHE .
" In ASCL 's view it would be extremely detrimental to make PSHE compulsory or to change the revised secondary curriculum orders in any way at this point , " he wrote .
It was not just a subject on the timetable .
" It is part of the ethos of the school , helping to develop the young person in ways that schools deem most appropriate to their circumstances .
" It should not be the subject to further central prescription and certainly not compulsion . "
Consultation
The sex education teaching requirements placed on schools at present are limited .
In primary schools , sex education is covered as part of the science curriculum .
This tells children about the main body parts and explains that reproduction is one of the life processes common to all animals including humans .
In secondary school , again mainly through science lessons , children cover the human reproductive cycle , including adolescence , fertilisation and foetal development .
HAVE YOUR SAY
A child given a frank education on sex and relationships may be more likely to have sex , but they are also more likely to approach it in a mature manner , with regards to pregnancy and STDs .
James , Belfast
They may also learn - though there is no statutory requirement that they should - about relationship skills , rights and responsibilities and different types of relationships , contraception , pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections and risky behaviours .
In Wales , sex and relationship education is already part of the curriculum and it is a legal requirement in Northern Ireland .
There is no legal requirement in Scotland .
The UK Youth Parliament says four out of 10 young people say they received no relationship education at school .
Earlier this year , figures were released showing that the number of abortions performed in the UK on girls under 16 had risen by 10 % in 2007 .
A UK - wide poll commissioned by the BBC from NOP found that the majority of those questioned believed sex and relationship lessons should be compulsory in schools .
Of those , 64 % believed lessons should not start until children are at least 11 years old .
Just over a third ( 36 % ) said they did not think children should learn about contraception until they were at least 13 .

Everyone is getting onto Facebook these days — even Nigerian scammers .
The social networking site is falling victim lately to Nigerian scammers weaseling their way into registered users ' accounts and then spamming their friends with requests for money .
While the Facebook crowd tends to be younger and more Internet - savvy than most , the new tactic could be dangerous , as it makes users believe that the requests are coming from their own peers .
One example that has come to light recently is from Karina Wells of Sydney , Australia .
She told the Sydney Morning Herald that she received a message on Facebook from a friend saying he was stranded in Nigeria and needed to borrow $ 500 for a ticket home .
For most people , it would n't take much to try and help out a friend in need ( assuming you had the funds ) .
However , Wells hesitated because her " friend " had begun to use different language than she was used to — not to mention that people do n't just randomly get stranded in Nigeria ? — and avoided turning into a victim .
Wells was smart , and many of us like to think we would be , too , but there are sure to be throngs of other Facebook users who will try to reach out to a friend and end up getting scammed .
Why 's that ?
Because scammers exploiting social networking sites for their own nefarious purposes is n't a new phenomenon .
With social networking growing in popularity , it 's only natural that scammers would turn their attention to Facebook , MySpace , and their brethren .
It 's not uncommon to receive messages or comments on MySpace , for example , that seem to be from your " friends " but are actually links to spam , porn , and other third - party affiliates .
Scammers usually manage to gain access to people 's accounts using the same old phishing techniques used in e-mail — by tempting someone to click on a link to another site and handing over their login credentials .
Nigerian scams have been around a long time , and perpetrators have had little difficulty finding new , gullible targets .
Nigerian high commissioner Sunday Olu Agbi defends his country , insisting that fewer than 0.1 percent of Nigeria 's population is involved in 419 scams , going so far as to say that victims are just as greedy as the scammers .
Many users have been conditioned to treat the contents of their inboxes with extreme suspicion , which is a good thing .
What 's clear from the increasing amount of suspicious activity on the likes of Facebook is that users of social networking sites are going to need to be just as wary .
And if by some strange turn of events you find yourself stranded in Lagos , pick up a phone and do n't rely on Facebook or MySpace to raise funds for your flight home .
Proposition 8 protests in California have taken a nasty turn , with protesters moving on from targeting the Mormon Church , to blaming African Americans .
Recent reports indicated that African Americans voted 70 % yes on Proposition 8 .
From Rod McCullom via The Huffington Post
A number of Rod 2.0 and Jasmyne Cannick readers report being subjected to taunts , threats and racist abuse at last night ’s marriage equality rally in Los Angeles .
Geoffrey , a student at UCLA and regular Rod 2.0 reader , joined the massive protest outside the Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints in Westwood .
Geoffrey was called the n-word at least twice .
It was like being at a klan rally except the klansmen were wearing Abercrombie polos and Birkenstocks .
YOU NIGGER , one man shouted at men .
If your people want to call me a FAGGOT , I will call you a nigger .
Someone else said same thing to me on the next block near the temple …me and my friend were walking , he is also gay but Korean , and a young WeHo clone said after last night the niggers better not come to West Hollywood if they knew what was BEST for them .
Los Angeles resident and Rod 2.0 reader A. Ronald says he and his boyfriend , who are both black , were carrying NO ON PROP 8 signs and still subjected to racial abuse .
Three older men accosted my friend and shouted , “ Black people did this , I hope you people are happy ! ”
A young lesbian couple with mohawks and Obama buttons joined the shouting and said there were “ very disappointed with black people ” and “ how could we ” after the Obama victory .
This was stupid for them to single us out because we were carrying those blue NO ON PROP 8 signs !
I pointed that out and the one of the older men said it did n’t matter because “ most black people hated gays ” and he was “ wrong ” to think we had compassion .
That was the most insulting thing I had ever heard .
I guess he never thought we were gay .
While we may be able to sympathize with the cause of the protesters , resorting to racism is a step way too far , and may cause some to distance themselves from the anti-Proposition 8 campaign .
Most people might be quicker to associate electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) with torture rather than healing .
But since the 1980s , the practice has been quietly making a comeback .
The number of patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy has tripled to 100,000 a year , according to the National Mental Health Association .
ECT - more colloquially known as shock treatment - is now accepted by growing numbers of psychiatrists as the preferred treatment for major depression and mania for patients who can not take or do not respond to medicine .
The research on ECT boomed in the last decade .
Most recently , scientists have been able to calibrate the amount of current a patient needs so that treatments can be individualized ; one patient may require 10 times the amount of current as another before a seizure occurs .
Introduction
Electroconvulsive therapy is a medical treatment for severe mental illness ( especially severe depression ) in which a small , carefully controlled amount of electricity is introduced into the brain .
During an ECT treatment , doctors jolt the unconscious patient 's brain with an electrical charge , which triggers a grand mal seizure .
It is considered by many psychiatrists to be the most effective way to treat depression especially in patients who have n't responded to antidepressants .
When it was first introduced , many people were frightened simply because it was called " shock treatment . "
Many assumed that the procedure would be painful ; others thought it was a form of fatal electric shock , and still others believed it would cause brain damage .
Unfortunately , unfavorable publicity in newspapers , magazines , and movies added to these fears .
Indeed , in those early years , patients and families were rarely educated by doctors and nurses regarding this or other forms of psychiatric treatment .
In addition , no anesthesia or muscle relaxants were used .
As a result , patients had violent seizures .
The way these treatments are given today is very different from the procedures used in the past .
Currently , ECT is offered on both an inpatient and outpatient basis .
Hospitals have specially equipped rooms with oxygen , suction , and cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( an emergency medical procedure for a victim of cardiac arrest or , in some circumstances , respiratory arrest ) in order to deal with the rare emergency .
ECT investigating the chemical basis of depression
The most compelling research is using ECT to investigate the chemical basis of depression .
In 1984 , National Institute of Mental Health ( N.I.M.H. ) researchers began to measure patients ' body fluids before and after receiving a course of ECT to determine the levels of three neurotransmitter systems - serotonin , norepinephrine and dopamine - that have been associated with major depression .
Neurotransmitters are molecules in the brain that carry electrical messages and affect how information is communicated , processed and stored .
Norepinephrine and serotonin affect mood , appetite and sleep patterns ; dopamine coordinates movement , controls some hormonal release and , when properly balanced , keeps thoughts and feelings grounded in reality .
The results of the research showed that whereas drugs strongly affect the norepinephrine and serotonin systems and do virtually nothing to dopamine , ECT has almost no effect on the first two systems and a striking influence on the third .
In spite of all this , ECT has been a hot topic for debates over medical ethics .
The central dispute revolves around the risks of brain damage and memory loss .
Critics of ECT , primarily former patients , say that no matter how much the procedure is modified and how carefully it is prescribed , it still causes irreversible brain damage and long - term memory loss .
Why is shock therapy given ?
The purpose of ECT is to provide relief from the signs and symptoms of mental illnesses such as severe depression , mania , and schizophrenia .
ECT is indicated when patients need rapid improvement because they are suicidal , self - injurious , refuse to eat or drink , cannot or will not take medication as prescribed , or present some other danger to themselves .
Risks associated with ECT
Advanced medical technology has substantially reduced the complications associated with ECT .
These include slow heart beat ( bradycardia ) , rapid heart beat ( tachycardia ) , memory loss , and confusion .
Persons at high risk for ECT include those with recent heart attack , uncontrolled blood pressure , brain tumors , and previous spinal injuries .
A crucial treatment — or brain damage ?
Though most studies have found that ECT is effective for severe depression and several other conditions , opponents claim that the mechanism through which E
CT changes mental state is nothing more than the destruction of brain cells , and even proponents are unsure how it works .
Many patients who have had ECT claim it caused their mental state to improve ; many others think their ECT did more harm than good .
Critics warn that the cognitive side effects , such as memory loss , are too severe and that the fuzzy , foggy state of mind that ECT initially causes simply makes patients temporarily forget about their sadness .
According to them , nearly every ECT patient experiences confusion , inability to concentrate and short - term memory loss during the treatment .
Actually , the stigma pushes people away from it , and it pushes some psychiatrists away from even recommending ECT .
Psychiatrists readily admit that in the early days , ECT absolutely was a cruel procedure .
And because the treatment has lingered in the shadows of psychiatry for decades , many people still associate it with its sketchy past .
Violation of human rights with ECT
" Unhealthy " dependence on computers is prevalent even in countries like China and there do seem to be more hardcore cases of lonely individuals spending all their free time online at the expense of their careers and social lives .
At the Daxing clinic , these troubled teens are housed together , where they are subjected to hypnosis and even mild shock therapy in an attempt to rid them of their love of surfing .
Thus , they are given treatment against their will or knowledge and consent is mostly obtained from parents .
A Massachusetts school in New York used electric shocks as a punishment for bad behavior , to some of its most challenging special education students .
Many have severe types of dysfunction , including self - mutilation , head banging , eye gouging and biting , that can result from autism or mental retardation .
Critics of the school say that applying shock as a punishment is not widely supported by the scientific community .
Still , the parents defend use of shock therapy by saying that the shocks are making a difference in their children ’s lives as nothing else has .
Thus , shock therapy is a procedure that seriously violates human rights and legal rights when done against the will of a person .
Rights and Legislation WHO Resource Book on Mental Health , " specifically states , " ECT should be administered only after obtaining informed consent . "
Gamers , VoIP and video conference users beware .
The leading BitTorrent software authors have declared war on you - and any users wanting to wring high performance out of their networks .
A key design change in the P2P application promises to make the headaches faced by ISPs so far look like a party game .
So what 's happened , and why does it matter ?
Upset about Bell Canada ’s system for allocating bandwidth fairly among internet users , the developers of the uTorrent P2P application have decided to make the UDP protocol the default transport protocol for file transfers .
BitTorrent implementations have long used UDP to exchange tracker information – the addresses of the computers where files could be found – but the new release uses it in preference to TCP for the actual transfer of files .
The implications of this change are enormous .
As BitTorrent implementations follow uTorrent ’s lead – and they will , since uTorrent is owned by BitTorrent Inc , and is regarded as the canonical implementation – the burden of reducing network load during periods of congestion will shift to the remaining TCP uses , the most important of which are web browsing and video streaming .
By most estimates , P2P accounts for close to half of internet traffic today .
When this traffic is immune to congestion control , the remaining half will stumble along at roughly a quarter of the bandwidth it has available today : half the raw bandwidth , used with half efficiency , by 95 % of internet users .
Oops .
When your internet bandwidth is divided by four , you ’re going to notice .
Even the downloading fiends who haunt the message boards at Broadband Reports can see this , as several have noted :
Is bypassing TCP congestion control a good thing for the users of the network ?
Why should one persons [ sic ] non-interactive file sharing generating a dozen to a hundred streams be more important than my interactive VoIP call or gaming experience ?
Using it as a feature , maybe , but enabling this behavior by default is just wrong and will lead to continuing counter , counter measures and more justification for caps .
But this insight is n’t shared by downloaders in general , most of whom have a sense of entitlement where their etiquette gene should be .
What 's UDP and why does this matter ?
UDP was intended for real - time data transfers such as VoIP that typically move small amounts of data with a low tolerance for delay .
By most estimates , UDP traffic amounts to less than two per cent of all internet traffic .
Bulk data transfers are supposed to use TCP , in large part because it shoulders the burden of congestion control for the internet ’s end - to - end layer .
There ’s no doubt that P2P file transfers are the epitome of delay - tolerant , bulk data applications .
The internet is only a stable system because application developers are gentlemanly with regard to the amount of traffic they shove onto the network .
But it has n’t always been so .
The Silence of the Quandts : The history of a wealthy German family
A documentary film by Eric Friedler and Barbara Siebert
By Emma Bode and Brigitte Fehlau
29 November 2008
A remarkable film , The Silence of the Quandts , which won the Hans Joachim Friedrichs prize for television journalism , deals with the unscrupulous rise of one of Germany 's richest and most influential families .
The Quandts own 46.6 percent of the auto manufacturer BMW , have an estimated fortune of € 20 billion and are implicated in the crimes of Hitler 's Nazi regime .
Today , against the background of a financial and economic crisis that evokes the events of the 1930s , the film is of particular relevance .
The Quandts owe their wealth directly to their support of the Nazi regime and the bloody exploitation in the concentration camps — something the family is unwillingly to discuss .
No family member has ever been indicted for the crimes that occurred in their company - owned concentration camps , nor has the family paid any compensation to the victims who survived .
The documentary , directed by Eric Friedler and Barbara Siebert , recounts the history of this family and the origins of their fabulous wealth .
The filmmakers undertook extensive research between 2002 to 2007 in various German and foreign archives , uncovering documents that would have provided sufficient grounds for an indictment at the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal for crimes against humanity .
Benjamin Ferencz , a lawyer and former prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials , who was shown all the documents , expresses his conviction that the evidence was sufficient for a prosecution and expresses his regret that the Quandts evaded punishment .
Today , the family lives largely out of the public gaze .
There are only a few pictures or film clips from the period after the end of the Second World War that show family members .
Statements or interviews were and are always refused ; even filming outside the Quandt family home is forcefully prevented by security personnel .
Johanna Quandt , the third wife of Herbert Quandt and today the matriarch of the business dynasty , is shown in just one picture at the beginning of the film , while the soundtrack tells how the Quandts would like to lead a life " like any normal family . "
Other family members , like their children Susanne Klatten or Stefan Quandt , declined to make any statement .
Only Herbert Quandt 's son Sven was willing to be interviewed for the documentary .
Sven Quandt makes clear that he wastes no time thinking about the origins of his wealth , stressing that " the past should finally be laid to rest " ; that would also be better for Germany , he says .
He sold his shares in battery maker Varta some years ago and has since spent his time pursuing his expensive hobby as a racing driver in the " Paris - Dakar Rally . "
T he ascent of the Quandts
As the son of a cloth manufacturer , Günther Quandt became wealthy during the First World War through the production of uniforms .
He used the inter - war years to acquire , on favourable terms , industrial companies that had become bankrupt due to the economic crisis and massive inflation .
In this way , he became active in other fields of business .
His main form of manufacturing soon concentrated on the production of batteries at the AFA Battery Works in Hanover and Hagen ( today : Varta ) .
Günther Quandt was quick to seize the profitable opportunities presented by the rise of the Nazis .
He gave generous donations to the fascists and joined Hitler 's National Socialists ( NSDAP ) in 1933 .
He maintained close and also private relations with prominent Nazis .
Following her divorce from Quandt in 1931 , his second wife Magda married the future Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels , who also adopted her son , Harald Quandt .
Günther Quandt rose under the Nazis to become one of the biggest arms tycoons .
His batteries were a significant component in numerous military vehicles and weapons .
The AFA works supplied the main batteries for submarines and the long - range V2 rocket during the war .
Other industrial companies that belonged to the Quandts included DWM ( German Weapons and Munitions Factory ) .
In 1937 , Günther Quandt was appointed the " War Economy Führer . "
His son Herbert ( 1910 - 1982 ) from his first marriage became a director of personnel in his father 's company .
In 1943 , and with direct support from the SS , the Quandts were able to establish a company - owned concentration camp directly alongside their battery works in Hanover .
KZ ( Concentration Camp )
Hanover , a satellite of KZ Neuengamme , exploited the labour of both Jews and resistance fighters , as well as forced labour from France and Czechoslovakia .
Prisoners from the KZ Neuengamme were selected for hard labour at the Quandt battery works .
The film features a surviving former forced labourer from Denmark , who was sent to the camp along with 41 fellow members of the Danish resistance .
For the first time since his incarceration , he walks on the site of the former factory , now overgrown with grass , and looks for any familiar remnants .
With tears in his eyes he tells of the lethal work involved in the production of batteries , which most of his comrades did not survive .
No protective clothing was provided , and they were exposed to poisonous gases produced by heavy metals such as lead and cadmium .
Immediately on arrival they were told that they would not survive longer than six months .
The filmmakers refer to internal calculations of Quandt , which assumed a monthly " turnover " of 80 people , i.e. , that 80 people would die each month .
Battery production also took place in a factory in Berlin Schöneweide , where women from KZ Ravensbrück were used .
A former Greek prisoner from Thessaloniki is also interviewed , who recounted how prisoners received no drinking water in the factory , had to drink from toilet basins and were subjected to whippings .
D e-Nazification
At the end of the war , the allied forces organised the prosecution of industrial barons such as Flick , Krupp and the directors of the IG Farben chemicals conglomerate — which had produced the Zyklon B gas used in the gas chambers — at the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal for crimes against humanity and enslavement .
A number of the industrial bosses were sentenced to several years ' detention and the confiscation of their fortune .
However , Günther Quandt succeeded in evading legal action .
First , he went underground in Bavaria for one year , until the Americans interned him for two years in 1946 .
Quandt employed abstruse arguments to present himself as a victim of the Nazis .
The elderly sister of Magda Goebbels , whom the film shows in an old people 's home , relates mockingly that at the time Günther Quandt had complained : " I now have a fortune of only 78 million dollars . "
The old woman has difficulty speaking , but what she says about Quandt leaves no doubt about his true attitude towards the Nazis .
Some of his battery factories lay inside the British zone of occupation .
There his son , Herbert , lost no time tendering his services to the new masters , and began producing batteries for British weapons systems .
Although he was considered to have " political baggage , " the British occupiers offered him protection and just a few weeks after the Nazis surrendered in May 1945 , he was one of the first to be awarded an operating permit by the British .
According to US prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz , Herbert kept quiet about the explosive evidence that could have led to an indictment .
In the end , Günther Quandt was classified merely as a " fellow traveller " and was set free .
Asked why the Americans did not bring Quandt before the War Crimes Tribunal , Ferencz , was evasive : Quandt was lucky , he was " at the right place at the right time " and evaded justice .
The Quandts ' biographer , Rüdiger Jungbluth ( The Quandts : Their Silent Rise to Germany 's Most Powerful Economic Dynasty , Campus , Frankfurt 2002 ) , questions this view .
" On July 18 1946 he was arrested on the orders of the US military government and interned for one and a half years in Camp Moosberg .
The Americans had him and they could have placed him before the courts . "
( R. Jungbluth in Die Zeit November 15 , 2007 )
Moreover , the Quandts DWM works , where forced labour was exploited under the worst conditions , was situated in Karlsruhe and thus fell inside the American zone .
Also , it was American and not British troops who liberated Hanover and begun investigating the concentration camps .
The real reason why Quandt was never indicted as a war criminal is that " resumption of production was soon given priority over the desire to thoroughly purge the business elite ....
From 1947 onwards the Nuremberg trials of industrialists assumed above all a symbolic character . "
The industrialists Krupp and Flick , who had been condemned in Nuremberg , soon returned to their old positions at the beginning of the 1950s .
T he Quandts today
After the death of Günther Quandt in 1954 , the capital belonging to Quandt Holding was divided equally between the two sons Herbert and Harald ( who had been adopted by Goebbels ) .
In 1959 , the Quandt family acquired a majority shareholding in the Bavarian Motor Works ( BMW ) .
It was only in their position as principal shareholders of BMW that they , like many other large German concerns joined the " Stiftung Zwangsarbeit , Verantwortung und Wiedergutmachung " ( Forced Labour , Responsibility and Recompense Foundation ) and made a financial contribution in compensation .
In the film , a Danish concentration camp survivor reports how he and other survivors had asked the Quandt family in 1972 for financial support because of the damage to their health , but were coldly rejected .
The Quandt family has prevented the erection of a monument to the forced labourers on the now derelict site on which KZ Stöcken had stood .
According to Forbes magazine , members of the Quandt family ( Susanne Klatten and Stefan Quandt ) are among the 100 richest Germans today .
They benefit from shareholdings in BMW , the pharmaceutical factory Altana , smart card manufacturer Gemplus AG , the Delton group , the Datacard Group , Varta and IWKA AG , Heel GmbH , which manufactures homeopathic remedies , and Thiel Media GmbH .
Behind their mask of discretion and reclusiveness the family also pulls many political strings .
A Wikipedia entry approved by the Quandt family notes that since 2002 they have donated about € 1.5 million to various political parties .
The largest donations went to the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) , and a smaller share to its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union ( CSU ) and to the liberal Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) .
If one includes donations made by BMW ( approximately € 1.5 million ) and Altana ( approximately € 1.1 million ) , then the family ranks among the biggest single donors to these parties .
No wonder that they were gladly received as guests at a recent gala event by the Hesse state premier and right wing CDU politician Roland Koch .
Several times , the film shows clips of this gala at which Koch pays his respects to his financial backers .
The Silence of the Quandts is highly recommended .
It vividly portrays the continuity between layers of the current German economic elite and the period of National Socialist dictatorship .
A desire to rule the world may be a good thing if you 're over 60 and worried about losing your mental faculties .
A new study found that adults in their 60s and 70s can improve a number of cognitive functions by playing a strategic video game that rewards nation - building and territorial expansion .
This is the first such study of older adults , and it is the first to find such pronounced effects on cognitive skills not directly related to the skills learned in the video game , said University of Illinois psychology professor Arthur Kramer , an author on the study .
The research appears this month in the journal Psychology & Aging .
Decades of laboratory studies designed to improve specific cognitive skills , such as short - term memory , have found again and again that trainees improve almost exclusively on the tasks they perform in the lab – and only under laboratory conditions , Kramer said .
" When you train somebody on a task they tend to improve in that task , whatever it is , but it usually does n't transfer much beyond that skill or beyond the particular situation in which they learned it , " he said .
" And there are virtually no studies that examine whether there 's any transfer outside the lab to things people care about . "
Kramer and his colleagues wanted to know whether a more integrated training approach could go beyond the training environment to enhance the cognitive skills used in every day life .
Specifically , the researchers wondered whether interactive video games might benefit those cognitive functions that decline most with age .
" Older people tend to fare less well on things that are called executive control processes , " Kramer said .
" These include things like scheduling , planning , working memory , multitasking and dealing with ambiguity . "
After testing several video games , the researchers selected " Rise of Nations , " which gives gamers points for building cities and " wonders , " feeding and employing their people , maintaining an adequate military and expanding their territory .
" You need merchants .
You need an army to protect yourself and you have to make sure you 're spending some of your resources on education and food , " said postdoctoral researcher Chandramallika Basak , lead author on the study .
" This game stresses resource management and planning , which I think for older adults is important because many of them independently plan and manage their resources . "
The study included 40 older adults , half of whom received 23.5 hours of training in Rise of Nations .
The others , a comparison group , received no training in the game .
Both groups were assessed before , during and after the video game training on a variety of tests designed to measure executive control functions .
The tests included measures of their ability to switch between tasks , their short - term visual memory , their reasoning skills and their working memory , which is the ability to hold two or more pieces of information in memory and use the information as needed .
There were also tests of the subjects ' verbal recall , their ability to inhibit certain responses and their ability to identify an object that had been rotated to a greater or lesser degree from its original position .
The researchers found that training on the video game did improve the participants ' performance on a number of these tests .
As a group , the gamers became significantly better – and faster – at switching between tasks as compared to the comparison group .
Their working memory , as reflected in the tests , was also significantly improved .
Their reasoning ability was enhanced .
To a lesser extent , their short - term memory of visual cues was better than that of their peers , as was their ability to identify rotated objects .
The video game training had no effect on their ability to recall a list of words in order , their enumeration ability or their ability to inhibit certain responses , however .
There was a correlation between their performance on the game and their improvement on certain cognitive tests , Kramer said .
Those who did well in the game also improved the most on switching between tasks .
They also tended to do better on tests of working memory .
" In medical terminology , these would be dose - response effects , " Kramer said .
" The more drug – or in this case the more training on the video game – the more benefit . "
The findings are meaningful , Basak said , because they show that multi-dimensional training can affect many individual components of cognitive function .
" The fact that you 're training people in a molecule and finding transfer to atoms I think is very impressive , " she said .
" This is one mode in which older people can stay mentally fit , cognitively fit , " Kramer said .
" I 'm not suggesting , however , that it 's the only thing they should do . "
Other activities , in particular socializing , exercising and eating well , are also important to maintaining healthy cognitive function in later years , he said .

One of the greatest personalities in baseball history , Herb Score , passed away on Tuesday at the age of 75 .
Most casual baseball fans outside of Cleveland probably never heard of Score , especially if they were born after the 1950s .
If Score would have been able to play the length of a normal career , he would have no doubt been the talk of the league for years to come .
He was a hard throwing left hander who made his debut in 1955 with the Indians .
During that season , he ran away with the American League Rookie of the Year award and went 16 - 10 .
During just his second season in the league , he won 20 games and was named to the All - Star team .
He was such a talent that during the 1957 season , the Indians turned down an offer of one million dollars for Score .
His career was derailed , however , by a moment that happened on the field .
On May 7 , 1957 , Score was facing the New York Yankees when Gil McDougald hit a sharp line drive back to the pitchers mound .
The ball hit Score directly in the middle of his face , leaving him with a broken nose and a number of other broken bones in his face .
Many at the stadium that day thought Score might have died as he lay motionless on the pitcher ’s mound after the play .
Before the injury , Score was known for being the hardest throwing left hander in the game , but he could never get that form back after that fatal day .
Many experts have claimed that if Score would have stayed healthy for his entire career , he would be at the top of this list of the best left handed pitchers ever to play the game with Sandy Koufax .
Although he did go on to play a few seasons after the injury , he finished his career in 1962 with an overall record of 55 - 46 .
He did receive other accolades later in life as he was named one of the 100 greatest Indians of all time and was inducted to the Indians ’ Hall of Fame in 2006 .
Score was not out of work for long though as he signed on as the television voice of the Indians just two years later .
In 1968 , he would move to the Tribe ’s radio booth where he would stay until 1997 .
Many recent Tribe fans can better relate to the voice of Herb Score than his great pitching .
Score was the voice of the Tribe during a two and a half decade streak where they did n’t even make the playoffs .
While he sometimes stretched the truth to make the fans feel better about their pitiful team , he would always say whatever happened straight and to the point .
Score will no doubt be missed by those in the Indians community and all of those ears who will no longer be able to hear his subtle New York accent across the radio waves .
As a lifelong Northeast Ohioan , I have a strong connection with Mr. Score .
Although I never met the man in person , I heard his voice over the radio many nights during the heyday of the Tribe during the 1990s .
My father also grew up in Cleveland , and was a resident of the city during the years Score pitched for the Indians .
About five years ago , I gave my father an autographed Herb Score baseball for Christmas , which to this day , proudly sits on the family mantle place .
The last game Score ever called was the Indians 1997 World Series game seven loss to the Florida Marlins .
If the Tribe would have won the game , there would have been no better way to go out , but Score did n’t focus on that during his last minutes in the booth .
He simply thanked the Indians ’ fans for all of their support over the years and reassured the city that he had no regrets .
Sweet , simple and to the point .
Nothing could have been more telling of his career and relationship with the fans .
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers writes , per TPM :
Dear Mr. Chertoff :
I was startled to read in today 's Associated Press that a " federal law enforcement official " has leaked information about an immigration case involving a relative of Senator Obama .
Even more troubling , the AP reports that it could not " could not establish whether anyone at a political level in the Bush administration or in the McCain campaign had been involved , " a very disturbing suggesting indeed .
This leak is deplorable and I urge you to take immediate action to investigate and discipline those responsible .
I note that this is not the first leak of law enforcement information apparently designed to influence the coming Presidential election -- in recent weeks law enforcement sources leaked information about an alleged investigation of a community services organization , a leak that the Department of Justice informs me is now under investigation by the Department 's Office of the Inspector General and Professional Responsibility .
Such leaks are deeply harmful to the political process , and the American people expect and deserve better from their government and its law enforcement agencies .
Sincerely ,
John Conyers , Jr.

Saddam Hussein's Luxury Yacht for Sale ( Photos )
Saddam Hussein's yacht
Saddam Hussein's luxury yacht , Ocean Breeze , is for sale after a dispute over ownership has been settled .
Iraq 's government spokesman Ali al Dabbagh issued a statement saying , " The cabinet has decided to sell the yacht of Saddam Hussein , docked in Nice ( France ) , and the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs were responsible for the transaction . "
The yacht was seized by French authorities in January after it docked in the Riviera city , and remained there while courts decided ownership .
A company part - owned by Jordan 's King Abdullah claimed to be the legal owner .
A yacht broker acting on behalf of the company tried to sell the Ocean Breeze for a reported $ 35 million .
The Iraqi government successfully blocked the sale until ownership was decided .
When Jordan renounced claims to ownership in July , it cleared the way for Iraq to sell it .
The yacht is fitted with swimming pools , salons , a secret passage and a rocket launching system .

Bush team defends raising terror alert
Clarke calls color - coded alert system a ' laughingstock '
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Bush administration officials used Sunday 's talk shows to defend last week 's heightened security alerts in three cities and to underscore the administration 's focus on terror threats .
" You have to go out and warn .
You have a duty to warn , " national security adviser Condoleezza Rice said on CNN's " Late Edition . "
The decision to raise the alert level to orange , or elevated , for specific buildings in New York City ; Newark , New Jersey ; and Washington , D.C. , has been criticized because it was based at least partly on information three or four years old .
Rice conceded that the surveillance of the buildings by al Qaeda operatives dates to before the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
" But the information that there were plots under way that might relate to the pre-election period came from multiple sources , and active multiple sources , " Rice said .
" It 's inconceivable to me that we would not have informed the Citigroup or the New York Stock Exchange or the World Bank that known terrorists have cased their buildings , " she said .
Rice said the Republican National Convention in New York is going to be " as best as we can make it , a very well - protected event , as was the Democratic convention . "
The Department of Homeland Security named both conventions national special security events , meaning the Secret Service will coordinate security .
The security budget for both events will total $ 100 million .
Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , who appeared on the same program , predicted that many New Yorkers would leave town during the August 30 - September 2 convention , but not necessarily because of heightened security and terror threats .
Many residents left the city during the Democratic convention in 1992 and " let the delegates sort of take over , " Giuliani said , noting that vacations and the end of summer would prompt many residents to leave .
" The [ security ] preparations here in New York are probably the best in the country , " Giuliani said .
" Life goes on , our politics have to go on .
And we can't let these politics stop us . "
Giuliani , too , defended the heightened alert , saying he took the warnings " very seriously . "
" It 's some of the most specific information that we 've had , not only about buildings but about method of attack , " he said .
" I think the warning has helped to make us even more alert . "
Retired Gen. Wesley Clark , former NATO supreme commander and one - time candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination , said the Bush administration " did the right thing , but they did it the wrong way . "
" When you raise the alert level , you 've got to do it in a way that you 're explaining and laying out as much as you can about why it is that you 're doing it , what you hope to achieve from it , " Clark said on " Late Edition . "
" The way the information dribbled out over time , it undercut the credibility of the system .
That 's the last thing we want , " he said .
Former White House counterterrorism coordinator Richard Clarke , speaking on ABC's " This Week , " said the Bush administration 's color - coded warning system is " a laughingstock " among state , local and business officials he has talked to .
" I 've talked to a lot of state directors of homeland security , state officials , mayors , heads of big companies , and they all say they do n't take it seriously , " Clarke said .
" They do n't get good information from [ Secretary ] Tom Ridge and the Homeland Security people .
There 's very bad communication , very bad messaging . "
Clarke said Ridge " is not a good spokesman for this issue .
When he says things like ' Here 's a warning , ' then in the next breath says the president is doing a great job , that just raises suspicions . "
White House homeland security adviser Frances Townsend , speaking on CBS 's " Face the Nation , " said it appeared the data about the financial sectors was part of al Qaeda 's plans to disrupt the U.S. election in November .
" While it 's not clear if this is the entire pre-election plan , this certainly looks like it was a piece of it , " she said .
Townsend also referred to threats against the Capitol building and certain members of Congress , but did not provide details .
The threats were " in the past and as part of this continuing threat stream , and so we shared that with them , " Townsend said , referring to members of Congress without naming them .
In a book released earlier this year , " Against All Enemies , " Clarke said the Bush administration failed to take terrorism seriously before the attacks of September 11 .
He praised recent U.S. intelligence efforts and the arrest of a suspected al Qaeda operative and computer expert in Pakistan , which was followed by other arrests .
" I think we have broken up an element of the [ terrorist ] plot of attacks against certain buildings in New York City , " Clarke said .
He said the week had produced " the best series of leads , leads going to other plots , leads going to other people , international cooperation -- I do n't think we 've seen this in five years . "
Miss Constitution had yellow curls that bounced down her back , wide blue eyes and a sweet if faltering singing voice .
She shimmied barefoot , donned a swimsuit in freezing temperatures and spoke plausibly about the responsibilities of the Russian state .
When her moment of glory came , Masha Fyodorova was draped in the Russian flag and handed the keys to a brand - new , pink - and - orange Mini Cooper .
She strolled off the stage in a shower of confetti and sparklers , an economics student from the provinces reborn as the official paragon of patriotic womanhood .
The gathering Friday of B - list pop stars and hundreds of die - hard pro-Kremlin youth activists on the edge of Red Square was beauty pageant as patriotic ceremony , emblematic of today ’s sexed - up , nationalistic Russia .
In between trilling traditional songs extolling the Moscow scenery and strutting in their bathing suits , the blond from Rostov - on - Don and three other nubile finalists paused to answer questions about authority , state obligations and the role of the elite .

“ Who is the only source of authority in the Russian Federation ? ” the announcer asked .
“ The multiethnic people of the Russian Federation ! ” one of the women fired back .
Organized by the government and the pro-Kremlin youth group Nashi , or Ours , the pageant was aimed at whipping up public enthusiasm for the constitution .
The 15th anniversary of the post -Soviet constitution has come at a sensitive moment , as President Dmitry Medvedev , backed by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , is pushing for the first - ever amendments .
Among other changes , the amendments would lengthen the presidential term to six years from four .
Putin , first as president and now as prime minister , has steadily centralized power and cracked down on freedoms .
Many analysts believe that the amendments , now just a formality from being passed , are designed to give Putin and his allies an even stronger hold on power .
They predict that Putin , who was forced from office by term limits this year , is laying the groundwork for a prolonged return to the presidency .

If so , no one here was complaining .
Putin is wildly popular among Russia ’s youths , who credit the former KGB agent with restoring their country to its rightful wealth and power .
“ These days all the youths are rallying around the authorities , ” said Isabela Berberian , a 20 - year - old chemistry student and Nashi member who rode an all - night bus to attend the beauty pageant .
A short girl with yellow hair and extensive eye makeup , she stood shivering in the front row of the crowd , eager to cast her vote for Miss Constitution .
“ Everything should be branded , ” she explained , nodding approvingly at the stage .
“ Youth groups have their brand , Nashi .
And now this will be a brand too , Miss Constitution . ”
These young people say they consider themselves “ Putin ’s generation . ”
They talk eagerly and earnestly about preserving Russian culture , fixing up monuments to the Great Patriotic War ( as World War II is known in Russia ) and diminishing Western influence .
But for all their patriotic fever , they are still college - age students , with requisite hormones and off - color humor .

“ I ’m looking for the ideal Russian woman , ” said Alexander Titarenko , an 18 - year - old management student .
He guffawed and added : “ I ’ll be voting for the most beautiful girl . ”
One by one , the four finalists burst forth on stage , stripped to skimpy dresses and gyrated with backup dancers .
American hip - hop poured from the speakers : “ Nasty girl , I want to do you all night long . ”
Pavel Astakhov , a high - profile lawyer and television anchor who sat as a judge , was visibly enthused .
“ They ’re remarkable , ” he told the crowd suggestively .
“ Exactly what the constitution should be : precise , elegant and with plenty of -- content . ”
Pop musicians and TV personalities clambered onto the stage to deliver lines like , “ Two hundred years ago we thought the constitution was the wife of the czar , and now we ’re celebrating this holiday . ”
Or , “ We ’d like to have a close relationship with the constitution .
Are you with me ? ”

A dance troupe performed a break - dancing number , titled “ I Love the Constitution , ” to the improbable accompaniment of the repeated lyrics , “ Sometimes I feel like I want to get away . ”
Soon , the women lined up like schoolgirls for a quiz , interrupting one another to shout out their answers .
“ What is the highest form of expression of the authority of the people ? ” the announcer asked .
“ Uh , ” the dimpled brunet from Moscow hesitated .
“ Can I call a friend ? ”

She could not .
“ People can organize demonstrations and strikes , ” she said , fumbling for words .
“ They can go to the corresponding organs of the state --"
“ Elections and referendums ! ” the other contestants interrupted .
The announcer moved on .

“ Now , the whole world is in financial crisis .
Can Russia use the financial crisis to strengthen its international position ? ”
Certainly , the contestants replied .
“ Russia can do all ! ” one of them crowed .
“ The ruble is strengthening .
Our love for life is getting stronger . ”
The announcer chuckled .
Everybody in Russia has been watching worriedly as the ruble has slumped , along with employment and public confidence .

“ We have four optimists on the stage who believe the ruble is getting stronger ! ” he said .
The women kept smiling .
“ Clap for us ! ” a redhead from Moscow exhorted the crowd .
“ We are so cold up here . ”
The crowd applauded .
Pink ballot boxes moved among the audience members .
At the beauty pageant , at least , the voice of the people would be heard .

In Denmark , Stein Bagger ’s spectacular fall from technology golden boy to alleged scam artist and international fugitive has captivated many of the country ’s 5 million residents .
His purported fraud , said to be as high as $ 170 million , is the biggest scandal in 20 years .
But when Bagger , 41 , strode into the Los Angeles police station near skid row on Saturday morning , officers wondered whether he was delusional .
“ I am Stein Bagger , ” the man said , putting his hands on the counter .
“ I ’m a fugitive from Europe and I ’m here to turn myself in . ”
Skeptical officers took the lean , 6 - foot man back for questioning .

“ We ’ve had several people come in and tell us they were the king of Denmark , ” explained Officer Jack Richter .
But as Bagger leaned across a desk , the sleeve of his black Armani jacket crept up to reveal a Rolex watch .
A computer search turned up an Interpol warrant for his arrest on charges of counterfeiting , forgery and fraud , according to the LAPD .
Bagger was turned over to federal authorities Saturday night and held at the Metropolitan Detention Center .
Until his flamboyant appearance in downtown Los Angeles , Bagger had last been seen on Nov. 27 in Dubai , United Arab Emirates , where he was vacationing with his wife and daughter .

At the time , he was on top of the world .
Bagger , chief executive of Copenhagen - based IT Factory , had recently been named Danish Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young after leading the previously crumbling computer company into what seemed to be an incredible turnaround .
The Danish press reported that IT Factory had doubled its revenue and profit for each of its last three fiscal years .
The company was reportedly due to announce a $ 53.6 - million profit and had co-sponsored a successful Danish cycling team in the Tour de France .
Bagger had allegedly taken a conference call the day he vanished .
Worried , his wife contacted authorities .
Officials inside and outside the company launched an investigation .
Within days , it was revealed that more than 90 % of the company ’s revenue was based on fraud .
They found a secret office in a nearby hotel .

The company had allegedly created dummy contracts for computers and software from fake companies , then sold those leasing contracts to banks and other investors .
Bagger allegedly forged the signature of the company ’s chairman to avoid board scrutiny .
IT Factory filed for bankruptcy last week , and its employees were being questioned by Danish economic crime detectives .
Ernst &
Young has rescinded its award .
The company ’s website was replaced with a short letter in Danish and English , explaining that the company was in bankruptcy and supplying the trustee ’s contact information .
“ We ask the public to appreciate that the employees of IT Factory . . . are subject to the general rules of secrecy , ” it reads .

The request is likely intended for Danish news and technology media outlets , which have been fascinated with the case .
Among the sensational tidbits was a report that Bagger hired an American actress to impersonate an official of “ Stanford Technical University ” when challenged on his resume , according to Ulrik Haagerup , head of news for DR , the Danish Broadcasting Corp .
The charismatic Bagger was also said to have ties to Hells Angels members in Denmark , who were implicated in a brutal attack on a supposed associate before Bagger left for Dubai .
Bagger told the LAPD that he flew from Dubai to New York , arriving Nov. 28 .
There , he said , he borrowed a friend ’s credit card and Audi sports car and drove to Los Angeles .
He checked into the Best Western in Hollywood on Friday night .
On Saturday , he decided to turn himself in and punched “ police ” into the Audi ’s navigation system .
The device led him from Hollywood to the LAPD ’s Central Division station in downtown Los Angeles -- listed alphabetically , it was the first to come up .

He walked into the police station about 11 a.m. , the picture of European class , wearing jeans , the $ 3,000 casual jacket and $ 65,000 gold watch and carrying a backpack .
Bagger told police that he had been the victim of a scam , but he also revealed that he was an international fugitive .
“ You never know who ’s going to walk through the door , ’ said LAPD Lt. Paul Vernon , head of detectives for the central division .
“ Today we got the millionaire next door -- the only question is , Whose millions does he have ? “

The flicking of a light switch rarely elicits excitement , but a Boulder company is trying to bring back the thrill of lighting with a new bulb that uses no energy and has some people saying “ that ’s the coolest thing I ’ve ever seen . ”
American Environmental Products this month debuted the After - Lite , a compact fluorescent lamp that can shine light without any electricity or battery power .
An attachment clipped to the top of the fluorescent bulb ’s spiral contains an advanced photoluminescent , or a refined phosphorous product .
This attachment , like the minerals within it , absorbs , retains and gradually releases light photons and only needs to be charged with natural or artificial light .
When used , a dark room suddenly glows green , illuminated by American Environmental Products ’ new bulbs .
“ It ’s kind of like a glow - in - the - dark key chain , ” said Charles Bolta , inventor of the After - Lite technology and president of American Environmental Products .
After - Lite , the first consumer product of its kind , can serve as a child ’s night light , lantern or just a safety light as it glows throughout the night .
The bulbs cost $ 19.95 apiece and are available at www.After-Lite.com.
The bulbs last at least 8,000 hours , but “ will decay out through the night , ” Bolta said .
The After - Lite will glow the greenest and the brightest within the first hour of darkness , but there will still be what he calls an “ after glow ” into the morning .
This allows people to wander in the dark without struggling for safety .
In fact , After - Lite can be unscrewed from its light source and continues to glow so it can be used as an emergency lantern .
“ The biggest impact of this light will be areas of bad power and areas that have a great use for emergency response , ” Bolta said .
These bulbs will meet safety needs , Bolta said , and at the same time , inspire others .
He has seen young boys and girls take the bulbs out of lamps as they watched them glow with amazement .
Julie High of Boulder said her 10 - year - old daughter loves the bulb in her room .
“ I think that she likes that she has been able to go to sleep , it ’s not like there ’s a light glaring , ” said High .
“ I think she gets a kick out of the fact that it glows green a little bit . ”
Not only that , but other engineers might build on this technology and make it even better , Bolta said .
“ That ’s part of what our intent is — to spark the imagination . ”
Just one election cycle ago , the Democratic Party hung its godless head , beaten into submission by the religious right and a small group of Democratic activists .
Democrats , the mythology went , were anti-religion or , at best , clumsy when talking to religious people .
The religious right embraced that myth and sought to reinforce it , to cement its own monopoly on the newly - minted electoral prize of the “ values voter . ”
The Democratic activists , many of whom were evangelical and resented both being lumped in with the religious right and feeling ignored by the Democrats , sought to remedy what they believed to be a persistently losing campaign strategy by refashioning how their party did religion .
No longer , proclaimed one member of Congress at a fundraiser for the Christian political action committee the Matthew 25 Network this summer .
No longer do Democrats look down at their shoes when they talk about their faith .
The Making of the “ Religious Industrial Complex ”
Eyes aimed upward , the loudly faithful Democrats have achieved a lot in four short years .
The party launched a Faith in Action initiative and hosted , for the first time , a faith caucus at its convention .
Under the leadership of then - Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California , the House Democratic caucus organized a Democratic Faith Working Group , which meets regularly with religious constituencies to craft policy .
Operatives and advocates sprang up to offer advice on how to win over religious voters .
Amy Sullivan , an editor at Time magazine , published The Party Faithful , both a castigation of Democratic elites for allegedly failing to understand or connect with religious voters and a blueprint for electoral outreach .
Mara Vanderslice , the former director ( and critic ) of John Kerry ’s religious outreach opened Common Good Strategies to advise Democratic candidates on faith outreach , before founding the Matthew 25 Network , which supported Barack Obama .
Burns Strider , the Pelosi aide who helped launch the Faith Working Group , went on to become the religious outreach strategist for Hillary Clinton ’s presidential campaign and runs his own consulting firm , the Eleison Group .
In 2007 , Religion News Service named him , Sullivan , and Vanderslice among the “ twelve most influential Democrats in the nation on faith and values politics and issues . ”
While the Democrats have come a long way in four years , Strider said , those efforts cannot match decades of organizing .
“ We ’re going to see continued ‘ bringing into the fold ’ faith organizing within campaigns and within the party , ” he told an audience at the National Press Club last month .
In the think tank world , the liberal Center for American Progress set up a Faith and Progressive Policy Initiative , which for a time housed what later became the nonprofit Faith in Public Life ( FIPL ) .
With former Democratic party staffer Katie Paris leading its media outreach , FIPL is in the forefront of those shaping the media narrative about the new religious landscape : religious voters are no longer shackled to a “ narrow agenda ” of abortion and gay marriage , and are voting on a “ broader agenda , ” including poverty , the environment , and global HIV / AIDS .
The Take Back America conference , the annual policy confab sponsored by the progressive think tank Campaign for America ’s Future , began regularly featuring a faith in public life panel , often showcasing the political talent that had lambasted the Democrats for allegedly ignoring them .
By 2008 , the constellation of organizations and initiatives that had cropped up inside the Beltway began cultivating the public personae of a new generation of religious leaders .
Pastor Dan Schultz of the Street Prophets blog calls this constellation the “ religious industrial complex . ”
Within this constellation , many believe , is the new generation of “ broader agenda ” religious leaders who hold the key to electoral success : swing Catholic voters , weekly churchgoers , and evangelicals .
Still , despite post-election cheerleading from FIPL and others that Democrats had narrowed the “ God gap , ” it is not at all clear from polling data that the new “ faith - friendly ” Democrats were responsible or whether it was simply the longing of the electorate as a whole for , well , change .
As Mark Silk , director of the Leonard E. Greenberg Center for the Study of Religion in Public Life at Trinity College , wrote on his blog , the bump in support for Democrats among frequent , and less - frequent , church attenders dated back to the 2006 midterms and has remained steady ever since .
In other words , both groups trended Democratic in a period when the popularity of George W. Bush and his party had plummeted .
The frequent church attenders and the heretics could have been reacting to the same Obama quality : his facility for framing morally complex issues in an ecumenically spiritual way .
Who ’s to say that the frequent churchgoers responded to “ God - talk ” or religious outreach , as opposed to the candidate ’s way of speaking which so clearly distinguished him from the hairsplitting , technocratic Kerry , whose defeat was frequently blamed on a reluctance to talk about his Catholicism ?
Regardless of the unproven electoral benefits of Democrats flaunting faith , all these efforts have had another outcome : elevating the profiles of a “ new generation ” of “ centrist ” religious leaders .
Is the Religious Left Getting Left Behind by the Beltway Constellation ?
We live , of course , in the age of the celebrity preacher .
In this world there is no better measure of a man of God than his book sales and pew attendance .
When I ’ve asked insiders like Strider or Jennifer Butler , FIPL ’s executive director , who the prominent figures in new face of religious America are ( and , moreover , in the wake of Obama ’s election , who will get their phone calls returned from the White House ) certain names keep cropping up .
Pastor Rick Warren , who sees no daylight between his views and James Dobson ’s , but who , according to Sullivan ’s book , former - DNC - chair Terry McAuliffe blasphemously did n’t know ; Jim Wallis , best - selling author and activist who lambasts the religious right for its petty intolerance and the left for “ not getting it ” ; and Joel Hunter , the Florida megachurch pastor who infamously turned down a stint as the president of the Christian Coalition , and author of A New Kind of Conservative .
FIPL has taken a lead role in promoting the “ broader agenda ” of some of these evangelical leaders .
No longer interested in fighting the so - called “ culture wars , ” these leaders say they will de-emphasize their opposition to abortion or gay marriage and work to alleviate the suffering of HIV / AIDS in Africa ( Warren ) , combat poverty ( Wallis ) , and fight global warming ( Hunter ) .
Obama has embraced these leaders , too , praying with Hunter on election night , visiting Warren ’s church and praising him , and making pivotal appearances at events with Wallis .
Yet , while these leaders have taken on issues outside of abortion and gay marriage — not a new development , incidentally , for mission - oriented evangelicals — and claim to tamp down the divisive rhetoric on those issues , each remains wedded to core religious right beliefs .
Warren and Hunter supported the same - sex marriage bans on the ballot this year in their respective states ( California and Florida ) .
Warren has argued that homosexuality disproves evolution and has compared pro-choice advocates to Holocaust deniers .
Although Wallis has been at the forefront of promoting the “ abortion reduction ” agenda as “ common ground ” he says everyone can agree on , he remains opposed to reproductive choice .
By rejecting the so - called “ culture wars , ” the “ broader agenda ” evangelicals and their Democratic allies imply that there is something inherently unseemly about advocating for reproductive or LGBT rights .
The American Prospect ’s Ann Friedman has rejected the use of the term “ culture war ” as a descriptor for the quest for LGBT equality because “ the very act of invoking the term ‘ culture war ’ signals that we think something is controversial , when in fact , equal rights should be the furthest thing from it . ”
This is a secular viewpoint that is mirrored in progressive religious thinking .
“ Anytime someone calls them [ abortion and gay marriage ] hot button or wedge issues my back goes up , ” says the Rev. Debra Haffner , director of the Religious Institute on Sexual Morality , Justice , and Healing .
“ It sounds like , oh , yeah , we do n’t need to worry about women and gay people . ”
The Religious Left Groundswell
Haffner was critical of the choice of hosts for the presidential faith forums — one , held at Messiah College in April , was organized by FIPL , which pushed for Warren to hold the second at his church in August .
Haffner objected that Messiah College ’s
Web site directs students to “ reparative therapy ” to “ cure ” homosexuality , and posts other anti-gay materials , though by the time she brought her concerns to FIPL ’s attention , the forum was “ a done deal . ”
Haffner questions the choice of Messiah or Saddleback , Warren ’s church , for the presidential forums , in order to appeal to conservative white evangelicals .
“ Why not go to a Riverside Church or a St. John the Divine , or John Buchanan ’s big church in Chicago , or City of Hope in Dallas , which is a gay - friendly church , with seating for 4,000 ? ”
“ There ’s a tremendous need , ” Haffner added , “ to recognize that there are progressive religious leaders who stand and support sexual justice .
There is a tremendous need for somebody besides white men to represent the progressive religious voice . ”
Haffner ’s position is not without a groundswell of support in faith communities ; more than 2200 ordained clergy , for example , endorsed the Religious Institute ’s call for marriage equality , and more than 3000 religious leaders have endorsed the Religious Declaration on Sexual Morality , Justice , and Healing , which calls for comprehensive sexuality education , full inclusion of women and sexual minorities , and reproductive health and justice .
The religious left is still struggling to find an organizing and base - building model , while the center - right continues to dominate the conversation and capture the attention of politicians .
A new book , Dispatches from the Religious Left , edited by the journalist Frederick Clarkson , attempts to start the conversation — though by its own admission it ’s merely a start , not a blueprint .
Part of that start , of course , is debunking the notion that the centrist evangelicals represent a religious left .
In his essay , “ Who ’s God ?
Faith , Democracy , and the Making of an Authentic Religious Left , ” the Rev. Osagyefo Uhuru Sekou , an associate minister at Middle Collegiate Church in Manhattan , critiques the idea that Wallis represents the religious left or even the prophetic tradition of social justice :
Despite his popularity , Wallis and his Sojourners / Call to Renewal organization do not engage or take seriously the discourse of those it claims to serve — i.e. the poor — a discourse which is best embodied by the radical tradition of African - American religion .
Wallis ’ inability to claim the radical politics of the prophetic tradition serves to undermine the stated mission of his working , thereby limiting his capacity to articulate the development of an authentic Religious Left .
Indeed , Wallis publicly argues against the organization of a Religious Left , arguing instead for a “ moral center . ”
Wallis ,
Sekou told me recently , is “ not Machiavellian , but he ’s situational .
He emerges at a moment when a right - of - center religious discourse has more salience . ”
Rather than focus on reaching out a helping hand to the poor and lecturing them about personal responsibility , Sekou envisions a religious left organizing model to “ create a space whereby the poor can speak for themselves , ” which sounds like Obama ’s earlier work as a community organizer .
As a politician , Sekou says , Obama “ is catering to this [ right - of - center discourse ] and putting it in progressive drag … if his agenda does not lift up the masses of the people , his presidency will prove to be ornamental and betray the prophetic tradition that elected him . ”
Sekou says a religious left “ wo n’t emerge out of beltway think tanks but on the ground . ”
Such a movement would be , as Dan Schultz puts it in his essay in Dispatches from the Religious Left , “ damnably disruptive . ”
Clarkson adds that , “ indeed , the prophetic voice is not necessarily ‘ on message ’ or a ‘ team player . ’”
But declining to be a team player for a political party is one thing , and having a team to field is another .
As Sekou put it , “ shut up and organize ! ”

In our home state of Ohio , third party candidates must register as a write - in candidate with the State before being allowed to be voted for as presidential candidates .
( Kind of defeats the purpose of a write - in , does n’t it ? )
Ron Paul , who was running under the Republican Party , is not on that list .
But in the state of Montana , Ron Paul is on the ballot as a third - party candidate under the Constitution Party – and Ron Paul Revolution signs still abound .
In fact , on Highway 93 , there are almost more Ron Paul signs than those for his Republican opponent , John McCain .
And in the polls , Paul is still drawing 4 % in MT .
Supporters say Paul could draw as much as 8 to 10 percent of the vote there .
It ’s a wild card … and we love it !

Newswise —
In research that could mitigate the spread of Lyme disease , Kansas State University entomologists are looking for answers in tick saliva .
Yoonseong Park , associate professor of entomology at K - State , is working with Ladislav Simo , a research associate , to understand what controls the salivary gland system in black - legged ticks .
" My research program has focused on how the tick 's neurological system is connected to the salivary system , " Park said .
" We have identified neuropeptides involved in controlling salivary gland activity . "
Working in collaboration with K - State 's Functional Genomics Consortium , Park and Simo have used the group 's MALDI - TOF machine .
Park said it is one of the most modern protein analysis machines available , and with it they have identified a number of neuropeptides for the first time .
Understanding these neuropepties could help mitigate the spread of Lyme disease , Park said .
Also called deer ticks , black - legged ticks spread Lyme disease .
Park said it affects between 250,000 and 350,000 people in the United States each year and also is a big problem in Europe .
The bacteria that cause Lyme disease are transmitted through the tick 's saliva when it is feeding on a host .
A tick 's meal lasts about a week , Park said .
During that time , neuropeptides control the salivary gland to keep the feeding process going .
That means secreting anticoagulants to make the host 's blood drinkable and secreting anti-immunoglobulins that inhibit the host 's ability to resist the tick .
Park said that the tick 's salivary system is continually adjusting these secretions as needed .
The salivary system also plays a role in helping the tick survive when a host is n't available .
Park said the tick uses its salivary gland to control the suction of water out of the atmosphere .
" Eventually , our study can be a tool for disrupting the disease transmission , " Park said .
" We might be able to inhibit the tick 's salivary secretion mechanism . "
He said that his research with Simo also will help scientists who are trying to understand such mechanisms in other tick species , like the species that spreads Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever .
Park said that his lab at K - State is one of few labs in the country studying the neuropeptides ' role in the salivary system .
Their research will be published in an upcoming issue of Cell and Tissue Research .
Park and Simo also are collaborating with Purdue University researchers who are sequencing the black - legged tick 's genome .
Park said that they have identified the genes responsible for encoding the neuropeptides .
Their research is being done with support from K - State 's Center of Biomedical Research Excellence .
Funded by the National Institutes of Health , the center provides resources to junior basic researchers and clinician - scientists at K - State and across Kansas .
Park 's previous research through the center involved investigating the excretion processes in Anopheles gambaie , the mosquito that spreads malaria .
Update 12:25 p.m. ET
Oct. 8 : The incoming rock exploded in the atmosphere , as expected , and was recorded by an infrasound array in Kenya .
As of this time , no images have been reported , owing to the remote location of the objects 's path .
Peter Brown at the University of Western Ontario estimated , based on the infrasound data , that the asteroid exploded at 0243 UT with an energy of somewhere between 1.1 and 2.1 kilotons of TNT .
The story below remains as originally published :
A very small asteroid will streak into the skies over Sudan tonight , astronomers announced .
It is expected to burn up in the atmosphere , creating a show .
It will not strike Earth .
But astronomers are abuzz over the event , because it is the first time an asteroid " impact " has been predicted with near certainty .
The space rock is only about 6 feet in diameter ( 3 meters ) and poses " no risk to those on the ground , " said David Morrison of NASA 's Ames Research Center .
A similar - sized object during the day would likely go unnoticed , he said .
The fiery entry will appear like a very bright shooting star known as a fireball , or what astronomers call a bolide .
" A typical meteor comes from an object the size of a grain of sand , " explained Gareth Williams of the Minor Planet Center .
" This meteor will be a real humdinger in comparison ! "
The object , named 8TA9D69 , was discovered by an ongoing survey at Mt. Lemmon run by the University of Arizona .
The entry will occur at 10:46 p.m. ET ( 0246 UT ) on Oct. 7 over northern Sudan , according to Steve Chesley of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
It is expected to be visible from eastern Africa traveling rapidly across the sky from northeast to southwest .
" We 're eager for observations from astronomers near the asteroid 's approach path .
We really hope that someone will manage to photograph it , " Williams said .
Based on 26 optical observations , " the probability of impact is between 99.8 percent and 100 percent , " said Andrea Milani of the University of Pisa .
" In practice the impact can be considered sure and is for tonight . "
Milani continued : " The effect of this atmospheric impact will be the release , in either a single shot or maybe a sequence of explosions , of about 1 kiloton of energy .
This means that the damage on the ground is expected to be zero . "
SHANGHAI  Chinese regulators said Friday that they were widening their investigation into contaminated food amid growing signs that the toxic industrial chemical melamine has leached into the nation ’s animal feed supplies , posing health risks to consumers throughout the world .
The announcement came after food safety tests earlier this week found that eggs produced in three provinces in China were contaminated with melamine , which is blamed for causing kidney stones and renal failure in infants .
The tests have led to recalls of eggs and to consumer warnings .
The reports are another serious blow to China ’s agriculture industry , which is already struggling to cope with its worst food - safety scandal in decades after melamine - tainted milk supplies sickened over 50,000 children , caused at least four deaths and led to global recalls of goods produced with Chinese dairy products earlier this fall .
The milk crisis is fueling worldwide concerns about food from China .
In Hong Kong , food safety officials announced this week that they would begin testing a broader variety of foods for melamine , including vegetables , flour and meat products .
On the mainland , Shanghai and other cities are moving aggressively to test a wide variety of food products for melamine , including fish and livestock feed , according to the state - run news media , which in recent days has carried multiple reports on melamine in animal feed .
We have had 50b reasons to figure out how a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœPonziÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ scheme works .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s incredulous that something could go undetected for so long .
Not doing oneÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s own due diligence unfortunately leads to one to getting burnt eventually .
This weekend , financial institutions from far a field lined up to declare their losses .
Greed has created this financial debacle and we are far from the bottom , there is never one Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœcockroachÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ in an infestation !
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 15 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in another Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœviolentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
The greenback remains under pressure as investors speculate that the Fed will lower interest rates this week and that the US will bail out the auto industry with funds meant to shore up financial institutions .
On Friday , prices paid to US producers fell more than forecasted last month , mostly due to a reduction in gas costs .
This is further evidence that the recession is cutting demand for fuel and keeping inflation contained .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s deflation that this market is worrying about .
The - 2.2 % drop followed the record - 2.8 % plunge in Oct.
Ex-food and energy , the index advanced +0.1 % m/m. Inflation concerns continue to diminish as worries about a prolonged global recession intensifies , this leads a clear path for another aggressive interest rate move by the Fed this week .
Fuel prices once again influenced the US consumer sentiment last month .
Other data showed that US Confidence unexpectedly improved from the lowest level in 28 - years , reflecting a record drop in gas prices that has given temporary relief to household budgets .
The UOM index jumped to +59.1 from +55.3 in Nov .
One should not expect this number to be sustainable in the short term , despite declining energy costs , rising unemployment , declining household wealth and fluctuations in the financial markets will continue to discourage spending , in the foreseeable future .
Does the index reflect stabilization ?
Too early to tell , headline unemployment will of course be the biggest influence and that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s only getting worse .
It was not too much of a surprise to see US retail sales decline for a record 5th consecutive month last week .
Once again the index was led by the slumps at auto dealers and service stations that overshadowed gains at electronic and department stores .
Despite beating analysts expectations ( - 1.6 % vs. - 1.8 % ) the loss of +1.3 m jobs in this quarter and an ailing property market certainly will not improve future sales figures over the coming months .
The US$ currently is lower against the EUR +0.61 % , GBP +0.54 % , CHF +0.28 % and JPY +0.86 % .
The commodity currencies are stronger this morning , CAD +0.69 % and AUD +0.47 % .
Last weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s fundamental data has been kind to the CAD dollar , despite the Political fiasco that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s taking place federally .
The loonie advanced vs. its southern neighbor as global equities and commodities rallied and the greenback remains under pressure across the board .
Last weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Canadian trade surplus narrowed to less than expected ( $ 3.8 b ) , as imports grew faster than exports .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s worth noting that the gain in imports was due to higher prices as the CAD dollar depreciated by - 12 % during the month ; import volumes declined - 0.8 % m/ m. Exports volumes , on the other hand , rose +0.5 % , this has provided some support to economic activity for the economy in Oct .
Another added bonus for the currency has be the weekly strength of the commodities .
Prices of commodities , which generate about half of CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s export revenue , have plummeted since the summer highs as a global recession has reduced demand .
Last week Governor Carney from the BOC delivered an unexpected Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœdeep interest rateÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ cut .
The market expected 50 bp , the economy warranted 75 bp and Carney pushed rates to a new 50 - year low of 1.5 % vs. 2.25 % .
In his communiquÃ ƒÂ© he signaled that more action may be needed as economic growth sputters in a Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœbroader and deeperÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ global slump .
This week we will have OPEC production cut decisions , perhaps this will once again provide support for the loonie short term .
With the general malaise of the greenback , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s difficult to want to own that currency in the short term .
On a cross related basis the loonie has faltered and traders continue to want to sell the CAD $ on strength .
The AUD found some O/N support as traders continue to speculate that the Fed will ease 50 bp tomorrow and by default provide some support for higher yielding currencies .
With global equities remaining in positive territory coupled with robust commodity prices had traders remaining better buyers on pull backs for the moment ( 0.6649 ) .
Crude is higher O/N ( $ 47.66 up +138c ) .
Crude prices had its strongest rally in over a month last week and the market remains on a firm footing ahead of OPEC meeting in Algeria this week , where itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s anticipated further production cuts are planned by the group .
Last week the Saudi oil minister said that the Kingdom had delivered the output cuts promised to OPEC ( last month ) .
The market has taken this as a sign that world supplies are smaller than traders believe .
The Kingdom pumped + 8.493 m barrels a day in Nov. , in line with its OPEC production quota of + 8.477 m barrels .
Oil has advanced +17 % , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the largest weekly gain in 10 - years .

The research confirmed that transsexuality was not a lifestyle decision , as some had suggested , said another team member , Trudy Kennedy , the director of the Monash Gender Dysphoria Clinic in Melbourne .
" People who come to our clinic describe how they knew they were different at a very early age , just three or four years old .
This is something that people are born with , " Dr Kennedy said .
The findings , which are published in the journal Biological Psychiatry , were good news , said Sally Goldner , 43 , who had an inner sense she was female from a young age , despite being a boy .
" Such compelling evidence dispelling the total myth of gender identity issues being a choice is always welcome , " she said .
The Australian and American team examined three sex hormone genes .
They found male - to - female transsexuals tended to have a longer version of the androgen receptor gene , which could reduce testosterone action .
" It is possible that a decrease in testosterone levels in the brain during development might result in incomplete masculinisation of the brain in male - to - female transsexuals , " Associate Professor Harley said .
But it was highly likely that other genetic factors were also involved in this form of transsexualism , he said .
The research was trying to solve the " fascinating " question of why people felt a particular gender was important , but it might also lead to practical benefits in future , if genetic tests could inform decisions about which sex children , born with ambiguous genitalia , should be raised .
Ms Goldner , a spokeswoman for TransGender Victoria , said she assumed she just had a vivid imagination as a child when she thought of herself as female .
It was not until she was 29 , after she had had a bad experience with a psychiatrist , that she was accurately informed about transsexualism by a different expert .
" It was incredible .
It was the first time I could remember waking up and feeling peace and calm in 20 years , " she said .
Juliet Richters , an associate professor in sexual health at the University of NSW , said much of the distress felt by transsexuals was caused by cruel treatment from others .
" A little more tolerance towards everyone who does n't conform to gender norms would be a good thing , " she said .

When you combine contraband , poverty , desperation and lots of spare time , you get the bizarre world of the smuggler .
Everything from cocaine to human beings is waiting to cross tight borders into lands where they 're not welcome .
And wherever you find them , you find an army of smugglers using every ounce of their creativity to get them through .
Also , it appears quite a few of them are insane .

7 Mini Subs Continue Reading Below Advertisement Smuggling drugs in completely safe and structurally sound factory - made vehicles is for cowards .
Real smugglers climb into leaky , rusty homemade submarines to bootleg their cocaine .
These things are n't just a couple of steel drums welded together , though .
They 've found subs in Colombia and Mexico big enough to carry up to 11 tons of drugs .
The cops seized a partially - built sub that had hydraulic tubing , a protected propeller , a double hull and the ability to dive below 300 feet .
It makes mom's attempts to smuggle opium in her wooden leg look sad by comparison .
Costing from a few hundred thousand to millions of dollars , the subs are usually crewed by small teams , have ranges of around 5,000 nautical miles and generally carry several hundred million dollars worth of drugs per trip .
If you 're wondering how you convince a drug mule to get inside one of those things , we 're guessing they figure that with 11 tons of drugs in there nobody will notice if , at the end of the trip , a little comes up missing .

" Missing cocaine ?
No , I 'm as shocked as you are . "
6 The Lady in the Dashboard Of course smuggling human beings across borders is a whole different ballgame .
After all , it 's not like you can just stuff a whole person in the glovebox .
We stand corrected .
A few years ago , customs officials at the US - Mexico border stopped a car and requested to see the registration .
Being trained in the fine arts of observations , officials noticed something suspicious : a fully grown , 135 lb woman jammed in the dashboard , looking out through the glove box .

Another passenger was sitting in the seat and the entire car was hoping today was the day customs officials were holding their annual " Bring A Retard To Work Day . "
Elsewhere in the universe , some people have attempted to smuggle humans -- specifically a woman and her 3 year old daughter -- in the gas tank of a Dodge Caravan .
If you 've never been in a gas tank of a Dodge Caravan you may be surprised to learn it 's exactly as uncomfortable as it sounds , which is to say : still better than public transit .

Fed considers issuing its own debt : WSJ
By Simon Kennedy Last update : 6:16 a.m. EST Dec. 10 , 2008
LONDON ( MarketWatch ) --
The Federal Reserve is mulling issuing its own debt for the first time in a move that would give it more flexibility to stabilize financial markets , The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday , citing a person familiar with the matter .
Government debt issuance is largely the job of the Treasury Department , but Fed officials are looking for new tools as the crisis drags on and have approached Congress about the idea , the Journal reported .
It added the concept could include issuing bills or some other form of debt , but it is n't known whether the preliminary discussions will result in a formal proposal or Fed action .
The Journal said one roadblock is that the Federal Reserve Act does n't explicitly permit the Fed to issue notes beyond currency .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Five security guards from Blackwater Worldwide have been indicted on charges related to a 2007 shooting in which 17 Iraqis were killed in a Baghdad square , two sources said Friday .
An Iraqi woman looks at a blood - stained car of two women killed in the 2007 Nusoor Square shooting .
A sixth security guard is in plea negotiations , the sources told CNN .
The exact charges handed up by a federal grand jury were not revealed .
The sources requested anonymity because the indictment remains under court seal .
It is expected to be made public by Justice Department officials as early as Monday .
The Justice Department had no comment on the development , and defense attorneys for the men could not be reached for reaction .
The State Department , which employed Blackwater to protect U.S. diplomats and other employees , also had no comment .
Blackwater said it would n't comment until there 's an official announcement .
Iraqi authorities accused Blackwater guards of killing 17 civilians and wounding nearly 30 in the September 2007 shootings in Nusoor Square in western Baghdad .
Blackwater said its guards were protecting a U.S. diplomatic convoy when they came under attack from armed insurgents .
The guards returned fire , Blackwater said .
But an Iraqi investigation called the killings " premeditated murder " and accused the guards of firing on civilians indiscriminately .
The first U.S. soldiers to arrive on the scene also told investigators they found no evidence the guards were fired upon , sources told CNN .
The complex legal case has been dogged by difficulties and may present a major challenge to federal prosecutors .
Among the potential problems is the uncertain limit of a law passed by Congress that prevents prosecution of military personnel or others working for the military and leaves open the question of those working for other U.S. government departments and agencies abroad .
The incident heightened tensions between U.S. and Iraqi government officials and contributed to a protracted debate over the extent of immunity that U.S. military personnel and civilian contractors have from Iraqi laws .
Security contractors have had immunity from Iraqi law under a provision put into place in the early days of the U.S. - led occupation of Iraq .
But starting next year , under a U.S. - Iraq security agreement that Iraq approved Thursday , Iraq will have the " primary right to exercise jurisdiction " over U.S. contractors and their employees .
The State Department renewed Blackwater 's contract this year over strong objections from the Iraqi government .

" You 've got to wonder what sort of people go and why .
Where is the moral code of behavior and how do you stop jealousies and fights ? "
Cairns Catholic Bishop James Foley said after Mr Fox 's announcement .
Tzipi Livni said Israel must react when it is fired upon
The two leading candidates to become Israel 's next prime minister have vowed if elected to topple the Palestinian Islamist movement , Hamas , in Gaza .
The threats by Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and Likud party leader Binyamin Netanyahu came after PM Ehud Olmert warned against making bold statements .
A six - month Egyptian - brokered truce between Israel and Hamas , which runs Gaza , came to an end on Friday .
On Sunday rockets fired by militants in Gaza hit a house in the town of Sderot .
No-one was injured in the attack , though a worker at a nearby farming community was hurt when another device landed in a field .
The Israeli military has said militants fired some 30 rockets and mortar bombs into Israel on Saturday .
A Palestinian militant was killed in an Israeli air strike .
' Proper response '
At the Israeli cabinet meeting on Sunday , the head of the country 's domestic security agency , Shin Bet , said that Hamas had increased the range of its rockets during the ceasefire and could now hit several southern Israeli cities .
Israel will know how to give the proper response at the right time in the right way , responsibly
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert Yuval Diskin said the rockets could now reach Kiryat Gat , Ashdod and even Beersheba , about 40 km ( 25 miles ) from Gaza .
He also told ministers that while Hamas had renewed its attacks , it was " interested in continuing the truce , but wants to improve its terms " .
" It wants us to lift the siege [ of Gaza ] , stop attacks , and extend the truce to include [ the West Bank ] , " Mr Diskin added .
Hamas blamed Israel for the end of the ceasefire on Friday , saying it had not respected its terms , including the lifting of the blockade under which little more than humanitarian aid has been allowed into Gaza .
Israel said it initially began a staged easing of the blockade , but this was halted when Hamas failed to fulfil what Israel says were agreed conditions , including ending all rocket fire and halting weapons smuggling .
Each side accuses the other of breaking the ceasefire Prime Minister Olmert said during the cabinet meeting that the government had agreed to the ceasefire with Hamas last June with little doubt or hesitation .
" Israel has always hoped for and wanted quiet for the residents of the South and that they should enjoy genuine calm and be free of the threat of unceasing Qassam and mortar attacks that have disrupted life in the South for a very long period , " he said .
Mr Olmert and Defence Minister Ehud Barak also warned the cabinet and opposition parties against making " bold statements " about plans for a major military operation in Gaza .
" A government does n't rush to battle , but does n't avoid it either , " Mr Olmert said .
" Israel will know how to give the proper response at the right time in the right way , responsibly . "
' Policy of attack '
Shortly afterwards , however , Ms Livni told a meeting of her Kadima party that she would topple Hamas if she became prime minister after the general election on 10 February .
Right now we have to go from passive response to active assault
Benjamin Netanyahu
Likud party
" The state of Israel , and a government under me , will make it a strategic objective to topple the Hamas regime in Gaza , " she said .
" The means for doing this should be military , economic and diplomatic .
" Israel must react when it is fired upon , must re-establish its force of dissuasion and stop the rockets , " she added .
" This is what has to be done and this is what I will do . "
Mr Netanyahu , whose right - wing Likud party is currently ahead in the polls , meanwhile called for a more " active policy of attack " , accusing the current government of being too " passive " .
" In the long - term , the toppling of the Hamas regime is inevitable , " he said while visiting Sderot on Sunday .
He said residents of southern Israeli towns close to the Gaza Strip were " paying a hefty price for the mistakes made by Livni and her ministers " since the Israeli withdrawal from the territory in 2005 .
Ismail Haniyeh , the head of the Hamas government in Gaza and former Palestinian prime minister , dismissed the Israeli threats .
" Nothing can finish off our people , " he said .
" It is not our people who are escalating the situation ; it is the Israeli occupation which should have stuck to the conditions of the truce . "
The BBC's Katya Adler in Jerusalem says the countdown to February 's election has started with the candidates eager to court an electorate fearful of the future .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has warned that a " major escalation of violence would have grave consequences for the protection of civilians in Israel and Gaza , the welfare of the Gazan civilian population , and the sustainability of political efforts " .

The carbon offset industry cannot agree on how much to charge for CO2 emissions , nor how much you produce when you fly , writes Fred Pearce
Flying somewhere this Christmas , or planning a ski trip ?
Arguably , given the carbon emissions involved , you just should n't .
But if you do , will you offset those flight emissions ?
Some people fuss that the offset companies are a green con .
How do we know the trees we pay for wo n't die ?
Are we just subsidising renewable energy projects that were going to happen anyway ?
Fair questions .
But questions for another day .
I have another problem .
Why does the price of offsetting vary so much ?
Are we being ripped off ?
Spend even a few minutes searching the internet offsetters and you will find two things .
First , the prices charged for offsetting every tonne of CO2 you emit vary hugely .
Second , the offsetters can't even agree on how great your emissions are for any particular flight .
Let 's start with ClimateCare , based in Oxford .
I have offset with them before , because I like the people and the projects .
For a return economy flight from Heathrow to JFK in New York , they reckon my emissions are 1.53 tonnes .
Earlier this week they wanted to charge me nearly £ 9 a tonne , making a total of £ 13.22 .
Type in your credit card details and it 's done .
Your money goes to fund some cooking stoves in Cambodia or wind turbines in Inner Mongolia .
But a more or less random sample of other offsetters this week provided me with some very different offers .
The London - based CarbonNeutral company and Carbonpassport in Glasgow both say my New York return journey emits just over 1.3 tonnes .
Terrapass in San Francisco puts it at just 0.84 tonnes .
While Atmosfair in Berlin suggests I will be responsible for 3.48 tonnes .
All are measuring the CO2 the same way ; all are assuming a regular economy flight .
The differences are baffling .
Then there is the price charged per tonne , which ranges from £ 17.50 at Carbonpassport to only half that with CarbonNeutral .
Put it all together , and Terrapass swears that I can offset my transatlantic hop with them for a measly $ 11.90 or £ 8.00 .
CarbonNeutral sound competitive at £ 11.90 .
But Atmosfairs wants € 81 , or £ 69.85 .
And my spot survey did n't find the full range .
A couple of weeks ago , Paul Hooper of Manchester Metropolitan University 's centre for air transport and the environment published his own study , conducted last winter , of more than 42 online offsetters .
He found a sixfold difference in the price charged per tonne of carbon emitted .
And , taking in the higher charges that some offsetting companies make for a bigger , business - or first - class seat , discovered price tags for a return trip from London to Sydney that ranged from £ 9.48 to a staggering £ 643.39 , almost a 70 - fold difference .
Now , if I was buying a laptop or something similar and got offered such a range of prices , I 'd probably just pay the least and send it back if it did n't work .
But with offsets , there is nothing to take out of the box .
At the end of the day , I have no real idea what exactly it is that I have bought .
And maybe it is ethically better to pay more .
The offsetters are all supposed to be good guys , doing their bit for the planet , after all .
The more money they get , the more they can help .
But maybe not .
So what 's going on ?
I 'm still not quite sure why some companies reckon they can absorb a tonne of carbon so much more cheaply than others .
I 'd welcome inside information on this from any companies not delivering .
But after a bit of pestering , I have established why they can't agree on the mileage .
There are a few technical things like how full you assume the plane is .
And maybe the odd discrepancy over flight routes and aircraft type .
New planes generally emit less .
But the big difference is a scientific disagreement .
It turns out that the companies with low emission estimates simply calculate how much carbon dioxide planes kick out of their engines per passenger - kilometre .
But the rest try to factor in other emissions from the engines that also add to the global warming .
Things like the contrails and the nitrous oxide emissions that do a bunch of different things to atmospheric chemistry that I wo n't go into here .
The problem is that factoring these in is complicated .
There is no single answer .
Some companies reckon these emissions double the global warming effect .
Some triple it .
Some go even higher .
This is because the answer depends on timescales .
If you mostly care about the short - term effects over the next decade or so , then these other gases are big players .
But if you have your ambitions set on protecting the climate for your grandchildren , then they will have long since gone , while the CO2 will still be hanging round in the atmosphere .
You would have thought the offsetting companies might have come up with some agreed rules about how to measure the overall global warming impact of greenhouse gases .
But they have n't .
Instead confusion reigns .
Once , we might have shaken our heads indulgently , thinking that at least they are encouraging us to cough up our cash for good projects that somewhere along the line will help clean up the atmosphere .
Maybe the details do n't matter too much .
After all , you would n't insist on personally checking the health of an Oxfam goat before giving that to your nearest and dearest for Christmas .
But in recent months , there has been a shake - down in the carbon offsetting business .
The start - ups are being taken over .
The enthusiasts in cardigans and riding bicycles are giving way to money men in sharp suits driving limos .
A few months ago my own favourite , ClimateCare , got gobbled up by Wall Street investment bank JPMorgan .
Call me prejudiced , but suddenly I do n't want to give them the benefit of the doubt any more .
Beth Ostrosky NYC Marathon Time 4:15:39 ( Photos )
cheered for his gorgeous wife , , as she participated in Sunday 's NYC Marathon .
The newlywed couple embraced after she crossed the finish line and he presented her with her race medal .
She was thrilled with her 4:15:39 time , having set a 5 hour goal prior to the race .
Running for her pet charity , North Shore Animal League , Ostrosky , 36 , had trained in earnest while also planning her October 3rd nuptials to the 54 year old radio shock jock .
After finishing the 26.2 mile journey she remarked : " This was the happiest day of my life . "
Sorry Howard - she probably meant to say one of the happiest .
Actually he was n't at all offended because he gushed , " Is n't she beautiful ? "
Stern told Newsday that he prepared her carb loaded breakfast of bagels stuffed with peanut butter and bananas .
" She ate a ton " , he said .
Ostrosky finished 17778 overall out of a field of 39000 .
Among women she was 4160 and in her age group she was 1564 .
Beth told a reporter after the race , " We 're going to celebrate with some sushi and some pasta .
A lot of sushi and pasta . "
When asked what kept her going during the grueling race , she said , " I just kept thinking about seeing Howard and Ashley on the finish line . "
Ashley is Howard 's 15 year old daughter from a previous marriage .

In a new study , most people willingly pulled a lever to deliver pain to others when instructed to do so , showing that little has changed in the near half - century since psychologist Stanley Milgram 's famous electric shock experiment .
Milgram 's experiment revealed our propensity to do harm when encouraged by authority , a topic of great interest in the post - World War II years .
A new iteration of the experiment ( with added precautions ) revealed that seven out of ten people will give painful electric shocks to another person as part of what they are told is a scientific investigation .
" What we found is validation of the same argument — if you put people into certain situations , they will act in surprising , and maybe often even disturbing , ways , " [ Reuters ]
says researcher Jerry Burger .
In the 1961 experiment , Yale University professor Milgram asked volunteers to deliver increasingly strong electric " shocks " to other people , who appeared to be test subjects but were really actors , if they answered certain questions incorrectly .
Milgram found that , after hearing an actor cry out in pain at 150 volts , 82.5 percent of participants continued administering shocks , most to the maximum 450 volts [ Reuters ] .
The results , now a fixture in psychology textbooks , suggested that people 's moral attitudes can be suppressed when they 're put in a situation of obedience .
Although no actual shocks were delivered and the sounds of agony came from a tape - recording , man
y of the volunteers suffered stress from the task and replication of the experiments was deemed unethical .
In the new study , to be published in American Psychologist , Burger replicated the gist of the original experiment but included measures to minimize the psychological stress on the test subjects , such as limiting the shocks to 150 volts and not letting them administer any further shocks even if they indicated their willingness .
The new participants were reminded repeatedly that they could stop at any time , while in Milgram 's version , participants were told , " The experiment requires that you go on , " if they expressed hesitation .
Again , however , the vast majority of the 29 men and 41 women taking part were willing to push the button knowing it would cause pain to another human .
Even when another actor entered the room and questioned what was happening , most were still prepared to continue [ BBC News ] .
About 70 percent continued the shocks up to 150 volts and were willing to go even higher .
" That was surprising and disappointing , " Burger said [ Reuters ] .
Burger believes his study demonstrates not only the power of blind obedience , but also that certain situations normalize immoral behavior .
In this case , the gradual incremental nature of the task — administering slightly more painful shocks each time — may have eased the shift from normal behavior , he suggests .
Burger cautions against any leap of judgment from laboratory studies to complex social behavior , but the findings do shed some light on the factors that contribute to genocide and torture .
Says Burger :
" People learning about Milgram 's work often wonder whether results would be any different today ... Many point to the lessons of the Holocaust and argue that there is greater societal awareness of the dangers of blind obedience .
But what I found is the same situational factors that affected obedience in Milgram 's experiments still operate today " [ Telegraph ] .

My brother - in - law recently bought a new car with the intention of taking it with him into the Rocky Mountains in a few years .
Worried about sub - zero temperatures , he looked into modifying his coolant / anti- freeze system and learned about a new trend in the automotive industry .
An increasing number of suppliers have begun marketing propylene glycol as an alternative to the widely used ethylene glycol because propylene glycol has a lower freezing point than its two - carbon sibling .
A savvy chemist should instinctively think “ freezing - point - depression , ” a staple of freshman general chemistry lectures .
Mathematically , it ’s identified by the following equation :
Wikipedia will inform you that freezing - point depression is a relation of the Clausius - Clapeyron equation and Raoult ’s law .
Personally , I have not found use for either of these equations , and I ’m not about to BS my way through the derivatives ( pchem was not my strong point as an undergrad ) .
Anyhow , the above equation tells us that a pure compound ’s freezing point will drop if you add another solvent to the solution .
For example , water typically freezes at 0 oC and propylene glycol freezes at 59 oC .
According to Sierra Anti-Freeze ’s literature , a 2/3 mixture ( by volume ) of propylene glycol and water will start to crystallize at - 4 oC , whereas a 3/ 2 mixture will begin crystallization at - 54 oC .
In fact , the change in water ’s freezing point is much larger with propylene glycol than with ethylene glycol .
Ethylene glycol is an interesting compound .
The majority of households know that anti-freeze ( i.e. ethylene glycol ) is highly toxic and that dogs like to drink it .
Upon ingestion mammals digest ethylene glycol by oxidizing it to oxalic acid ( among other compounds ) , which has been linked to kidney failure .
Ethylene glycol purportedly tastes sweet to humans and dogs , which has prompted manufactuers to begin adding a bittering agent .
C&EN covered the issue a couple years back and from what I ’ve recently read only Maine , Arizona , New Mexico , California and Oregon require bittering additives by law ; Wisconsin ’s right behind them .
For whatever it ’s worth , the bittering agent ( denatonium benzoate ) is sold commercially as Bitrex or Aversion and is added to products such as rat poisons to prevent human consumption .
By comparison , propylene glycol is generally regarded as a safe , non -toxic chemical .
If propylene glycol is safer and appears more advantageous than ethylene glycol , why does the auto industry use it ?
I could n’t find an answer .
I did learn that some automobile manufacturers will actually void your warranty if you do not use their “ approved ” anti-freeze ( usually ethylene glycol ) .
Perhaps this issue will be addressed by the Obama - appointed US car czar in January .

Another day , another ethics challenge for the Palin administration .
This one involves ( brace yourselves ) failure to disclose free gifts on her financial disclosure forms !
Does this sound familiar ?
If you answered “ no ” , I invite you to use the search feature located in the sidebar and type the words “ Ted Stevens ” .
You ’ll have enough reading material on the subject to keep you busy for a week .
ANCHORAGE , Alaska – Gov. Sarah Palin has added to her financial disclosure forms two free trips that she took nearly two years ago but failed to report .
Palin , who was Republican presidential candidate John McCain ’s running mate , made the disclosures last month , but after Election Day when she and McCain lost to Barack Obama and Joe Biden .
The trips were first revealed in a story by The Associated Press in October .
The free trips were taken in April and May of 2007 and should have been reported within 30 days under state ethics law .
The Nov. 17 disclosure forms note that the reports were “ not filed timely due to administrative error . ”
Bill McAllister , the governor ’s spokesman , said this week that the mistakes were made by travel support staff .
He said he could not explain the timing of when and how they were caught , but that it was irrelevant because the error was corrected .
Palin , who has criticized state lawmakers for gifts they take , is not facing any sanctions for the late filings , according to Linda Perez , state administrative director .
Perez said she was alerted to the matter by McCain ’s presidential campaign before the Oct. 14 AP story .
“ It was n’t necessarily the governor ’s oversight , nor was she trying to hide anything , ” Perez said .
“ It was a staff oversight . ”
In one of the trips , the James B. Hunt Jr. Institute of North Carolina — a nonprofit education policy group — paid the $ 2,827 cost of Palin ’s April 2007 flight and hotel in Scottsdale , Ariz. , to attend a four - day conference , according to her report .
The group has said it also paid for other governors attending the annual event in recent years .
In May 2007 , Palin accepted lodging for herself and her three daughters at Mt. Chilkoot Lodge in the Southeast Alaska town of Skagway .
The lodging , valued at $ 300 , was paid for by the owners , including Palin friend and former deputy campaign treasurer Kathy Hosford .
The reports were among recent disclosures released to the AP after a public records request .
Among other gifts Palin reported last month is a June 30 flight valued at $ 1,187.50 that was paid by the North Slope Borough for Palin and her 7 - year - old daughter , Piper , to attend various functions , including a whaling festival in the town of Barrow .
Palin and husband
Todd also received travel , food and lodging valued at $ 4,620.12 to attend a Republican Governors Association event in Texas , in April — gifts that were not reported until August , according to disclosure forms .
Palin and the other governors attending the event also received $ 1,000 Rocky Carroll cowboy boots .
So , in case you missed it , here ’s the timeline :
April 2007 – Trip #
1
May 2007 – Deadline for reporting Trip #
1
June 2007 – Trip # 2
July 2007 – Deadline for reporting Trip #
2
September or October 2008 – McCain post- nomination vetting process discovers violation .
October 14 , 2008 – Associated Press reports on the trips and Palin ’s failure to disclose them .
November 2008 – Palin amends her forms to include the gifts , and blames support staff .
And Bill McAllister , Alaska ’s own Dana Perrino , has assured us that none of this matters because once the Associated Press blew the lid off it , she went back and fixed it .
So , move along everyone , nothing to see here .
Fascinating .
So , does this mean when the IRS finds out you have n’t disclosed certain things on your tax forms , and you find out that they know , and then you go back with a bottle of white out , that means everything is OK ?
And I suppose , Mr. McAllister would say that if you rob a bank , and the police show up at your house , everything is OK as long as you give it back ?
Can we assume , then , that since Linda Perez tells us that Palin will not be facing sanctions that there is precedent for overlooking these little mistakes ?
Maybe others have been allowed to slide with nothing more than a “ tsk tsk ” from the overseeing financial watchdog agency APOC ( the Alaskan Public Offices Commission ) ?
In an interesting little piece of irony , Democratic Senator Elect Mark Begich recently got in to hot water for …. wait for it …. failure to properly fill out his financial disclosure forms .
A complaint was filed against him by the Republican Party , because … well … they can’t stand people who do n’t fill out their financial disclosure forms properly .
Mark Begich , the Democratic challenger for U.S. Senate , will pay a $ 1,420 fine for failing to properly fill out state financial disclosure forms , a campaign spokeswoman said Monday .
A Begich spokeswoman says he corrected all errors and will pay the fine that reflects $ 10 a day for each day the report was deemed incomplete . [ snip ]
“ We are pleased to have this matter over , ” said campaign spokeswoman Julie Hasquet .
“ We ’ll be paying the fine immediately . ” McHugh Pierre [ a spokesman for the Alaska Republican Party ] said in a statement that he was pleased with the outcome .
“ I am very happy that the commission is holding Mayor Begich accountable for his actions , ” Pierre said .
Yes , by all means , McHugh Pierre , APOC should hold people accountable for their actions .
Mark Begich did something wrong , APOC sanctioned him , he admitted it and immediately paid a fine of $ 10 a day .
So ( getting out calculator ) that means that give or take $ 100 … Sarah Palin owes about $ 8720 in fines according to my calculations .
Right ?
I mean , surely we ’re not going to fail to hold someone accountable for their actions , are we ??
So , why is state administrative director Linda Perez telling us that the Governor is facing no sanctions ?
Did she get this information from APOC ?
Did they decide to give her a free pass ?
Or is this a bit of wishful thinking on the part of the Governor ’s office ?
Is this a bit of Bill McAllister logic that says if you have a library book out past the due date and you accrue a big fine , that as long as you bring the book back , and as long as you are a Republican , you do n’t have to pay ?
I ’d be interested to find that out .
And in the meantime , Alaskans for Truth can add something else to their growing list of things for which to hold Sarah Palin accountable .

According to a British specialist in robotics , there is an urgent need in ethics guidelines to control the utilization of robots in caring for children and elderly people .
The case of Professor Noel Sharkey , of the Department of Computer Science , was published in latest issue of the journal " Science " .
The professor considers that the use of robots is constantly increasing , which may lead to unexpected risks and ethical issues .
Pr. Sharkey expressed special concerns over the influence of " personal care " robots on children and elderly , representing the most vulnerable groups within a society .
The expert stated that today there are about 14 companies that create child care robots in Japan and South Korea .
Pr. Sharkey is worried about the fact that the steady increase of such robots could " lead to neglect and social exclusion . "
He outlined that teddy bears become redundant among children , who choose robots and get attached to them .
Although , in short - term , robots may provide an entertaining experience for children , who are curious about the machines , in long - term children may get attached to robots , which may lead to psychological problems due to the lack of human contact .
The professor gave example of monkeys who were exposed to personal care robots .
They showed inability to deal with other monkey and thus were unable to breed .
According to Sharkey there are a lot of robots today that help elderly people .
One of them is " My Spoon " - a Japanese creation that automatically feeds elderly .
There is also a Japanese electric bathtub robot that washes and rinses older people automatically .
The expert is also concerned about the use of robots in military operations , and namely about the location and automatic destruction of targets without human interference .
" The ethical problems arise because no computational system can discriminate between combatants and innocents in a close - contact encounter , " outlines Sharkey .
In 2008 consumers acquired about 5.5 million robots .
Over the next two years , this number may double to 11.5 million .
" [ Robots ] are set to enter our lives in unprecedented numbers , " says Sharkey .
He fears that without ethical rules , set by international bodies , the control of robots will be left to busy parents , militaries and robot industry .
" It is best if we set up some ethical guidelines now before the mass deployment of robots rather than wait until they are in common use , " the scientist says .
He considers that it is crucial to take specific measures on an international level immediately .
It is worth mentioning that Sharkey studied robotics for over 30 years and for him the ethic rules are compatible with the increase of the number of robots , of which he is a great supporter .
He dismisses the theories about robots taking over the world , presented in " I , Robot " and " The Terminator , " considering that these stories will only remain fantasies .
" They are dumb machines with computers and sensors and do not think for themselves despite what science fiction tells us , " says Sharkey , adding that he is mostly concerned about the application of robots by people and not the machines themselves .
Research shows for the first time that a group - based psychological treatment , Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy ( MBCT ) , could be a viable alternative to prescription drugs for people suffering from long - term depression .
In a study , published December 1 , 2008 in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology , MBCT proved as effective as maintenance anti-depressants in preventing a relapse and more effective in enhancing peoples ' quality of life .
The study also showed MBCT to be as cost - effective as prescription drugs in helping people with a history of depression stay well in the longer - term .
The randomised control trial involved 123 people from urban and rural locations who had suffered repeat depressions and were referred to the trial by their GPs .
The participants were split randomly into two groups .
Half continued their on - going anti-depressant drug treatment and the rest participated in an MBCT course and were given the option of coming off anti-depressants .
Over the 15 months after the trial , 47 % of the group following the MBCT course experienced a relapse compared with 60 % of those continuing their normal treatment , including anti-depressant drugs .
In addition , the group on the MBCT programme reported a higher quality of life , in terms of their overall enjoyment of daily living and physical well - being .
The study was led by Professor Willem Kuyken at the Mood Disorders Centre , University of Exeter , in collaboration with colleagues at the Centre for Economics of Mental Health ( CEMH ) at the Institute of Psychiatry , King 's College London , Peninsula Medical School , Devon Primary Care Trust and the Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit .
Members of the study team from the Institute of Psychiatry , King 's College London also compared the cost of providing MBCT programmes with the cost of maintenance anti-depressant treatment .
The findings suggest that MBCT provides a cost - effective alternative to anti-depressant drugs .
Unlike most other psychological therapies , MBCT can be taught in groups by a single therapist , and patients then continue to practice the skills they have learned at home by themselves .
Therefore , MBCT is less costly than individual treatments and is not dependent on having the large number of trained therapists needed for one - to - one psychological treatments so could help the National Health Service shorten its waiting lists for psychological therapies .

During the eight - week trial , groups of between eight and fifteen people met with one therapist .
They learned a range of meditation exercises that they could continue to practice on their own once the course ended .
Many of the exercises were based on Buddhist meditation techniques and helped the individual take time to focus on the present , rather than dwelling on past events , or planning for future tasks .
The exercises worked in a different way for each person , but many reported greater acceptance of , and more control over , negative thoughts and feelings .
Professor Willem Kuyken of the University of Exeter said : " Anti-depressants are widely used by people who suffer from depression and that 's because they tend to work .
But , while they 're very effective in helping reduce the symptoms of depression , when people come off them they are particularly vulnerable to relapse .
MBCT takes a different approach – it teaches people skills for life .
What we have shown is that when people work at it , these skills for life help keep people well . "
Professor Kuyken continues : " Our results suggest MBCT may be a viable alternative for some of the 3.5 million people in the UK known to be suffering from this debilitating condition .
People who suffer depression have long asked for psychological approaches to help them recover in the long - term and MBCT is a very promising approach .
I think we have the basis for offering patients and GPs an alternative to long - term anti-depressant medication .
We are planning to conduct a larger trial to put these results to the test and to examine how MBCT works . "
MBCT was developed by a team of psychologists from Toronto ( Zindel Segal ) , Oxford ( Mark Williams ) and Cambridge ( John Teasdale ) in 2002 to help people who suffer repeated bouts of depression .
It focuses on targeting negative thinking and aims to help people who are very vulnerable to recurring depression stop depressed moods from spiralling out of control into a full episode of depression .
MBCT is becoming more widely available as part of psychological treatment services in the NHS .
The study was funded by the Medical Research Council .

Case studies
Case study 1 : Di
Di Cowan of Sampford Peverell , East Devon , has suffered from depression since he was in his late teens , though it was not diagnosed until much later .
Now 53 , he has been taking anti-depressant drugs for more than 15 years and has had no previous psychological treatment .
It is now two years since he completed the eight - week MBCT trial and Di practices the meditation techniques learned during the trial four or five times a week , for up to an hour each time .
He plans to continue doing this for the rest of his life .
Di explains how the techniques learned on the trial have helped him in his daily life : " It 's helped me immensely .
It 's given me the ability to come up against something that would have previously thrown me , think it through , come up with a solution and then move on .
It 's helped me deal with recurrent thoughts . "
Shortly after completing the trial , Di was diagnosed with bone cancer and had to undergo treatment , including a major spinal operation , which has left him less mobile than he was before .
Despite this set - back , he feels he is managing his depression using the techniques learned on the MBCT trial .
He says : " My view of the world has changed and I look at life in a new light .
I 'm much more cheerful and positive .
Other people noticed a change .
My friends and family were very quick to comment that I was showing an improvement . "
Di concludes : " It was very worthwhile and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has similar problems .
It 's a very sound way of combating mental illness and promoting mental health . "
Originally from Manchester , Di has lived in Devon for 28 years .
He is a retired Maths teacher and is married with two boys , aged 19 and 11 .
Case study 2 : Stephen
Stephen hopes that MBCT will be " the final piece in the jig - saw " in learning to cope with a tendency towards severe depression that he has suffered since his teens .
Now 56 , he experienced severe episodes between 2000 and 2002 , involving hospitalisation .
Having already tried a number of alternative therapies , and talking cures , as well as anti-depressant drugs , he finally agreed to try the mood - stabiliser , Lithium .
Soon afterwards , he embarked on a course of cognitive behavioural therapy , and it was via this route that he heard of MBCT .
" It was the right thing at the right time " , he says .
Sufficiently " stabilised " by Lithium , he was able to benefit fully from the techniques taught , which he now practices on a daily basis , some six years later .
The group context of MBCT was important for him .
Not only did participants share their individual experiences of depression , and find common ground in symptoms suffered and warning signs to heed , they also helped keep each other " on track " with the practical homework involved .
Stephen believes that , in addition to the group 's support , self - discipline helped him complete the eight week course and has been essential for him to continue regular practice at home .
He says : " Persistence and determination are necessary during the course and become even more vital when you 're on your own . "
Stephen , who lives in Exeter , is realistic enough to suspect that , without Lithium he could not have reaped the benefits of MBCT .
However , he says : " Mindfulness gave me added insight into the way I function and respond to people , and helped me become more accepting .
Along the way I have gained an understanding that , much of the time , life may not be as I would like it , but an awareness – particularly a body awareness – of such situations can lead to easier acceptance of them , and sometimes to beneficial change .
Maybe , one day , I 'll have gained sufficient insight not to need the Lithium any more " .

Combinations of ten of the world ’s most popular pesticides decimate amphibian populations even if the concentrations are within EPA safe limits for each chemical individually .
These supposedly safe low - dose cocktails kill 99 percent of leopard frog tadpoles .
One pesticide alone — endosulfan , a neurotoxin banned in several nations but still used extensively in US agriculture — killed 84 percent of the leopard frogs all on its own .
Obviously we ca n’t get a new EPA chief fast enough .
Biologist Rick Relyea at the U of Pittsburgh exposed gray tree frog and leopard frog tadpoles to small amounts of the 10 most widely used pesticides on Earth .
He chose five insecticides ( carbaryl , chlorpyrifos , diazinon , endosulfan , and malathion ) and five herbicides ( acetochlor , atrazine , glyphosate , metolachlor , and 2,4 - D ) .
He then administered : each of the pesticides alone , all the insecticides combined , a mix of the five herbicides , or all 10 of the poisons .
The findings published in Oecologia : A mixture of all 10 chemicals killed 99 percent of leopard frog tadpoles .
The insecticide - only mixture killed 99 percent of leopard frog tadpoles .
The herbicide mixture had no effect on the tadpoles .
When leopard frogs perished , gray tree frogs did not succumb and flourished in the absence of leopard frog competitors .
This study builds on a 9 - year effort by Relyea to understand links between the global amphibian decline , pesticide use , and the threat to humans .
Leopard frogs were once plentiful across North America but their population has declined in recent years as pollution and deforestation have increased .
Okay , here ’s one link : Humans get more populous and pudgy as frogs and forests decline .
Another study Relyea published in Ecological Applications last month reports that gradual amounts of malathion — the most popular insecticide in the US — too small to kill developing leopard frog tadpoles , instead sparked a biological chain of events that deprived them of their primary food source .
Consequently nearly half the tadpoles in the experiment failed to reach maturity and would have died in nature .
Relyea also published papers in 2005 suggesting the popular weed - killer Roundup® is extremely lethal to amphibians in concentrations currently found in the environment .
Relyea for EPA chief ?

Forty - five years ago today , An Unearthly Child aired on BBC , marking the beginning of an epic science fiction journey and a pop culture legend .
It ’s a little crazy to think that Doctor Who is still going strong after all these years ( thanks to being resurrected by RTD in 2005 ) .
In any case , I thought it deserved a passing mention !
The Underwire dug up this fantastic fan tribute on YouTube , created by Babelcolour .
Eight minutes , forty - five years , and 700 something episodes .
If you ’re a fan , you ’ll definitely get a kick out of this :
Is it really possible that President - elect Barack Obama intends to break his campaign promise to “ end the war ” in Iraq , and keep US troops in that country well beyond the sixteen month timetable for withdrawal he advocated during the campaign ?
The answer , according to the New York Times , is a fairly certain yes :
“ On the campaign trail , Senator Barack Obama offered a pledge that electrified and motivated his liberal base , vowing to “ end the war ” in Iraq .
“ But as he moves closer to the White House , President - elect Obama is making clearer than ever that tens of thousands of American troops will be left behind in Iraq , even if he can make good on his campaign promise to pull all combat forces out within 16 months .
“ ‘ I said that I would remove our combat troops from Iraq in 16 months , with the understanding that it might be necessary  likely to be necessary  to maintain a residual force to provide potential training , logistical support , to protect our civilians in Iraq , ’ Mr. Obama said this week as he introduced his national security team . ”
Tens of thousands  a prime target for terrorists , a “ residual force ” that , in any other context , would be seen as an army of occupation , and a reminder to the Iraqis that they still are n’t free of us , nor we of them .
That “ residual ” force , we are told , could number as high as 70,000 troops “ for a substantial time even beyond 2011 . ”
At a cost of billions , to be sure .
This is not “ ending ” the war .
The retention of Gates , the appointment of Hillary the Hawk , the “ team of rivals ” gambit that is supposed to inoculate Obama against criticism from the pro-war right  this pre-inaugural political drama is a dress rehearsal for betrayal .
Antiwar voters , who put Obama in office , are about to get screwed  and their alleged spokespersons , at least amongst the left - wing punditariat , are bending over with alacrity .
Somebody please tell Rachel Maddow to drop the “ quackitude , ” and reorient her own attitude  because she soon wo n’t have George W. Bush to kick around anymore .
The ball is in her court  and in Keith Olbermann ‘s , if he can only remember to take his meds .
My guess , however , is that they ’ll miss the basket by a mile .
After all , it looks like GE Capital  a division of General Electric , corporate parent of MSNBC  has got their bailout to the tune of untold billions .
Unlike the blue - collar types , like General Motors and the UAW , they did n’t have to come crawling to Congress , hat in hand , with a plan to show what they ’re going to do with the money .
It was payment for services rendered : thanks for your business , and please come again .
There ’s no accountability from this crowd .
Forget the pretentious rhetoric about “ inclusion , ” and the alleged sanctity of the “ democratic process . ”
The only kind of populism these folks understand is the kind that ’s packaged and sold by Madison Avenue , for the benefit of Wall Street .
From all the formerly outraged “ antiwar ” personalities in the media and politics , we hear nothing in response to Obama ’s preemptive betrayal  carried out before he even takes office  except a very loud and embarrassing silence .
Where is the ever - voluble Arianna Huffington ?
Busy choosing her wardrobe for the Inaugural Ball .
And Rachel ’s so focused on getting Susan into the inaugural after - party at the White House that such mundane matters as the continuing occupation of Iraq shrink into well - deserved insignificance .
As for Keith Olbermann , I hear he ’s demanding GE Capital ’s bailout check be made out directly to him .
After all , he ’s earned it  they ’ve all earned it .
It ’s been remarked before that Team Obama is a re-run of the Clinton administration , as far as appointments are concerned , but there ’s been less attention paid to what this actually means , stylistically : the return of the old Clintonian trick of redefining words to fit the circumstances .
Get ready for more lectures on what the true meaning of the word “ is ” is .
They ’re going to redefine us out of Iraq , whilst leaving the occupation intact , by re-labeling military personnel and “ changing the mission . ”
Since the mission is being reduced to specific tasks , like force protection , these will no longer be “ combat troops . ”
They ’ll be something else  but not , technically , an occupying force .
Or , at least , that is what MSNBC will no doubt be reporting as fact .
The moral slackness , the complete lack of perspective , and of course the boundless arrogance  it ’s all coming back to Washington .
So when did it ever leave ?
Well , then , expect a ratcheting up , at the very least , of all the worst aspects of the old Clinton administration , especially in the foreign policy realm .
These people have forgotten where they ’ve come from so quick that , in a few months , they ’ll be acting just like their predecessors : warlike , imperious , and ready to rumble .
As far as the future of American foreign policy is concerned , I have only three words to say : watch out , Pakistan !
So where is the left , anyway ?
Glenn Greenwald , among the best of the liberals , is AWOL on Obama ’s foreign policy sellout .
Sure , torture is bad , and it ’s very noble to be against it , I ’m sure , but what about the endless war that gives it a conceptual framework and legitimizes it in the name of “ national security ” ?
Where are the “ antiwar ” liberals ?
They ’re on their way to the Inauguration , and you ’ll have to pardon them if they slam the door of the limousine in our faces .
Okay , so what about the commies ?
As obnoxious and outright crazy as they can be , surely they are sufficiently sincere and consistent in their opposition to US imperialism to resist the lure of Obama - mania .
Well , not exactly because , you see , unfortunately , they do n’t make commies like they used to .
Take , for example , the softcore Communist party types who lord it over the main antiwar “ coalition , ” United for Peace and Justice .
These are old - style CPUSA types , whose subservience to the Democratic party is a matter of longstanding doctrine , and whose hopes for “ Popular Front ” with the incoming administration fit in quite well with the Obama - as - Roosevelt narrative the left is playing in their heads .
The war in Iraq ?
As they say in the Big Apple , fuggeddaboutit !
The Communist Party of Iraq supports the American occupation , and has from the beginning .
The endless “ withdrawal ” from Iraq can be glossed over in the name of getting out “ responsibly . ”
The war in Afghanistan ?
One hardly expects much sympathy , in these quarters , for a people that defeated the Soviet Union and arguably brought about its downfall .
As for Obama , in a statement on his election victory they take credit for his success :
“ For more than six years , United For Peace and Justice and the antiwar movement have stood firm in our opposition to the war in Iraq .
Our consistent work played a major role in turning public sentiment against the war , and that sentiment helped lay the foundation for the Obama campaign ’s success . ”
You ’ll note that there ’s no mention of Afghanistan , until much later , and then only in an ambiguous context .
After all , these people consider themselves part of the team 
Obama ’s team :
“ Obama has put forth the challenge and United For Peace and Justice is ready to meet that challenge as we work to change our nation ’s path from militarism and greed to peace and justice . ”
The real challenge these leftist appendages of the Obama administration face is explaining to their own supporters how and why we ’re still going to be in Iraq at the end of Obama ’s first term .
In the meantime , however , they can gush over their multiculti messiah and even take credit for his election  and forget about all those tiresome antiwar demonstrations .
I see they ’re holding a “ National Assembly ” soon , which is going to discuss their new strategic orientation : their last such document professed to “ stay alert ” to the threat of an expanded war in Afghanistan , as well as reiterating UFPJ ’s opposition to the occupation of Iraq .
But actions speak louder than words : where are the relatively large demonstrations of the Bush era ?
I see no indication of any such action anywhere , not even from the Marcyites , who made a profession out of mounting these marches .
However , they seem to have split into two factions , the most active of which is preoccupied with calling for a government “ bailout ” for “ workers ” , freeing Mumia , and calling for a National Day of Mourning on Thanksgiving  a public relations triumph in Bizarro World , from what I hear .
This loud silence from the ostensibly antiwar Left is all the more inexplicable given the fact that they ’re right : Obama does owe his election in large part to their efforts , which helped turn public opinion against the crazed foreign policy of the Bush White House .
From a raucous crowd that would n’t shut up , to a mobilization of Trappists  that ’s the current and very curious trajectory of the “ official ” antiwar movement in America .
The irony of this strange paralysis is that there never was a better time for them to get out the old placards , unfurl the banners , and take to the streets with their demands  after all , this is a President who listens to them , presumably .
I never understood the logic of demonstrating in front of the Bush White House : after all , that ’s the last place anybody would be sympathetic .
This , however , is a White House of a different color , so to speak .
Having taken credit for electing Obama , what ’s to stop antiwar demonstrators from asking for a little something in return ?
They can do it respectfully : like Russian peasants supplicating the Czar .
Sooner or later , the antiwar movement will have to respond , as the Afghan front takes center stage in our perpetual “ war on terrorism , ” and the War Party digs its spurs into the hindquarters of the national security bureaucracy , which actually administers and implements American foreign policy .
The quick extension of the conflict into Pakistan by the Obama administration is another development we have to look forward to , complete with an Indo - American alliance and the ratcheting up of regional tensions .
China , Russia , and Iran all have legitimate cause for concern .
We are entering a very dangerous time , as everyone ’s attention is diverted away from the field of foreign affairs while the economy melts down .
However , war is often seen as the “ solution ” to our economic problems .
The popular myth that war is good for the economy has been concretized by the doctrine of “ military Keynesianism . ”
After all , if government spending of any sort is the best way to kick - start the economy , then why not more military spending to create government - guaranteed jobs and keep the bubble expanding ?
I note that the UFPJ statement comes out strongly against “ militarism . ”
I have news for them : they have n’t seen anything yet .
Another enemy , another crusade , another “ necessary ” war that requires the production of arms and the militarization of labor  just like the “ good war ” did .
If Obama is indeed a post- racial version of Franklin Delano Roosevelt , as the lefties hope , then it becomes ever more important to keep a very close watch on his foreign policy .
After all , Clare Booth Luce was dead on right when she said of FDR : “ He lied us into war . ”
Whether it was for our own good , as historians like Arthur Schlesinger , Jr. , aver , is an issue the Rachel Maddows and Keith Olbermanns of this world will have to face in the very near future .
And , correct me if I ’m wrong , but I ’m certain I know which side they ’ll come out on .
The Britney bludgeon , a weapon of torture : Pop stars tell the U.S. military to stop using their songs to ' break ' terror suspects
Torture : Britney Spears is on the list of artists whose songs are used to ' break ' detainees in American military camps
In the hands of a teenager with a powerful set of speakers it is a lethal weapon .
Popular music played at extreme decibel levels will already have been judged torture by many a parent .
But a phenomenon that did no more harm than widen the generation gap has suddenly taken on more sinister overtones with reports that ear - splittingly loud music has been used as a ' sonic bludgeon ' by the U.S. military against prisoners in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay .
Human rights groups are protesting that blasting tracks such as Britney Spears 's Baby One More Time and Bruce Springsteen 's Born in the U.S.A. into cells at high volumes for hours on end can cause the inmates longterm psychiatric problems .
Now the musicians themselves have joined the fray , furious that their songs are being used to ' break ' suspected terrorists .
Bristol - based band Massive Attack and Tom Morello , guitarist with U.S. group Rage Against The Machine have joined a campaign against the practice .
According to an FBI memo , one interrogator at Guantanamo bragged that he needed only four days to ' break ' someone by alternating 16 hours of loud music with just four hours of silence .
The practice has been used often in the ' war on terror ' , with U.S. forces systematically playing loud music to hundreds of its detainees .
Lt Gen Ricardo Sanchez , the former U.S. military chief in Iraq , said the aim was ' to create fear , disorient . . . and prolong capture shock ' .
Devices of torture : Christina Aguilera and Eminem both had songs used
Ruhal Ahmed , from Tipton in the West Midlands , underwent excruciating ' music torture ' sessions at Guantanamo .
He said his hands were tied to his feet , which were shackled to the floor , forcing him into a painful squat for periods of up to two days .
' You 're in agony , ' said 27 - year - old Mr Ahmed , who was released without charge in 2004 .
The pain was compounded when music was introduced , because ' before you could actually concentrate on something else , try to make yourself focus on some other things in your life that you did before and take that pain away ' .
But , he said , ' the music makes you feel like you are going mad ' .
It is thought that inmates who grew up under the Taliban regime in Afghanistan - when music was banned - are particularly affected by exposure to loud music .
Ethiopian - born Londoner Binyam Mohammed , 30 , now a prisoner at Guantanamo , said men held with him at the CIA 's ' Dark Prison ' in Afghanistan ended up screaming and smashing their heads against walls , unable to endure any more .
' Plenty lost their minds , ' he added .
The new campaign is a joint venture between musicians and the human rights group Reprieve , which represents 30 inmates at Guantanamo .
There are plans for minutes of silence during concerts and festivals to raise awareness of the issue .
One of the more unlikely protesters is Bob Singleton , whose song I Love You - sung by U.S. children 's television character Barney the Dinosaur - has been used to ' torture ' detainees .
He said he was horrified that 'a song designed to make little children feel safe and loved was somehow going to threaten the mental state of adults and drive them to the emotional breaking point ' .
Guantanamo :
One of the detention centres where the U.S. has been using music to torture detainees
Twenty - three thousand executives and employees of various private firms work with the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security .
The group , called InfraGard , receives secret warnings of terrorist threats well in advance of public notification , and sometimes before elected officials .
In return , InfraGard provides information to the government .
InfraGard is a quiet quasi - governmental entity which wields an unknown , but extensive , amount of power and influence .
Michael Hershman , the chairman of the advisory board of the InfraGard National Members Alliance ( INMA ) and the CEO of an international consulting firm , calls InfraGard “ a child of the FBI . ”
The organization started in Cleveland in 1996 , when business members cooperated with the FBI to investigate cyber - threats .
The FBI then “ cloned it , ” according to Phyllis Schneck , chairman of the board of directors of the INMA .
Schneck is one of the biggest proponents of InfraGard .
As of February 2008 , 86 chapters of InfraGard exist in each of the 50 states , operating under the supervision of local FBI agents .
“ We are the owners , operators , and experts of our critical infrastructure , from the CEO of a large company in agriculture or high finance to the guy who turns the valve at the water utility , ” says Schneck .
According to the InfraGard website , “ At its most basic level , InfraGard is a partnership between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the private sector .
InfraGard chapters are geographically linked with FBI Field Office territories . ”
After the 9/11 attacks , InfraGard experiences explosive growth — from 1,700 members in November 2001 to 23,682 members in January 2008 .
350 members of the Fortune 500 have members in InfraGard .
Prospective members are sponsored by existing members , then vetted by the FBI .
The organization accepts members from agriculture , banking and finance , and chemical industry , defense , energy , food , information and telecommunications , law enforcement , public health , and transportation industries .
Controlled Exposure - InfraGard ’s inner workings are not available to the general public ; its communications with the FBI and DHS are not accessible through the Freedom of Information
Act under the “ trade secrets ” exemption .
And InfraGard carefully controls its exposure and contact with the media .
According to the InfraGard website : “ The interests of InfraGard must be protected whenever presented to non-InfraGard members .
During interviews with members of the press , controlling the image of InfraGard being presented can be difficult .
Proper preparation for the interview will minimize the risk of embarrassment . …
The InfraGard leadership and the local FBI representative should review the submitted questions , agree on the predilection of the answers , and identify the appropriate interviewee . …
Tailor answers to the expected audience .…
Questions concerning sensitive information should be avoided . ”
Advance Warning from the FBI - InfraGard members receive quick alerts on any potential terrorist threat or a possible disruption of US infrastructure .
Its website boasts that its members can “ [ g ] ain access to an FBI secure communication network complete with VPN encrypted website , webmail , listservs , message boards , and much more . ”
Hershman says members receive “ almost daily updates ” on threats “ emanating from both domestic sources and overseas . ”
Schneck adds ,
“ We get very easy access to secure information that only goes to InfraGard members .
People are happy to be in the know . ”
Shortly after the 9/11 attacks , an InfraGard member passed along an FBI warning about a potential threat to California ’s bridges to then - Governor Gray Davis , who had not yet heard anything from the FBI ( see November 1 , 2001 ) .
In return , InfraGard members cooperate with FBI and DHS operations .
Schneck says : “ InfraGard members have contributed to about 100 FBI cases .
What InfraGard brings you is reach into the regional and local communities .
We are a 22,000 - member vetted body of subject - matter experts that reaches across seventeen matrixes .
All the different stovepipes can connect with InfraGard . ”
The relationships between the FBI and InfraGard members are key , she says .
“ If you had to call 1 - 800 - FBI , you probably would n’t bother , ” she says .
“ But if you knew Joe from a local meeting you had with him over a donut , you might call them .
Either to give or to get .
We want everyone to have a little black book . ”
InfraGard members have phone numbers for DHS , the FBI , and to report cyber - threats .
InfraGard members who call in “ will be listened to , ” she says ; “ your call [ will ] go through when others will not . ”
The American Civil Liberties Union , who has warned about the potential dangers of Infragard to constitutional liberties ( see August 2004 ) , retorts , “ The FBI should not be creating a privileged class of Americans who get special treatment .
There ’s no ‘ business class ’ in law enforcement .
If there ’s information the FBI can share with 22,000 corporate bigwigs , why do n’t they just share it with the public ?
That ’s who their real ‘ special relationship ’ is supposed to be with .
Secrecy is not a party favor to be given out to friends . …
This bears a disturbing resemblance to the FBI ’s handing out ‘ goodies ’ to corporations in return for folding them into its domestic surveillance machinery . ”
Preparing for Emergencies , Martial Law - InfraGard members are “ very much looped into our readiness capability , ” says a DHS spokeswoman .
Not only does DHS “ provide speakers ” and do “ joint presentations ” with the FBI , but “ [ w ] e also train alongside them , and they have participated in readiness exercises . ”
InfraGard members are involved with the Bush administration ’s “ National Continuity Policy , ” which mandates that DHS coordinate with “ private sector owners and operators of critical infrastructure , as appropriate , in order to provide for the delivery of essential services during an emergency . ”
InfraGard members participate in “ national emergency preparation drills , ” Schneck says , sometimes by the hundreds .
InfraGard members are drilling in preparation for martial law , members say .
One business owner recently attended a meeting conducted by FBI and DHS officials .
He recalls , “ The meeting started off innocuously enough , with the speakers talking about corporate espionage .
From there , it just progressed .
All of a sudden we were knee deep in what was expected of us when martial law is declared .
We were expected to share all our resources , but in return we ’d be given specific benefits . ”
In the event of martial law being declared , Infragard members will have the ability to travel in restricted areas and to evacuate citizens .
But they will have other abilities and duties as well .
InfraGard members , says the business owner , will be authorized to “ shoot to kill ” if necessary to maintain order and “ protect our portion of the infrastructure .
[ I ] f we had to use deadly force to protect it , we could n’t be prosecuted . …
We were assured that if we were forced to kill someone to protect our infrastructure , there would be no repercussions .
It gave me goose bumps .
It chilled me to the bone . ”
Other InfraGard members deny that they have ever been told such ; Schneck says InfraGard members will have no civil patrol or law enforcement responsibilities .
The FBI calls such assertions “ ridiculous . ”
But the business owner ’s story has been corroborated by other InfraGard members .
“ There have been discussions like that , that I ’ve heard of and participated in , ” says Christine Moerke , an InfraGard member from Wisconsin .

The Republicans have won a crucial election to deny president - elect Barack Obama and the Democrats the chance of a 60 - seat " super- majority " in the Senate .
The Republican incumbent , Saxby Chambliss , held on to his seat in Georgia in an election run-off held because the November 4 vote failed to produce an outright winner .
Chambliss had called on the electorate to back him in order to build a " firewall " against total control by Obama of the White House , the Senate and the House of Representatives .
The Republican victory means the Democrats have 58 of the 100 senate seats .
A majority of 60 would have allowed them to override Republican delaying tactics such as filibusters that could play havoc with Obama 's ambitious legislative programme .
Instead , the Democrats will have to rely on moderate Republicans to see their bills through .
Another senate contest , in Minnesota , is being recounted and remains in the balance but the Georgia defeat makes that outcome less important .
With 96 % of the vote counted , Chambliss took 57 % to Democratic candidate Jim Martin's 43 % .
Martin benefited on November 4 from the big African - American turnout in the southern state for Obama .
Turnout on Tuesday , by contrast , was low .
Both sides saturated Georgia with adverts and visits by prominent politicians , including the failed vice - presidential candidate , Sarah Palin , on Monday .
Obama , possibly wanting to avoid association with a defeat , did not go to Georgia to campaign for Martin .
In Minnesota , the Democratic candidate , Al Franken , is trailing the Republican Norm Coleman in a recount that has to be completed by December 16 .
Franken is cutting into Coleman 's lead .
By last night , with 93 % of the total vote recounted , Coleman was only 303 ahead .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Bank of America said Thursday it plans to slash up to 35,000 jobs over the next three years as it absorbs Merrill Lynch and contends with the deepening recession .
The Charlotte , N.C. - based bank , which will be the nation 's largest financial services firm when the Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) deal closes in coming weeks , said it will announce a final job reduction plan in early 2009 .
The cuts will come from both companies and will affect all lines of business .
Bank of America had 247,000 employees , as of Sept. 30 , while Merrill Lynch had 60,900 at the end of the third quarter .
While Bank of America had not announced any large - scale job cuts so far this year , Merrill Lynch eliminated about 3,300 employees since the fall of 2007 , mainly in its global markets and investment banking division and in support areas .
" The reductions are designed to eliminate redundancies created as a result of the merger with Merrill Lynch and to reflect the current recessionary environment , " Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) said in a statement .
Bank of America is likely to keep many of Merrill Lynch 's financial advisers , who numbered 16,850 at the end of September , said Scott Rothbort , president of Lakeview Asset Management , which owns Merrill Lynch and plans to hold onto its Bank of America shares after the merger .
It 's one of the main reasons why the bank bought the nation 's largest brokerage firm .
" Most of the brokers are going to stay , " Rothbort said .
Those in the companies ' capital markets divisions - the traders , analysts and sales representatives - wo n't be as lucky , he predicted .
The announcement comes just a week after shareholders at both companies approved the deal .
The merger ends the independence of Merrill , the storied Wall Street investment bank founded in 1914 .
The deal valued Merrill at $ 50 billion when it was announced on Sept. 14 , the day before Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy .
Bank of America shares have fallen 46 % since then , putting the value on the merger at just under $ 20 billion .
Since the merger was announced , both Bank of America and Merrill Lynch have received funds under the Treasury 's Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) established as part of the $ 700 billion bailout of the financial services industry .
Bank of America received $ 15 billion , while Merrill Lynch got $ 10 billion .
Responding to criticism that banks have n't used the bailout money to lend , Bank of America is running advertisements detailing their commitment .
The bank says in the past three months it has funded more than $ 50 billion in home loans , financing more than 250,000 homes .
" The tightening mortgage market should not squeeze out qualified homebuyers , " the ad reads .
" That 's why we 're putting our capital where our mouth is . "
Bank of America joins a growing list of financial services companies slashing staff amid the continuing credit crunch and downturn in consumer spending .
Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) said last month it would cut more than 50,000 jobs , while Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) said it would slash 10 % of its institutional securities division and 9 % of its money management business .
In October , American Express ( AXP , Fortune 500 ) announced it would shed 7,000 jobs and Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) said it would cut 3,260 positions .
The financial sector overall has lost 142,000 jobs over the past year , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Unfortunately this vid starts with an ad , but it 's definitely worth waiting through .

By way of background , we posted this on November 27 :
How can you give cash compensation to an executive , yet claim it is not a salary or bonus ?
You call it a “ retention bonus , ” No , I am not making this up .
Note that AIG chose to make this disclosure the day before Thanksgiving , selecting a time when it would attract the least notice .
Not that it really matters .
The talk about restricting executive compensation to bailout recipients has been just that , talk .
It turns out that AIG was less than forthcoming in its pre-holiday revelation , and is now having to admit to more bonus payments during a busier news period .
Did AIG really not have a good count two weeks ago , or did it think it could get cute and not admit to the full scope of executive largess ?
Or perhaps it decided , not having gotten as much flack as it feared , to expand the program .
From Bloomberg :
American International Group Inc. , the insurer whose bonuses and perks are under fire from U.S. lawmakers , offered cash awards to another 38 executives in a retention program with payments of as much as $ 4 million .
The incentives range from $ 92,500 to $ 4 million for employees earning salaries between $ 160,000 and $ 1 million , Chief Executive Officer Edward Liddy said in a letter dated Dec. 5 to Representative Elijah Cummings .
The New York - based insurer had previously disclosed that 130 managers would get the awards and that one executive would get $ 3 million .
“ I remain concerned , as do many American taxpayers , that these retention payments are simply bonuses by another name , ” Cummings said in letter responding to Liddy .
AIG , which received a U.S. rescue package of more than $ 152 billion , has been criticized for saying it will eliminate bonuses for senior executives while still planning to hand out “ cash awards ” that double or triple the salaries of some managers .
The payments are designed to keep top employees at AIG while Liddy seeks to sell units and pay back the federal government , which owns 79.9 percent of AIG …..
Keeping the managers is necessary to maintain credit ratings and meet requirements in some reinsurance agreements , Liddy wrote .
AIG disclosed the initial list of 130 managers in a September filing without saying how much most of the recipients will get .
Another 38 people were added “ subsequently , ” according to Liddy ’s letter , which did n’t disclose the new recipients or say when they had been added .
Yves here .
What rubbish .
Do you really think there are a lot of senior executive jobs on offer in the insurance industry these days ?
And have you ever heard of credit ratings being dependent on a particular manager staying in the saddle ?
CEOs get deposed without there being any ratings impact .
This explanation comes perilously close to being a bald - faced lie .

Woolly rhino roamed the area about 50,000 years ago
The remains of an Ice Age rhinoceros have been unearthed by a five - year - old girl at a Gloucestershire water park .
Emelia Fawbert found the fossilised carcass at the Cotswold Water Park near Cirencester during a fossil hunt .
Emelia and her father James , 33 , from Bussage , near Stroud , dug up the atlas vertebra of the woolly rhino which roamed the area about 50,000 years ago .
Emelia was among a group of fossil hunters searching a freshly - excavated gravel pit at the park on 26 October .
' Protective covering '
The atlas vertebra , which once supported the head of the animal had been sticking up through the clay which was exposed by the gravel excavations .
The pair used a trowel to dig the bone from the mud .
It has now been sealed in a special protective covering before being donated to a museum .
The hunt , involving 75 people , also unearthed the leg bone and vertebra from an Ice Age deer and belemnites , the remains of squid - like creatures from the Jurassic period , some 150 m years ago .
Emelia , who wants to become a palaeontologist , had joined the fossil hunt for the first time .
It was organised by the Cotswold Water Park Society and led by Swindon palaeontologist Dr Neville Hollingworth who also found the remains of a woolly rhinoceros in a gravel pit near Swindon in 2004 .

The problem
Any electronic file is a stream of bits , 1s and 0s .
For example , a 1MB file contains 8,388,608 bits .
Every stream of bits is a binary representation of a unique integer .
In 1MB , that integer has about 2,525,223 decimal digits .
So every electronic file corresponds to a single unique integer .
It is , in many cases , illegal to copy and distribute electronic versions of movies , music , software etc. , as well as things like DVD encryption keys .
Therefore , it is illegal to copy and distribute certain integers .
The problem is this : numbers are just concepts , they are not concrete .
They exist independently of intelligent observers .
How , then , can you possibly pass restrictions on the distribution of an uncontrollable , indestructible abstract which nobody can own ?
If you started counting at 1 , you 'd get to an illegal number eventually .
Should you be sued at that moment ?
Does that make any sense ?
Actually , yes , it does .
You can't control mathematics .
You can , however , control reality .
The Wastelands
The short answer is : if you started counting , the universe would end before you reached an illegal number .
Regardless of how fast you counted .
And regardless of where you started counting .
To elaborate :
All electronic files represent , and are represented by , unique integers .
However , those integers are invariably extremely large .
As a proportion of all the possible integers of this size , the set of integers which actually represent real , sane , meaningful electronic files is minuscule .
Thus , the vast majority of all integers in this range are completely useless .
So the set of all the integers representing restricted content - indeed , the set of all " useful " numbers - is a very sparse collection of lonely integers , each one separated from its nearest neighbour by an incomprehensibly gigantic wasteland of meaningless , useless numbers .
Once your electronic files grow beyond , say , a thousand bits in length , the size of the average " useless wasteland " grows to the point where not even all the computing power of the whole universe combined could generate enough processor cycles to cycle through the whole gap .
Therefore , if somebody started counting at ANY integer , the chances of them reaching an illegal number before dying are statistically insignificant .
Which means that that person knew the illegal number in advance ( or was fed it by somebody else who did know , or generated it using a procedure based on an illegal number , et cetera ) .
Somewhere , there was ( either legitimate or illegitimate ) intent to copy the original illegal number .
Likewise , if we took somebody 's hard drive , randomly read off a sequence of 1000 bits or more , and that stream of bits turned out to be of any significance at all - a prime number or a DVD encryption key or a textbook or the entirety of an MP3 - encoded song - then we can draw the same conclusion ; the HDD 's owner deliberately downloaded that illegal file ( or somebody else put the file there , or some insecure / malicious piece of software downloaded it , or whatever ) .
Wait !
What about different formats and compressed versions of the original illegal file ?
Does n't that make the set of useful numbers more crowded ?
Yes , but not significantly .
The number of different " reversible transforms " of this type is strictly finite and MUCH smaller than the magnitude of the number any such transformed file represents .
We can consider all transformed illegal numbers to have the same legal restrictions as the original file with no problems .
This is simply an extension of the fact that the original number is effectively a transformed version of the actual song ( physical pattern of sound waves ) , having the same distribution restrictions .
Naturally , you would have to show that this transform exists , and that the accused had intent / means to use it .
But this is moving towards the legal end of the problem , which , as I say , I can't be authoritative about .
So we can conclude that , while it may raise philosophical and practical objections to attempt to pass restrictive laws about a number , it is perfectly practical to pass restrictive laws about real - world representations of it ... if , and only if , the number is sufficiently large and complex .
So where do we set our threshold ?
Size
According to Wikipedia , a total of roughly 161 exabytes of digital information were created , captured and replicated worldwide over the course of 2006 .
Meanwhile , every possible 64 - bit number put together would take up 128 exabytes of computer space .
In this case , the random appearance of a valid 64 - bit encryption key where nobody intended it to appear is unacceptably likely .
( True , most of the " real " information in the world displays repetition and other patterns , which would lower the odds .
As we 've established , the vast majority of data streams are meaningless , while the vast majority of actual data in the world IS ( believe it or not ) meaningful .
Nevertheless , the chances of a random collision here are clearly far too high to be worth ignoring . )
And the more illegal 64 - bit numbers there are , the worse those odds become .
It is debatable whether that chance is " beyond all reasonable doubt " ; frankly , I doubt a court of law would ever decide otherwise .
But computers are getting faster and increasing in number .
In a hundred years ' time , " exabyte " may be such a common quantity of data as to be a household term .
So to set the threshold this low would be short - sighted .
By comparison , the HD - DVD AACS encryption key which was - to the horror of the MPAA - released publically onto the internet in early May 2007 is 32 hexadecimal digits long ( well , 31 if we want to be pedantic , since it has a leading zero ) - that 's 128 bits .
Each of those 64 extra bits makes a random collision half as likely , so this takes us a full twelve orders of magnitude below the point of " certainty " .
128 bits , therefore , is an excellent size for the shortest possible illegal number .
Complexity
However , obviously , it would be ridiculous to try to make it illegal to distribute ( for example ) the encryption key " 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 " .
This is because such numbers , though arbitrarily large , would very probably turn up all over the place , generated independently by multiple sources .
More technically , the remark above about compression can be carried over here .
We can compress , say , a billion zeros from occupying almost an entire gibibyte of computer space to a mere six bytes as the ASCII string , " 1E9 0s " .
Other such simple patterns can likewise be compressed immensely to relatively short streams of ASCII using that famous compression routine , " do what the ASCII tells you to do " .
For example , " 5E8 repetitions of 01 " or " first 1E9 bits of pi " .
Since I argued above that a reversibly transformed version of a restricted file should hold the same distribution restrictions as the original , we cannot effectively enforce restrictions about these arbitrarily large but relatively simple bit streams , since they transform to something too short , meaning collisions are too likely .
English , of course ( and other languages using relatively small character sets ) is even more compressed a format than ASCII , since the vast majority of possible streams of ASCII mean nothing in English .
Thus , " Generate and concatenate the first million prime numbers " is a 56 byte string = a 448 bit number ( which describes the construction of about 7.3 MiB of decimal digits ) but still probably immune to distribution restrictions .

One of Barack Obama 's first acts as president should be to instruct his attorney general to appoint an independent prosecutor to initiate a criminal investigation of former Bush Administration officials who gave the green light to torture .
At Obama 's press conference on Dec. 1 , he spoke of upholding America 's highest values as he introduced Eric Holder as his choice for attorney general .
Holder insisted there was no tension between protecting the people of the United States and adhering to our Constitution .
A few months ago , Holder was even more explicit .
" Our government authorized the use of torture , approved of secret electronic surveillance against American citizens , secretly detained American citizens without due process of law , denied the writ of habeas corpus to hundreds of accused enemy combatants and authorized the use of procedures that violate both international law and the United States Constitution , " he said .
" We owe the American people a reckoning . "
The day of reckoning is fast upon us .
If Obama and Holder want to adhere to our Constitution and uphold our highest values , they must pursue those in the Bush Administration who violated that Constitution , broke our laws , and tarnished our values .
Read the words of Lt. Gen. Antonio M. Taguba , who investigated the Abu Ghraib scandal for the Pentagon .
" There is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes , " he concluded .
" The only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account . "
Despite Taguba 's words and reams of documentation supporting his statement , there has been little discussion about holding officials accountable for their design and implementation of the torture program .
We need to make it clear , just as we do in cases with the most minor offenses , that actions have consequences .
To simply let those officials walk off the stage sends a message of impunity that will only encourage future law breaking .
The message that we need to send is that they will be held accountable .

A popular refrain in Washington these days is that criminal prosecutions would be an unnecessary look backward .
Some argue that in order for the new administration to move forward , presidential pardons should be granted and a Truth Commission assembled to investigate the circumstances that gave rise to the brutal interrogations and deaths of prisoners in Afghanistan , Iraq , Guantanamo Bay and CIA black sites around the world .
But pardons would be the final refuge for an administration whose egregious violations of human rights have , for all too long , gone unpunished .
And a Truth Commission is not applicable .
This is not Latin America ; this is not South Africa .
We are not trying to end a civil war , heal a wounded country and reconcile warring factions .
We are a democracy trying to hold accountable officials that led our country down the road to torture .
And in a democracy , it is the job of a prosecutor and not the pundits to determine whether crimes were committed .
Criminal prosecutions are not about looking to the past ; they are about creating a future world without torture .
They will be the mark of the new dawn of America 's leadership and our new era of accountability .
Prosecuting these officials would help the United States regain its moral standing in the world and to prove our commitment to upholding international human rights standards .
In his first nationally televised interview , President - elect Barack Obama made this promise : " I have said repeatedly that America does n't torture .
And I 'm going to make sure that we do n't torture . "
The best way to do that is to prosecute those who designed the torture policies .
Maybe General Motors should throw in a fleet of Cadillacs .
The automaker is dumping its corporate jets into what some participants say is the worst market they have ever seen .
Just seven months ago , hundreds of mega-millionaires , including Ralph Lauren and David Geffen , were elbowing one another in the lineup to buy a $ 60 million Gulfstream G650 , which was not expected to hit runways until 2012 .
It did not matter that $ 500,000 had to be wired to Gulfstream ’s account at a Midwest branch of JPMorgan Chase at exactly 12:01 a.m. on April 15 , or that bidders who secured a place in the waiting line could not sell their rights if they changed their minds , according to one bidder .
Some eager moguls even tried to improve their chances of getting a jet quicker by opening accounts at Chase ’s Midwest office .
Among high - ticket status symbols , “ me and my brand new jet ” was it .
Catholic Charities of Orange County assembled Thanksgiving dinners for 500 families this week , filling plastic bags with frozen turkeys , cranberry sauce and other fixings .
But word of the free food attracted 920 families , many of whom left empty - handed when the Santa Ana agency doled out the goods .
“ There were tears in our eyes as we had to turn people away , ” said executive director Terrie Montminy , who referred families elsewhere for food or invited them back the next day for smaller packages .
Charities across the country are facing the same stress this year as their busiest season approaches .
Aid organizations are hobbled by dwindling resources and soaring demands for food , clothing , money and other necessities .
And it ’s not only the desperately poor who are banging on their doors .

The web of poverty is expanding into the white - collar workforce , with the souring economy upending professionals who were once considered reliable contributors .
The director of one Phoenix charity , for instance , says that some of his donors have become his clients .
Charity administrators , pastors and rabbis are forecasting a bleak holiday season and an even more troubling year ahead , given government cutbacks and contributors tightening their belts in response to the deteriorating economy .
The crisis occurs at an alarming time : Such philanthropic groups typically collect most of their revenue at the end of the year , when donors open their wallets to qualify for tax write - offs .
As resources vanish , however , the threads of the nation ’s extensive social safety nets are fraying , leaving single mothers , elderly shut-ins and others ever more vulnerable .
“ The number of people and families who are forced to seek help is going to continue to grow exponentially in the next year , ” said Nancy Volpert , director of public policy at Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles .
“ The safety net is being stretched very thin . ”

Already , increasing numbers of people who were once prosperous are having to ask for help , according to a variety of accounts .
In a new survey of 44 charities that provide food , shelter and financial assistance , Catholic Charities USA found that 52 % reported an increase in middle - class clients , up from 43 % in June .
“ I receive a call or two every week from people who have been contributors for years who find themselves unemployed , ” said Paul Martodam , chief executive of Catholic Charities Community Services in Phoenix .
“ They feel terrible .
They never pictured themselves as being on the receiving side of charity . ”
These new recipients have added to the Phoenix agency ’s mounting troubles .
In October , its emergency shelter turned away 161 families and its food pantry had to send away 198 families .
Meanwhile , 526 families could n’t get help with utility bills , Martodam said .

And the worst may be yet to come .
The charity typically receives about half its $ 2.4 million in annual cash contributions in December .
“ We can only give out what comes in , ” Martodam said .
“ The whole community is just out of resources . ”
Across the country , natural disasters have added to relief groups ’ financial strain , with a drum beat of hurricanes , floods , wildfires , tornadoes and winter storms this year depleting their coffers .
The Salvation Army has seen its disaster donations fall , even as overall contributions have remained roughly steady , one official said .

The charity now faces dual pressures :
Trying to keep up with growing demand for its storefront services while replenishing relief funds from donors who are tapped out or impassive in the face of repeated catastrophes .
“ The fact that we ’ve had so many [ disasters ] has worked against our ability to fund - raise , ” said Melissa Temme , a spokeswoman for the national organization .
“ You throw in the economy and millions of dollars raised for the political process and you start to see it ’s been a very full two years . ”
Philanthropy experts say charities are facing one of the most daunting fiscal environments in recent memory .
Charitable giving in the coming year , they say , will depend primarily on stock market performance , corporate profits and personal income .
“ We do think there is going to be some pain associated with the charities , ” said Patrick Rooney , interim executive director of the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University .
“ They will have to make choices about programs and staff .
It ’s going to be a more challenging year . ”

The American Red Cross is one charity that appears , for the time being , to be bucking the trend .
Since September , the organization has raised $ 65 million toward a goal of $ 100 million to replenish its disaster relief fund ; it hopes to raise $ 30 million in December .
In a nod to the power of the Internet , the Red Cross has hired some of the fundraisers who helped President - elect Barack Obama raise enormous sums of money online .
“ In this economy , a charity has to find every way possible to raise money , and that includes the old - fashioned way and the new techniques and technology we are seeing , ” said Suzy DeFrancis , chief public affairs officer for the American Red Cross at its headquarters in Washington , D.C .

It also means being creative .
Members of New City Parish -- a coalition of nine Lutheran churches in Inglewood , South Los Angeles and Compton -- distribute leftovers from restaurants at their food pantries , along with more traditional groceries .
Among items on the menus : Chicken wings from Kentucky Fried Chicken and crab legs from Red Lobster .
The group ’s executive director , the Rev. Scott Fritz , also envisions “ urban gardening ” that would allow communities to grow their own vegetables .
Last weekend , members of Fritz ’s congregation , Chapel of Peace Lutheran Church in Inglewood , reached out to the community ’s homeless and working poor , inviting 180 people into the church for meals .
“ The poor are coming around to help the poor , ” the pastor said .
“ It makes us see that we ’re all in this together . ”
Advertisement
Others also believe the solution lies in faith .
The Rev. Pat O’Reilly had worried about making ends meet this fall at the Ecumenical Council Pasadena Area Churches , a coalition of 50 Protestant and Catholic congregations , as cash donations fell and the numbers of needy increased at its food pantry .
Then , to O’Reilly ’s surprise , the council received two foundation grants last month worth $ 19,500 .
“ If you give , ” O’Reilly said , “ God will take care of you . ”

Hollywood 's distaste for disruptive innovation is n't limited to software products like RealDVD .
Now it is targeting DVD rental kiosks , like the Redbox kiosk pictured here .
The idea could n't be simpler , or the innovation more pro-consumer : Redbox makes DVD rental kiosks that rent authentic , Hollywood DVDs .
It 's just like Blockbuster , only without the trappings of the store , which means kiosk vendors can do it cheaper , quicker , and in more places .
Simple $ 1 per night DVD rentals .
Brilliant .
Hollywood apparently does n't see it that way .
According to a lawsuit filed by Redbox , the Universal Studios family of companies have demanded that Redbox sign a " revenue sharing agreement " that would require Redbox to :
wait 45 days after a DVD 's release date before renting it ;
pay a royalty of 40 % of gross rental revenues ;
promise that prices never dip below $ 0.99 per night ; and
destroy all previously rented DVDs rather than offering them for purchase for $ 7 , as Redbox currently does .
What if Redbox refuses ?
Universal Studios allegedly threatened to cut off the distributors ( Ingram and VPD ) who sell Universal DVDs to Redbox .
I 'm guessing this threat is meant to get Redbox cut off by its distributors -- obviously , Ingram and VPD are n't going to be thrilled to lose all of their other customers over the Redbox account .
This is a breathtaking attack on the first sale doctrine , which makes it crystal clear that once you 've bought a DVD , you can rent and resell it at any price and on any terms you like .
Universal Studios apparently would prefer a world where millions of DVDs are shredded and put in landfills to one where consumers can rent a DVD for $ 1 .
( Although this is an improvement over its former corporate sibling , Universal Music Group , which believes that throwing promo CDs away is illegal . )

The conference also solicits Experience Reports , which are short papers that provide evidence that functional programming really works or describe obstacles that have kept it from working in a particular application .
What 's different this year ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*
The conference dates and the submission deadline are about one month earlier than usual .
* Special ' Call for Experience Reports ' page , suitable as a target for posts on blogs and social networks to reach practitioners who would n't normally think about submitting to a conference .
If you have a blog , etc. , please help by pointing your readers to : http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~apt/icfp09_cfer.html
Instructions for authors ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By Monday , 2 March 2009 , 20:00 UTC , submit an abstract of at most 300 words and a full paper of at most 12 pages ( 4 pages for an Experience Report ) , including bibliography and figures .
The deadline will be strictly enforced and papers exceeding the page limits will be summarily rejected .
Authors have the option to attach supplementary material to a submission , on the understanding that reviewers may choose not to look at it .
A submission will be evaluated according to its relevance , correctness , significance , originality , and clarity .
It should explain its contributions in both general and technical terms , clearly identifying what has been accomplished , explaining why it is significant , and comparing it with previous work .
The technical content should be accessible to a broad audience .
Functional Pearls and Experience Reports are separate categories of papers that need not report original research results and must be marked as such at the time of submission .
Detailed guidelines on both categories are below .
Each submission must adhere to SIGPLAN 's republication policy , as explained on the web .
Violation risks summary rejection of the offending submission .
Proceedings will be published by ACM Press .
Authors of accepted submissions are expected to transfer the copyright to ACM .
Presentations will be videotaped and released online if the presenter consents by signing an additional permission form at the time of the presentation .
Released videos will be included along with the conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library and may also be placed on a host such as YouTube or Google Video .
Formatting : ~~~~~~~~~~~
Submissions must be in PDF format printable in black and white on US Letter sized paper and interpretable by Ghostscript .
If this requirement is a hardship , make contact with the program chair at least one week before the deadline .
ICFP proceedings are printed in black and white .
It is permissible to include color in a submission , but you risk annoying reviewers who will have to decide if your final paper will be understandable without it .
Papers must adhere to the standard ACM conference format : two columns , nine - point font on a ten - point baseline , with columns 20 pc ( 3.33 in ) wide and 54 pc ( 9in ) tall , with a column gutter of 2 pc ( 0.33 in ) .
A suitable document template for LaTeX is available from SIGPLAN .
Submission : ~~~~~~~~~~~
Submissions will be accepted electronically at a URL to be named later .
The deadline is set in Coordinated Universal Time .
The world clock ( http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=3&day=2&year=2009&hour=20&min=0&sec=0&p1=0) can give you the equivalent in your local time , e.g. , Noon Monday in Seattle , 3:00 PM Monday in New York , 8:00 PM Monday in London , 5:00 AM Tuesday in Tokyo .
Citation : ~~~~~~~~~
We recommend ( but do not require ) that you put your citations into author - date form .
This procedure makes your paper easier to review .
For example , if you cite a result on testing as ``( Claessen and Hughes 2000 ) '' , many reviewers will recognize the result instantly .
On the other hand , if you cite it as ` ` [ 4 ] '' , even the best - informed reviewer has to page through your paper to find the reference .
By using author - date form , you enable a knowledgeable reviewer to focus on content , not arbitrary numbering of references .
LaTeX users can simply use the natbib package along with the plainnat bibliography style .
In practice , this means putting \usepackage{natbib} \bibpunct ( ) ; A{} , \let \cite= \citep in your LaTeX preamble , and \bibliographystyle {plainnat} in your document .
For most citations you will use the \cite command ; if you want a citation like ``Claessen and Hughes ( 2000 ) showed that ...'' you should use something like ``\citet{claessen : quickcheck} showed ...''
Alternatively , the McBride bibliography style , which adheres to the Chicago manual of style ``Documentation Two '' specifications and which fixes some perceived deficiencies of natbib , may be used .
The style file along with instructions for using it is available on the McBride web site .
Author response : ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Authors will have a 48 - hour period , starting at 20:00 UTC on 21 April 2009 , to read and respond to reviews .
Special categories of papers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In addition to research papers , ICFP solicits two kinds of papers that do not require original research contributions : Functional Pearls , which are full papers , and Experience Reports , which are limited to four pages .
Authors submitting such papers may wish to consider the following advice .
Functional Pearls ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Functional Pearl is an elegant essay about something related to functional programming .
It might offer : * a new and thought - provoking way of looking at an old idea * an instructive example of program calculation or proof * a nifty presentation of an old or new data structure * an interesting application of functional programming techniques * a novel use or exposition of functional programming in the classroom Functional Pearls are not restricted to the above varieties , however .
While pearls often demonstrate an idea through the development of a short program , there is no requirement or expectation that they do so .
Thus , they encompass the notions of theoretical and educational pearls .
Functional Pearls are valued as highly and judged as rigorously as ordinary papers , but using somewhat different criteria .
In particular , a pearl is not required to report original research .
However , it should be concise , instructive , and entertaining .
Your pearl is likely to be rejected if your readers get bored , if the material gets too complicated , if too much specialized knowledge is needed , or if the writing is inelegant .
The key to writing a good pearl is polishing .
A submission you wish to have treated as a pearl must be marked as such on the submission web page , and should contain the words ``Functional Pearl ' ' somewhere in its title or subtitle .
These steps will alert reviewers to use the appropriate evaluation criteria .
However , pearls will be combined with ordinary papers for the purpose of computing the conference 's acceptance rate .
Experience Reports ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The purpose of an Experience Report is to help create a body of published , refereed , citable evidence that functional programming really works --- or to describe what obstacles prevent it from working .
Possible topics for an Experience Report include , but are not limited to : * insights gained from real - world projects using functional programming * comparison of functional programming with conventional programming in the context of an industrial project or a university curriculum * project - management , business , or legal issues encountered when using functional programming in a real - world project * curricular issues encountered when using functional programming in education * real - world constraints that created special challenges for an implementation of a functional language or for functional programming in general An Experience Report is distinguished from a normal ICFP paper by its title , by its length , and by the criteria used to evaluate it .
* Both in the proceedings and in any citations , the title of each accepted Experience Report must begin with the words ``Experience Report ' ' followed by a colon .
The acceptance rate for Experience Reports will be computed and reported separately from the rate for ordinary papers .
* An Experience Report is at most 4 pages long .
Each accepted Experience Report will be presented at the conference , but depending on the number of Experience Reports and regular papers accepted , authors of Experience reports may be asked to give shorter talks .
*
Because the purpose of Experience Reports is to enable our community to accumulate a body of evidence about the efficacy of functional programming , an acceptable Experience Report need not add to the body of knowledge of the functional - programming community by presenting novel results or conclusions .
It is sufficient if the Report states a clear thesis and provides supporting evidence .
The thesis must be relevant to ICFP , but it need not be novel .
The program committee will accept or reject Experience Reports based on whether they judge the evidence to be convincing .
Anecdotal evidence will be acceptable provided it is well argued and the author explains what efforts were made to gather as much evidence as possible .
Typically , more convincing evidence is obtained from papers which show how functional programming was used than from papers which only say that functional programming was used .
The most convincing evidence often includes comparisons of situations before and after the introduction or discontinuation of functional programming .
Evidence drawn from a single person 's experience may be sufficient , but more weight will be given to evidence drawn from the experience of groups of people .
An Experience Report should be short and to the point : make a claim about how well functional programming worked on your project and why , and produce evidence to substantiate your claim .
If functional programming worked for you in the same ways it has worked for others , you need only to summarize the results --- the main part of your paper should discuss how well it worked and in what context .
Most readers will not want to know all the details of your project and its implementation , but please characterize your project and its context well enough so that readers can judge to what degree your experience is relevant to their own projects .
Be especially careful to highlight any unusual aspects of your project .
Also keep in mind that specifics about your project are more valuable than generalities about functional programming ; for example , it is more valuable to say that your team delivered its software a month ahead of schedule than it is to say that functional programming made your team more productive .
If your paper not only describes experience but also presents new technical results , or if your experience refutes cherished beliefs of the functional - programming community , you may be better off submitting it as a full paper , which will be judged by the usual criteria of novelty , originality , and relevance .
If you are unsure in which category to submit , the program chair will be happy to help you decide .

The program committee will invite the authors of select accepted papers to submit a journal version to this issue .
Lots of people know about the relationship between fantasy writers C.S. Lewis and J.R.R.
Tolkien , but who know Bram Stoker stole Oscar Wilde 's true love out from under his nose ?
I did n't , at least , so I think these relationships between classic authors are terribly interesting .
I included Lewis and Tolkien for those who did n't know about their friendship .
There are a lot more where this came from - I might make this a two - parter .
And if you 're impatient and do n't want to wait for my second part , check out the book Secret Lives of Great Authors by Robert Schnakenberg .
Very interesting read .
1. Bram Stoker was a frequent guest at Oscar Wilde ’s parents ’ house .
Oscar ’s mom , Lady Jane , was a poet who liked to keep literary company .
Bram found himself in Lady Jane ’s circle , and eventually met Florence Balcombe , who had previously been Lady Jane ’s daughter - in - law to be .
Yep , Florence was once engaged to Oscar Wilde .
At least , by some accounts .
Other accounts say they dated seriously and Oscar merely wanted to marry her .
At any rate , Florence ended up marrying Bram Stoker instead .
When Oscar heard she was engaged , he wrote her a letter and said that he was leaving Ireland and would never come back .
He mostly stayed true to his word – he only came back twice for a brief visits .
2. C.S. Lewis and J.R.R .
Tolkien were good friends since they first met at Oxford and belonged to the Inklings group together .
But they hated one another ’s books .
When Tolkien was writing a new character for Lord of the Rings and tried to describe the character to Lewis , Lewis famously responded , “ Not another frigging dwarf ! ” Except , you know , he actually swore .
But this is a family blog .
3. Louisa May Alcott loved Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson .
Really loved them .
Like Alcott , they were residents of Concord , Massachusetts , so she had friendships with both .
She and Thoreau used to exchange ideas and he would play his flute for her .
The Emerson infatuation may have started when Ralph Waldo gave her the book Goethe ’s Correspondence with a Child , which involves a young girl in love with a horny old poet .
You can see why Louisa may have been flattered and sort of started stalking him – she would leave flowers on his doorstep , write him love letters but never send them , and sit outside of his window and sing him songs in German .
He was married and had a daughter just six years younger than Louisa and never returned her affections .
4. F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway were just three years apart in age .
They met at the Dingo Bar in Paris in 1925 , when Hemingway was 25 and Fitzgerald was 28 .
The Great Gatsby had just been published and looked to be a big hit ; Hemingway , on the other hand , was a relatively unknown author .
They were close friends for a while – Fitzgerald was notoriously insecure about himself in almost every aspect , and when his wife once insulted the size of his manhood , Fitz actually dropped trou and asked Hemingway if everything looked normal to him .
Hemingway assured his friend that things appeared to be up to par .
But the friendship quickly deteriorated .
As Fitzgerald ’s career fell and he descended further into alcoholism , Hemingway ’s work started picking up .
Hemingway started making fun of Fitzgerald to newspapers and magazines , to the point that Fitzgerald actually pleaded with his old friend to stop .
The reason for the sudden cold shoulder ?
Hemingway was said to have been disgusted by Fitzgerald ’s alcoholism , because he would make huge public scenes and embarrass himself and everyone around him when he was drunk .
5 . And , speaking of Hemingway , he was also once very good friends with Gertrude Stein .
He met her in Paris as well , at the introduction of their mutual friend , writer Sherwood Anderson ( Anderson also introduced Hemingway to Ezra Pound ) .
She reminded him of his mother both physically and otherwise .
He even openly used Gertrude to try to work out some of his issues with his mother .
She ended up introducing him to bullfighting , Spain , and prose .
He used her as his sounding board and would completely rewrite something at her suggestion .
He even made her the Godmother of his first son , Jack .

Mordac :
You will get a survey asking you how satisfied you were with my service today .
If you do n't rate my service superior in all categories , I will lose my jobs and my wife will leave me for a more successful man .
Dilbert : Is she cute ?
Mordac :
Why do you ask ?
The BBC's Rushdi Abou Alouf in the Gaza Strip described the chaos as Israeli warplanes fired missiles at Hamas targets , killing at least 155 Palestinians .
Israeli planes are still flying over Gaza and they have just targeted another Hamas [ security ] compound in the middle of the Gaza Strip , in a place called Khan Younis .
We can see from our office here in Gaza , in the middle of Gaza City , ambulances are still evacuating the injured from buildings and school kids are trying to find secure places .
People who were going to their work were turned back and went home , and most of the residents in Gaza have been ordered by the ministry of health to stay indoors .
The mosques in Gaza are calling the people here to go to the hospitals and to donate blood .
Doctors say the operating rooms are full and the morgues are full and they have no place to put the dead bodies .
They are asking for every doctor who is not working today to come and help .
We have seen in the streets of Gaza today and this evening many funerals .
No safe places
It 's a very bad situation ...
There were Israeli aeroplanes everywhere , hitting everywhere .
You could see smoke from north to south , from west to east .
The people are really in a panic .
The main object for the people now is to find a secure place to secure their family .
Gaza has no shelters , it has no safe places .
The Hamas security compounds are in the middle of the city - it's not the kind of place where you see compounds outside the cities .
I have witnessed one of the compounds - which is 20 m [ yds ] away from my house - I was standing on the balcony and I have seen the Israeli airplanes hitting the place .
Some of my balcony was damaged and my kid was injured .
Many people were injured inside their houses today .
I saw an Israeli fighter drop a bomb on a building , flattening it .
Smoke was coming from it .
Kids were panicking and screaming .
It took rescue teams six hours to evacuate injured from the place and they are still searching under the rubble , trying to find any survivors .

If you ’re using mnesia disc_copies tables and doing a lot of writes all at once , you ’ve probably run into the following message
=ERROR REPORT==== 10 - Dec-2008::18:07:19 === Mnesia( node@host ) : ** WARNING ** Mnesia is overloaded : {dump_log , write_threshold}
This warning event can get really annoying , especially when they start happening every second .
But you can eliminate them , or at least drastically reduce their occurance .
Synchronous Writes
The first thing to do is make sure to use sync_transaction or sync_dirty .
Doing synchronous writes will slow down your writes in a good way , since the functions wo n’t return until your record (s ) have been written to the transaction log .
The alternative , which is the default , is to do asynchronous writes , which can fill transaction log far faster than it gets dumped , causing the above error report .
Mnesia Application Configuration
If synchronous writes are n’t enough , the next trick is to modify 2 obscure configuration parameters .
The mnesia_overload event generally occurs when the transaction log needs to be dumped , but the previous transaction log dump has n’t finished yet .
Tweaking these parameters will make the transaction log dump less often , and the disc_copies tables dump to disk more often .
NOTE : these parameters must be set before mnesia is started ; changing them at runtime has no effect .
You can set them thru the command line or in a config file .
dc_dump_limit
This variable controls how often disc_copies tables are dumped from memory .
The default value is 4 , which means if the size of the log is greater than the size of table / 4 , then a dump occurs .
To make table dumps happen more often , increase the value .
I ’ve found setting this to 40 works well for my purposes .
dump_log_write_threshold
This variable defines the maximum number of writes to the transaction log before a new dump is performed .
The default value is 100 , so a new transaction log dump is performed after every 100 writes .
If you ’re doing hundreds or thousands of writes in a short period of time , then there ’s no way mnesia can keep up .
I set this value to 50000 , which is a huge increase , but I have enough RAM to handle it .
If you ’re worried that this high value means the transaction log will rarely get dumped when there ’s very few writes occuring , there ’s also a dump_log_time_threshold configuration variable , which by default dumps the log every 3 minutes .
How it Works
I might be wrong on the theory since I did n’t actually write or design mnesia , but here ’s my understanding of what ’s happening .
Each mnesia activity is recorded to a single transaction log .
This transaction log then gets dumped to table logs , which in turn are dumped to the table file on disk .
By increasing the dump_log_write_threshold , transaction log dumps happen much less often , giving each dump more time to complete before the next dump is triggered .
And increasing dc_dump_limit helps ensure that the table log is also dumped to disk before the next transaction dump occurs .

If there is one scientist more responsible than any other for the alarm over global warming it is Dr Hansen , who set the whole scare in train back in 1988 with his testimony to a US Senate committee chaired by Al Gore .
Again and again , Dr Hansen has been to the fore in making extreme claims over the dangers of climate change .
( He was recently in the news here for supporting the Greenpeace activists acquitted of criminally damaging a coal - fired power station in Kent , on the grounds that the harm done to the planet by a new power station would far outweigh any damage they had done themselves . )

Today is World Toilet Day .
You might chuckle or blush , but it ’s worth taking a moment to acknowledge what the humble loo has done for us .
Though the word “ toilet ” is often considered declasse and even rude to utter aloud , much of modern life would not be possible without the commode .
Ask yourself this :
If you had to live without toilets or electricity , which would you choose ?
If you opted for electricity , you might consider the plight of Londoners during the summer of 1858 , when the city experienced what historians know as the Big Stink .
As a thriving metropolis at the peak of an empire , London teemed with vitality .
But all those productive citizens had to poop , and all that excrement had to go somewhere .
Where it went , generally , was into chamber pots and thence into the streets or one of the city ’s 200,000 backyard cesspits , which overflowed into basements , neighbors ’ yards and nearby streets .
Most of it ended up in the River Thames as undiluted , putrid muck .
The problem was perennial , but the summer of 1858 was unusually hot , causing bacteria in the pits and river to multiply .
The stench was so appalling the House of Commons was overpowered .
Parliamentarians soaked the curtains in chloride of lime to combat the smell and considered moving their business upriver to Hampton Court .
Anyone who could leave town did .
The experience galvanized the Metropolitan Board of Works , which set about reforming the city ’s sanitation infrastructure .
The next year , the major elements of the London sewerage system were under construction , which in turn necessitated the evolution of the flush toilet .
Though the first modern toilet is said to have been built for Elizabeth I , true flushable loos are an invention of the late 19th century .
From the Middle Ages on , most large cities were drowning in excrement , making urban spaces not just stinky but downright dangerous .
In the London cholera epidemic of 1844 to 1855 , 20,000 people died because of commingling of sewage and drinking water .
New York City began comprehensively building sewers in 1849 , after its own series of deadly cholera outbreaks .
Toilets became a key factor in metropolitan growth both laterally and vertically .
In order to build up , you have to be able to flush down .
( Imagine carrying a chamber pot down the 102 stories of the Empire State Building . )
The average person goes to the toilet between six and eight times a day .
Of the 69 gallons of water Americans use per person per day indoors , 27 % ( 18.5 gallons ) goes to flushing -- more than on showering or laundry or any other single activity , says the American Water Works Assn .
So central are flush toilets to our lives that we easily forget how many people do without them , or any other kind of effective sanitation either .
Nobody seems to keep toilet statistics per se , but the World Health Organization and UNICEF monitor access to what is called “ improved sanitation ” -- which they reckon 2.5 billion people live without .
Contrary to what the term appears to imply , “ it does n’t mean anything indoors and it does n’t mean water .
It certainly does n’t mean flushable toilets , ” says Patricia Dandonoli , the president of WaterAID America , an organization that works to provide sanitation in developing countries .
It does mean a private , covered pit latrine -- which Dandonoli stresses is “ several steps up the sanitation ladder ” from open defecation .
In cities like Nairobi , many residents have no option but to use what is known as the “ flying toilet . ”
They defecate in a plastic bag that they throw onto the roadside .
Others may only have access to the woods or open fields .
In slums and shantytowns in South Asia and South America , millions of people rely on “ hanging latrines , ” an open platform with a hole in the middle built precariously on poles over a river or stream .
Women are especially vulnerable when there are no sanitation facilities .
Modesty may keep them from going until night , when they are vulnerable to attack .
In developing countries , 11 % more girls go to school when sanitation is available .
Diseases such as diarrhea and dysentery -- caused by food and water contaminated with excrement -- are the second - biggest killer of children worldwide , causing 5,000 deaths a day , five times the number dying from HIV / AIDS .
( The No. 1 killer is pneumonia and upper - respiratory infections . )
The costs of not having sanitation are enormous .
According to the U.N. Development Program , countries in sub-Saharan Africa lose 5 % of their total GDP because of illness and death caused by poor sanitation and water .
The United Nations estimates that every $ 1 spent on sanitation saves at least $ 9 in accumulated health costs , lost productivity and delayed economic development .
One of the U.N. 's Millennium Development Goals , set in 2000 , was to halve the proportion of people living without “ basic sanitation ” by 2015 .
We are nowhere near to making good on that promise , Dandonoli says .
It would require spending about $ 10 billion a year for a decade to get covered pit latrines to just 50 % of those who need them .
That ’s less than what Americans spend on bottled drinking water , which , according to the Beverage Marketing Assn. , is running at more than $ 12 billion annually .
Today , on World Toilet Day , I propose that all of us give one loud grateful flush for the porcelain throne .
Followed by one hour of not flushing in silent solidarity with those who do n’t have the privilege of pooping safely in private .
Margaret Wertheim is a science writer who has consulted for WaterAID America on public outreach .
NESKOWIN , Ore. ( AP ) --
A romantic marriage proposal on the Oregon coast turned deadly for the bride - to - be when a wave swept her out to sea .
Scott Napper planned to pop the question to Leafil Alforque , 22 , at a spot near Neskowin Beach that got its name from couples ready to marry .
Napper said the tide had receded around Proposal Rock on Saturday when the couple began to walk to it .
He planned to propose and give her the ring he carried in his pocket .
About 10 feet from the rock , a wave around 3 feet high suddenly came toward them .
" I turned into it to keep from getting pulled under it , " Napper said .
By the time he turned to find Alforque , only 4 - foot - 11 and 93 pounds , she had been caught by the receding waters .
" She was about 30 feet away , getting swept away , " Napper said .
The 45 - year - old Silverton man tore off his jacket to get rid of any extra weight , and when he looked up again she was gone .
" That 's the last I saw of her , " he said Wednesday , breaking into tears .
Emergency personnel called by someone on the beach arrived within minutes .
His own phone no longer worked after being exposed to the water .
Along with rescuers , he searched for any sign of Alforque .
" I yelled for her , " he said .
" I was praying to God . "
Thick fog and dangerous water conditions hampered the rescue efforts before the search was called off Monday .
Napper and Alforque had been dating since they met on the Internet in 2005 .
Alforque arrived in Oregon on a visa from the Philippines just three days before the fateful trip to the coast .
The Tillamook County Sheriff 's Office is checking the beach and looking for possible witnesses , Sheriff Todd Anderson said .
Police do n't suspect foul play , he said .
We whetted your appetite with 10 Xbox 360 tricks Microsoft wo n't tell you , now here are seven more handy tips to help you get the best out of your console .
1. System updates by disc
Not got your console online yet , or having trouble downloading the latest dashboard update ?
Try downloading it from a web - connected PC or Mac instead and burning it to a CD .
Grab the latest ( well , latest - ish - hopefully Microsoft will update the page soon ) update from the XBox 360 System Updates page , burn it to disc , then pop that disc into the 360 and turn it on .
You 'll be prompted automatically as to whether you want to run the update .
2 . The towel trick
Bit of a controversial one this , at least as long as you count " possibly burning your house down " as controversial .
What it is is a short - term fix for the infamous red rings of death , the mournful LEDs that announce your 360 is deaded .
There are various theories about why it works , but the important thing is that , for some people , it does .
The way to do it is to wrap the console in a towel or two - ensuring all sides of it are covered - then turn it on and leave it running for 10 minutes or so .
Then turn it off , remove the towels , turn it on again and pray .
If it 's worked , it 'll only stay alive for a few hours , but doing this a couple of times may be enough to get you through those long , lonely days while you wait for Microsoft to collect and replace your dead Xbox .
Again though , it 's dangerous - it could damage the console further , and could cause enough heat to set stuff on fire .
3 . Clear the cache
Is your 360 dawdling along like a gin-addled pensioner ?
It 's possible its hard drive is full up with junk files from old games and downloads - a spring clean could work wonders .
There 's a hidden function to clear out the cache , though be warned it 'll delete any game patches too , so you 'll probably have to redownload a few .
Head to the System blade , select memory , HD , then press Y. Next , hit X , X , Left Bumper , Right Bumper , X and X .
You should get a message about maintenance .
Do n't expect miracles , but if a game 's been slowing down mysteriously lately , this could cure it , plus free up some extra space on your HD .
4. Makeshift web - browsing
Microsoft 's continued refusal to add a web browser to the 360 is infuriating , but there are a few ways to stare at the internet with your console if you 've also got a PC in the house and on the same network , and running either Windows XP Media Center or Vista Home Premium / Ultimate .
There are several ways to do it , but perhaps the easiest is the MCE Browser plug - in .
It 's somewhat limited , but set it up on your Media Center PC then configure your 360 as a Media Extender and you can access your favourite web pages from it .
5. Stream Netflix movies
One for US 360 owners only , this .
Again thanks to Windows Media Center and a free third - party plug - in called vmcNetflix you can save yourself from picking up an expensive set - top box to stream downloaded Netflix movies , as well as being able to manage your queue and set up new downloads from your PC .
Install it , configure your 360 as a Media Center Extender and you 're away .
6. Quieten the damn thing down
The 360's heat issues are well known , but they do n't mean the box has to quite as noisy as it is .
That 's down to Microsoft using the cheapest fans it can get its hands on , which make an awful racket and are quite a distraction when you 're watching a movie .
If you 're prepared to neuter your warranty , you can replace them with near - silent third - party jobs , such as the Talismoon WhisperFan .
Go to real extremes with a complete replacement case , the Lian Li XB - 01 .
Unfortunately , neither of these will silence the roar of the DVD drive , but once the upcoming dashboard update introduces installing games to the console 's hard drive , that 'll be less of a problem .
7. Insert special characters in your gamer profile
Oh , boring , boring text .
Why can't we make our Gamercards a bit flashier ?
Fortunately , there is a way , but unfortunately it involves screwing around with Far Eastern languages .
It 's a bit of a complex process to explain in words alone , but this video made by a helpful soul will guide you through the entire process .

The past 366 days ( happy belated leap year ! ) have been such a roller - coaster ride of apocalyptic dread and yes - we - can positivity that we can all be excused for swapping holiday bubbly for a nice glass of warm milk .
But even for a year that saw both Axl Rose and Kevin Shields emerge from weirdo - exile , there were some blessedly familiar constants :
Albums were released , many of them quite good .
Lil Wayne made 13 of them .
And we all relearned the valuable lesson that a year should be measured not by its highs or lows , but by its delicious creamy center .
[ This list was originally published in the January 2009 issue of SPIN . ]
" It does n't get much more offensive than this , " noted The Inquisitor blog .
" If visiting poor people in remote locations , some who would be at best surviving on below poverty levels and throwing a burger in their faces is n't bad enough , it gets better , because they also ask the Whopper Virgins to compare the taste of the Whopper to a McDonalds Big Mac as well .
Confessions of a Gasoline Huffer How It Happened , Why I Did It , What It Felt Like
Paul Hoppe
Fran Handford was a retired schoolteacher who sat in a rocking chair , smoking long white cigarettes with shaky hands and listening to public radio .
She and her husband Dana lived in the woods on Bainbridge Island , just down the road from my parents .
Dana was tall and thin and drank a glass of buttermilk every day at lunch to keep his weight up .
He saved his pee in a bucket by the back door to pour onto his compost pile .
He was a psychiatrist and had been associated , in the 1950s , with the first American psychiatrists to study psychedelics .
The Handfords had an impressionist landscape over the fireplace , by a friend of theirs .
Fran once pointed at it and said , in her quavering old - lady voice , " I think he painted that after he had taken El - Es - Dee . "
I was their primary gardener and houseboy that summer .
I got $ 8 an hour and a pair of surrogate grandparents .
They sometimes hired additional help : an ex-con named Tony who lived in a halfway house , a 25 - year - old stoner named Eric who still lived with his parents .
As a teenager , I liked being around ex-cons and stoners and always fell for the racy girls who took drugs and skipped class .
( At the time , I was dating a girl who lived in Seattle — even racier .
Sex was still a pleasant mystery , but getting closer every day . )
They made me feel tougher by association .
On Saturdays , I came over to weed , prune , fix , paint , sweep , and mow .
Burn days were the best , when I 'd stand around all afternoon with a rake , watching a fire twice as tall as I was incinerate the detritus from the previous year 's windstorms and yard projects .
The Handfords ' house had peeling red paint and an old wisteria vine strangling the front porch .
Inside , it was like a library where people happened to live .
Books covered and sometimes tumbled off of shelves in every room — the kitchen , the bathroom , the hallways .
There were books on the floor .
They were good books , books Fran encouraged me to read : Slaughterhouse - Five , Mrs. Dalloway , Catch - 22 ; nonfiction by Isaiah Berlin , Arthur Schlesinger , Winston Churchill ; poetry by Dylan Thomas , E. E. Cummings , and T. S. Eliot .
I read on the job , stealing time from them — time I was supposed to be weeding , pruning , and fixing .
They knew :
They were saints that way .
They thought that any time I spent with a book would be good for me .
I took more books from their house than anyone can remember , and dutifully returned them — with one exception .
I was too embarrassed to ask to borrow it .
The book : Altered States of Consciousness : A Book of Readings , a 575 - page collection of essays , written by psychologists and psychiatrists , published in 1969 .
It has a stained white dust jacket with a line drawing of a bald man meditating and some EKG scribbles in black , red , and green .
I crouched in the Handfords ' basement , next to the box where I found it , flipping through its pages .
Some passages were hypnotically opaque , about " autogenic training " and " psychophysiology " and other jargon I did n't understand .
Some were druggy but erudite , like where William James explains how getting high on nitrous oxide helped him " understand better than ever before both the strength and weakness of Hegel 's philosophy . "
Some were just druggy ( I imagined this spoken in a soft man 's voice , like something you 'd hear from a groovy 1960s British movie ) : " Shortly after swallowing the pill , I began to feel the effects .
I was looking at the green grass and green hills of the countryside .
Slowly the green changed into a lavender ...
My body was deep purple .
It was an extremely pleasant sensation .
It resembled sleeping between covers of purple velvet , an experience which I had at one time in my life and which was very sensuously enjoyable . "
I took the book home .
That night , sitting in bed , I read an essay by Dr. Frederick B. Glaser called " Inhalation Psychosis and Related States . "
Dr. Glaser studied people who huffed gasoline , glue , and other organic solvents .
He was a writer whose subjects seemed like characters , entire lives evoked in details .
The child who " used a dispersion principle , distributing gasoline over the surface of a large salad bowl and then inhaling , somewhat after the technique of the brandy snifter . "
The Swedish kids who " placed paint thinner in perfume sprayers and sold sniffs to their habituated classmates . "
The tenacious Texas kid whose parents chained him up to keep him from huffing , but who " broke free by dint of remarkable effort ... the boy achieved newspaper notoriety as ' The Sniffer . ' "
Dr. Glaser had me .
I wondered and began to care , along with him , why research showed a high rate of huffing among Latinos but " in a Chicago study which found Negroes to be well represented among juvenile alcoholics and in the city population , there were no Negro inhalers . "
I was absorbed in the mystery of the weirdo who began huffing when he was 33 .
I wanted to know who these people were , what their lives were like .
They were distant and foreign , people whose lives I could n't imagine .
What did they do every day ?
What did they know that I did n't ?
I wished I could talk to them .
I wished I could join their society .
Like any kid , I wanted secrets , wanted a life of my own .
Now that I 'm almost 30 , I 've got more secrets than I want .
One Saturday at the Handfords ' , I took a squat , silver canister of gas , used to fill the weed whacker , from the shed .
I walked into the woods , sat on a soft bed of brown needles at the bottom of a cedar tree , and unscrewed the lid .
I put my mouth to the aperture and inhaled .
I felt the thick fumes reaching like tentacles down my throat and into my stomach .
There was a strange sound , like the echoing call of a bird I 'd never heard before .
The bird I imagined was dark blue , almost black .
The tree I was sitting beneath began to sway .
The tree became sentient and uprooted itself , and then fell over , grew four legs , and invited me onto its back .
I do n't remember it walking the eight miles to town , but suddenly there we were , in the middle of the street , me straddling a tree .
We were in a parade , like the one that happens on the island every Fourth of July , with vets in their jeeps and farmers on their tractors .
I waved at all the people on the sidewalk , hoping they did n't realize I was high on gasoline .
When I came to and stumbled out of the woods , dazed , my legs were n't working properly .
I lurched back into the garden of perennials I was supposed to be weeding , a garden at the edge of a bluff , and kneeled in the wet mud , hoping nobody would find me .
A few hours later , I could almost walk and talk normally , and went home .
Gasoline was stronger than any drug I 'd heard of — it took me out of the world altogether .
It had to be bad for me .
I remembered histrionic news stories and public - service - announcement language about the dangers of huffing .
A contemporary sample , from www.drgreene.com: " About 22 percent of those who die from huffing do so on the first time they try it ...
When huffing does n't kill quickly , it damages the body each time — especially the brain .
Huffing can cause memory loss , impaired concentration , hearing loss , loss of coordination , and permanent brain damage ... if you suspect or discover that your child is huffing , get professional help .
Treating inhalant abuse is very difficult and requires expert intervention . "
It did n't make sense for me to be a gas huffer .
I was n't desperate like the people in Davis Inlet , on the Labrador coast , who became famous for gas huffing in the early 1990s .
The major pastimes in Davis Inlet were suicide , drinking moonshine , and not graduating from high school .
Families froze inside one - room concrete shacks and domestic violence was common , but Canada did n't do anything about it until 1993 , when a police officer released a videotape of six Davis Inlet children huffing gasoline and screaming that they wanted to die .
The Canadian government 's solution was to build a new town , Natuashish , 15 kilometers away , for residents of Davis Inlet who wanted to start over .
Huffing has been such a problem among Australian aboriginal kids that , in 2005 , the oil company BP invented a new kind of " unsniffable " fuel called Opal .
( The BP website quotes an e-mail from a social worker : " ... as I write , I can see a 10 - year - old girl outside the window with half a Coke bottle filled with unleaded petrol tied over her mouth and nose .
She may well never reach her 12th birthday . " )
Consider that :
So many people were huffing that a multinational oil company told its scientists to invent a new kind of gas .
I was n't a poor kid , but I 'd seen poor kids fucked up by huffing , during the spring before my gasoline summer , when I was an exchange student in Nicaragua .
I visited a shelter for urchins , some of them little tiny kids , who wandered the markets of Managua , begging for pennies to spend on baby - food jars filled with rubber cement they bought from shoe repairmen .
The glue made them feel warm , full , and happy — the opposite of how they normally felt .
It also made them vicious .
They had nasty fights over food , territory , and imagined slights , slashing at each other with shards of broken glass .
The kids in the shelter were covered in scars and nicks .
All of us — the urchins , the people who took care of them , some other exchange students — took a bus to Lake Nicaragua one afternoon .
We ran around on the beach and splashed in the brown water .
On the way back , I sat in the back of the bus , teaching the kids poker .
They stole my wallet and passed it to the front , one of them waving it in the air and smiling before throwing it back to me .
I said I thought it was funny , but one of the social workers — a pretty , middle - aged woman — rebuked me .
These kids learn to steal because they 're addicts , she growled .
And the goddamned shoe repairmen are goddamned pushers .
There 's nothing cute about children addicted to toxic solvents .
The next Saturday , I snuck back into the shed and sat next to the squat silver canister .
I unscrewed the cap , leaned over the aperture , felt the vaporous tentacles reach into my stomach , and heard the call of the dark - blue bird .
A small fairy girl , as tall as my forearm , appeared .
She did n't make any real words , but communicated by telepathy and giggling and I admired her wings , all translucent and shiny .
She lived in the rose bushes and let me know that these gardens and woods were a special place , a place I 'd never been able to really see until now .
There was another sound , in a minor key , and the air turned sinister .
The toys and tools in the shed — tricycles , pruners , riding lawn mowers — were rumbling , rustling angrily , forming an army that could crush me with wheels , cut me with blades , bludgeon me with handles .
I was an interloper , a spy in the secret , vengeful lives of toys and tools .
I hoped they would n't hurt the Rosebush Fairy .
I came to , lying on the floor of the shed , thinking that we lived in a world in which objects conspired against people .
I held onto the idea for a while .
It was the same every Saturday for three or four months : the rasp of the lid as I unscrewed it , the sloshing gasoline , the tentacles reaching into my stomach , the dark - blue bird .
The Rosebush Fairy usually came to giggle and preen and communicate fairy - tale secrets about the forests and gardens .
I wish I could remember the things she told me .
My breath stunk of gasoline for days at a time .
I 'd come back from the Handfords ' and my mother would ask where that gasoline smell was coming from .
I 'd say I 'd been using the weed whacker , quickly finish my glass of water , and hurry upstairs to shower .
Later , at dinner , she 'd mention I still smelled like gasoline .
I 'd shrug .
The next day , I might see my girlfriend who lived in the city .
When she kissed me , she 'd say my mouth tasted like a gas station .
Somehow , nobody figured it out .
One Saturday after work , I was at my parents ' house listening to old records —
I 'd just learned how to work the phonograph and there were stacks of neglected vinyl in the Handfords ' basement — when I distinctly heard the call of the dark - blue bird .
It came out of the speakers .
I checked the record .
The call of the bird matched the first chord of Bach 's second orchestral suite in B minor , when the violins begin to trill over the harpsichord .
I wondered what that meant .
I thought about the Rosebush Fairy .
I realized I had a crush on her , which was both embarrassing and crazy .
Even crazier , I wondered :
What about my girlfriend ?
Was I cheating on her by liking this fairy ?
I was n't doing anything with the fairy , just talking .
Upstairs , I re-reread Dr. Glaser 's essay and stopped on this sentence , which I had barely noticed before : " On a rather impressionistic level it may be noted that a general feeling of eroticism pervades many reports of inhalation . "
Likewise , I stopped on the story of a 5 - year - old boy who
had a pleasant hallucination of friendly , gnomelike men who were fond of him and spoke kindly to him .
At this time , parental discord was intense .
The patient felt like his father was abusive and severe with him .
' Father heckled me and gave my mother and me heck at everything I did . '
Because of this , he began to plot with the men of his hallucinations to remove his father .
He said , ' I want to make Father go away so I can go off someplace with Mom and we can make a living together and be happy on a farm . '
His hallucinations promised to help him if he would never call again .
Quite by coincidence , the father left on a three weeks ' trip about this time .
Wish fulfillment .
The kid had his gnomes .
And I was having an affair with a fairy .
At some point that summer , I was at a typically druggy high - school party , with beer in the kitchen , cigarettes on the lawn , and a bunch of people sitting in a circle in the bedroom with a lava lamp , passing around a pot pipe .
The house belonged to a waitress from Spokane and an aspiring acid dealer .
These were n't really my friends , but I was happy to be included .
Next to me on the couch was Jim , who had studs in his jacket and played guitar in a Bainbridge Island band and was on the high - school debate team .
I wanted to say something to him , but I did n't know what , so I asked if he had ever huffed gasoline .
His laugh said : Oh yeah — gasoline .
My old friend .
I told him about the secret walks into the woods , the hallucinations — everything except the Rosebush Fairy .
That was too embarrassing .
" How could a drug be that powerful ? " I asked .
" Like I 'm right out of my head ? "
" Um , " he said , " it makes cars go . "
One Saturday , my racy girlfriend came from the city to visit me after I finished work .
Like every Saturday when everyone else thought I was working , I 'd been in the woods huffing .
I 'd unscrewed the lid , heard the call of the dark - blue bird , and seen the Rosebush Fairy .
She 'd giggled , showed me her wings , but seemed different somehow .
She was n't happy and ethereal — she was weirdly flirty and erotic .
She batted her eyes , wiggled her ass , and leered .
She was hungry and gross , a portent from the adult future of crude , selfish sex .
She did n't want to communicate secrets or even kiss me — she wanted to fuck .
I was n't sure how to fuck .
It was horrifying .
Then she lifted her skirt over her head .
If I were n't in a stupor , I would 've screamed .
I 'd known what I was doing was dangerous — that inhaling gasoline , that thing that makes cars go , was probably giving me brain damage .
But , until this moment , I 'd almost hoped it would give me brain damage .
Putting my mouth to the metal aperture and feeling the tentacles reaching down my throat was an attempt to stay innocent and dumb , to spare myself the sadness and disenchantment of growing up .
Getting my first pubic hair fucked me up .
Pubic hair meant puberty , puberty meant adulthood , and adulthood meant pain , suffering , and death .
I was sentimental for childhood even while I was still a child .
Gasoline was a way to dodge the flat , sterile doom of adulthood .
I wanted to stay in the woods .
I stumbled out of the woods and saw my girlfriend .
She was just standing there .
She 'd come early .
My legs would n't work , my tongue was too thick to form words , and I could n't do anything but feel bad .
She did n't know anything about my gasoline habit except having tasted it in my mouth .
She watched me lurch around on the grass , gabbling , reeking of fumes .
She panicked .
She cried .
I tried to explain , but she did n't understand and neither did I .
One night six months ago , I was sitting outdoors in Eastern Washington , in a circle with some friends , and the conversation failed .
One drunk woman said , all in one breath : " Let'stellsecretsIstealthings . "
She paused .
" I shoplift . "
We went around the circle and people unloaded their secrets : eavesdropping on sex , reading other people 's diaries .
When it was my turn , I knew which secret I wanted to unload , the one I did n't want anymore — I 'd never talked about gasoline huffing with anyone except that guy at that party years ago , never told anyone about Altered States of Consciousness or the Rosebush Fairy or how , to this day , the opening chord of Bach 's second orchestral suite makes me woozy .
But I did n't .
I held onto it a little longer .
I told another secret , one I was n't genuinely embarrassed about .
The Handfords died a few years ago , but I still have Altered States of Consciousness .
It sits on a lower shelf in a bookcase in my closet .
That shelf is for embarrassments from my youth — forgotten magazines that published stories I 'd written , notebooks full of childish poems and adolescent confessions , scrapbooks with pictures of ex-girlfriends .
It 's the shelf where I keep things I wish I could get rid of .

By Barry Healy & Annolies Truman , Caracas
November 22 , 2008 -- Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez called for a “ revolution within the revolution ” at an 8000 strong United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) rally here on November 18 .
Chavez called upon the PSUV ranks to hold successful PSUV candidates to account if they failed to act in the interests of the people after the election .
The rally was organised to inspire PSUV organisers and local committee members in the lead - up to the vote for state governors and local government positions on November 23 .
Poliedro Stadium , on the edge of Caracas , was a sea of red T - shirts and banners , and echoed with energetic revolutionary singing and chanting .
Contingents of local PSUV battalions and international solidarity groups from Argentina , Peru and Australia listened to Jorge Rodriguez , PSUV candidate for mayor of the Caracas municipality of Liberatador , and candidate for mayor of Greater Caracas , Aristobulo Isturiz .
Rodriguez was Venezuelan vice - president during 2007 , while Isturiz is a former education minister .
Rally participants were urged to ensure the maximum turnout for voting on November 23 .
Rodriguez claimed that the PSUV had made a mistake in relation to the December 2007 constitutional reform referendum campaign by giving insufficient attention to turning out the voting support base .
The opposition won a narrow victory against Chavez ’s proposed reforms — that aimed to help open the way towards socialism — when close to 3 million people who voted for Chavez in the 2006 presidential elections abstained from the referendum .
Isturiz stressed the political and programatic content of the campaign , contrasting it with bourgeois marketing campaigns .
He said PSUV activists need to construct an alternative to the capitalist model that is credible and sustainable .
“ We need to end poverty and social exclusion .
Public spaces need to be accessible to all ” , he said .
He also argued that the PSUV campaign has an internationalist outlook .
The crowd greeted Chavez with loud enthusiasm .
“ Get up early on Sunday ” , he said .
“ We have to be as organised as we were for the 1998 presidential election [ when Chavez first won office ] . ”
At the end of his speech he lifted two children up to the podium .
“ We need Bolivar ’s vision of a Gran Colombia [ united Latin America ] so these children and all children can have a future ” , Chavez said .

Venezuela : Socialist campaign gathers momentum as vote nears
By Jim McIlroy & Coral Wynter , Caracas
November 21 , 2008 --
At a mass rally of PSUV activists in the Poliedro Stadium on November 18 , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez called for “ Operation Round Up ” to gather the maximum number of votes for candidates of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) in the November 23 elections for state governors and municipal mayors .
The enthusiastic rally of around 8000 were attending the final meeting of the PSUV campaign in the Caracas region , preparing for the last days of organising before polling day .
“ If we have done what we had to do , if we have touched base with the people , if we have used the right tactics … if we have convinced those who were not convinced , if the logistics are properly organised , if the red campaign has been strong enough … then we could win all the governors ” , Chavez told the crowd , according to the November 19 Ultimas Noticias .
“ The people in the street , together with the National Armed Forces , are the guarantors that the result of the popular vote will be respected ” , Chavez added .
This meeting followed the final mass march and rally in central Caracas on November 15 , which attracted tens of thousands of PSUV supporters who gathered at five points in the city and marched to Plaza O´Leary in the inner suburb of Silencio .
The crowd applauded speeches by PSUV candidates Aristibulo Isturiz for mayor of Greater Caracas and Jorge Rodriquez for mayor of the huge municipality of Libertador .
They also danced to Chavista bands and responded to rousing chants and rap music .
At a huge rally in the oil - rich and hotly contested state of Zulia on November 16 , Chavez urged the people to “ liberate the region ” , which has been ruled by corrupt , right - wing opposition leader Manuel Rosales .
Chavez called for support for the PSUV candidate for governor , Gian Carlo Di Martino .
At a separate campaign meeting in Zulia the same day , Di Martino declared that if he won , “ the first 100 days of government would be aimed at repairing the damage caused by Manuel Rosales ” , the November 17 Diario Vea reported .
The November 15 Ultimas Noticias reported that at a November 14 mass meeting in the state of Anzoategui , Chavez warned the corporate media : “ No one is allowed to announce the results of the November 23 elections before the CNE ( National Electoral Commission ) .
If any communications media act before the official closure , they will be taken off the air . ”
While maintaining a hectic pace of election campaigning , Chavez has also been opening public projects , as part of the revolutionary Bolivarian government ’s program of expanding social and economic development in the country .
Inaugurating a new milk plant in the state of Barinas , Chavez described socialist economic development as “ a school for the transformation of the human spirit and consciousness ” .
This process creates workers who are “ conscious workers , not alienated workers ” , he said , according to the November 17 Diario Vea .
Such development “ produces the new human being , and the new society — socialism ” .
Chavez announced that the government would soon build 11 more milk processing plants similar to that in Barinas , which was established with the assistance of the Iranian government .
The November 16 Diario Vea also reported Chavez ’s speech at a graduation ceremony for tertiary students studying as part of Mission Sucre on November 15 .
Chavez described Mission Sucre ( a government program which has provided more than 350,000 Venezuelans with free university education since 2003 ) as “ the spirit of the Bolivarian Revolution ” .
The previous day , the president had opened a new fish - processing factory in the port of Puerto Cabello in Carabobo state , declaring that such projects were essential for the progress of the revolution .

Pictured :
The mystery pink light that appeared over London
While a pink sky at night might be a shepherd 's delight , London residents were left scratching their heads last night as a mysterious pink cloud drifted over the city .
Bemused bystanders in Mayfair craned their necks to witness the strange alien - like cloud that appeared for just under an hour at around 8:30 pm .
It hovered over buildings before breaking up and slowly disappearing .

Let there be light :

But after dismissing theories of UFOs and atmospheric phenomenons , the Met Office said the blob was likely to be nothing more than the lights of the city reflected in a cloud .
A spokesman said : " If you have very high cloud , as we did last night , you tend to get odd splodges of low cloud that will reflect the pink or sometimes orangey - pink lights of the city from all angles and stand out from the darkness of the sky .
" It can be truly spectacular to witness . "

“ We all want our children to feel safe in this world , ” said Meryl Chertoff , wife of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff , at a ceremony held at the John Tyler Elementary School to announce the partnership .
When it comes to securing the homeland , who better to help you sleep at night than various characters from the popular children ’s show , “ Sesame Street ” … ?!?
Seriously .
In a move that will make Bush administration detractors bring back those duct tape jokes again , the Department of Homeland Security has partnered up with the famous children ’s show .
“ We all want our children to feel safe in this world , ” said Meryl Chertoff , wife of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff , at a ceremony held at the John Tyler Elementary School to announce the partnership .
“ And who better to do that than our Sesame Street friends , Grover and Rosita ! ”
“ I always knew that [ Mr. and Mrs. Chertoff ] would be big muppet Muppett supporters ! ” said Sesame Workshop CEO Gary Knell .
As you can imagine , the partnership is aimed at children , and seeks to encourage family preparedness plans in the case of emergencies .
“ Family preparedness is the cornerstone of personal and community readiness , ” said Secretary Chertoff in a statement ( he was scheduled to attend the event , but has been busy handling the aftermath of Hurricane Ike in Texas ) .
“ And we could not be more pleased to team up with Sesame Workshop . ”

For the US trade deficit to fall ( setting the effect of falling oil prices aside ) , exports have to grow faster than imports -- or imports have to fall faster than exports .
If exports fall faster than imports , the deficit will stay large .
In September , the headline deficit fell because the petrol deficit fell .
The petrol deficit has gone from $ 43 billion In July to $ 35.6 b in August and $ 32.1 b in September as the average price of imported oil fell from $ 125 a barrel to $ 108 a barrel .
That alone generated a $ 10 billion improvement in the trade balance -- and there is more good news to come .
Especially if the US continues to import 5 % less oil even after the prices come down .
But the non-petrol goods deficit is now moving in the wrong direction .
It increased from $ 29.3 b in June to $ 35.6 b in August .
Non-petrol exports fell by $ 9.9 b over the last two months , while non-petrol imports fell by " only " $ 3.7 billion .
The sharp fall in exports shows up clearly in a chart showing " real " non-petrol goods exports and imports .
Real data tries to show what is happening if changes in price are taken out of the equation -- it is meant to measure the actual quantity of stuff that is traded .
The fall in real goods exports has been steep enough to push the real non-petrol trade deficit back up .
And remember this is the September data .
Since then the global outlook has deteriorated -- and the dollar has strengthened substantially .
That is n’t going to help US exports .
The main reason why the US should support more emergency lending to the worlds ’ emerging economies is pure self - interest : if their currencies continue to fall , the US is n’t going to be able to rely on exports to help it get out its own domestic troubles .
There is one small bit of hope .
The monthly data jumps around a lot .
Two months do not a trend make -- though in this case , the falloff in exports is almost certainly directionally right .
But the pace of the fall could reflect some month - to - month noise .
Civil aircraft exports fell from $ 5.5 b in August to $ 2.2b in September ( Boeing strike ? ) .
So long as the Gulf and India and China do n’t cancel their Boeing orders , civil aircraft exports should n’t fall by quite that much .
Average monthly aircraft exports this year have been around $ 4b .
Two other things to watch :
One , will US exports to Latin America hold up .
Y/y growth for the first three quarters of 2008 was 37 % ...
Two , what will happen to the US deficit with China .
Y/y exports are up $ 17 % while imports are only up 7 % .
But given the gap between what the US imports from China and what it exports to China , that works out to $ 16 b in new imports and a little over $ 8 b in new exports , so the bilateral deficit is still growing .
However , if both import and export growth turn down , the fact that the US does n’t sell much to China ( absolutely ) would start to work in the United States favor .
Or to put it differently , a fall in US demand hurts China more than a fall in Chinese demand hurts the US .
At least directly .
Watch out for the rebound .
Falling Chinese demand for Brazilian iron ore and soybeans could mean less Brazilian demand for US manufactured goods ...

Earlier today , the Our Country Deserves Better PAC concluded its nationwide “ Stop Obama ” tour with a press conference at the National Press Club in downtown Washington DC .
The speakers — who included a conservative talk radio host , a Marine mom , and the singer of a Sarah Palin tribute song entitled “ Sarah Smile ” — and their supporters gave voice to all of the paranoias that have come to grip the conservative base in the closing days of the campaign .
Obama is an authoritarian thug who will deny First Amendment rights if he is made president ; he attacks anyone who speaks against him ; he will put the country at risk of terrorist attack ; he will make America a socialist state ; he wants to give American money to Africa ; he himself may be foreign - born .
Herewith , a collection of all the things of which Barack Obama stood accused :
– He does n’t understand that inalienable rights granted by God are what make America great .
America is a shining * city on a hill and “ there are those around Barack Obama who would extinguish those lights . ”
– He and his supporters “ vilify ” anyone who questions him .
– He “ mocked ” and “ laughed at ” Joe the Plumber at a recent rally because Joe thought he could make $ 250,000 despite being a plumber .
– He is having talk show hosts who speak out against him “ slaughtered , ” by having Obama - friendly advertisers pull their contracts .
– He very likely will take away dissenters ’ right to free speech if elected president , keeping them from publishing their views in the newspaper or from voicing them on television and radio .
This is in part due to the “ storm troopers around him . ”
– He benefits from the fact that voters who oppose him are hesitant to declare their feelings publicly , for “ fear of being attacked at their place of work , or in their homes , or their children being retaliated against in school . ”
– He will try to “ extinguish ” our freedom of speech .
Reporters who question Obama and Biden are already being “ silenced . ”
– He has n’t come clean about his birth certificate or the country of his birth .
While the speakers said they did not want to put on their “ tin foil hat ” and speculate about the nation of Obama ’s birth , one said he would give only “ even money ” that Obama was born in the United States .
– He would probably have trouble passing the tests required to become an FBI agent .
His associations make him unfit for office .
– He wants to use the Global Poverty Act to give $ 800 billion of US taxpayers ’ money to poor countries , “ mostly Africa . ”
– He does not understand the plight of military families .
Unlike John McCain and Sarah Palin , he does not have a son serving in Iraq .
– He had the opportunity to join the military during the first Gulf War .
Instead “ he went to the University of Phoenix to write books about himself . ”
– He is supported by leftist leaders in South America , Muammar Quaddafi , and the “ maniac from Iran . ”
– He has “ crazy ideas , dangerous ideas in dealing with those who would like to lop our heads off . ”
– He continues to ignore the fact that we did find WMDs in Iraq .
In fact , 500 tons of WMDS were transferred out of Iraq this year .
– He has no record from the Illinois State Senate .
He has no record from the federal Senate .
He never introduced major legislation “ probably because he is too busy writing books about his life and convincing us he should be president . ”
– He is the most liberal Senator in the US Senate .
– He “ breathes air and fluff and words . ”
– He is at most qualified for middle management .
Yet he as the “ audacity to hope ” we will make him president of the United States .
– His vice presidential pick is like “ training wheels on a tricycle . ”
– His presidency “ will change America as know it and love it , and not in a good way . ”
– He would create an America characterized by “ socialism and servitude . ”
– He seeks to deny the American dream through wealth distribution .
– He is part of a “ repo team ” with Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi .
– He can not talk about the needs of small business owners .
He has never run a small business .
– He has the middle class “ in his sights . ”
– He comes out of the Chicago Democratic machine , which spells politics M - O - B .
– He benefits from a biased liberal media .
The LA Times , the NY Times , and the Washington Post are “ organs of the Obama campaign . ”
– He does n’t finish what he starts .
He began as a lecturer at the University of Chicago , but did n’t become a full professor .
He was a lawyer , but never became a partner .
– He “ believes he is entitled to the president of the United States . ”
* Corrected .
About four months ago , FOX News ( yes , I know ) floated an oddly low - profile story about the nearly - forgotten anthrax bioterrorism attacks of late 2001 :
The FBI has narrowed its focus to " about four " suspects in the 6 1/2 - year investigation of the deadly anthrax attacks of 2001 , and at least three of those suspects are linked to the Army ’s bioweapons research facility at Fort Detrick in Maryland , FOX News has learned .
Among the pool of suspects are three scientists — a former deputy commander , a leading anthrax scientist and a microbiologist — linked to the research facility , known as USAMRIID .
The FBI has collected writing samples from the three scientists in an effort to match them to the writer of anthrax - laced letters that were mailed to two U.S. senators and at least two news outlets in the fall of 2001 , a law enforcement source confirmed .
[ snip ] ... in an e-mail obtained by FOX News , scientists at Fort Detrick openly discussed how the anthrax powder they were asked to analyze after the attacks was nearly identical to that made by one of their colleagues .
" Then he said he had to look at a lot of samples that the FBI had prepared ... to duplicate the letter material , " the e-mail reads .
" Then the bombshell .
He said that the best duplication of the material was the stuff made by [ name redacted ] .
He said that it was almost exactly the same ... his knees got shaky and he sputtered , ' But I told the General we did n't make spore powder ! ' "
When I wrote about the story , I concluded with the thought that this " new development " was n't really news , that it was only slightly more specific than what we already knew ( see the background included in my post ) .
Well , in light of yesterday 's revelation , it looks like FOX might have had something :
A top government scientist who helped the FBI analyze samples from the 2001 anthrax attacks has died in Maryland from an apparent suicide , just as the Justice Department was about to file criminal charges against him for the attacks , the Los Angeles Times has learned .
Bruce E. Ivins , 62 , who for the last 18 28 * years worked at the government 's elite biodefense research laboratories at Ft. Detrick , Md. , had been informed of his impending prosecution , said people familiar with Ivins , his suspicious death and the FBI investigation .
* LA Times correction .
The story is anything but simple .
For years , the investigation focused on Stephen Hatfill as a " person of interest " .
However :
The extraordinary turn of events followed the government 's payment in June of a settlement valued at $ 5.82 million to a former government scientist , Steven J. Hatfill , who was long targeted as the FBI 's chief suspect despite a lack of any evidence that he had ever possessed anthrax .
The payout to Hatfill , a highly unusual development that all but exonerated him in the mailings , was an essential step to clear the way for prosecuting Ivins , according to lawyers familiar with the matter .
As the LA Times reports it , Ivins was just what the FBI was looking for .
Ivins , employed as a civilian at Ft. Detrick , earlier had attracted the attention of Army officials because of anthrax contaminations that Ivins failed to report for five months .
In sworn oral and written statements to an Army investigator , Ivins said that he had erred by keeping the episodes secret -- from December 2001 to late April 2002 .
He said he had swabbed and bleached more than 20 areas that he suspected were contaminated by a sloppy lab technician .
We have no idea what Ivins ' motives were .
He is alternately described in the press as everything from " a family man " to " a revenge killer " .
He is described as a dedicated scientist .
And he is n't really described at all by the FBI .
We just do n't know anything :
The Justice Department said Friday it had made " substantial progress " in the investigation of the 2001 anthrax attacks , but officials declined to comment on a report in The [ Los Angeles ]
Times that the department was about to bring the first criminal charges for the attacks against a Maryland man who died this week .
We deserve better .
As Glenn Greenwald said in his excellent ( and extensive ) analysis , not only was the FBI 's investigation dangerously sidetracked from the start , but the media 's involvement in the distraction has been extensive , when the culprit quite possibly has been under our noses , employed by the federal government , the whole time :
From the beginning , there was a clear intent on the part of the anthrax attacker to create a link between the anthrax attacks and both Islamic radicals and the 9/11 attacks ...
Much more important than the general attempt to link the anthrax to Islamic terrorists , there was a specific intent -- indispensably aided by ABC News -- to link the anthrax attacks to Iraq and Saddam Hussein .
In my view , and I 've written about this several times and in great detail to no avail , the role played by ABC News in this episode is the single greatest , unresolved media scandal of this decade .
News of Ivins ' suicide , which means ( presumably ) that the anthrax attacks originated from Ft. Detrick , adds critical new facts and heightens how scandalous ABC News ' conduct continues to be in this matter .
Finally , let 's turn to the broader national security implications .
Dr. Alan Pearson , Ph.D is the Director of the Biological and Chemical Weapons Control Program at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation .
He is an expert on bioweapons and biodefense , and has expressed concern about the biosecurity risks involved in research with select agents , particularly bioweapons agents .
He expressed his concerns about laboratory oversight before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations in October 2007 , mentioning in particular that " [ N ] or should we ignore the possibility that a US biologist may become disgruntled or turn rogue while working in one of these labs . "
His statement on Ivins ' death and the FBI investigation is exactly on the mark :
" The FBI must not let the death of Bruce Ivins deter it from completing a full and thorough investigation of the attacks , " said Pearson .
" The chance to prove Ivins ' guilt before a court of law has been lost , but the need for a thorough investigation and a full accounting to the American people remains . "
CNN reported today that the FBI will soon close the case " because a threat no longer exists . "
Pearson says that the number one question still to determine is whether Ivins was responsible for the attacks and , if so , whether he acted alone and with complete secrecy .
" If Ivins was indeed responsible for the attacks , did he have any assistance ?
Did anyone else at the Army lab or elsewhere have any knowledge of his activities prior to , during , or shortly after the anthrax attacks ? " questioned Pearson .
" The FBI must see this investigation through to completion . "
Pearson added that if it is established that Ivins or anyone else working at the government 's biodefense lab at Fort Detrick , Maryland produced the anthrax used in the attacks or diverted anthrax powder from the lab 's stocks , the implications would be significant .
" It appears increasingly likely that the only significant bioterrorism attack in history may have originated from right within the biodefense program of our own country , " said Pearson .
" The implications for our understanding of the bioterrorism threat and for our entire biodefense strategy and enterprise are potentially profound . "
Doubtless , Friday 's revelations will generate a plethora of conspiracy theories , but who needs conspiracy theories ?
In other words , an ominous picture is starting to reveal itself , and it has nothing to do with a nefarious government plot .
It has to do with the much broader implications of the event , that a massive biosecurity breach occurred , and a scientist with access to extremely dangerous materials " went rogue " .
" Potentially profound " is an understatement .
CHEYENNE , Wyo . ( AP ) 
A report by the Wyoming chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union contends that the federal Forest Service has engaged in systematic harassment of people who attend Rainbow Family gatherings on public lands .
The A.C.L.U. opened an investigation this summer after a clash on July 3 between members of the Rainbow Family , an informal group of professed hippies and peace activists , and Forest Service law enforcement officers .
About 7,000 members of the group attended its annual gathering this summer , held in the Bridger - Teton National Forest near Big Sandy in western Wyoming .
Forest Service law enforcement officers fired pepper balls  like paint balls but containing a pepper substance  at Rainbow Family members during the incident .

Like Karl
Rove eight year ago , some progressives are now proclaiming a new era of American politics .
Dems talk of ‘ permanent progressive majority ’
Echoing Karl Rove 's words from four years ago , Democratic pollsters on Friday touted the creation of a “ permanent progressive majority . ”
“ This was not just a change election , but a sea- change election , ” Robert Borosage , co-director of the Campaign for America ’s Future , said during remarks at the National Press Club .
“ This is the end of the conservative era . ”

“ What you ’re seeing in the nation is the emergence of a center - left majority , ” Borosage continued .
“ We are witnessing the creation of a permanent progressive majority . ”
Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg agreed , saying that the United States is now “ in a progressive period . ”
“ The conservative movement brought about by the Gingrich revolution has been crushed , ” he said .
Greenberg pointed to exit polls conducted by his firm , Greenberg Quinlan Rosner , showing that Democrats hold a significant edge over Republicans on the issues on which most voters based their decision on Election Day .
“ Area after area people have tilted toward the progressive policy , ” Greenberg said pointing specifically to the economy , the war in Iraq , energy and healthcare .
“ There has been a change in the way we think about society and the economy , and Democrats have a huge advantage . ”
Shortly after the GOP ’s triumphant 2004 election , Rove heralded the beginning of a “ permanent Republican majority . ”
After the win , Republicans , at the direction of Rove , began looking for ways to expand the tent , specifically reaching out to black and Hispanic voters .
But the Republican Party ’s effort to expand its coalition collapsed not long after Rove ’s declaration , as continued bad news from Iraq , a failed response to Hurricane Katrina and charges of corruption on Capitol Hill sunk the GOP ’s prospects in 2006 , a trend that continued in 2008 .
The groups Democrats were successfully able to court in 2008 , including Hispanics , single women , Asians and youth voters , are a growing part of a electorate , said Greenberg , while the base voters Republicans have depended on have become a proportionately smaller part of it .
“ A lot of Republican voters were brought in with gimmicks , ” the pollster said .
“ They had their base and then would try to pick off specific groups of voters on narrow issues . ”
Greenberg insisted meanwhile that those who voted for Obama “ share a world view . ”
“ I would be stunned if there is a disagreement within the Democratic Party about what this election means , ” he said .
Still , Democrats are already studying the decline of the GOP even as they celebrate this week ’s historic election .
“ The Obama administration must undertake a dramatic change agenda , ” Greenberg said .
“ Failure in the real world counts , and that ’s a cautionary tale for Democrats . ” andy
Earlier this month , just before most Christians would mark the birth of their saviour , a group of scholars gathered in Amherst , N.Y. to begin pondering a simple yet combustible question : Did Jesus exist ?
It 's an issue heavy with theological baggage and poised to offend more than a few Christians : Polls by University of Lethbridge sociologist Reginald Bibby in his latest book The Boomer Factor show two out of three Canadians believe Jesus is the divine son of God .
By now , the whole question might seem tired , almost banal .
Former Toronto Star religion writer Tom Harpur certainly won recognition , and notoriety , for arguing in his explosive 2004 book The Pagan Christ , that Jesus was a legend rooted in Egyptian myths thousands of years before the Gospels were written ( though that was not a new position ) .
But over the past 150 years of efforts to find the historical Jesus , the vast majority of scholars have settled on the baseline belief that a Jewish teacher from Galilee named Yeshua did indeed live some 2,000 years ago , and spoke about the Kingdom of God .
Even so , the Jesus Project is proceeding from point zero , billing itself as " the first methodologically agnostic approach " to the question of Jesus 's historical existence .
It promises " the most rigorous methods , data , and open debate . "
An initiative of the Center for Inquiry , an Amherst - based secular think tank , and its Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion ( CSER ) , the project is an extension of the no-less controversial Jesus Seminar , which has been convening twice annually for 23 years .
There 's one key difference :
Whereas the Seminar has operated on the premise that Jesus was an actual person – it was what he said and did that is up for grabs – the scholars in this latest effort regard Jesus 's existence as a " testable hypothesis . "
With a core group of 20 scholars , the project is the first joint effort by historians , biblical scholars , archeologists , textual authorities , theologians and other experts to determine " what can be reliably recovered about the historical figure of Jesus , his life , his teachings , and his activities , utilizing the highest standards of scientific and scholarly objectivity . "
Like judges in a courtroom , project members will sift through mountains of material to ascertain what evidence is admissible , stripping away theological and mythical accretions .
" We believe in assessing the quality of the evidence available for looking at this question before seeing what the evidence has to tell us , " writes project chair R. Joseph Hoffman , an historian of religion at State University of New York , on the initiative 's website .
The scholars say they do not believe their task is to produce a " plausible " portrait of Jesus prior to considering the motives the Gospel writers had in telling his story , and their intended audience .
At least two Canadian scholars are involved : Arthur Droge of the University of Toronto and Philippa Carter of McMaster University in Hamilton .
To run for five years , the project will inevitably risk comparison to the controversial Jesus Seminar , a think tank founded in 1985 by New Testament scholars John Dominic Crossan and the late Robert Funk , and which became famous , Hoffman charges , " for all the wrong reasons . "
Among other oddities , the Seminar was known for its unusual voting methods :
Fellows used coloured marbles to determine whether Jesus said or did something attributed to him in biblical texts .
Red was for " virtually certain , " pink for " probably reliable , " grey for " possible but unreliable , and black for " improbable . "
The results stunned – and angered – millions .
The scholars decided Jesus uttered just 31 sayings , or 18 per cent of what is attributed to him in the Bible .
A similar rate was found for the deeds ascribed to him : Just 29 of 176 acts were certain or likely .
The Seminar also rejected the very foundations of Christianity :
There was no virgin birth , no resurrection or transfiguration , and Jesus performed no miracles .
He was little more than an itinerant Jewish sage who preached a social gospel using parables and aphorisms .
Many Christians derided the Seminar 's findings as the product of liberal scholars , and even a little silly .
Undeniably , it was media - friendly , and whetted the public 's appetite for more on the historical Jesus .
But to Hoffman and other scholars , the Seminar reduced Jesus to " a talking doll with a questionable repertoire of 31 sayings .
Pull a string and he blesses the poor . "
The Jesus Project plans a more comprehensive and sober approach – with no marbles – that extends to examining the history , literature and culture of Jesus 's time and place .

The project aims to examine and date all relevant sources – not just the books of Matthew , Mark , Luke and John , but also the Dead Sea Scrolls , found in 1948 , and the " lost " or Gnostic Gospels , unearthed at Nag Hamada , Egypt in 1945 , and which depict a very different Jesus than the New Testament .
Classical sources with tantalizing references to Jesus and nascent Christian communities , such as the writings of Flavius Josephus , Tacitus and Pliny the Younger , will also be considered .
Christians , evangelical and otherwise , should be guarded about this new quest since such searches for Jesus " are usually marred by guesswork , bias against miracles and a reductionist approach to history , " argues James Beverley , a professor at Toronto 's evangelical Tyndale Seminary .
Belief that Jesus existed " is not a matter of faith alone , " Beverley claims , and Christians have nothing to fear from " solid , careful historical work . "
But the new quest will only succeed only if it is " open to the clear historical presence of Jesus in the New Testament , the earliest documents about him . "
German scholars of the 19th century were among the first to raise questions about the historical veracity of the Bible and Jesus .
So why this endeavour now , and why Jesus ?
After 2,000 years , Jesus remains " the most fascinating figure of Western civilization , " enthuses project member James Tabor , and scholars at the beginning of the 21st century are uniquely positioned to take advantage of a plethora of new texts , sources , and methods .
But what does the Jesus Project mean for the larger , secular society in which the carpenter from Nazareth still plays an important role ?
As a review of Harpur 's book on these pages noted , Jesus ( or Christ ) , after all , is a universal archetype known essentially by all humanity .
Will this effort re-mythologize or de-mythologize him ?
Hoffman replies that even the fiercest critics of Christianity have viewed the historical Jesus , or traditions and myths about him , as essentially benign or even beneficial .

This wo n't be the final word on the subject .

Last week , the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors approved the use of the state ’s medical - marijuana ID card in the county .
There ’s really no reason to thank them ; the ID card was mandated by the state Legislature in 2003 and had already been approved by 42 out of the state ’s 59 counties , including Fresno , for Christ ’s sake .
By not enacting it , the supervisors were thwarting the will of the electorate and the Legislature .
Apparently , only the prospects of a lawsuit by medical - marijuana advocates convinced a majority of the supes to pass the ordinance 4 - 1 .
So there ’s really no reason to thank them .
But then again , there ’s no reason to blame them .
Twelve years ago , I did n’t believe the seemingly grandiose claims of medicinal pot use , either .
Back in 1996 , when proponents of Proposition 215 , the Compassionate Use Act , were pushing for the legalization of medical marijuana in the state of California , I pegged them all for a bunch of stoners attempting to back - door the legalization of cannabis by tugging on the electorate ’s heartstrings .
This mainly had to do with the fact that most of the medical - marijuana advocates I encountered were stoners .
Not that there ’s anything wrong with that .
At any rate , voters overwhelmingly approved Prop. 215 , which permits the use of cannabis for treating “ cancer , anorexia , AIDS , chronic pain , spasticity , glaucoma , arthritis , migraine or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief . ”
That ’s a lot of territory , and I scoffed at the notion of marijuana as some sort of magic elixir , like the phony tinctures hawked by unprincipled hucksters in old - time medicine shows .
I did n’t see the light until after the Legislature passed Senate Bill 420 , the bill authorizing the state ID card and the formation of medical - marijuana collectives and cooperatives where patients may go to get their medicine .
At the time , I was working in Sonoma County , one of the first counties to enact the measure .
Nevertheless , medical marijuana remained controversial there .
Since then , I ’ve interviewed literally hundreds of medical - marijuana patients , and I can tell you that of all those people , I ’ve encountered exactly one who had a dubious reason for his use , a 20 - year - old who said his doctor had authorized the use of marijuana to treat muscle soreness from his gym workouts .
Puh - leaze !
However , with that one exception , every patient I ’ve ever interviewed suffered from sort of serious malady for which medical marijuana provided one of the few sources of relief .
These conditions range from AIDS to cancer to traumatic injuries to serious mental disorders .
A common thread running through their stories was the failure of Western medicine to provide the sort of relief they get from marijuana .
One of my most mistaken previous assumptions was the idea that because a person is young and dressed in hip - hop attire , he or she must be scamming the system .
I presumed that was the case with the first young patient I interviewed , a college student who pulled up his sleeve and showed me the scar where he ’d nearly severed his wrist in a restaurant kitchen accident .
The ID card is voluntary , and patients with a doctor ’s recommendation are n’t required to have it to purchase medical marijuana at their local dispensary .
Many patients are n’t keen on having their name listed in the state ’s database , particularly considering that medical marijuana remains illegal under federal law .
However , the card is indispensable for patients who encounter local law enforcement , who ’ve been known to arrest medical - marijuana users possessing only a doctor ’s recommendation and confiscate their medicine .
Courts generally excuse the patients , but not before they endure a significant amount of hassle .
The ID card , which costs $ 166 , is recognized by the Sacramento Police and County Sheriff ’s departments and will put an end to such inconvenience .
Federal authorities remain a threat to both patients and medical - marijuana dispensaries .
That may change after President - elect Barack Obama takes office .
Obama has said in the past that he ’d approve the use of medical marijuana federally , ending the persecution of the patients who can find no other source of relief .
Hope for change in medical - marijuana laws ?
If it should come to pass , we do n’t necessarily have to thank Obama .
But like the county supes , we can say better late than never .
IMAX Corporation
“ Our goal with Avatar is to revolutionize live - action 3D moviemaking , and I have no doubt that it will look and sound incredible in IMAX 3D , ” said director James Cameron .
“ The larger field of view and powerful surround sound of an IMAX ( R ) theatre will completely immerse the audience in a way that cannot be experienced anywhere else . ”
“ We are delighted to be releasing Avatar in all available theatrical formats , and by including the premium IMAX 3D format , we can give consumers the entire spectrum of choice at the box office , ” said Bruce Snyder , President , Domestic Distribution , Twentieth Century Fox .
“ The IMAX theatre network is increasingly becoming an important part of our distribution strategy , as it continues to expand with its new digital projection system . ”
“ Avatar is one of the most anticipated movies of 2009 and it is a powerful addition to our film slate , ” said IMAX Co-CEO ’s Richard L. Gelfond and Bradley J. Wechsler .
“ We are particularly pleased with Twentieth Century Fox ’s increasing interest in the IMAX theatre network , which is largely fueled by the rollout of our digital projection systems and IMAX ’s track record of strong box office performance . ”
“ James Cameron is a genius filmmaker .
His vision and 3D expertise make Avatar a natural fit for IMAX and we believe it will resonate with our audiences as well as the millions of James Cameron fans across the globe , ” added Greg Foster , Chairman and President of IMAX Filmed Entertainment .
“ Every aspect of this film was meticulously designed for 3D , so when audiences experience this revolutionary film in an IMAX 3D theatre , they will feel as if they are actually IN the movie .
and Twentieth Century
Fox today announced that they have reached agreement on material terms to release the highly anticipated 3D motion pictureinsimultaneously with the motion picture ’s premiere in conventional 3D theatres on December 18 , 2009 .
Avatar is directed and written by Academy Award Winnerand starsandCameron will also produce with his Lightstorm Entertainment partner , .
Avatar will be digitally re-mastered into the unparalleled image and sound quality of The IMAX Experience ( R ) .
Avatar is the story of an ex-Marine who finds himself thrust into hostilities on an alien planet filled with exotic life forms .
As an Avatar , a human mind in an alien body , he finds himself torn between two worlds , in a desperate fight for his own survival and that of the indigenous people .
More than ten years in the making , Avatar marks Cameron ’s return to feature directing since helming 1997 ’s Titanic , the highest grossing film of all time and winner of eleven Oscars ( R ) including Best Picture .
WETA Digital , renowned for its work in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and King Kong , will incorporate new intuitive CGI technologies to transform the environments and characters into photorealistic 3D imagery that will transport the audience into the alien world rich with imaginative vistas , creatures and characters .

He 's been described as the real " local hero " , the man who stood up to a cocky billionaire and refused to sell his home to make way for the " world 's greatest golf course " .
But though Michael Forbes , a fisherman and quarry worker , said " no " to the wealthy industrialist Donald Trump , he may have to get used to the sight of him across the sand dunes they both covet just north of Aberdeen .
Though Trump once described Forbes 's home as a disgrace , he has apparently decided to move in next door , upping the ante in a neighbour 's dispute that has gained notoriety across the world .
After two years of defiant jousting with the New York - based property tycoon , Forbes has learnt that Trump intends to convert Menie House , the 14th century listed manor which sits next to the proposed resort , into his family 's " official Scottish residence " .
On top of that , Trump 's advisers have signed a legally - binding outline planning agreement for the £ 1bn golfing and holiday resort that could envelop Forbes 's 23 - acre plot .
It could take until 2010 before building work begins , but the work of finally designing the 500 - home housing estate , 36 luxury villas , 450 - bed hotel and high - rise timeshare flats has started in earnest .
Forbes , however , remains as pugnacious as ever .
In his first interview since Trump formally agreed to the Scottish government 's terms , Forbes insisted he intends to stay .
" I wo n't be moving .
He 's made a fool of the government , he 's made a fool of the council , but he wo n't make a fool out of me .
They know to keep away from me now . "
The ill - will between the two men began when Trump 's team first tried to buy Forbes out .
His home , his mother 's mobile home and his sprawling collection of decrepit outbuildings and rusting tractors is in the middle of Trump 's resort .
After Forbes refused Trump 's offers , which rose to £ 450,000 for the land and a promise of work for Forbes , the tycoon 's temper boiled over in October 2007 , when he described Forbes 's land as a " disgrace " and " disgusting " .
That immediately entrenched Forbes 's resistance , and made him an instant celebrity .
Forbes is now getting fan mail from across the world , including cheques which he does n't cash .
One Canadian woman writes to him every week .
" They keep telling me to keep up the good fight .
They just can't stand Trump : everything he touches turns to rubbish .
I have never ever had a bad letter ; it 's really good , like . "
Forbes believes the global recession will hit Trump 's plans far more severely than the developer will admit .
" I do n't think it will ever start because I do n't think he has the money - no - one else has money - so why has he got some ?
If Trump is a billionaire , so am I . "
But if construction does start , Forbes is apparently planning a campaign of resistance .
Rumours are circulating among his neighbours that Trump will surround Forbes 's land with a high fence .
Forbes has cryptically hinted that he plans to respond .
" I will keep all that quiet just now , " he said .
" Oh aye .
I always have something up my sleeve . "
Forbes is now embroiled in another dispute with a neighbouring family , the Hewisons .
Their immaculate villa and outhouses are surrounded on two sides by Forbes 's land .
" They [ are ] itching to sell , but they can't sell because I own everything around them , but Trump wo n't be interested in them unless I sell , " he said .
However Mark Hewison , who runs a local driving school , believes Trump will eventually get his own way .
" I 'm sure at the end of the day , Mr Trump will get everything he wants and requires , and he will just develop around it , " Hewison said .
" He will keep gathering up all the pieces of the jigsaw . "
" If we do n't sell it to the Trump Organisation , the property will still be worth a fortune in the middle of that development .
Would n't another American want to have the same postcode as Donald Trump 's Scottish residence ? "
Trump 's project director at the Menie estate , Neil Hobday , said they had no plans to reopen negotiations with either Forbes or Hewison for their land - they would build around it .
But he confirmed the recession was influencing their planning .
The resort 's timeshare blocks and housing estate , which will be sold off to finance the entire development , have to be built in phases under the planning agreement .
But it could take more a year to complete all the designs and get formal planning consent - and that would allow Trump to buy more time .
It will be " at least 12 months before the first shovel hits the ground , " Hobday said .
" The market has changed quite dramatically , I think we all know that ; catastrophically in some places and some countries , " he added .
" We 're not looking at a very attractive market just now .
We would be hopeful that when we start building these things , the market will have returned . "
In nine years of racing , only 28 men and 2 women have completed the full route to Nome , including Tim Hewitt , a lawyer from Latrobe , Pa. , who reached the finish on foot in 2001 , 2004 and 2008 .
About 90 percent of the entrants have dropped out along the trail .
Only seven racers have registered for the 2009 contest , including Hewitt and Basinger .
Partly to generate future entries , the organizers have continued to operate a simultaneous 350 - mile race ending in the village of McGrath , about a third of the way to the finish .
For this shorter course , 43 men and women have entered under the flags of Britain , Japan , Spain , Australia , Italy , Germany , the United States and ( separately ) Alaska .
For the early December training session , four racers arrived .
There was Aidan Harding , 30 , a mountain biker from Princes Risborough , England .
Despite his lack of experience on snow , Harding was considered a serious racing prospect .
There was George Azarias , a young Morgan Stanley banker from New York .
A practiced hiker , Azarias had little cycling experience .
And there were Jon and Denise Whyte , a married couple in their early 50s with five children from previous marriages .
The Whytes , veteran distance racers , intended to ride a tandem bicycle of their own design .
Though Merchant had sought to dispel them of that notion , he could not bring himself to refuse entry outright , largely on account of Jon Whyte ’s reputation .
Whyte , a successful veteran of Formula
One auto racing crews , had left that sport to design a renowned line of full - suspension mountain bikes bearing his name .
For the Iditarod trail , he had built a two - seated silver contraption with a single - wheeled trailer meant to bear the survival gear of a second rider without the additional drag of carving a second rut in the snow .
As the late - November snowfall blanketed the strip malls of Wasilla , Merchant drove his charges in an unheated van to a remote parking lot .
The racers piled rucksacks and bicycles into an eight - foot plastic bin hitched to the rear of a snowmobile .
As the machine kicked up powder and exhaust , the racers made their way to a hilltop , where piles of snow had buried picnic tables .
The film traces the origins of the centuries - old blood feud between the aristocratic vampires known as “ Death Dealers ” and their onetime slaves , the Lycans .
In the Dark Ages , a young Lycan named Lucian emerges as a powerful leader who rallies the werewolves to rise up against Viktor , the cruel vampire king who has enslaved them .
Lucian is joined by his secret lover , Sonja , in his battle against the Death Dealer army and his struggle for Lycan freedom .

Vegans and vegetarians are not only typically healthier than those who eat meat , they ’re also eating food that consumes fewer resources .
Eating less meat is a great eco-friendly step you can take in your life to help the planet .
Still , everyone from foodies to flexitarians enjoy meat from time to time , and there are plenty of ways to enjoy recipes with meat while still being considerate of the planet .
Here are some helpful tips and options complete with recipes .
1 . Go grassfed .
( Image via chewingthecud )
Grass is the cow ’s natural diet , and it makes for healthier animals and tastier meat .
Grassfed standards also require sustainable practices as part of the equation , so always choose grassfed beef to avoid the factory - farmed Meatrix .
Recipe : steak salad .
2. Look for a meat CSA .
( Image via chewingthecud )
Support local community farmers and ranchers , and reduce your carbon impact , by buying from a meat CSA whenever possible .
Recipe : pork chops and easy mashed potatoes .
3 . Go for oysters .
( Image via Chincoteague )
Farmed oysters are a great choice .
Not only are they healthy , but they ’re good for the planet .
Oysters will not grow if the water is not clean or if conditions are unsustainable , so unlike many fish farming practices , oyster farming is inherently eco-friendly .
They are also filter feeders , meaning they do n’t require additional food resources .
And they clean the water .
Recipe : creamy winter oyster bisque .
( note : for recipes , use local or organic ingredients whenever possible ) .
4 . Pick the best shrimp .
( Image via Spicelines )
You might think wild is best , and you ’d be right – American wild shrimp is the most eco-friendly option for this shellfish .
Farmed may contain contaminants , and other wild shrimp may be harvested by companies that do not use nets that are environmentally friendly or safe for other animals like sea turtles .
Recipe : easy , spicy grilled shrimp .
5. Enjoy sardines .
( Image via Algarve )
They ’re tasty , full of heart - healthy fats , and they ’re low on the food chain so they have minimal impact on the environment .
They can be an acquired taste for some , but they go well on everything from pasta to toasted wheat bread to omelets .
And sardines are sustainable .
Recipe : cucumber , egg and sardine sandwich .
6 . Eat smart sushi .
( Image via serious eats )
Know which sushi is likely to be full of mercury ( bad for you ) or from a threatened fishery ( bad for the planet ) .
There are choices that are sustainable , like albacore tuna , but you should skip the toro .
Recipe : tuna maki with brown rice .
7. Reduce portions .
( Image via camperogrilled )
This is a very simple way to trim the fat off your own waistline while helping the planet .
In most cultures and throughout most of human history , meat consumption has been a minimal part of the diet .
The factory farming method required to produce the amount of meat we like to eat is not sustainable or healthy .
Americans in particular eat far more animal protein than they need .
Try reducing your portions down to 2 - 4 ounces per serving .
Eat meat as an accent to vegetables and salads rather than as the major part of the meal .
Recipe : spinach salad with grilled chicken , mushrooms and balsamic vinegar .
8 . Choose the best fish .
( Image via naturemoms )
The Monterey Bay Aquarium and the Blue Ocean Institute have excellent guides to help you determine which fish is healthiest and most sustainable .
Avoid things like farmed salmon , Chilean sea bass and mahi mahi .
Recipe : wild Alaskan salmon with lemon and dill .
9 . Know which chicken is best .
( Image via northrup )
Many chickens are raised in deplorable , crowded conditions , subjected to painful debeaking and tiny crates that are filthy .
They ’re fed a diet high in hormones and antibiotics just to make it to your table , and as a result they tend to be very high in saturated fat – almost as much as beef .
And conventional chicken farming is bad for people in more ways than one .
Choose only free range , organic chicken .
Recipe : homemade chicken noodle soup with vegetables .
10 . Enjoy exotics .
( Image via leafhouse )
Try emu , ostrich , bison , elk , wild boar and other less popular meats that may be caught and slaughtered in more sustainable ways .
Recipe : wild boar Korean meatballs .
11 . Avoid the drive - through .
And Britney .
( Image via People )
Fast food supports rainforest deforestation , pollution and inhumane animal conditions .
Most meat at the drive - through is heavily processed , factory - produced fare .
Go for a green restaurant instead – there are many across the United States .
Recipe : how to make fried chicken at home with healthy baked sweet potato fries .
12 . Smart meat - eating tips .

Use every part of the animal – eat the organs , make stock from the bones , do what our grandparents did and do n’t waste anything .
Buy organic or local .

Obama spoke briefly about the arrest today in Chicago .
" Like the rest of the people of Illinois , I am saddened and sobered by the news that came out of the U.S. attorney 's office today , " Obama said .
" But as this is an ongoing investigation involving the governor , I do n't think it would be appropriate for me to comment on the issue at this time . "
Drinks and online banking do n't mix
After imbibing large quantities of certain beverages , we Ars writers sometimes get carried away with telling each other true - life stories that probably should n't go anywhere but sometimes do .
Last week ,
Ars Project Manager Clint Ecker mentioned that he wanted a flexible password generator on the iPhone for whenever he wants to create a completely forgettable pass - phrase .
Those forgettable items are perfect for online banking .
Or , so says Clint , arguing a position that 's not necessarily supported universally by online security experts .
Clint resets his bank password to something unbreakable ( and unmemorable ) each time he accesses his online accounts , and in doing so he protects himself even from himself .
His method works by using his browser to issue a password reset request before each login ; he then generates a random password with some software , and uses the reset code that the bank sends to his phone or inbox to assign this new password to his account .
This process , though a bit involved to carry out for each banking session , displaces his identity assurance from his login information to his mobile or email account .
At first , I set out to help Clint by digging up a suitable app on iTunes .
But when that did n't work , I made one myself based on what I 'd learned in my brief tour of App Store password generators .
Here 's how I did it .
Evaluating the options
Looking through iTunes for a suitable password generation app turned up a few candidates , including Utils ( iTunes ) and Password ( iTunes ) , but neither of these really offered the simple , intuitive interface we were looking for .
There had to be a better way to generate passwords using the following three basic criteria :
Upper case and lower case mixing
Alphanumeric mixing
Setting a password length , ranging between 4 and 12 characters
The two existing approaches on the App Store did n't really meet these criteria .
Keishi Hattori's Password generates one long Rijndael cipher result , which would be hard to type from the iPhone screen onto a banking site once , let alone twice , as is normally required .
Redwheel Apps ' Utils offered the basic controls requested , but with a few usability issues that complicated Clint 's goal .
Using the toggle switches shown here , it 's entirely possible to create passwords without lower case letters , upper case letters , numbers or punctuation .
Switching each option to OFF leaves you with a whole lot of nothing , an unacceptable scenario .
What 's more , each pair of switches ( Upper and Lower Case , Numbers and Punctuation ) are not conceptually independent .
There are at least three options being represented by these two switches .
Users should be allowed to pick from all lower case , all upper case , and mixed case passwords .
So these switches do n't represent those choices well , and they also offer the unacceptable " no lower case " and " no upper case " option .
The Password Length text entry field here uses freeform user input to determine the password length .
Keeping the user from entering invalid numbers demands some sort of pop -up / alert feedback , increasing the complexity of user interactions .
Even if the number is valid , the user must still tap the field , wait for the keyboard to appear , enter a number , dismiss the keyboard and then tap the Generate Password button .
Given these challenges , there had to be a better way to allow users to interact with the interface while retaining the same degree of freedom .
My choice : the segmented control
To meet the toggle switch challenge , I decided to use a different UIKit class .
A three - way choice is better presented using a segmented control .
The UISegmentedControl class presents a radio button - style interface , where users can choose one choice out of a group .
Rather than present independent upper and lower case switches , a single segmented control offers all three choices without the option of unacceptable " neither . "
A similar control for alpha , alphanumeric , and alphanumeric with punctuation removes the need for the second set of switches .
The next challenge was to eliminate the free - form text entry field .
After considering a number of options of selecting the password length through modal dialogs and pop-ups , I decided to go with yet another segmented control instead .
Although the number of options is high ( there are nine valid choices ) , the iPhone 's width accommodates segments that remain easy to touch by individual fingers .
This was not an ideal solution , given the complexity of the control , but it proved workable in testing .
Deciding to meet all of these interface challenges with segmented controls allowed me to move onto designing the application itself .

NARRATOR ( CHARLOTTE CORNWELL ) :
The 60s , the age of contraception , heralded a whole new era of liberation for women .
But contraceptives have not always meant liberation .
SYBIL SHAINWALD :
They have been used as a human laboratory .
They 're just expendable .
Who cares if a Third World woman dies ?
NARRATOR : When Norplant was released in the West recently , it seemed to be every woman 's dream .
Hassle - free sex , no daily pill , and extremely reliable protection .
Six implants are surgically inserted under the skin of the arm , where they stay for five years , releasing a hormone to inhibit ovulation .
Its developers claimed it was the most widely - studied contraceptive to arrive on the market .
But some women have had problems .
Patsy Smith had Norplant inserted after the birth of her second child .
PATSY SMITH :
Three months after having Norplant inserted I started getting horrible headaches like gosh , it was like somebody was just grabbing my head and just squeezing it together as tight as can be squeezed like someone had put a bomb in there and it was going to go off .
I 'd noticed that being kind of blurry and after the months it got a little bit more blurry and things started looking like they were on top of each other and ...
NARRATOR : Doctors thought there was nothing wrong at first , but over the next year her eyesight deteriorated .
Her symptoms became unbearable and she was taken to hospital .
PATSY SMITH : I knew something was wrong rightaway when residents and students and people started coming in and saying can we look at your eyes , you know , can we take a look at your eyes .
They did all kinds of tests and pictures and X - rays and ultra-sounds and odds and ends and , oh I was scared , I was really , really scared , and then they tell me this big word and I 'm like whoa .
I then asked if I would go blind and Dr. Tang told me she could n't make any promises that she could n't make me any guarantees at all , so we 're just waiting .
NARRATOR : They found Patsy had pseudo - tumour cerebri , a condition where increased fluid pressure in the brain crushes the optic nerve .
The pale circle shows a cross-section through a normal nerve , but in Patsy 's case , the fuzzy white circle shows where the nerve has been crushed and permanently damaged .
DR .
ROSA TANG : Patsy has blindness in one eye already , for practical purposes .
What damage she has now is not going to improve .
She is blind in that eye permanently and partially blind in the other .
If she has another episode this may further damage the vision she has left and she could go completely blind .
NARRATOR : Could the Norplant have caused this ?
Dr. Tang became so concerned that she wrote to every eye specialist in Texas to find out if other women on Norplant had eyesight disorders .
Out of 100 women referred to her , over 40 had blurred vision .
Of these 8 had the same condition as Patsy .
ROSA TANG :
It was very surprising for me because I had not seen any reports in the literature at this time of such a link between Norplant and pseudo - tumour cerebri and I was surprised of the fact that there were so many patients that seemed to be having the condition related to Norplant .
I think that there is enough out there that there is a possibility of a link between the two that a larger - scale study should be done if Norplant is to be continued .
PATSY SMITH :
What hurts me the most is the possibility that I may go blind and not see my children grow up .
It 's really scary .
It 's more precious to me now than it was before .
I take a lot of the things that she does and I hold them near so that way I can remember them if anything happened .
NARRATOR : Eyesight disorders , strokes , persistent bleeding , problems with removal - many women have no such side - effects , but thousands are now taking legal action in the West .
Norplant was studied for 20 years in the West , but mostly in developing countries .
After standard clinical trials of Norplant had been completed , pre-introductory clinical trials were held to assess the drug 's safety , efficacy and acceptability in local conditions .
Horizon went to Bangladesh to investigate one such trial .
In the mid-80s , stories had begun to emerge from women 's health campaigns .
In the slums of Dhaka , Farida Akhter heard of women with Norplant in their arms who were desperate to get it removed .
She realised she had stumbled on a drug trial .
FARIDA AKHTER :
This started with the slum woman very secretly .
They just did not tell anybody , there was no announcement and these are poor women , we are not meeting them every day so nobody knew .
NARRATOR : Farida
Akhter was concerned about the vulnerability of slum women and wanted to know how the tests were being run , but no - one could tell her .
FARIDA AKHTER :
We found that the family planner would just come to them and say that you can't talk about these things to any outsider woman , and they were afraid to talk to us , you know .
They were so afraid that sometimes they were not even sure that because we look educated woman we might be from the government , or from the family planning clinic itself , maybe we are just pretending to know them , so they were not sure what they could tell us .
You know , it took us time to even get their trust to be open and they were so much afraid , you could see in their face that they were really afraid .
NARRATOR : An earlier trial had been dropped because of public outcry over the way Norplant was being promoted as a safe drug when it was still under test .
While Farida Akhter was investigating this trial , her offices were raided by military government officials .
FARIDA AKHTER :
They just gave me an impression that if I do n't answer questions in the right way they will do something .
It was like a frightening thing you know .
They entered the gate , asked where is the Executive Director and you know , two men coming in you know and entered my room and sat down and there was a file and you can see the government file , you know it 's a red tape and they have Ubinig written on it you know , and they said where do you get the money from , what are you doing you know .
They were just frightening me , asking me look , you have the file , we have information about you .
NARRATOR : Undeterred , she continued her investigation .
FARIDA AKHTER : I really had to find out in a detective way .
We went to the villages , we went to the slum areas .
It was more than 100 woman we talked to .
NARRATOR : She found the side - effects were having a dramatic effect on their lives .
WOMAN [ SUBTITLED ] :
Suddenly my body became weak , quite suddenly .
I could n't get up , could n't take care of my children , could n't cook .
I was bedridden .
WOMAN [ SUBTITLED ] :
It was unbearable .
INTERVIEWER : Did you feel weak ?
WOMAN : Yes , my limbs felt like collapsing , as if they were being wrenched apart .
I could n't work or eat even .
I had to lie in bed for three months .
I could n't do anything .
INTERVIEWER : And the bleeding ?
WOMAN : I was bleeding all the time .
FARIDA AKHTER :
Severe bleeding makes her so weak and she even does not have two meals a day .
Many of them fainted quite often , you know which was not the case before , so these woman were telling us we were supposed to be very happy after taking this Norplant , but why our life is like hell now .
NARRATOR : Then she heard of women being coerced to stay in the trial .
Once Norplant is inserted , a woman cannot remove it by herself .
WOMAN [ SUBTITLED ] :
I went to the clinic as often as twice a week .
But they said : ' This thing we put in you costs 5,000 takas .
We 'll not remove it unless you pay this money . '
Of course I feel very angry .
I went to several other doctors and offered them money to take those things out , but they all refused .
I went to three or four of them and they said these can only be taken out by those who put them in .
They said that , if they tried they might go to jail .
INTERVIEWER :
If they ask you to take Norplant again , will you ?
WOMAN : That thing !
Even if 14 generations of my ancestors asked me , I shall refuse .
INTERVIEWER [ SUBTITLED ] :
How many times did you go to the clinic and ask them to take it out ?
WOMAN : In 6 months about 12 times .
Yes , about 12 times .
I went to the clinic and pleaded ' I 'm having so many problems .
I 'm confined to bed most of the time .
Please remove it . '
My health broke down completely .
I was reduced to skin and bone I had milk and eggs when I could , but that did me no good .
WOMAN [ SUBTITLED ] :
I felt so bad , my body felt so weak , even my husband told me it was all very inconvenient .
INTERVIEWER : How is your relationship with your husband ?
WOMAN : What else could it be ?
He says he 'll get another wife tomorrow .
I told the doctors , ' Please take it out , I 'm having so many problems . '
INTERVIEWER : How many times did you ask to get it removed ?
WOMAN : Oh , about 15 times .
One day I was so desperate .
I gave up hope .
I felt like throwing myself under the wheels of a car .
FARIDA AKHTER :
One woman when she begged to remove it , they said ' I 'm dying , please help me get it out ' .
They said ' OK , when you die you inform us , we 'll get it out of your dead body ' , so this is the way they were treated .
In a slum area people are living in a very small , like 5 ft by 7ft where at least five family members are living and these woman are working outside .
The most important resource they have is their own healthy condition .
NARRATOR : In Bangladesh if a woman can't work , often her family can't eat .
FARIDA AKHTER :
We have many information where these woman have told us that they have sold their cow or the goat which was the only asset they had for treatment because she had to get well , otherwise the family can't survive , so in order to save her , they had to , you know , sell the cow or if they did n't want to treat her then she suffered , so the family was suffering either way .
In every sense these people were totally torn .
Their economic condition were torn , their family happiness was totally gone .
NARRATOR : By now , news of the Norplant testing had spread .
Nasreen Huq , who has recently represented the Bangladeshi government on women 's health issues , found more disturbing aspects to the trial .
NASREEN HUQ : Participation in a clinical trial requires that the person who is participating in that trial understands that it is a trial , that the drug they are testing out is still in experimental stages .
This requires informed consent .
This was categorically missing .
INTERVIEWER [ SUBTITLED ] :
When they implanted this device , did they say it was an experimental thing that they were testing ?
[ WOMEN RESPONDING ] : No .
NARRATOR : Perhaps most worrying of all in the drug trial , potentially serious side - effects appeared to have been ignored .
NASREEN HUQ : Many of them told us that they had problem with eyesight which is not recorded by the clinics which were doing the trial on their bodies .
WOMAN [ SUBTITLED ] :
I could n't see .
I could n't look at things at a distance .
I had trouble focusing .
You know in the village we light oil lamps .
I could n't look at them .
They looked like the sun , as red and large as the sun .
If I looked into the distance , my eyes would water .
INTERVIEWER [ SUBTITLED ] :
What do you mean by this dimness of the eyes ?
WOMAN : If I went out of doors , my eyes became absolutely dark .
I could n't see anything at all as if my eyes had become affected by blindness .
NARRATOR : In 1993 a report of the first phase of this trial concluded : Norplant is a highly effective , safe and acceptable method among Bangladeshi women . '
It stated less than three per cent of women reported significant medical problems , no mention of eyesight disorders or women being refused removal .
NASREEN HUQ : I think the Norplant trials were bad science , really shoddy science , because they were not recording the side - effects .
They were scolding women when they wanted to report side - effects , they were scolding women if they came in at a time when they were not scheduled to come in for a follow - up check .
Their request for removal were disregarded , were not even recorded during the trial .
So how can they tell us that it was an acceptable method for women and that this has been scientifically tested out , you know ?
When continuation rates reflect caution , reflect refusal to remove , reflect disregard of women 's concerns , reflect disregard for women's health , how can they even accept that this has been the work of scientists ?
FARIDA AKHTER :
If you look at the trial , it looks like as if this woman are no better than a guinea pig and a guinea pig perhaps is more expensive in the West , that 's why our woman are cheaper here , so they 're easily available , they can be easily controlled and their bodies can be easily tested .
NASREEN HUQ :
When you conduct a trial in this sort of setting , you are simply taking advantage of them being poor .
You 've access , cheap access , to subjects , and you can write it up as a successful trial .
You 're not in any way advancing science , you 're taking advantage of a situation in which women are poor and they do n't want to have more children , and by providing this method , or conducting this trial , you are not in any way letting them out of their desperate situation .
I mean , I have been trained in science and I 'm sorry , this is not science .
NARRATOR : The trials were developed with funds from the US Agency for International Development .
DR NILS DAULAIRE :
We have very strict rules at AID in terms of any experimentation that 's done that certain ethical standards in terms of human subjects have to be met , and informed consent is a critical part of that .
I 've not been made personally aware of any serious lapses in terms of informed consent of any of the AID trials .
If there are cases where women were not accorded the opportunity to have Norplant removed , that would be a very serious breech and if this was done with US aid funds , we would take that extremely seriously .
INTERVIEWER :
Well it has been done with US funds it appears , and we have interviewed many women who had problems getting it removed .
How can this be , with a clinical trial which you 're running with American taxpayers ' money ?
NILS DAULAIRE : Well I can't answer that specific clinical trial because that 's one that I 'm not personally familiar with .
I can't tell you how it can be , I can tell you that if it is , there will be severe consequences .
The organisations that would be responsible for monitoring and overseeing these would have to clarify how any such activities took place under their oversight .
NARRATOR : Family Health International oversaw some of the trial for US AID .
They confirmed their officials were in Bangladesh regularly , but told Horizon : we do not believe this was very poor science .
The study was well designed and implemented in an ethical way .
They admitted there were problems with removal , but say they acted upon them and that these were not as widespread as claimed .
Yet their own data reveals that out of 1300 women from the expanded trial , over 100 reported being refused removal .
And Horizon found evidence of problems with other US AID studies of Norplant .
Testing was also carried out in Cité Soleil in Haiti , the poorest community in the poorest country in the western hemisphere .
Since the mid-80s , there have been 14 coups d'état and 8 changes of government .
CATHERINE MATERNOWSKA
: Danger 's a difficult concept to define in Haiti .
It can come from any direction at any moment .
People who stand up and indicate that they have been abused are often punished , attacked at night , raped , hundreds of women in Cité Soleil have been raped by the para - military forces .
Often entire neighbour - hoods are razed and burned down .
This political instability makes the climate for doing good research absolutely impossible .
For many years now I 've had copious field notes on side - effects with the Norplant method , but I 've had to work essentially in secret and covertly with Haitian women listening to their stories and their difficulties and unable to publish it .
The participants in my study could have been in grave danger had the information been let out , the fact that they were talking to me about their woes , about their difficulties with the Family Planning Centre and the Norplant method .
Many of the women that I interview come from the countryside where they 've lost their land , where they 've lost their income , where they 've basically taken off in search of life and within months most of them tell me , the little saying ( FRENCH ) takes a turn and they say ( FRENCH ) , which means in searching for life the essence of life is destroyed .
They can't find food , they can't find water , they have no access to health care , so essentially they 're looking for life but they find misery .
NARRATOR : It was while studying this community that Catherine Maternowska came across US AID trials of Norplant and was worried at what she found .
CATHERINE MATERNOWSKA
: Side - effects in the context of Haitian women 's lives are horrible .
With the Norplant users they were extremely severe .
Bleeding could go on for 18 months and what this means in a Haitian woman 's life has enormous impact .
In Haiti , women do n't have cotex or tampons .
That means that they have to use rags .
She needs to wash them every morning .
Washing is not a simple task at all in Haiti .
She has to buy soap which cuts into her finances for her food .
To purchase water .
A woman who can't actually purchase the water needs to find the water in the nearby gutters which are filthy , polluted and used for defecation among other things .
Another bad side - effect was headaches .
A Haitian woman is not able to buy aspirin .
They live in very noisy , active , polluted , intense communities and the headaches on top of all this were intolerable .
Many women collapsed from this method in sheer exhaustion .
They could n't go to work , they felt so ill , they were unable to function .
NARRATOR : Just as in Bangladesh , a pattern emerged where it was sometimes difficult for the women to get the Norplant removed .
Catherine Maternowska believed local clinics were under pressure to keep women in the trial to make the data look good .
CATHERINE MATERNOWSKA
:
One woman came in with an infection in her arm .
She was a market woman , she carried heavy loads on her head and when she came in asking to get the insert out , the doctor complained and he complained and he looked at me and he was used to having me in the clinic and he said , ' Oh Cathy , look at this woman , she 's an animal , she wants her Norplant out , she 's an animal .
She has to be in the study and she wants it out now .
What 's her problem ? '
They proceeded to throw her literally onto the table , lie her down so that they could do the , take the Norplant insertion out .
They threw her head to the side like this and they gave her the anaesthesia but before the anaesthesia had actually taken effect in her skin they started pulling the inserts out and making incisions and pulling the inserts out .
Because the infection in her arm it looked painful , it was red , it was swollen , and the muscle and sinew tissue had grown over the implants , they were pulling and she was wailing , she was why , why , and they continued calling her an animal .
I think it 's a sham , it 's disgusting , it appalled me that this kind of research was going on .
When someone 's looking for help , looking for a solution to their poverty and what they find is something that just makes their poverty worse , it 's a huge , huge sadness .
NARRATOR : For health workers in Cité Soleil Norplant is one of a long line of contraceptives that have been tested in Haiti over several decades .
ROSE -ANNE AUGUSTE [ SUBTITLED ) :
It is important for us to expose how women in poor countries are used as guinea pigs , especially in Haiti , so that they can test their products .
Developed countries may not even use these products because the hormone levels are too high .
But they use these in experiments on women in poor countries so that they can regulate the levels .
Fundamentally , what appears to us in Haiti is that these people have found a laboratory here a slum laboratory - to do whatever they want .
And one of the biggest laboratories for the American government is right here in Cité Soleil .
INTERVIEWER :
Why would your research target the poorest and the most illiterate and the least well able to defend themselves group ?
NILS DAULAIRE :
You 'll find that the broad portfolio of research does not target the poorest and the most illiterate and the least able to defend themselves .
That in fact the research that 's carried out is over a broad spectrum of society because it 's important to understand the use effectiveness and the benefits , as well as the disadvantages of certain contraceptive types among a wide variety of groups .
INTERVIEWER :
That maybe true for US AID as a whole , but I am talking about the clinical trials of Norplant in the Third World which were in the slums of Dhaka ..
NARRATOR : At this point the interview was terminated by a State Department official who asked for further information .
Later , Horizon was told : US AID categorically denies that poor Haitian women were being used as human guinea pigs by the United States .
They added they were proud of their programme in Cité Soleil and that the clinic there had been widely praised for its quality of care .
Norplant was studied in over 40 countries and apart from Bangladesh , there are reports of problems from Indonesia , Brazil and others , so how did the drug get approved by America 's Food and Drug Administration ?
Sybil Shainwald attended the only public hearing in 1989 .
SYBIL SHAINWALD :
The FDA approve a process
In the case of Norplant was ludicrous .
It was not the standard approval process .
The auditorium was packed and it was like a dog and pony show .
There were blond women running around saying I love Norplant , I 'm satisfied with Norplant .
On the other hand , the advisory committee , which was hearing the testimony , took very little cognisance of the fact that there were problems that had been reported throughout the world .
NARRATOR : This application was later withdrawn due to problems with the data .
It was resubmitted and approved 8 months later with no further public hearing .
SYBIL SHAINWALD :
This was the fastest approval process that I know of since I have been dealing with the Food and Drug Administration and the purpose was to market this overseas to control population .
NARRATOR : Many researchers do believe that Norplant is of great benefit , but others are critical of the US government 's promotion of a long - acting contraceptive overseas .
PROF .
BETSY HARTMANN :
At the highest levels in Washington , population growth in the Third World has long been perceived as a national security threat .
During the Cold War , of course , public fear and paranoia often focused on the nuclear bomb and in the post - Cold War period we 're having the population bomb re-emerging as a threat .
Now we 're fearing these Third World peoples .
Does this mean that you promote Norplant like a weapon in the war against population growth ?
Colleagues and I have looked through declassified documents and have found , much to our horror , that at the highest levels of government this has been an obsession .
There is a national security memorandum , for example , which talked about the great need to control population growth in places like Brazil and the big countries and how this population was a definite national security threat .
NARRATOR : Norplant is at least an officially approved contraceptive .
But there are other , less regulated methods already in use .
BETSY HARTMANN :
It 's not just in the United States case the government , but there are also a whole range of private foundations that are funding the building of a population control movement .
NARRATOR : One private organisation is run by two doctors from America 's southern states who believe they 've found the answer for Third World women in a drug called Quinacrine .
DR . STEPHEN MUMFORD : Quinacrine is the most important development in contraception since the birth control pill .
It has an enormous potential for preventing births and we 're talking about literally billions of births .
DR . ELTON KESSEL :
We have trials of the Quinacrine method going in some 17 countries like India , China , Bangladesh , and the trials are going very well .
100,000 women have had this method without a single fatality being reported .
NARRATOR : Dr. Elton Kessel was the founding director of Family Health International .
He now researches Quinacrine in a worldwide operation , masterminded from Dr. Mumford 's basement in Chapel Hill , North Carolina .
Quinacrine is inserted into the top of the womb where it causes inflammation and scarring in the Fallopian tube , in theory blocking the tube with scar tissue and preventing the sperm from reaching the egg .
STEPHEN MUMFORD :
It 's a very simple procedure , takes only a few minutes .
It can be done in very primitive settings by people who do not necessarily have a lot of clinical skills .
Quinacrine is clearly the cheapest method available in the world and in fact the second cheapest method would probably be more than 100 times as expensive as the Quinacrine method .
For $ 10,000 's worth of Quinacrine pellets , 70,000 women can be sterilised .
It 's been known for more than five years that Prince is a Jehovah 's Witness who goes door - to - door trying to win converts to the austere faith , as mentioned in this week 's New Yorker .
Less appreciated : the musician 's growing distance from the liberal artistic values that pervade show business , despite his move to Los Angeles seven years ago .
As Claire Hoffman writes , Prince has a budding relationship with Christian conservative media mogul Philip Anschutz , of Denver , and seems to be opposed to gay marriage and adoption .
These can ' be popular views among Prince 's fellow California - based rockers :
When asked about his perspective on social issues — gay marriage , abortion — Prince tapped his Bible and said , “ God came to earth and saw people sticking it wherever and doing it with whatever , and he just cleared it all out .
He was , like , ‘ Enough . ’ ”
If Prince wants to get attention for his views , airing them amid nationwide demonstrations against the passage of a California anti-gay - marriage initiative will probably do the trick .
What that does for the " celibate " musician 's sales and popularity is another matter .
The comic reveals his virility on the US chatshow .
It 's enough to make you quail in horror , or persuade the Daily Mail to print an article , at least .
Watch the contentious clip for yourself
Three weeks after L'affaire Manuel and the Daily Mail 's still digging around for sharp sticks with which to poke Russell Brand .
Today 's story attacks his appearance on the David Letterman show this week and even deploys the word " misogynistic " ; perhaps a first in the paper 's history .
But are they right ?
Why do n't you watch the contentious clip and make your own mind up ?
( Clue : you probably wo n't have to spend too much time thinking about it . )
Ron Paul Answers Your Questions : Part One
Do you love the smell of libertarianism in the morning ?
If so , today is a good day for you .
Last week we solicited your questions for Congressman Ron Paul .
There was such a big response ( more than 400 comments ) that we have split Paul ’s answers into two batches , the first of which is posted below .
Thanks to Paul for his answers and all of you for your good questions .
Q : What was your first thought when you found out McCain chose Palin as his running mate ?
A : At first , I thought it was a pretty savvy choice from a political perspective .
I also knew that she had said some nice things about me in the past .
At the same time , I knew that to be on the ticket , she would have to toe the line on foreign policy and the war , so that tempered a lot of my enthusiasm .
Q : Who in Congress would you consider to be your closest peer(s ) ?
A : There are a lot of members who I work with on a variety of different issues .
Walter Jones is a good friend and works with me on foreign policy .
Often on spending , if there is a 432 - 3 vote , the other two congressmen voting with me are Jeff Flake and Paul Broun .
A lot of times , I work with Democrats on civil liberties issues .
I guess my point is that people from all over the political spectrum can side with liberty and the Constitution .
The goal is to get a majority to vote that way most of the time .
Q : It was mentioned you were in favor of getting rid of the Department of Education .
Is this true , and if so , how do you feel this would benefit the country ?
A : I do believe in eliminating the Department of Education .
First , the Constitution does not authorize the Department of Education , and the founders never envisioned the federal government dictating those education policies .
Second , it is a huge bureaucracy that squanders our money .
We send billions of dollars to Washington and get back less than we sent .
The money would be much better off left in states and local communities rather than being squandered in Washington .
Finally , I think that the smallest level of government possible best performs education .
Teachers , parents , and local community leaders should be making decisions about exactly how our children should be taught , not Washington bureaucrats .
The Department of Education has given us No Child Left Behind , massive unfunded mandates , indoctrination , and in come cases , forced medication of our children with psychotropic drugs .
We should get rid of all of that and get those choices back in the hands of the people .
Q : What active steps would you take toward reducing the size of the government ?
A : The first thing I would do , which could be done rather quickly , is change our foreign policy .
If you add up all of our overseas expenditures , we spend nearly $ 1 trillion every year .
We have bases in 130 countries , 50,000 troops in Germany , and our brave military men and women bogged down in two wars in the Middle East .
By announcing that America will pursue a foreign policy of non-intervention , where we have trade , diplomacy , and travel — but where we do n’t police the world and stay out of the internal affairs of other nations — we could cut that $ 1 trillion in half and still have a strong national defense to keep us safe .
All that money we save could be used to address the entitlement system , making sure there will be funding there for people who have become dependent , while allowing young people to get out .
Secondly , I would begin to reassert respect for the Tenth Amendment .
The Constitution does not authorize so many things that the federal government currently does .
I would look to phase out entire departments and return these functions to the states as the Constitution intended .
The Departments of Education and Energy would be on the top of my list .
Finally , I would look to our monetary system .
Government can only tax its people so much before they say no .
So the government expands the money supply when it has taxed and borrowed all it can .
This inflation is a hidden tax that falls squarely on the middle class .
Sound , honest money would go a great way towards reining in the big- spending politicians .
Q : Even before the primaries , you said you would not run in the general election .
Why specifically did you not run ?
A : I was running for the Republican nomination , and I would have run in the general if I had won .
I had little interest in running third party due to the inherent biases against such efforts .
I also signed legally binding agreements not run third party in 2008 if I failed to win the G.O.P. primary .
That was the cost for ballot access in several states , 11 total I believe .
So even I had wanted to , it would not have been possible to run in the general after I lost the primary .
Q : What would your plans for economic stimulation look like during this slumping economy ?
A : Let ’s start with what I would n’t do , which is make the problem worse .
We can not solve our problems with what we ’ve been doing — borrowing money from overseas and creating money and credit out of thin air .
Distorting interest rates and inflating the monetary supply sometimes provides short - term relief , but it will only make the pain worse in the long run .
During the presidential campaign , I released the following four - point plan , and would stick by it while at the same time listening to experts for advice on how to improve it :
The Four - Point Plan
1 ) Tax Reform : Reduce the tax burden and eliminate taxes that punish investment and savings , including job - killing corporate taxes .
2 ) Spending Reform : Eliminate wasteful spending .
Reduce overseas commitments .
Freeze all non-defense , non-entitlement spending at current levels .
3 ) Monetary Policy Reform : Expand openness at the Federal Reserve and require the Fed to televise its meetings .
Return value to our money .
4 ) Regulatory Reform : Repeal Sarbanes - Oxley regulations that push companies to seek capital outside of U.S. markets .
Stop restricting community banks from fostering local economic growth .
Q : Do you still believe that the financial industry needs no regulation because markets are inherently stable and always act rationally ?
A : The free market is the most stable and fair system .
Government intervention and manipulation of interest rates are at the heart of the whole mess we are currently in .
Government intervention causes unintended negative consequences .
Artificially low interest rates help out special interest and elites , not the common person , all the while creating malinvestment and booms and busts in our economy .
Q : Do you think people who relate more to the libertarian ideals of the Republican Party have a role to play in the Republican Party of the moment , and do you see a role for them in the coming ( hopeful ) rebuilding of the Republican Party ?
A : I certainly hope so .
The Republican Party has traditionally been the party of liberty and limited government .
Republicans like Robert Taft , Barry Goldwater , and Ronald Reagan had very libertarian qualities .
If the G.O.P. gets back to its roots , they can appeal once again to liberty - minded Americans .
Q : Do you think the efforts of the libertarian - minded are better spent forming a third party or joining the actual Libertarian Party ?
A : I never try to tell people exactly what to do , so that ’s up to them .
However , I think the fact that I have remained in the Republican Party shows where I stand .
Q : What do you think are the most important steps to seeing greater access for third - party candidates ?
Is the root of the bipartisan problem more national or local in scope ?
A : Bipartisan dominance exists at all levels , but it ’s even more pronounced at the national level .
The biggest obstacle , I think , is inclusion in the national debates .
To take part , you basically have to be a Democrat or a Republican .
Unless that changes , a national third - party presidential candidate has little chance .
Q : What role should the United States play on the world scene ?
A : I believe we should treat everyone the same .
We should be friends with all willing parties , talk and trade with everyone we can , have diplomacy , and travel .
At the same time , we should not subsidize foreign governments with money or weapons ; this comes back to hurt us more times than not .
We should not have separate and different policies for Europeans or Latin America , Israelis or Palestinians .
We should set a good example here at home and stay out of the internal affairs of other countries .
Q : Did Bob Barr ‘s failure to appear at your press conference endorsing the third - party vote cause a rift between you and him ?
Are you still friends with him ?
A : That ’s old news as far I ’m concerned .
I ’m more interested in focusing on positive things Americans can accomplish moving forward .
Q : Do you believe that it is possible to make positive incremental changes to our monetary policy , entitlements , taxes , etc. within the system , or is it just a matter of waiting for failure and then coming in with a solution ?
A : Yes , I do believe we can make successful changes .
And I want to start making those changes now so that we can avoid a devastating collapse .
But we need to start quickly before it ’s too late .
If we can cut spending and balance budgets , beginning with our overseas expenditures , we can do a lot to fix this mess .
We also need monetary reform .
I would begin with the incremental step of repealing legal - tender laws and legalizing the use of gold and silver to act as a currency alongside the dollar .
That would help stabilize the dollar and strengthen our monetary system .
Q : How has the recent economic turmoil affected your views regarding deregulation ?
A : It has reinforced my belief that massive central planning does not work , whether it be in for the economy , education , or energy policy .
Q : How do you propose we restore people ’s faith in free - market ideas ?
A : Well , we need to start by making sure politicians who talk about free markets practice what they preach .
One of the reasons why people may have lost faith in freedom is that leaders used limited - government rhetoric while expanding the size and scope of government .
Free markets got a black eye even though the actual policy was intervention and central planning .
So again , leaders who profess to support markets need to act like that once in power .
If we do that , we ’ll prove that freedom really does work .
Q : How much money was left over from your campaign donations and what will be the next step with those funds ?
A : We had about $ 4 million left , which we are using to launch the Campaign for Liberty .
You can learn more about that group here .

Oh , the poor , sad McCain campaign just sold all of their leftover campaign crap , for pennies .
And of course some reporter bought some used Blackberries and guess who did n't delete anything off it ?
That is right , the McCain campain sold Blackberrys to any schmo who walked in off the street , and these Blackberrys were full of emails and things :
When we charged them up in the newsroom , we found one of the $ 20 Blackberry phones contained more than 50 phone numbers for people connected with the McCain - Palin campaign , as well as hundreds of emails from early September until a few days after election night ….
Most of the numbers were private cell phones for campaign leaders , politicians , lobbyists and journalists .
We called some of the numbers ….
“ They should have wiped that stuff out , ” another said .
But he added , “ Given the way the campaign was run , this is not a surprise . ”
This is a local
Fox affiliate who found all this , so of course they do n't share any awesome emails or even list names of people involved .
But presumably hundreds more Blackberrys are out there , full of hilarious emails about Sarah Palin 's magical pregnancy and " secret political strategy " stuff like " stick your tongue out really funny - like at the end of the debate , Senator . "
This is all especially ironic because , as we all know , John McCain invented the Blackberry , in 1902 .

Mary Kate Olsen Lands Role on Samantha Who ?
( Photos , Video )
22 , is reportedly making a guest appearance on the ABC hit show Samantha Who ?.
The filming is taking place this week for fall airing .
Her film The Wackness is also set to open in select theaters on July 3rd .
The reclusive millionaire reportedly has good comedy instincts , no doubt the result of her many years as a child star .
She and her twin sister Ashley Olsen shared the role of Michelle Tanner on Full House , beginning at age six month .
E! reports that Samantha Who ?
producers are happy with Olsen 's performance .
No word on whether she might snag a callback for a future episode .
Samantha is played by gorgeous actress Christina Applegate .
The show won the distinction of being the highest rated new sitcom in 2007 , making it a shoe in to be picked up for a second season which begins in September .
Mary - Kate appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman earlier this week .
We 've got photos of the bohemian waif as she was entering the Ed Sullivan Theater .
Unlike her normal demeanor , she actually smiled in a couple of the poses .
Check them photos and Olsen 's Letterman performance video below .

Jason de Caires creates underwater sculptures .
Instead of trying to create unchanging and lasting works , he encourages the organic growth of coral and other organisms across his creations .
He 's working on a new project in Mexico at the moment , but we caught him on dry land for a few questions .
On a practical level , how are your sculptures installed , and how can viewers see them while they 're underwater ?
Depending on the weight and design of the sculptures most are deployed from a vessel with a lifting arm .
Once in the water float bags are attached and the piece (s ) can be carefully lifted and moved into the final position .
Larger pieces are made in separate units and then connected underwater .
Anchoring screws are used to connect the base of the piece to the ocean substrate .
The whole operation can take up to ten crew members and five divers .
The largest piece Vicissitudes took me a week ( four hours per day ) underwater to assemble .
The work is shallow enough to be viewed by snorkelling , diving or from a glass bottom boat .
The experience of each visit can be entirely different depending on the prevailing weather conditions and the interaction of marine life .
My work has also started to develop another life in its digital reproduction .
Vissicitudes close up
Could you explain how your sculptures interact with and are affected by their aquatic environment ?
The materials and construction of the work are designed to encourage and promote marine life .
The texture , chemical composition and design actively encourage the settlement of embryonic corals .
Areas of shelter and void space provide a habitant for creatures to breed and take refuge .
As time passes and the settlement increases and series of natural events begins to enfold .
Besides the development of hard and soft corals , numerous fish graze on algae that collects on the surfaces and I have documented octopus , shrimp and moray eels living under or within the structures .
The Lost Correspondent
A few of your works ( e.g. Lost Correspondent , Still Life ) are of familiar scenes transformed by an alien environment .
Is this in opposition to the near sacred reverence and desperate restoration of traditional art ?
Most definitely , the works are all intended to highlight the temporal and organic nature of our existence - not celebrating or depicting moments from the past but aiming to remind the viewer of the inevitability of change and evolution .
I also feel we have started to alienate ourselves from our natural surroundings and hope the work portrays a symbiotic and sustainable relationship with our environment .
Un-still Life
Tell us about the sculpture you 're working on in Mexico .
I am currently resident in Cancun working on the first phase of an ambitious new project .
The initial two sculptures are called La Jardinera de la Esperanza ( ' The Gardener of Hope ' ) and El Archivero de los Sueños ( ' The Archive of Lost Dreams ' ) .
The first depicts a garden scene with a young woman surrounded by a series of plant pots and garden utensils .
Once the piece is submerged , coral fragments and cuttings from storm damage will be “ planted " into the pots ( A well established technique for coral conservation ) .
It aims to portray human intervention as both positive and life sustaining .
Fall from Grace
The second piece is the creation of an underwater archive , maintained by a male registrar .
The archive is a collection of hundreds of messages in bottles which have been brought together by the natural forces of the sea .
The last piece in the Cancun project is a monumental installation of over 200 figurative works , depicting the change from indigenous ( Mayan ) cultures to a present multicultural society .
All the works will form part of a new underwater museum located in a protected marine reserve .

Or , In Defense of Fondling Cardboard Cut-Outs
[ digg - reddit - me ] Dahlia Lithwick , writing in Slate about the character of John Roberts as he was being vetted for the Supreme Court in 2006 :
I knew guys like [ John Roberts ] in college and at law school ; we all knew guys like him .
These were the guys who were certain , by age 19 , that they could n’t smoke pot , or date trampy girls , or throw up off the top of the school clock tower because it would impair their confirmation chances .
They would have done all these things , but for the possibility of being carved out of the history books for it .
An acquaintance of mine from college has been in the news recently .
No – I ’m not talking about this profile in Newsweek ( which was reddit - famous ) , this one from The New York Times , or this piece in Time magazine .
I ’m talking about the headline on The Drudge Report linking to this piece in the Washington Post .
I ignored that piece when it first came up , hoping the story would die .
It ’s certainly not news in any meaningful sense .
But it does turn out to be “ news ” in the sense that matters most these days :
It provides a hook for people to fake righteous outrage over .
Jon Favreau , a speechwriter for Barack Obama now slated to move to the White House as chief speechwriter for Obama , had a picture taken of him at a party .
I include the picture to keep matters in perspective – for without it , an observer would probably imagine something quite shocking .
( The Wikipedia entry ’s description of the photo , Favreau “ performing a suggestive gesture to a cardboard cut - out of Hillary Clinton . ”
With that description , I would have pictured something else entirely ! )
The offending picture was posted on Facebook by a friend of Favreau ’s for some two hours before it was taken down .
Now it ’s in the Washington Post and the New York Times and analysts on CNN are making profound noises about it .
According to The New Agenda , a supposedly feminist group , Favreau should be fired .
Campbell Brown of CNN , the individual whose brilliant first name inevitably leads her to disappoint viewers expecting profundity ( “ Free Sarah Palin ! ” ) decided her counterintuitive response would be to attack Senator Clinton ’s lack of outrage over the degradation of womankind that this photo represents :
Really , Sen. Clinton ?
Boy , have you changed your tune .
You really think this photo is OK ?
Put another woman in that photo , just an average woman who supported you during the campaign .
Have it be her image being degraded by a colleague of hers .
Would you be OK with that ?
Yes – Campbell Brown is outraged over Hillary Clinton ’s shrugging - off of an unfortunate photo while the economy is melting down and two wars are raging .
Clearly , Hillary ’s priorities are out of order – not Brown’s .
Walter Cronkite must be ashamed to call himself a newsman these days .
There is a sensibility that infects mainstream coverage of any material that is tawdry and cheap – a kind of Hayes Code for today ’s newsroom that makes every sexual scandal or embarrassing photograph into a morality tale .
Without that cover , it ’s hard to justify the right to show scandalous photographs repeatedly and talk in graphic details about the sex lives of politicians .
( Remember the New York Post ‘s scolding headline about the Miley Cyrus photograph , the scandalous photograph that they then enlarged on their front page to scold her about ? )
The goal of these morality tales is to pull readers or viewers in with titillating details while simultaneously and self - righteously denouncing the behavior .
What ’s worse though than the faux - outrage and real outrage over such petty scandals is the type of public servant it encourages .
We ca n’t all live as Dahlia Lithwick imagines John Roberts has .
To view a scandal with good humor is one thing – to view it with the knowledge that we are all human , are all imperfect , all make mistakes – with the knowledge that if a perfect inquisitor came to judge us by our own standards , each of us would be found wanting .
None of us are pure – and often those most obsessed with purity turn out to have their own demons .
( See Haggard , Ted . )
Our current political and media environment penalizes anyone who has lived and left any evidence to show for it .
And we wonder how we ’ve gotten in so much trouble .
At the same time , the self - appointed inquisitors have often been found wanting themselves .
From preachers to journalists to politicians to news anchors to judges to each one of us – all of us , having lived , have done things we regret .
Whether our regrets are dragged into the light of day and made into a media spectacle is largely a matter of happenstance .
If you live in the public eye , then having the media pore over the worst moments of your life is a risk you take .
But we do n’t really want to limit our politicians and public servants to those who have never done anything to have offended anyone in their lives .
Thankfully , Barack Obama has not taken this approach .
If he wanted to avoid scandal and hypocritical tsk - tsk-ing , he would not have named Hillary Clinton Secretary of State with her long history .
Lawrence Summers , as necessary as his brilliance may be to saving our economy , would have been eliminated because of controversial remarks he made some years ago .
Eric Holder , despite his almost spotless record , would have been eliminated for that one spot – his minor role in the Marc Rich pardon .
Joe Biden ’s runaway mouth has led him to offend many constituencies .
Barack Obama campaigned saying he would change Washington and politics as usual .
It seems his first order of business is to ignore the hypocrites of the media ( and media - parasites like The New Agenda ) .
With Hillary Clinton downplaying the incident and Obama having a history of ignoring this type of media scandal , I hope and trust that Jon Favreau ’s job is safe .
But that ’s not the point .
It should never have been called into question over an incident like this .
If the media wants to report on some lewd scandal , they can at least do their audience the favor of avoiding the hypocritical moral posturing and just revel in the tawdriness of it .
It would at least be honest .
***
By the way , The New Agenda managed to insinuate that my college inculcated “ less - than - respectful attitudes toward women ” :
Ironically , other famous alumni of Jon Favreau ’s alma mater , the College of the Holy Cross , are Clarence Thomas and Chris Matthews , also noted for their less - than - respectful attitudes toward women .
Apparently , the writer of this piece for The New Agenda never quite understood the meaning of the word “ ironically . ”
That ’s what a second - rate education will get you – a lack of knowledge of basic English vocabulary and a deficient sense of humor .
To complain about The New Agenda ’s misuse of the word , “ ironically , ” you can email :
Or preferably , email each address to make sure someone gets it .
( It ’s harder to get in touch with Campbell Brown – but you can comment to CNN here . )

THIS Christmas the world economy offers few reasons for good cheer .
As credit contracts and asset prices plunge , demand across the globe is shrivelling .
Rich countries collectively face the severest recession since the second world war : this week 's cut in the target for the federal funds rate to between zero and 0.25 % ( see article ) shows how fearful America 's policymakers are .
And conditions are deteriorating fast too in emerging economies , which have been whacked by tumbling exports and the drying - up of foreign finance .
This news is bad enough in itself ; but it also poses the biggest threat to open markets in the modern era of globalisation .
For the first time in more than a generation , two of the engines of global integration — trade and capital flows — are simultaneously shifting into reverse .
The World Bank says that net private capital flows to emerging economies in 2009 are likely to be only half the record $ 1 trillion of 2007 , while global trade volumes will shrink for the first time since 1982 ( see article ) .
This twin shift will force wrenching adjustments .
Countries that have relied on exports to drive growth , from China to Germany , will slump unless they can boost domestic demand quickly .
The flight of private capital means emerging economies with current - account deficits face a drought of financing as well as export earnings .
There is a risk that in their discomfort governments turn to an old , but false , friend : protectionism .
Integration has less appeal when pain rather than prosperity is ricocheting across borders .
It will be tempting to prop up domestic jobs and incomes by diverting demand from abroad with export subsidies , tariffs and cheaper currencies .
The lessons of history , though , are clear .
The economic isolationism of the 1930s , epitomised by America 's Smoot - Hawley tariff ( see article ) , cruelly intensified the Depression .
To be sure , the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) and its multilateral trading rules are a bulwark against protection on that scale .
But today 's globalised economy , with far - flung supply chains and just - in - time delivery , could be disrupted by policies much less dramatic than the Smoot - Hawley act .
A modest shift away from openness — well within the WTO 's rules — would be enough to turn the recession of 2009 much nastier .
Incremental protection of that sort is , alas , all too plausible .
Fair - weather free - traders
In many countries politicians ' fealty to open markets is already more rhetorical than real .
In November the leaders of the G20 group of big rich and emerging economies promised to eschew any new trade barriers for a year and to work hard for agreement on the Doha round of trade talks by the end of December .
Within days , two of the G20 countries , Russia and India , raised tariffs on cars and steel respectively .
And the year is ending with no Doha breakthrough in sight .
As economies weaken , popular scepticism of open markets will surely grow .
Among rich countries , that danger is greatest in America , where grumbles were heard long before recession set in .
The new Congress , with bigger Democratic majorities , has a decidedly less trade - friendly hue .
Barack Obama 's campaign rhetoric left an impression of a man in two minds about trade , which he has since done nothing to dispel .
Now that their exports are faltering , emerging economies too may become less keen on trade .
The WTO 's rules allow them plenty of scope : after two decades of unilateral tariff - cutting most of their tariffs are well below their “ bound ” rates , the ceilings agreed in the trade club .
On average they could triple their import levies without breaking the rules .
Handouts to the ready
Politicians from Washington to Beijing are being pressed to help troubled industries , regardless of the consequences for trade .
A bail - out of Detroit 's carmakers , whatever its final extent , will be a discriminatory subsidy .
As China 's exporters go bust by the thousand , industries from textiles to steel have been promised handouts and rebates .
Subsidies will beget more subsidies : Nicolas Sarkozy , France 's president , says that Europe will turn into an “ industrial wasteland ” if it too does not prop up its manufacturers .
They will also invite retaliation .
With China 's bilateral trade surplus at a record high even as America 's economy slumps , Congress will not take kindly to Beijing 's bolstering of its exporters .
Exchange - rate movements could also prompt protectionist responses .
Chinese officials have said publicly that they will not push down the yuan , and their currency has risen in trade - weighted terms .
However , it did slip against the dollar in late November .
Viewed from America , China still seems to be following a cheap - yuan policy .
A Sino -American trade spat is all too plausible .
Add all this together and it is hard for a free - trader not to worry .
So what is to be done ?
The first requirement is political leadership , especially from America and China .
At a minimum , both must avoid beggar - thy - neighbour policies .
Second , a conclusion of the Doha round would help .
A deal would reduce the risk of broader backsliding by cutting many countries ' bound tariffs — and it would establish Mr Obama 's multilateral credentials .
Third — Doha deal or not — is greater transparency .
A good recent idea is that the WTO publicise any new barriers , whether or not they are allowed by its rules .
The best insurance against protectionism , however , is macroeconomic stimulus .
Boosting demand at home will reduce the temptation to divert it from abroad .
By historical standards policymakers are acting aggressively , as the Federal Reserve did this week .
But the effort is unevenly , and poorly , distributed .
Emerging economies from which capital is fleeing have little room to boost spending .
Some creditor countries ( notably Germany ) are holding back on fiscal stimulus , while the world 's biggest borrower ( America ) is acting the most boldly .
A bigger push to boost domestic demand in creditor countries coupled with more help , through the IMF , to cushion cash - strapped emerging economies would ease the world economy 's adjustment and brighten the prospects for free trade .
In the 1930s protectionism flourished largely because of macroeconomic failures .
That must not happen this time .
ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) -- By 2011 ?
No recovery ?
No new bull ?
" Hey Paul , why do you keep talking about a bigger crash coming by 2011 ? "
Readers ask that often .
So here 's a sequel to my predictions of 2000 and 2004 , with a look three years ahead :
We pinpointed the dot - com crash at its peak , in a March 20 , 2000 column : " Next crash ?
Sorry , you wo n't see it coming . "
Bulls - eye : The dot - com bubble popped .
The economy went into a 30 - month recession .
The stock market lost $ 8 trillion .
And today , over eight years later , the market is still roughly 40 % below its 2000 peak .
Factor in inflation and the average stock has lost well over 50 % of its value .
Stocks have proven to be a very big loser , a bad investment for Americans , thanks to Wall Street 's selfish greed , plus the complicity and naiveté of politicians , press and public .
Second .
Subprime meltdown
We reported on warnings of another crash coming as early as 2004 , wrote a sequel , also titled " Next crash ?
Sorry , you wo n't see it coming . "
Yes , we were early , but in good company .
We wrote many more warning columns .
Few listened .
Subsequent events , notably former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan 's admission of his failures in congressional testimony , prove that if he and other Reaganomic ideologues were n't so myopic and intransigent about proving their free - market deregulation theories , they could have acted earlier and prevented today 's colossal mess .
Instead , their ideology kept the bubble blowing , delayed the pop , making matters worse .
So once again , as history proves over and over , ideology trumps common sense , reality and the facts .
Greed drives ideologues to blow bubbles .
They pop .
Crashes happen .
The public is collateral damage .
Third .
Megabubble cycles
We also detailed the broader , accelerating macroeconomic sweep of cycles last summer in columns like " 20 reasons new megabubble pops in 2011 . "
We summarized a long list of major warnings from financial periodicals -- Forbes , Fortune , the Wall Street Journal , Economist -- and from the voices of Warren Buffett , Bill Gross , a sitting Fed governor and a former Commerce secretary .
Multiple warnings " hiding in plain sight , " beginning with a Fed governor warning Greenspan in 2000 about subprime risk .
But the big shocker came from the new Treasury secretary two years before the meltdown : Bloomberg News reports that shortly after leaving Wall Street as Goldman Sachs ' CEO , Henry Paulson was at Camp David warning the president and his staff of " over - the - counter derivatives as an example of financial innovation that could , under certain circumstances , blow up in Wall Street 's face and affect the whole economy . "
Yes , they knew .
And still both Paulson , a Wall Street insider , and Greenspan 's successor , Ben Bernanke , a Princeton scholar of the Great Depression , stayed trapped in denial and kept happy - talking the public for months after the meltdown began in mid-2007 .
Get it ?
While they could have put the brakes on this meltdown years ago , our leaders were prisoners of their distorted , inflexible views of conservative Reaganomics ideology .
As a result , once again the " best and the brightest " failed America and now they and their buddies in Washington and Corporate America are setting up the Crash of 2011 .
Now it 's time for my 2008 update , a look into the future where things will get far worse during the next presidential term .
And given human behavior , especially in the deep recesses of Wall Street 's " greed is good " DNA , it seems inevitable that no matter how well - intentioned the new president may be Wall Street and Washington 's 41,000 special - interest lobbyists will drive America into the Great Depression 2 .
30 ' leading edge ' indicators of the coming Great Depression 2
Every day there is more breaking news , proof Wall Street 's greed is already back to " business as usual " and in denial , grabbing more and more from the new " Bailouts - R - Us " bonanza of free taxpayer cash and credits , like two - year - olds in a toy store at Christmas -- anything to boost earnings , profits and stock prices , and keep those bonuses and salaries flowing , anything to blow a new bubble .
Scan these 30 " leading indicators . "
Each problem has one or more possible solutions , but lacks unified political support .
Time 's running out .
We 're already at the edge .
Add up the trillions in debt :
Any collective solution will only compound our problems , because the cumulative debt will overwhelm us , make matters worse :
America 's credit rating may soon be downgraded below AAA Fed refusal to disclose $ 2 trillion loans , now the new " shadow banking system " Congress has no oversight of $ 700 billion , and Paulson 's Wall Street Trojan Horse King Henry Paulson flip - flops on plan to buy toxic bank assets , confusing markets Goldman , Morgan lost tens of billions , but planning over $ 13 billion in bonuses this year AIG bails big banks out of $ 150 billion in credit swaps , protects shareholders before taxpayers American Express joins Goldman , Morgan as bank holding firms , looking for Fed money Treasury sneaks corporate tax credits into bailout giveaway , shifts costs to states State revenues down , taxes and debt up ; hiring , spending , borrowing add even more debt State , municipal , corporate pensions lost hundreds of billions on derivative swaps Hedge funds : 610 in 1990 , almost 10,000 now .
Returns down 15 % , liquidations up Consumer debt way up , now at $ 2.5 trillion ; next area for credit meltdowns
Fed also plans to provide billions to $ 3.6 trillion money - market fund industry Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are bleeding cash , want to tap taxpayer dollars Washington manipulating data :
War not $ 600 billion but estimates actually $ 3 trillion Hidden costs of $ 700 billion bailout are likely $ 5 trillion ; plus $ 1 trillion Street write - offs Commodities down , resource exporters and currencies dropping , triggering a global meltdown
Big three automakers near bankruptcy ; unions , workers , retirees will suffer Corporate bond market , both junk and top-rated , slumps more than 25 % Retailers bankrupt : Circuit City , Sharper Image , Mervyns ; mall sales in free fall Unemployment heading toward 8 % plus ; more 1930 's photos of soup lines Government policy is dictated by 42,000 myopic , highly paid , greedy lobbyists China 's sees GDP growth drop , crates $ 586 billion stimulus ; deflation is now global , hitting even Dubai Despite global recession , U.S. trade deficit continues , now at $ 650 billion
The 800 - pound gorillas : Social Security , Medicare with $ 60 trillion in unfunded liabilities Now 46 million uninsured as medical , drug costs explode New - New Deal : U.S. planning billions for infrastructure , adding to unsustainable debt Outgoing leaders handicapping new administration with huge liabilities
The " antitaxes " message is a new bubble , a new version of the American dream offering a free lunch , no sacrifices , exposing us to more false promises
Will the next meltdown , the third of the 21st Century , trigger a second Great Depression ?
Or will the 2007 - 08 crisis simply morph into a painful extension of today 's mess to 2011 and beyond , with no new bull market , no economic recovery as our new president hopes ?
Perhaps some of the first 29 problems may be solved separately , but collectively , after building on a failed ideology , they spell disaster .
So listen closely to " leading indicator " No. 30 :
At a recent Reuters Global Finance Summit former Goldman Sachs chairman John Whitehead was interviewed .
He was also Ronald Reagan 's Deputy Secretary of State and a former chairman of the N.Y .
Fed .
He says America 's problems will take years and will burn trillions .
He sees " nothing but large increases in the deficit ... I think it would be worse than the depression .
...
Before I go to sleep at night , I wonder if tomorrow is the day Moody 's and S&P will announce a downgrade of U.S. government bonds . "
It 'll get worse because " the public is not prepared to increase taxes .
Both parties were for reducing taxes , reducing income to government , and both parties favored a number of new programs , all very costly and all done by the government . "
Reuters concludes : " Whitehead said he is speaking out on this topic because he is concerned no lawmakers are against these new spending programs and none will stand up and call for higher taxes .
' I just want to get people thinking about this , and to realize this is a road to disaster , ' said Whitehead .
' I 've always been a positive person and optimistic , but I do n't see a solution here . ' "
We see the Great Depression 2 .
Why ?
Wall Street 's self - interested greed .
They are their own worst enemy ... and America 's too .
Colbert cheers the way Fox ' schooled ' caller 's ' hippie - speak ' RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday November 19 , 2008
Print This Email This Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert expressed satisfaction on Tuesday that those radical hippie ideas of peace and love have become so thoroughly discredited that nobody even bothers to mention them .
Colbert noted in his best fake - pundit style , " This year everyone talked about hope and change , but thankfully we never took the next step to much more dangerous ideas -- I am talking about peace and love . "
" We were n't always this lucky , " Colbert explained , noting that in the 1960s , peace and love were thought to be " serious concepts with international implications .
...
Thankfully , peace and love were discredited as ideas , because they became associated with the excesses of the time , like drug use . "
" Since then , we have kept the words ' peace ' and ' love ' out of serious conversation , " Colbert said approvingly .
" And if we even get close to those ideas , they are exposed for the joke that they are . "
Colbert illustrated this point with a post-election clip from Fox News Radio , where a caller suggested , " it 's the dawn of a new era ... of mutual respect and cooperation and unity , " and was rewarded by having the show 's host play " This is the Dawning of the Age of Aquarius " over his words .
" Far out , man , " the host commented mockingly , then adding a more contemporary Beavis and Butt - head style jab , " Hey , man , you said ' cooperation , ' man . "
" You got schooled , hippie ! " proclaimed Colbert .
" Everybody knows that if you say anything in hippie - speak , it 's not true . "
" If you start loving your enemies " Colbert warned in conclusion , " pretty soon you 're going to end up in a drum circle with Mahmoud Ahma - kumbaya - jedad .
...
Peace and love are powerful ideas .
If we start talking about them , we might actually get the hope and change that everybody keeps talking about .

In Moscow traffic with Walter Benjamin Dragan Klaic was in Moscow to run a theatre workshop .
He was overwhelmed by the sense of impending financial disaster and nearly missed his plane home .
My Moscow hosts had assured me that I would be at the airport in no time at all - it was not only a Sunday but most the population would be out of town for the four - day holiday , they said .
The weekend was connected with the public holiday on Tuesday 4 November , the Day of People 's Unity , which had been introduced some years ago to replace the October Revolution Day , traditionally celebrated on 7 November .
And yet , half way to the airport we hit a horrendous traffic jam .
Sasha , the driver , inched off the Leningradski Shose and , passing the Perseus shoes megastore , started on a long detour through the faceless Golovinski Reon , which was jammed by other cars abandoning the highway or hopelessly seeking to join it .
In agonising slow motion , we passed Avangardnaya Street and I started to feel like a character in an absurdist Daniel Harms play , wondering what irony had inspired Brezhnev 's urban planners to give such a promising name to this drab street of prefab high rises .
The Avant - garde project , whatever it was - artistic , political or urbanist – ground to a halt at the Moscow periphery and so did I , condemned to miss my flight to Amsterdam .
Then , a second splash of irony hit me when we crawled past Festivalskaya Street .
I felt like the butt of a cruel joke because the reason I had come to Moscow was to run a research workshop on arts festivals .
The two - day workshop had gone well , with much discussion between Russian and foreign festival organisers and experts , but here , on this public holiday in Festivalskaya Street , there was nothing festive in sight and nothing to celebrate .
I was overwhelmed by gloom and despair .
Always when in Moscow I think of Walter Benjamin and his " Moscow Diary " , a record of love , pain and misery in a shabby city .
In the past weeks I had been reading his " Memories of a Berlin Childhood " and the evening before I had eaten in a cafe Dona Clara in Maloya Bronya , decorated with his 1920 Berlin photos .
So I imagined how I would explain present - day Moscow to the ghost of Walter Benjamin , were he to come down and sit with me here in the back seat of the Mitsubishi 4x4 .
What would Benjamin want to know and how would he analyse the latest twists of the post - communist transition ?
When Benjamin came to Russia in December 1926 , pursing his erotic fascination for the Latvian poetess Asja Lacis , Russia had abandoned its New Economic Policy , a brief flirt with small - scale capitalism , and was sliding into the long , cruel night of cultural destruction and terror .
Benjamin's peregrinations through Moscow 's streets and courtyards mark the traces of an old city , soon to be erased to make place for the huge edifices of Stalinist architecture .
The Berlin writer saw that the communist project was hopelessly stuck , just like the Mitsubishi in traffic .
Now , 82 years later , Russia is about to take leave of the Putin - era prosperity , shored up by high energy prices , and to slide , with the rest of the world , into the turmoil of protracted economic recession .
Stability , prosperity and the 7 % annual rise of the GNP has brought little progress to this distant Moscow periphery other than a few Western cars , some small - scale consumerism , patched up kiosks , countless construction sites and street repairs that only exacerbate traffic congestion .
Back in the city centre , just 10 km away , the ostentatious display of wealth , haughty office towers , luxury apartment houses , streets clogged with huge limousines set the urban scene .
The barrage of advertising schlock and neon , billboards offering brand new taunhauzi and kotedzi , sushi joints and elegant restaurants , strip clubs and cigar bars , is as overwhelming as it was on my previous visits .
When I was last here , in April 2005 , I noticed that this capitalist explosion was accompanied by a certain unease and anxiety .
Many of my friends felt that the price of this growing prosperity would be arrogant governmental interventionism , increased control of the NGOs , rampant corruption and pumped - up nationalism .
Khodorkovsky was already in jail but had yet to be condemned to 9 years in Sibiria .
So I was unable to gauge the full impact of the Khodorkovsky effect , which the Putin regime meticulously stage - managed to tame the oligarchs , sidetrack philanthropy in the innocent , apolitical cultural and social spheres and rein in critical and activist NGOs .
The dismantling and re-establishment of the Yukos empire and the grand gignol trial of its boss , symbolically re-arranged the balance of power , drew clear lines of what was permissible and tolerable , and extinguished all illusions of pluralism and the civil society movement that budded in the turbulent Yeltsin era .
The gushing oil , gas and precious metal export profits corrupted large swathes of the intelligentsia , distributed more subsidies to public cultural institutions and renovated much of the decaying infrastructure .
It created a class of wealthy consumers , fixated on culture as glamour and fancy entertainment - partly in the style of Hollywood glitz and partly along the lines of the super - patriotic , traditional iconography of nationalism and superpower nostalgia .
But the loudly trumpeted reforms of cultural and social systems never happened , much of the state income has been squandered , the stock market has been plummeting for months , Russian and foreign capital is fleeing the country , the government stability fund - once a solild 500 billion dollars - has been dented to salvage the flailing ruble and secure liquidity for the major banks .
The tycoons have taken a severe beating and the crisis is only just beginning .
With the worldwide economic recession exploding , Russian exports , consisting of 80 % energy and raw materials , will generate much less money for the state budget and inevitably put the brakes on small - scale consumerism and the small and medium business economy created to sustain it .
The brights lights are starting to flicker in central Moscow .
Only the night before , I saw a line of people in front of a travel agency : Aeroflot had stopped taking credit card payments , an ominous sign that the party 's over .
I was not only going to have explain credit cards to Walter Benjamin , I would have to tell him that this crisis of globalized capitalism was n't just a liquidity crisis and a solvency crisis but a crisis of trust , involving the depletion of social capital by reckless speculation in derivatives , subprime mortgages and insured security swaps .
This is not the fate of the work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction .
Admittedly , international stars are still Moscow regulars , festivals of all sorts abound , a publishing boom is spilling forth domestic and translated books as never before , former factories are being converted into creative hubs where small - scale cultural industry coexists with non-profit experimental art , internet use is rocketing .
And affluent Moscovites are fighting the traffic on the way to the airport to take off for foreign destinations .
But there is also a growing fear that the binge might soon be over – and then what ?
Benjamin's experience with the 1929 crisis and its aftermath could offer some painful analogies , but I am not sure that they are applicable .
My Moscow interlocutors cannot see the future as a mere extension of the dynamics of recent years .
Some major - scale discontinuity seems inevitable .
The regime , impoverished and unable to bribe clients and pamper consumers , could well take a paranoid turn , and seek to assert itself through nationalist mobilisation at home and aggressive posturing abroad .
On the other hand Russian power holders , fearing social unrest and aware of the country 's economic , institutional and demographic weak points , could also seek domestic and international appeasement .
They might embrace initiative and nascent pluralism , seek to strengthen rule of law and respect of private property , in the hope that such measures might secure some goodwill abroad , and provide the stability and international support necessary to survive economic hardship .
That a few weeks ago a Moscow court overruled the tax evasion charges against the British Council , might be an early signal of this second scenario .
If this is a window of opportunity ( even it 's just a fortochka , the tiny window that is occasionally opened in the long Russian winter to let in some fresh air ) , then European cultural networks , foundations , organisations and associations should not ignore it , nor should culture ministries , regions , cities and EU institutions .
After all the West 's arrogant and humiliating gestures towards Russia , now is the moment to reach out to Russian public cultural organisations , in particular to the small and weak world of informal and autonomous culture , to the radical and critical artists and intellectuals who bravely resisted corruption and authoritarianism .
It is time to organise cultural exchanges , it is time for engagement , support and encouragement .
With this Katrina of global capitalism bearing down on us , it is time to recognise that we are all in the same boat .
There will undoubtedly be less public and private money for culture , fewer sponsors , donors and perhaps even audiences , but what really matters is to buttress cultural production against the social and political consequences of this crisis and oppose a radical shift to populism and xenophobia that threatens Russia and rest of Europe .
In the back seat of the Mitsubishi , Benjamin 's shadow grew silent .
It was visibly confused by my explanations and wild speculations and perhaps , too , by the depressingly monotonous periphery through which we we continued to crawl .
He looked old and tired and I felt embarrassed and tired too , from all the stress and frantic speculation about what I would do if I missed my flight .
My Russian visa would expire at midnight , it was a pre-holiday Sunday which made it difficult to come up with contingency plans and I did not cherish the idea of spending the night in the Shermetyevo 2 transit zone , waiting for some early morning flight to anywhere westwards .
I slipped into a self - protective nap and when I awoke , perhaps only minutes later , Sacha had managed to break free of the traffic and we were hurtling towards the airport , 2 hours and 20 minutes after setting off from the centre of Moscow .
I only managed to catch my flight because KLM had extended the check - in time to wait for two - thirds of its passengers who , like me , were trapped in the traffic .
I did not have to stay to celebrate the Day of People 's Unity , I could be home for dinner .
Benjamin's ghost had its own flying arrangements , away from Avangardnaya and Festivalskaya , away from Moscow .

Enlarge By H. Darr Beiser , USA TODAY General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner got $ 9.3 million in salary plus bonus last year .
DETROIT  The United Auto Workers says it knows it needs to help Detroit 's automakers cut labor costs to reduce the gap in production expenses with Asian rivals .
But as talks continue on new contracts , the union also is questioning why top executives at the automakers are paid what they are .
" As much as workers do , workers can't do enough , and as much as executives get , they cannot get enough , " UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said during last month 's two - day strike against General Motors ( GM ) .
CHRYSLER TALKS : UAW , automaker press the deadline During talks with GM , the UAW pointed out that while the automaker has complained that hourly wages and benefits are dragging it down , it has continued awarding bonuses to its top executives .
GM CEO Rick Wagoner earned $ 9.3 million in salary and bonus in 2006 , nearly double what he earned in 2005 .
While UAW members finish voting on a new contract with General Motors that includes a cost - of - living freeze , union negotiators have moved on to Chrysler , with Ford Motor ( F ) next .
Chrysler 's new CEO , Bob Nardelli , became a symbol of corporate excess when he left Home Depot early this year with a $ 210 million severance package .
Ford 's new CEO , Alan Mulally , got $ 27.8 million in salary and bonus in his first few months on the job , including an $ 18.5 million signing bonus .
Some top executives have taken steps to curtail their pay during automakers ' recent financial difficulties .
Former Ford CEO
Bill
Ford took only $ 1 in wages during his tenure and donated much of his stock - based pay to charity .
Wagoner and his top lieutenants took a base pay cut , although they continued to get bonuses .
Pros and cons
The automakers did n't want to comment on the issue .
Critics say automotive executive paydays are out of line with what 's happening in the industry .
" It seems like something out of the gilded age , " says Chris Kutalik , an editor at Labor Notes newspaper .
" It 's such a glaring disparity . "
Others say executive salaries are determined by what companies are willing to pay for the talent .
" There 's pros and cons to every bit of it .
Do you want the job of being a CEO of a bankrupt supplier for nothing ?
The question becomes what 's the right amount of pay for the job that 's being rendered , " says Laurie Harbour Felax , auto industry consultant at Stout Risius Ross .
Mulally defended his pay package to reporters last summer , saying , " All the skills required to run a business are market - driven . "
Pay packages at U.S. automakers do n't stand out compared with those at other U.S. companies .
The median 2006 compensation for CEOs at 50 of the largest U.S. companies was $ 17.8 million , according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from Salary.com 's CompAnalyst Executive database .
Packages included salary , bonus , perks and stock and options awards .
But U.S. executive pay outpaces that of Asian companies , including Asian automakers .
Detroit automakers have focused on the gap between their hourly workers and those of the non-union foreign automakers in the USA .
Union workers say the executive pay gap should be examined , as well .
" There is a huge difference between Asia and here when it comes to the top executive compensation , " says Han Kim , a professor of business administration at the University of Michigan .
" Rarely in Asia , especially Japan and Korea , do the CEOs get paid more than a million dollars . "
Japanese companies are not required to break out salaries and bonuses for top executives .
Instead , they lump them together .
Last year , Toyota 's top 37 executives earned a combined $ 21.6 million in salary and bonuses , according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
U.K. firm Manifest Information Services , which analyzes proxy information , estimates Toyota 's top executive , Hiroshi Okuda , earned $ 903,000 in 2006 .
At Honda , the top 21 earned $ 11.1 million , combined , in salary and bonuses , SEC filings show .
" There is this huge gap between the average worker and the CEO , and the gap is greatest in the U.S. , " Kim says .
" That kind of thing might work where individual work counts the most , but in the manufacturing sector , it 's all about teamwork . "
It 's difficult to get a precise comparison because Japanese companies are not required to include perks .
" It 's a very tough comparison to make , " says David Cole , chairman of the Center for Automotive Research .
The perks given to Japanese executives can include homes , chauffeurs , country club memberships .
In the USA , " our disclosure on things like this is pretty complete .
The first inclination is to say there 's this huge difference , but I do n't think that 's true . "
" It 's true that they have some of those extra perks , " Felax says .
" But let 's not kid ourselves ; so do the American guys . "
Focus on hourly pay Despite UAW grumbling about executive pay , the focus throughout the current labor negotiations has been on hourly worker pay .
GM 's proposed contract attempts to close the gap between its workers and those of its foreign rivals .
It 's estimated that GM workers earn an average $ 73 an hour when benefits including health care and pensions are added in .
That appears to be about $ 25 an hour more than Toyota 's U.S. workers .
Toyota and GM workers earn about the same hourly wages .
Benefits are what push the UAW members ahead .
The GM contract slashes the hourly rate by making changes in retiree health care .
The contract also will allow GM to bring in certain workers at lower wages .
For Gregory Stack , a Chrysler union worker in Detroit , the conversation about hourly pay seems unfair .
" We 're all pretty much watching helplessly as the situation with the domestic auto industry worsens daily , " says Stack , who is a third - generation autoworker .
" Unions are getting a lot of negative press as being the sole cause of all the problems with the corporations . "
While he 's willing to take some concessions in the upcoming contract , he says he hopes something is done to fix the wage structure up top , as well .
" The disparity is massive , " he says .
" It does not all necessarily lie with the unions . "

The Eclipse Web Tools and Data Tools Projects deliver a feature - rich environment for developing Java EE database - driven web applications .
This tutorial walks you through the process of creating a simple database web application using Eclipse WTP / DTP , Tomcat , and the Derby database engine .
Introduction
Creating database - driven web applications in Java has traditionally involved a steep learning curve .
Even if you already know how to write Java programs , and have a basic understanding of web applications , the Java Enterprise Edition ( Java EE ) stack is daunting .
Learning to use the Servlet API and JavaServer Page ( JSP ) technology to generate dynamic content is just the beginning .
Installing and configuring an open source Java EE web application server and a DBMS , and getting them to talk to each other , can require significant developer effort .
In this article , I will demonstrate how the combination of Eclipse Web Tools Platform , Eclipse Data Tools Platform , Tomcat , and Derby help to " lower the bar " by virtually eliminating the server administration issues , allowing developers to focus on the task at hand : building the web application .
I will assume that you understand the basics of SQL , and are familiar with HTML and basic web application concepts .
Prerequisites
You will need the following software to build the project :
Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers 3.3
Eclipse can be downloaded from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/.
The Eclipse IDE for Java EE
Developers distribution packages together all of the Web Tools Platform components and their dependencies in a convenient all - in - one download archive .
To install , simply extract the archive to your hard drive .
Tomcat 6.0
Available from http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi.
This tutorial was written using version 6.0.14 .
Note :
If you 're a Windows user , I recommend downloading the zip distribution and extracting it , instead of getting the packaged Tomcat installer , which installs Tomcat as a Windows service ( not an appropriate configuration for use with Eclipse WTP ) .
Derby Plugin for Eclipse
Get the Derby Plugin for Eclipse ( derby_core_plugin_10.2.2.zip and derby_ui_plugin_1.1.0.zip ) , available at http://db.apache.org/derby/derby_downloads.html.
Note : The plugins contain the Derby engine .
You do n't need to download the standard Derby distribution for this tutorial .
JRE 6.0
Sun 's JRE is available from http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
Getting Started with Derby
Derby is an open - source pure - Java Database Management System ( DBMS ) .
I picked it as the DBMS for this article because it is freely available , integrates nicely with Eclipse , runs on all platforms that Eclipse runs on , and , most importantly , is far simpler to install and administer than traditional DBMS's .
Like most popular DBMS's , Derby has a client / server architecture .
The Derby engine runs as a server process , accepting connections from client applications .
To use Derby , you start the Derby server , then you use Java database management tools to connect to the Derby server , create and populate databases , run queries , and so on .
The Derby plugin for Eclipse described in this article integrates the Derby server controls into Eclipse , so you can start and stop the Derby server from the Eclipse environment .
The plugin also stores the database files in the workspace , simplifying backup .
Installing the Derby plugin for Eclipse is fairly straightforward .
Here 's how to do it .
Unzip the two Derby Eclipse plugins ( derby_core_plugin_10.2.2.zip and derby_ui_plugin_1.1.0.zip ) into your eclipse installation folder ( ECLIPSE_ROOT ) .
Detailed instructions are available here : http://db.apache.org/derby/integrate/plugin_howto.html#Installing+the+plug-ins
In your ECLIPSE_ROOT / plugins folder , you should have a folder named org.apache.derby.core_10.2.2 .
Copy the file derbyclient . jar from that folder to your TOMCAT_ROOT / lib folder ( if you 're using Tomcat 5.x , install into TOMCAT_ROOT / common /lib ) .
This installs the Derby JDBC driver into Tomcat for use in a DataSource .
Eclipse organizes files in the workspace into projects .
When you use the Derby plugin for Eclipse , you create an empty Java project , and then you " Derby enable " it .
This project then becomes the repository for all of the Derby databases that you create in your workspace .
Follow these steps to create a Derby data project in Eclipse :
Start Eclipse .
If you have an existing Eclipse workspace , I suggest choosing a new workspace folder for this tutorial .
Choose Window >
Preferences from the menu to open the Eclipse Preferences dialog .
Navigate to Connectivity > Driver Definitions .
Select the Derby 10.2 folder and click Add ....
In the New Driver Definition dialog , select Derby Client JDBC Driver and click OK .
In the Provide Driver Details dialog , select the derbyclient . jar file and click Edit Jar / Zip .
Navigate to the location of the derbyclient . jar file on your system and click OK .
Click OK in the Preferences dialog .
Create a new Java project by selecting File > New > Other . Select Java > Java Project and click Next .
Enter the name data for the project , choose the option to create separate source and output folders , and click Finish .
This project will hold your Derby database for this tutorial .
In the Package Explorer , right - click your new project and choose Apache Derby > Add Apache Derby Nature .
This action marks the project as a Derby project , capable of storing one or more Derby databases .
Next , right - click your data project and choose Apache Derby > Start Derby Network Server .
This action starts the Derby server .
You should see the following message appear in the Eclipse Console :
The Derby server will run as long as you have Eclipse open .
If you close Eclipse , the next time you start Eclipse , you will need to start the Derby server again .
The server accepts connections only from the local host , which is just what you want for a development database .
Creating a Derby Database
Now that you 've installed Derby and started the Derby server , you will create a new database to hold the data for your web application .
To create a new Derby database , you must use a Java DBMS management tool to connect to the Derby server with a specially formatted connection string that includes the name of the database you want to create , and an option that tells the Derby server to create the database .
Here 's how to accomplish the task using the Eclipse Data tooling included with the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers .
Select Window > Open Perspective > Other . Choose Database Development from the list .
In the Data Source Explorer view , right - click the Databases folder and choose New .
In the New Connection Profile dialog , choose SQL Model - JDBC Connection , and click Next .
( We wo n't be using the Derby Embedded Database option , which prevents multiple JVM's from concurrently accessing the database . )
On the next page , enter the name sample for your database and click Next .
Leave Auto - connect at startup unchecked .
Fill out the final page as shown .
Note carefully the selections : Choose the Derby Client JDBC Driver from the driver dropdown ; accept the default Database name ( " SAMPLE " ) ; use any non-blank User ID and non-blank password ( the password is ignored by Derby ) .
Click Finish .
The connection wizard will display a new connection in the Databases folder named sample .
Right - click the sample icon and choose Connect to open the connection .
This will cause Derby to create the database .
The database files are stored in a folder named sample in your data project .
If you want to see them , switch to the Java perspective , right - click the data project and choose Refresh .
To create a backup of your Derby database , simply stop the Derby server , make a copy of the sample folder and its subfolders , and restart the server .
Restoring the database is just as simple : stop the server , replace the sample folder structure with the backup copy , and restart the server .
Now that the database is created , it 's time to create a table for our application and populate it with some data .
The current version of the Data tooling does n't include any wizards to create a table , so we 'll create a table using SQL Data Definition commands .
To execute SQL commands using the Eclipse Data tooling , you will create a SQL File , which provides an editor that allows you to enter and execute SQL statements .
Choose File > New > SQL File .
Click Next , and enter scratch ( or whatever ) as the filename .
Select sample from the Connection profile name dropdown , and select SAMPLE from the Database name dropdown to associate the SQL file with your Derby sample database .
Click Finish .
A blank SQL editor will open .
Copy and paste the following code into the editor : CREATE TABLE app.posts ( post_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY ( START WITH 1 , INCREMENT BY 1 ) , postname VARCHAR ( 50 ) , comments VARCHAR ( 512 ) NOT NULL ) ; INSERT INTO app.posts ( postname , comments ) VALUES ( ' Fred Jones ' , ' Derby is cool , and the Eclipse plugin makes using it a snap ! ' ) ; INSERT INTO app.posts ( postname , comments ) VALUES ( ' Wilma Harris ' , ' Tomcat lets me register DataSources using a file in my web project ?
That ''s great stuff ! ' ) ;
Right - click in the editor and choose Execute All .
The SQL Results tab will appear to show the results of the execution .
Now , back on the Data Source Explorer tab , browse to find the table that was created .
Right - click the Posts table and choose Data >
Edit to view the contents in an editable grid .
Creating a Web Project
Now that the database is in place , we 're ready to begin creating our web application .
A Java EE web application consists of a collection of dynamic resources ( such as Servlets , JavaServer Pages , and other Java classes ) , static resources ( HTML pages and images ) , and configuration files , all organized in a standardized directory .
Eclipse helps you organize your web applications using a type of project called a Dynamic Web Project .
When you create a Dynamic Web Project , you must select a Java EE web application server , which provides libraries needed by the project .
Follow these steps to create the project .
Select File > New > Other . Select Web > Dynamic Web Project and click Next .
Enter the Project Name demo , and click New beside the Target runtime dropdown .
Select Tomcat 6.0 and click Next .
Select your Tomcat 6.0 installation folder ( the root folder of the extracted Tomcat download archive ) .
Click Finish .
Back in the New Dynamic Project wizard , click Finish to create the project .
The application will use JSP tag libraries that you must download and install into your project .
Browse to http://jakarta.apache.org/site/downloads/downloads_taglibs-standard.cgi and download the jakarta - taglibs - standard - 1.1.2.zip distribution ( or , you can get them from the completed sample that accompanies this article ) .
Copy the jstl.jar and standard .
jar files from the download archive into your project 's WebContent / WEB - INF / lib folder .
When you 've done this , you may need to right - click on the project and choose Refresh .
In the Java EE Perspective 's Project Explorer , you should see them listed both under Web App Libraries and under the WEB - INF / lib folder as shown here ( note that if you 're using the Java perspective , with the Package Explorer , you wo n't see them in the WEB - INF / lib folder ) :
Next , we 'll tackle the issue of database connection management for our application .
Servlets and JSP pages that access a database are usually designed to obtain a database connection for each incoming request , and release the connection when the request has finished processing .
Since opening and closing database connections is usually an expensive operation , an efficient web application makes use of JNDI connection pooling to speed up database access .
The application server maintains a pool of connections to the database , and makes them available to the web application via a DataSource object .
Since connection pools are managed by the application server , not the web application , configuring connection pooling can be a pain .
Fortunately , Tomcat 6.0 makes it really easy .
Tomcat allows the developer to configure the database connection pool using a configuration file in the web project .
We 'll use that feature to simplify this tutorial .
The technique discussed here also works for Tomcat 5.5 .
If you are using Tomcat 5.0 or older , or another application server , you must consult your application server for information on configuring a DataSource .
Choose File > New >
File , select the META - INF folder , and enter the name context.xml .
Copy and paste the following into your context.xml file ( you may have to click on the Source tab at the bottom of the editor to be able to paste ) .
This defines a DataSource with the name " jdbc/SampleDB " .
Our application will retrieve database connections from the pool using this name .
< ?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?> < Context > < Resource name= " jdbc/SampleDB " auth = " Container " type=" javax.sql.DataSource " username= " app " password = " app " driverClassName=" org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver " url=" jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/sample " maxActive = " 8 " /> </ Context >
If you want to use a different DBMS , simply change the driverClassName and url to values appropriate for your database , and make sure you install your DBMS 's JDBC driver in Tomcat 's common / lib folder .
Writing the Application
Standard Java EE web applications use servlets and JSPs to generate dynamic content .
For this tutorial , we 'll create a JSP page to allow the user to interact with the database .
You do n't have to know Java to write JSPs ; the JSP Standard Tag Library provides all the capabilities a simple database application needs .
We 'll begin with a simple page that displays the comments in the Posts table .
Choose File > New >
File .
Fill out the dialog as shown , making sure that the WebContent folder is highlighted .
Next , paste the following code into the page : < %@ page language = " java " contentType= " text / html ; charset=ISO - 8859 -1 " %> < %@ taglib prefix= " sql " uri= " http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/sql " %> < %@ taglib prefix= " c " uri= " http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core " %> < sql:setDataSource dataSource=" jdbc/SampleDB " /> <!
DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional //EN " > < html > < head > < title > Speak To Me , Please < / title > </ head > < body > < h1 > Speak To Me , Please </ h1 > Welcome to the Acme Corp. feedback site . < h2 > Here's what your fellow workers have said :</ h2 > < table border= '1 '> < tr>< th> Worker </ th>< th> Comment</th></tr> < sql:query var= " qryPosts " > SELECT postname , comments FROM app.posts </sql:query > < c:forEach var = " row " items = " ${qryPosts.rows} " > < tr > < td >< c:out value= " ${row.postname} "
/></td> < td>< c:out value= " ${row.comments} "
/></td> </tr> </c:forEach > </ table > </ body > </html >
The taglib directives allow the use of the < sql : > and < c :> tags from the JSP Standard Tag Library .
taglib directives allow the use of the sql : > and < c :> tags from the JSP Standard Tag Library .
The < sql:setDataSource > tag references the JNDI DataSource whose attributes are defined in the context.xml file you created earlier .
The JSP engine retrieves a connection from the DataSource for use by queries later in the page .
< sql:setDataSource > tag references the JNDI DataSource whose attributes are defined in the context.xml file you created earlier .
The JSP engine retrieves a connection from the DataSource for use by queries later in the page .
The < sql:query > tag executes a query against the database and exposes the results in a JSP page variable named qryPosts .
< sql:query > tag executes a query against the database and exposes the results in a JSP page variable named qryPosts .
The < c:forEach > tag iterates over the results of the query .
The items expression " ${qryPosts.rows} " references the collection of rows returned from the query and exposed via the qryPosts JSP variable .
The body of the < c:forEach > tag emits a row of the HTML table for each row in the query result set .
Each time the body is evaluated , the iterator variable row references the next row of the query result set .
< c:forEach > tag iterates over the results of the query .
The items expression " ${qryPosts.rows} " references the collection of rows returned from the query and exposed via the qryPosts JSP variable .
The body of the < c:forEach > tag emits a row of the HTML table for each row in the query result set .
Each time the body is evaluated , the iterator variable row references the next row of the query result set .
The < c:out value= " ${row.postname} " /> expression inserts the value of the postname field of the current row of the result set .
If you 're using an application server other than Tomcat 6.0 , and you do n't know how to configure a DataSource , you can embed the connection attributes directly in the JSP page .
You wo n't get connection pooling , but you can at least get the sample working by replacing line with the following lines :
<% Class.forName(" org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver " ) ; %> < sql:setDataSource dataSource=" jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/sample " user = " app " password = " app " />
If you do this , you may also find it necessary to copy the derbyclient .
jar file to your project 's WEB - INF / lib folder to make the JDBC driver class available to your application .
Testing the Application
Notes about the code :
We have n't finished the application yet , but let 's take a break from coding to test the existing functionality .
Right click on demo.jsp and select Run As > Run on Server .
Select the Tomcat 6.0 server , and click Finish .
Eclipse starts the Tomcat application server .
After the server starts , you should see a page like this .
Note : If Eclipse has problems starting the server , make sure you do n't already have Tomcat running on your system .
If you have an instance of Tomcat running , you should stop it before trying to test your application in Eclipse .
Try adding a new row to the Posts table using the Eclipse table editor I mentioned earlier .
After you save the new row , you should be able to click Reload in the web browser , and the new row should appear .
Letting Users Leave Feedback
This application does n't allow users to contribute feedback .
Let 's enhance the JSP page to provide a form that users can fill out to add comments .
Switch to the JSP editor and copy and paste the following code just above the closing < / body > tag :
< form action = " demo.jsp " method= " post " > < table > < tr > < td > Your name : ( optional ) < / td > < td > < input type= ' text ' name= ' name ' value= " $ {name} " ></td > </tr > < tr > < td > Your comments :</td > < td >< textarea name= ' comments ' rows = " 6 " cols= " 40 " >$ {comments}</textarea></td > </tr > < tr> < td></td> < td >< input type=' submit ' name= ' action ' value= ' Submit ' >
</tr> </table > < h3>$ {msg}</h3 > </ form >
When the user clicks the submit button on this form , the name and comments entered by the user will be submitted to the demo.jsp page for processing .
A message indicating success or failure will be placed in a JSP variable named msg to inform the user of the result of the processing .
Next , we need to write the code to process the form submission .
Insert the following code at the top of the page , after the < sql:setDataSource > tag :
< c:set var =" name " value= " ${param.name} " /> < c:set var = " comments " value= " ${param.comments} " /> < c:if test= " ${param.action == ' Submit'} " > < c:choose > < c:when test= " $ {not empty comments} " > < sql:update > INSERT INTO app.posts ( postname , comments ) VALUES ( ? , ? ) < sql:param value= " $ {name} " /> < sql:param value= " ${comments} " /> </ sql:update > < c:set var = " msg " value =
" Thank you for your feedback . " /> < c:set var =" name " value= " " /> < c:set var=" comments " value= " " /> </ c:when > < c:otherwise > < c:set var = " msg " value =
" Please supply some comments . "
/> </c:otherwise > </c:choose > </c:if >
Notes about the code :
When the user submits the form , his name and comments are submitted to the JSP page .
The < c:set > statements retrieve those values and place them in local JSP variables named name and comments .
< c:set > statements retrieve those values and place them in local JSP variables named name and comments .
If this is a form submission , the action parameter will be " Submit " , and the code inside the < c: if > block will execute to process the submission .
On the initial page load , the action parameter will be empty , and the code inside the < c: if > block will not execute .
< c:if > block will execute to process the submission .
On the initial page load , the action parameter will be empty , and the code inside the < c: if > block will not execute .
The user may opt to omit his name , but must supply some comments .
The < c:when > test verifies that the comments variable is not blank .
< c:when > test verifies that the comments variable is not blank .
The < sql:update > tag is used to execute an INSERT , UPDATE , or DELETE statement against the database .
The question marks (? ) indicate places in the query where user input is substituted .
< sql:update > tag is used to execute an INSERT , UPDATE , or DELETE statement against the database .
The question marks (? ) indicate places in the query where user input is substituted .
The < sql: param > tags supply values for the ?
placeholders .
< sql:param > tags supply values for the ?
placeholders .
The contents of a JSP variable named msg is displayed at the bottom of the form .
Here , msg is set to indicate to the user that the submission was successfully saved .
Here , msg is set to indicate to the user that the submission was successfully saved .
If the user failed to enter comments , this code is executed , and sets msg to indicate to the user why the submission could not be successfully processed .
After entering this code , save the changes .
Switch back to the browser view and click Reload .
You should see a form appear :
Try entering some comments and clicking Submit .
The page should process the submission , and you should see your comments appear in the table .
Check the database table using the table editor ; you should find that the comments have been saved there .
Deploying the Database
When you are ready to deploy the application to a production Tomcat application server , you must copy the Derby database data folders to the application server computer .
You then have a couple of options for accessing the Derby database from your deployed application .
You can install Derby on the application server computer , and run it in client / server mode .
Your application connects to the database using the same technique as I 've demonstrated in this article .
The drawback to this approach is that you have two server processes to manage : Tomcat and Derby .
You can use Derby in embedded mode .
In this scenario , the Derby engine runs inside the Tomcat process .
You do n't have to stop and start Derby separately from Tomcat .
For more information , refer to the Derby website .
Summary
The Eclipse Web Tools Project , combined with Tomcat 6.0 , Derby , and the Eclipse Data Tools Project , reduces the burden of server administration , delivering a convenient platform for Java EE database web application development .
This article demonstrated how to construct a simple Java EE web application using these tools .
Resources
The completed sample is available .
You can import it into Eclipse by renaming it to demo.war , choosing File > Import , and selecting Web > WAR File .
Note that the database is not included ; you must set that up following the instructions in the article .

RICHMOND , Va.  Senators Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden Jr. seldom see each other as they campaign for the Democratic ticket .
And they talk only occasionally .
But on Wednesday , Mr. Obama delivered a long - distance message to his running mate .
“ I think Joe sometimes engages in rhetorical flourishes , ” Mr. Obama said , gently chiding the vice - presidential nominee as he sought to sweep aside a dustup Mr. Biden touched off when he predicted that a world crisis would test Mr. Obama during his first six months in office .
“ A period of transition in a new administration is always one where we have to be vigilant , we have to be careful , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ We have to be mindful that as we pass the baton in this democracy that others do n’t take advantage of it  that ’s true whether it ’s myself or Senator McCain . ”
In his remarks , Mr. Biden told supporters at a Seattle fund - raiser on Sunday that if Mr. Obama was elected , the world ’s leaders would test his mettle as a young president , just as they did John F. Kennedy .
The comment from Mr. Biden fanned a new line of criticism from Republicans that Mr. Obama is not ready for the presidency .
At the Times , it is house style to refer to a successful Presidential nominee by his full name in the lead of the main story the morning after the election .
He may be Bill or Jimmy on his campaign posters , but in the newspaper of record on that one momentous occasion he is William Jefferson or James Earl , Jr. So say it loud and say it proud : Barack Hussein Obama , President - elect of the United States .
Of the United States of America , as he himself liked to say on the stump — always , it seemed , with a touch of awe at the grandeur and improbability of it all .
Illustration by Tom Bachtell
Barack Hussein Obama : last week , sixty - five million Americans turned a liability — a moniker so politically inflammatory that the full recitation of it was considered foul play — into a global diplomatic asset , a symbol of the resurgence of America ’s ability to astonish and inspire .
In the Convention keynote speech that made him instantly famous four years ago , Obama called himself “ a skinny kid with a funny name . ”
Funny ?
Not really .
“ Millard Fillmore ” — now , that ’s funny .
The Times contented itself with referring to the candidate ’s “ unusual name . ” Unusual ?
Unusual would be , say , “ Dwight D. Eisenhower . ”
Ten weeks from now , the President of the United States will be a person whose first name is a Swahili word derived from the Arabic ( it means “ blessing ” ) , whose middle name is that not only of a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad but also of the original target of an ongoing American war , and whose last name rhymes nicely with “ Osama . ”
That ’s not a name , it ’s a catastrophe , at least in American politics .
Or ought to have been .
Yet Barack Obama won , and won big .
Democrats have now achieved pluralities in four of the last five Presidential elections .
But Obama ’s popular vote was an outright majority — a little more than fifty - two per cent , at the latest reckoning — and the largest share for a nominee of his party since Lyndon Johnson ’s in 1964 .
Obama made significant gains compared with John Kerry , four years ago , in nearly every category that exit polls record : black folks but also white folks ; liberals but also conservatives ; women but also men .
His gains were especially striking among Latinos , the very poor and the very well - off , Catholics and the unchurched , and the two groups most likely to be concerned about the future — young people and the parents of children living at home .
And although the Obama wave does not seem to have brought with it a filibuster - proof Senate , it did sweep into office enough new members of both houses of Congress to offer him the hope of a governing legislative majority .

We ’re just eliminating your salary . ”

This election was so extraordinary in so many ways that its meaning will take many years to play out and many more to be understood .
But there is already the feel of the beginning of a new era .
As in 1932 and 1980 , a crisis in the economy opened the way for the rejection of a reigning approach to government and the forging of a new one .
Emphatically , comprehensively , the public has turned against conservatism at home and neoconservatism abroad .
The faith that unfettered markets and minimal taxes on the rich will solve every domestic problem , and that unilateral arrogance and American arms will solve every foreign one , is dead for a generation or more .
And the electoral strategy of “ cultural ” resentment and fake populism has been dealt a grievous blow .
Obama is young , educated , focussed , reassuring , and energetic .
He is as accomplished a writer as he is a speaker .
His campaign was a marvel of discipline , organization , and prescience .
He has , as a conservative critic acknowledged , “ a first - class intellect and a first - class temperament . ”
We have had these qualities in our Presidents before , if rarely all in the same person .
But Obama ’s most visible attribute , the only one mentioned in that Times lead , is unique , even revolutionary : the color of his skin .
As surely as Appomattox , the post - Civil War constitutional amendments , Brown v. Board of Education , and the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts of the nineteen - sixties , Obama ’s election is a giant victory in the long struggle against what an earlier generation of Republicans called the Slave Power and its long legacy of exclusion and hate .
During the campaign , Obama ’s “ exoticism ” — both real ( his childhood in Jakarta ) and imagined ( “ he ’s a Muslim ” ) — served bigots as a cover for racism .
But it was a shield as well as a vulnerability .
It set him apart from the stereotypes of racial prejudice .
It broadened rather than narrowed his “ otherness . ”
His absent father was Kenyan ; if the son ’s line of descent includes American slaves , they are hidden on his mother ’s side , as they are in the lineage of myriads of this country ’s white citizens .
His upbringing in his mother ’s far - flung world and the polyglot Hawaii of his white grandparents gave him the perspective of both an outsider and an insider .
His search for identity — the subject of his book “ Dreams from My Father , ” now assured of a place in the American literary canon — made him a profound student of the American dilemma .
In his Philadelphia speech of March 18 , 2008 , prompted by the firestorm over his former pastor , he treated the American people as adults capable of complex thinking — as his equals , you might say .
But what made that speech special , what enabled it to save his candidacy , was its analytic power .
It was not defensive .
It did not overcompensate .
In its combination of objectivity and empathy , it persuaded Americans of all colors that he understood them .
In return , they have voted to make him their President .
A generation ago , few people anywhere imagined that they would witness the dissolution of Soviet totalitarianism , or the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as President of a multiracial South African democracy , or the transformation of China into a fearsome engine of capitalist commerce .
Nor did Americans of an age to remember Selma and Montgomery and Memphis imagine that they would live to see an African - American elected President of the United States .
It has happened .
No doubt there will be disappointments and difficulties ahead ; there always are .
But a few months from now a blue - and - white Boeing 747 emblazoned UNITED STATES OF AMERICAwill touch down on a tarmac somewhere in Europe or Asia or Africa , the door will open , and out will step Barack and Michelle Obama .
That is something to look forward to . ♦
The iPhone 3G
Pt. 1 : Macro
Let ’s just say it up front : the iPhone is the greatest piece of consumer electronics that has ever been made .
If I could travel back 20 years and show my then 15 - year - old self just one thing from the future of today , it would be the iPhone .
It is our flying cars .
Star Trek - style wireless long - distance voice communicator .
The content of every major newspaper and magazine in the world .
An encyclopedia .
Video games .
TV . Etc .
None of these features is quite what an imagination of the ’ 80s would have predicted .
The TV , for example , is far from the imaginary “ pocket TV ” of my youth , which was rooted in the concept of broadcast TV channels .
But it is a TV .
In some ways it is worse ; you cannot use an iPhone to , say , watch a live broadcast of a sporting event .
In many ways , though , it is better ; it stores content , including full - length major motion pictures , which you can watch whenever you want .
A pocket full of movies was simply unimaginable 20 years ago .
And it ’s all in one easily pocketed gizmo .
Each of these features is of course available in devices other than the iPhone .
A checklist of the iPhone ’s features is not , in and of itself , impressive .
Some competing devices , in fact , offer all the same fundamental features of the iPhone .
The difference is in the overall experience .
( Even a $ 10 Nokia dumbphone , combined with today ’s worldwide cellular and satellite phone network , can do the Star Trek - wireless voice communicator trick .
That alone would be impressive compared to the brick - sized fabulously expensive cellular phones of the ’ 80s . )
Everything Apple as a company has ever stood for , good and bad , was to get to the point where they could make this .
It ’s a computer you can take with you everywhere , so small you would n’t really even want it much smaller , even if it were possible .
In software , Apple went back and rethought certain priorities with the iPhone compared to Mac OS X .
On Mac OS X , scrolling prioritizes visual fidelity but can be painfully slow .
Not so much with today ’s Mac hardware , but in the early days of Mac OS X , scrolling or resizing windows could be molasses slow .
iPhone scrolling , on the other hand , is almost always fluid and perfectly responsive , but the content often does n’t keep up .
The checkerboard background in MobileSafari is the most obvious example of this .
The illusion that your thumb or finger is actually moving the screen contents is astoundingly effective .
Mac OS
X values the visual over the feel ; iPhone OS is vice versa , and I prefer it .
In hardware , the radical reduction of physical buttons has proven to be genius .
The iPhone not only eschews a keypad and keyboard , but also those green / red place - call / end - call buttons that you see on nearly every other phone in the world .
The iPhone has just four buttons : power , volume up , volume down , and home .
That seems just right .
I ’ve gotten satisfyingly proficient typing with the on - screen touch keyboard .
My single biggest gripe is that my right thumb often hits the Return key when I ’m trying to hit the space bar .
In another five years , one of today ’s iPhones will be no more than a sentimental curiosity , painfully slow both in terms of networking and computation .
The iPhone has significant and obvious shortcomings .
But it is an order of magnitude better than anything that came before it .
Pt. 2 : Micro
I bought my original iPhone on day one .
When the iPhone 3G arrived , I figured I could wait .
In early August , one month after they went on sale , I upgraded .
In a nut , the iPhone 3G is aptly named , in that it is n’t much more than the iPhone plus 3G .
If they ’d called it “ iPhone 3G ( and GPS ) ” the name alone would have completely described what was new , technically at least .
The iPhone 3G uses the same CPU and has the same amount of RAM ( 128 MB ) as the original .
It is an iteration .
If you ’ve got an original EDGE iPhone , the only factor that really matters with regard to whether you ’d be happy after upgrading is the quality of the 3G service where you live .
I , apparently , am lucky .
3G service in center city Philadelphia , the surrounding suburbs , and at the New Jersey shore has been terrific .
Even before the 2.1 OS update , I had few complaints about dropped calls , and network speed has far exceeded my expectations .
Browsing with 3G on the iPhone generally feels just about as fast as browsing with Wi -Fi — the CPU often seems to be the limiting factor in MobileSafari ’s rendering speed , not the network .
In addition to the faster data speeds and higher - quality audio , 3G offers one additional advantage over EDGE : 3G can take an incoming phone call while simultaneously using the data network .
I missed a surprising number of calls on my old iPhone while dicking around waiting for pages to load in Safari .
The main problem I initially ran into with 3G networking was that it would occasionally get stuck .
I ’d try to load a web page , and the inside - the - location - field progress bar in MobileSafari would simply never get past the “ h ” in “ http : ” .
In most cases , turning the iPhone completely off and back on would fix this .
Even better : I have not seen this problem once since upgrading to the 2.1 OS .
Tethering my 3G connection with NetShare — sadly , no longer available from the App Store — my MacBook Pro achieves download speeds of 700-900 kb/s , and upload speeds of 200-400 kb / s.
Tethering with EDGE , I see download speeds of about 200 kb / s .
Thus , for me , networking far exceeds Apple ’s marketing claim of “ double the speed ” , and for that alone the upgrade price and slightly higher monthly plan are well worth it .
1
( Net Share is simply remarkable , and deserves a full digression .
After just one month of owning an iPhone 3G , the $ 10 I spent on NetShare is some of the best money I ’ve ever spent .
The multi-step process required to get it working , which you can only partially automate , is a hassle .
If Apple can build a feature like this into the iPhone itself , it will be a smash hit feature , and , if it were something that only worked with Mac OS X , yet another impetus for iPhone / iPod users to switch from Windows .
( My use of “ can ” is a reference to the challenge of getting phone carriers on board with it , not any technical hurdle . )
The biggest limitation using NetShare is that because it ’s a SOCKS proxy , it mostly only supports HTTP / HTTPS networking traffic .
i Chat can be configured to use a SOCKS proxy , but I ’m aware of no way to get Apple Mail to use a SOCKS proxy for IMAP or SMTP , which means Mail does n’t work using NetShare .
But for web surfing , NetShare is a spectacular success .
Yes , I ’m aware that you can buy external Mac - compatible EVDO dinguses from Verizon , AT&T , and Sprint , but those are separate services that cost like $ 60 per month .
With NetShare , I paid $ 10 one time and I can use it with my existing iPhone data plan without paying one additional cent .
Performance is way better than the Wi-Fi service in most hotels . )
The 3G ’s ringer is louder .
( I sometimes missed calls with my original iPhone because I did n’t hear or feel the phone ringing in my pocket . )
The speakerphone sounds much better .
As noted shortly after the 3G shipped , the color temperature of the display is different — warmer if you like it , yellower if you do n’t .
I prefer the original ( cooler ) temperature , but it ’s only noticeable to me when compared side - by - side .
Temperature aside , the screen seems identical to that of the original .
Looking at the front face , the form factor is practically unchanged .
The 3G is slightly wider overall , but since the display is the same size , there is now a small black border between the screen and the chrome , where previously the screen ran nearly chrome - to - chrome .
The back is completely different , plastic instead of metal , and differently shaped .
( I chose black , of course . )
Aesthetically , I prefer the original iPhone case on all counts : shape , appearance , touch .
The original iPhone is , to put it bluntly , sexier .
I even liked the black plastic panel at the bottom of the original iPhone — it made it easy to tell which way the phone was oriented without looking at it , such as when pulling it from a pocket .
From a practical standpoint , however , the all - shiny - plastic 3G has one significant and perhaps very valuable advantage : it is not slippery .
There ’s a tackiness to the iPhone 3G in hand .
There is something to be said for the fact that the phone with the strongest brand in the world has no visible branding whatsoever on its front face .
The home button on the 3G seems to require a more forceful push .
The clickiness of my original iPhone ’s home button is better .
On the other hand , the clickiness of the 3G ’s volume and sleep buttons is better .
Apple sometimes seems to be the lone consumer electronics company that pays any attention at all to the tactile response of buttons .
Battery life is the single biggest shortcoming .
The simple truth is that the iPhone pushes the limits of what a device this size can do .
Power consumption is perhaps
Apple ’s single - biggest engineering concern with the iPhone — both in software and hardware .
Last year , when criticism of the original iPhone centered on the lack of 3G , Steve Jobs said it was about power .
He was right .
The iPhone 3G consumes power faster .
However , the 2.1 OS update improved battery life dramatically .
In particular , after upgrading to OS 2.1 , the iPhone 3G does not seem to lose much power while idle .
Part of it , too , is that because 3G is faster , you can do more in the same amount of time .
So if you measure by time , yes , one hour of web browsing on EDGE will leave you with more battery life than one hour of browsing on 3G .
But if you measure by the page , I think loading and reading , say , 15 web pages on 3G stands up just fine against loading the same 15 pages on EDGE .
It just happens faster .
Pt. 3 : Coda
“ What ’s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest .
You can be watching TV and see Coca - Cola , and you know that the President drinks Coke , Liz Taylor drinks Coke , and just think , you can drink Coke , too .
A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking .
All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good .
Liz Taylor knows it , the President knows it , the bum knows it , and you know it . ” — Andy Warhol
So too with the iPhone .
A billionaire can buy homes , cars , clothes that the rest of us cannot afford .
But he cannot buy a better phone , at any price , than the iPhone that you can have in your pocket today .
Have you ever noticed that you feel better when you 're around your pet ?
It 's true .
Spending quality time with a dog , cat or other animal can have a positive impact on your mood and your health .
Pets can be calming stress - fighters .
" We found that pet owners , on average , were better off than non-owners , especially when they have a higher - quality relationship with their pets , " says pet researcher Allen R. McConnell , PhD .
He 's a professor of psychology at Miami University .
" What [ makes ] a meaningful relationship varies from person to person . ”
For some active people , that includes playing ball or Frisbee in the park .
For others who ca n’t get outside , just petting your dog can help you feel connected .
Pets can help you in other ways , too .
1. A Healthier Heart Your dog may make you less likely to get heart disease .
Why ?
Dog owners walk more and have lower blood pressure than people who do n't have dogs .
Pets can also be good for you if you already have heart problems .
Heart attack survivors and people with serious abnormal heart rhythms who own dogs live longer than people with the same heart problems who do n't have pets , studies show .
2. Stress Soothers
Petting your cat or dog feels good .
It can lower your blood pressure , helps your body release a relaxation hormone , and cuts down on levels of a stress hormone .
It also soothes your pet , says Alan Beck , ScD , director of the Center for the Human - Animal Bond at Purdue University .
3. Social Magnets
Pets , especially dogs , can help you connect with other people .
" If I saw you walking down the street , I could n't comfortably start talking to you if I did n't know you , but I could if you had a dog , " Beck says .
" It 's an acceptable interaction that otherwise would n't be possible . "
People who use wheelchairs say that other people make eye contact with them more often and ask if they can be of help when they 're with their dogs , Beck says .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- President - elect Barack Obama , like every candidate seeking to oust a ruling party , campaigned on a platform of change .
Then he went and hired half of the former Clinton administration .
There 's nothing , of course , wrong with a little experience in the highest ranks of an administration that is facing a dire economic landscape .
Obama himself said he would have a hard time justifying to the American people tapping someone who did n't have government experience for a Cabinet - level appointment .
To his credit , he also nailed the most important pick of his transition : Timothy Geithner to head the Treasury Department .
Geithner is much like the incoming president .
He 's smart , young , well - regarded and has just enough experience to not be considered a tenderfoot .
If anything , the Geithner appointment shows just how uneven the nation 's 44th president has been in picking confidants .
The trouble began with the economic advisory team that flanked him at his first post-election news conference .
Three camps
Obama , perhaps unknowingly , has divided his economic team into three camps :
There are the smart , successful outside - the - box thinkers such as Google Inc.'s GOOG , +0.32 % Eric Schmidt , Anne Mulcahy of Xerox Corp. XRX , +0.70 % and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s BRK.A , - 1.30 % Warren Buffett .
Eric Schmidt , Anne Mulcahy of Xerox Corp. XRX , and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s BRK.A , Warren Buffett .
There are the Clinton retreads , including Roel Campos , the former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman , Robert Reich , the former labor secretary , former advisers Daniel Tarulio , former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers , and the list goes on .
And then there are the what - was - he - thinking picks : Dick Parsons , the former Time Warner Inc. TWX , chief executive and current Citigroup Inc. board member who is known for presiding over the most lackluster media company during one of the most robust economies in a generation .
The latter group also includes Laura Tyson , the University of California economics professor who sits on three corporate boards , including Morgan Stanley 's MS , - 2.35 % .
She served Morgan during its bungled ouster of Philip Purcell in 2005 , a lost year for the firm that earned the board low marks for corporate governance and cost the company several top bankers .
But the real head scratcher is Robert Rubin , who has held top roles at Citigroup C , - 2.12 % since 1999 .
A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS , - 1.14 % banker , Rubin served as Treasury secretary during both Clinton terms .
Rubin is the Mole of today 's economic crisis .
Given the opportunity to protect the country from deregulation of financial services , at Treasury he worked with then - Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to redesign or roll back Depression - era reforms .
Of course , the greatest beneficiary of deregulation was Citigroup .
Formed in 1998 through the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group , the new company combined some of America 's biggest banks , investment banks and insurance companies under one roof .
A job at Citi
So , when Rubin decided to step down at Treasury , yielding that post to Larry Summers , it was n't long before Citi 's chairman and chief executive , Sandy Weill , came calling .
He offered Wall Street 's equivalent of a no - show job .
Rubin worked in the office of the chairman and led Citigroup 's executive committee .
He was paid $ 115 million over nine years .
Now , the government has been forced to invest $ 45 billion in Citigroup and backstop $ 270 billion of its $ 2 trillion balance sheet .
How does Rubin respond when critics say he should bear some responsibility ?
" Nobody was prepared for this , " he told The Wall Street Journal .
Was he overpaid ?
" I bet there 's not a single year where I could n't have gone somewhere else and made more , " he said .
See full story at WSJ.com .
Along with Vikram Pandit , Citi 's current CEO , Rubin seems to think that the whole system broke , not institutions .
" This was something that was bigger than Citi , " Pandit said .
Except , of course , that J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM , - 0.84 % is OK , and so are Wells Fargo Corp.
WFC , - 2.35 % and BB&T Corp. BBT , , along with other banks that were wise enough not to boost short - term profits through derivatives at the risk of long - term survival .
This stubborn denial that people such as Rubin , Parsons and Pandit show is troubling enough .
That two of those executives are advising the man who pledged to lead us out of this mess is terrifying .
Michael Bloomberg , New York 's mayor , and Bill Gross , the Pimco fund manager , are two people who have volunteered to help .
Paul Krugman , the Nobel Prize - winning economist and New York Times columnist , and Charles Calomiris , the controversial business - school professor at Columbia University , are still working their day jobs .
It 's true , Mr. President - elect , that none of these candidates has the kind of government experience that your advisory panel has , but at some point fresh voices have to be more than just token members of the team ; they have to actually lead .
Is n't that why we hired you ?
MARIANNA , Florida ( CNN ) --
Four men , now in their 60s , met over the Internet , shared stories about the darkest days of their pasts and spurred an investigation into 32 graves at a reform school .
Athorities have agreed to investigate 32 graves on the grounds of a former Florida reform school .
Roger Kiser , Michael McCarthy , Bryant Middleton and Dick Colon talked about whippings and beatings and other boys who disappeared .
They discussed the 32 crosses marking the graves of persons unknown on the grounds of the former Florida Industrial School for Boys .
They called their group the White House Boys , taking the name from the single story concrete building where , they say , boys were beaten and tortured decades ago .
The White House Boys believe that delinquents and orphans sent to the concrete White House were killed and their remains buried to cover up the brutality .
This week , the four called on Florida Gov. Charlie Crist to investigate .
Crist agreed and asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to search for remains , identify them and determine whether any crimes were committed .
The department agreed to look into the mystery of the 32 crosses on the grounds of what is now known as the Dozier School , in Marianna , just south of the Alabama state line .
Watch how the White House Boys dug into the past »
Two of the White House Boys , Middleton and Colon , spoke with CNN .
The stories they told were chilling .
Middleton said he was " an incorrigible youth of 14 or 15 " when he was sent to the reform school for breaking and entering .
During a 30 - minute phone interview , he recounted story after horrific story about his time there .
Middleton said he took six trips to the concrete White House , where he endured brutal beatings .
He says boys were regularly struck with a metal - reinforced double strap with a long wooden handle .
Do n't Miss Web site : thewhitehouseboys.com
" You could hear it coming through the air , and when it hit your body , the pain was unbelievable , " he recalled .
" They just beat you to the point of unconsciousness , or you could no longer understand what was happening to you . "
He recalled another occasion in which he and another boy decided to get drunk .
They mixed orange juice with rubbing alcohol .
It make Middleton sick and his friend intoxicated .
A guard confronted the other boy and began to treat him roughly , Middleton said .
" He dragged him to the administration building , and I never saw him again .
He never came back to work or to the cottage , " Middleton said .
" He literally disappeared off the face of the Earth . "
Colon is an electrical contractor in Baltimore , Maryland .
But in the 1950s , he acknowledged , he was a wayward youth who gritted his teeth through 11 beatings inside the White House .
Colon said he remembers entering the laundry one day , and his life has never been the same .
Inside a large tumble dryer was a black teen .
The White House boys , who are all white , said black kids at the school were beaten even more savagely than white kids .
" I said to myself , ' What 's going to happen to me if I take him out ? ' " Colon said .
He recalled being about 15 feet away from the boy in the dryer .
He thought about helping him but was afraid .
" I said to myself , ' I can't do it , ' cause I 'm gonna be the next one in the God------ dryer if I take him out , ' " he said .
" I turned my back and walked out , and it torments me every day of my life . "
So far , all authorities have are allegations and the collective memories of the White House Boys .
But they say it 's worth looking into the case .
" Questions remain unanswered as to the identity of the deceased and the origin of these graves , " Crist wrote in his letter to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement .
" The main goal is to determine the location of the graves , who owned the property at the time , and determine if any crimes were committed , " agency spokeswoman Kristin Perezluha said .
Authorities are only now beginning their investigation , so no one can say for certain who , if anyone , is buried under the 32 white metal crosses .
Middleton learned about the investigation from a CNN producer .
" My God !
That 's remarkable .
My God !
That 's all I ever wanted , " he said .
" That will begin a lot of the healing for those that survived that school .
" Some of us will never get over the brutality , the sexual assaults and the fear .
But this is a major step in the right direction , " he added .
Colon has established an educational trust fund at the same campus , the Dozier School for high academic achievers , today operated by the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice .
At least one former student says the school was strict but fair .
" They were justified in giving me these paddlings , because , hey , I was wrong , " Phil Hail of Anniston , Alabama , told The Miami Herald .
Hail told the Herald he remembers going to the white building once for getting low grades in 1957 .
" Was [ the school ] run with a very strict hand ?
Yes , it was ...
Were the paddlings very severe ?
Yes , they were , " he told the newspaper .
There are lingering questions no one seems able to answer :
Why was there no outcry from the parents of boys who disappeared ?
Why did no one look for them ?
Colon and Middleton say they 're valid questions .
They firmly believe that bodies will be found and that they will be the bodies of both black and white boys .
" I believe , in my own heart , that there has been a coverup , " Middleton said .
Added Colon , " White , African - American , they 're all there ...
I believe they will find crushed skulls , and broken bones -- and hopefully , one day , the murderers . "

The body of Saddam Hussein was stabbed six times after he was executed , according to the head guard at the former president ’s tomb north of Baghdad , who was one of the people that helped bury the corpse .
The claim is categorically denied by the head of Saddam ’s tribe .
The Iraqi Government similarly denies any mutilation took place after the dictator was hanged on December 30 , 2006 , for crimes against humanity .
Talal Misrab , 45 , is the chief guard at Saddam ’s tomb , housed in a large hall in al - Awja , a small village north of Baghdad , where the fallen dictator spent much of his childhood .
In an interview with The Times , he claimed : “ There were six stab wounds on his body . ”
Mr Misrab alleged that four of the wounds were on the former president ’s front and two on his back .
He also said there was an injury to his face .
The guard alleged that 300 other people witnessed the injuries when the body was buried in the early hours of the morning , the day after Saddam was killed .
Another tribesman said he had been told by Sheikh Ali al - Neda , the former head of Saddam ’s tribe , who has since also died , that the body had stab wounds .
Mowaffak al - Rubaie , Iraq ’s security advisor , denied the allegation .
“ I oversaw the whole process from A - Z and Saddam Hussein ’s body was not , not stabbed or mutilated and he was not humiliated before execution , ” he said .
Sheikh Hasan al - Neda , who is now leader of Saddam ’s tribe , also dismissed the suggestion that anyone had interfered with the corpse .
“ I swear by God his body was totally intact except for a bruise on his cheek , ” Mr al - Neda said .
“ When we received the body in Baghdad , we were told that they [ the Iraqi authorities ] washed and wrapped it according to Islamic traditions , but we still washed him again here in Tikrit . ”
He continued : “ My son Ahmed was there and he told a Saudi newspaper that the body was not mutilated in any way . ”
The circumstances of Saddam ’s death are not in dispute , however .
His execution triggered international outrage after leaked video footage revealed that he was taunted by guards who chanted Shia Muslim slogans as the noose was placed around his neck on the gallows .
Nouri al - Maliki , the Prime Minister , told The Times last month that he regretted the way in which the sentence was carried out .
He added : “ Those who chanted were punished .
There was no major violation apart from the chanting . ”

MOPAR , Mustangs and meaty motors – they are all part of this inspiring Top 10 list of the best classic American muscle cars , unlike the cars today that pose as muscle cars .
Sure , some cars such as Porsche , Lamborghini and Ferrari could be categorized as muscle , but those cars were built with a different richer clientele in mind .
The true muscle car was built for the everyday American who would spend from $ 500 to a couple grand more in the late 60s and early 70s for that one jaw - dropping feature – more power !
Through the ages , boys have always been attracted to their toys , these toys just happened to be bigger , badder and with a lot more muscle than their standard counterparts .
10 . 1965 Pontiac GTO
Possibly the one to start the American muscle car craze , the Goat or 1965 Pontiac Tempest GTO option featured racing car options that remained inspirational long after it was out driven in speed and power .
From 0 - 60 in 6.1 seconds was not shabby , but not awe - inspiring considering the next 10 years of muscle cars .
Regardless , this muscle car has the chops to make this list just by starting the phenom that has turned car enthusiasts into weekend warriors under the hood .
9. 1970 Buick ‘ GSX ’ Stage 1
A beefy Buick , the Stage 1 ‘ GSX ’ performance package boasted 360 bhp though testers said it came in at closer to 400 for the bigger valved , better headed and hotter camshafted car .
This supercar did the quarter mile in 13.38 seconds and came in only two colors – Apollo White or Saturn Yellow .
8. 1969 Ford Mustang ‘ Boss 429 ’
The ‘ Boss 429 ’ 1969 Ford Mustang was the costliest non-Shelby Mustang Ford offered at the time .
The reason came down to the semi-hemi 429 engine that Ford wanted to get into NASCAR .
While the car was not built for its screaming starts , it was known for long - haul racing capabilities and smooth handling .
7. 1970 Plymouth Hemi-Cuda
The baddest of the 1970 Plymouth Barracudas or Hemi Cudas featured a 425 bhp 426 hemi engine .
This muscle car boasted a 0 - 60 mph in 5.6 seconds and was known for burning rubber without much prompting .
A brute on the road , the Hemi Cuda was made for muscle lovers .
The Hemi Cuda came in one engine size , 426 , while the other four engine options for the ‘ Cuda did not have hemispherical heads .
6. 1969 Z28 Camaro
Not the most powerful , the 1969 Z28 Camaro was built for the excitement of road racing and loved for its sense of style and handling capabilities .
Perhaps one of the most stylish muscle cars , this Camaro could do a quarter - mile in 14.8 seconds though only at a speed of a little more than 100 mph .
Despite that obvious lack of raw power , it was noted for its great handling with four - disc brakes , positraction and power steering .
5. 1966 Shelby Cobra 427 S/
C
Thought to have too much power for its chassis , the 1966 Shelby Cobra 427 S/C featured an impressive 480 bhp .
This sporty little number looked like a European sports car , yet had the muscle to prove it was American .
Two twin turbocharged versions of this super car were made – one for Bill Cosby and one for Shelby .
Cosby sold his because it had too much power and the next owner put it in a lake ; Shelby ’s Super Snake was sold in 2007 for $ 5.5 million US .
4. 1968 L88 Corvette
Boasting a top speed of about 170 mph with a special order package , the 1968 L88 Corvette is thought to be the end - all , be -all in the Corvette world .
The 550 bhp motor was designed specifically for racing and GM did n’t want the L88 on the open road due to its power .
More standard features of everyday cars such as air conditioning and a radio were n’t even offered to make this powerful car less attractive to the common man .
3. 1970 454 Chevelle SS
The 1970 Super Sport package Chevelle featuring the LS6 package came in at a whopping 454 horse .
The option was standard for the average car buyer of the day making it one of the most powerful stock cars anyone could purchase .
With racing stripes and a smooth interior , this muscle monger was the average muscle lover ’s dream .
2. 1969 427 COPO Chevelle
A special order by dealers designated Central Office Production Order , the 1969 427 COPO Chevelle had a limited run of about 320 cars .
This 450 bhp muscle car was fitted with a L72 427 - cid V - 8 due to demand from muscle loving Chevy dealers .
Interestingly enough , Chevy did n’t want their mid-sizes at the time to have more than 400 cid .
But the COPO Chevelles were made and distributed to some very happy dealers .
1. 1969 ZL1 Camaro
Perhaps one of the rarest of muscle cars , the 1969 ZL1 Camaro featured a jaw - dropping 500 horses under the hood in an aluminum V - 8 engine .
This bad boy American beast could go from 0 - 60 in about 5.3 seconds , which was why some of the 69 models made found their way into drag - racing .
Over time , the full complement of cars was sold ; however , the package option was never offered again .

All of us - countries , corporations and consumers - have neglected basic principles .
Sir Evelyn : " action has to be taken and action must be taken very soon " .
Ethics - we have lost sight of an honest day 's work for an honest day 's pay .
Careful management - we have indulged our wants without the taxes or the prices or the cash to pay for them .
Oversight - public relations and spin have replaced disclosure and transparency ; casual yet complex accounting and accommodating rating agencies left us blissfully unaware of the problems , and we revelled in our ignorance .
Hubris has replaced community responsibility as a requirement for executive positions .
American automobile executives and British bankers have been unable to form their lips into an apology .
Management prefers to hold onto private corporate jets rather than push for fuel efficiency standards
Sir Evelyn de Rothschild
Yet their institutions lie in ruins and the rest of us are left feeling embarrassed for them .
Their customers worry that their savings or their working capital will just vanish , their mortgage will be transferred to a new institution they have never heard of .
Their employees wonder which of their colleagues - or they themselves - will be unemployed in the coming week , with bleak prospects for working again anytime soon .
Where is the shame of those who only months earlier boasted of ever increasing profits , of ever more clever products , of ever easier loans ?
Remaining credit
The US automakers may be the worst of the lot , so far .
New York ran into trouble during the 1970s Years of incompetence and now manoeuvring in the halls of Congress for a massive bailout .
Management prefers to hold onto private corporate jets rather than push for fuel efficiency standards to make their products more competitive .
Union members would rather hold onto their gold - plated pensions for life than to save their companies .
Why should taxpayers help those who have so frequently refused to accept responsibility themselves ?
If the US government uses up its remaining credit to help the auto industry carry on as usual , who will lend the country the money to repair its bridges , build its power stations , clean its water , fuel its navy ?
Slow revival
Thirty years ago , New York City found itself in a position similar to GM , Ford and Chrysler today .
They asked Washington for help .
The government refused .
The Daily News summed it up in its front page headline - Ford to City : Drop Dead Instead New York balanced its budget , taxed itself , reduced hiring , negotiated better labour contracts and gradually worked itself back to fiscal health .
It took more than 10 years .
Take responsibility
This era of struggle may last as long .
Until we can be generous in accepting fault for our predicament , we will have difficulty dropping our suspicions about others so that we can get on with repairing the damage .
Unless action is taken soon , we can only see a long time of difficult and very onerous problems continuing .
Could be one or two years .
It is therefore essential that management must take a firm look at it 's problems and accept its faults and redeem them .
A lot of talk and a lot of words have been written .
But in the end action has to be taken and action must be taken very soon if we are not going to see this stretched out over many years .

Viral archeologists have been trying to track down and understand the spread of HIV - 1 , the strain responsible for most HIV infections worldwide .
In particular , researchers are interested in the M ( major ) group , which is responsible for over 90 % of the infections .
Although scientists first identified HIV as the cause of AIDS in 1984 , the virus has been spreading among humans long before that .
Since HIV evolves up to a million times faster than we do , it is advantageous to examine and compare HIV - 1 samples from as early as possible .
Finding these samples is the limiting factor .
Only one early - period HIV - 1 , called ZR59 , was known about until now , but today 's Nature unveils another " ancient " sample , giving us a more complete understanding of HIV - 1's prehistory .
In a collaboration , eight research groups isolated and studied partial HIV - 1 genome fragments from a lymph node that was obtained in 1960 at what is now known as Kinshasa , Democratic Republic of Congo .
This " ancient " virus , dubbed DRC60 , shares about 88 percent sequence similarity to ZR59 .
Out of the 11 classified subtypes of group M HIV - 1 strains ( A - K ) , DRC60 is most closely related to the ancestor of subtype A , while ZR59 is associated with the one for subtype D. This difference shows that diversification of HIV - 1 was already underway half a century ago .
As both samples come from Kinshasa , a comparison of their sequences can reveal the existence of a common ancestor .
By performing statistical analyses with models that account for the rates of evolution and various methods of HIV - 1 pandemic spread , the researchers found that the viral ancestor existed between 1902 and 1921 .
Even though only two " ancient " sequences from Kinshasa are known , scientists had already inferred that the ancestors of all group M viruses originated there , as it is the location with the most diverse number of group M subtypes in modern times .
If that is the case , the simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) that plagued chimpanzees jumped to humans at Kinshasa in the early 1900s and was likely to be related to M group viruses .
This possibility raised a couple of additional questions .
First , chimpanzees infected with SIV that are most similar to group M strains live about 435 miles away from Kinshasa , in the southeast corner of Cameroon .
So , why did the virus originate in Kinshasa ?
Second , what made the early 1900s particularly favorable for the start of an infection spread ?
The researchers point to the rise of cities as the reason .
Kinshasa was known as Léopoldville at the time , and its location near the mouth of the Congo River made it a key transportation spot .
When populations grew in the early 1900s , Léopoldville became the largest city in the area .
Infected chimpanzees and / or their handlers could have easily arrived there , and the sufficient population density allowed the virus to take hold .
The isolation of DRC60 allowed researchers to make significant progress in their efforts to trace the origin of HIV - 1 .
Samples preserved in other hospitals in the region hold the promise of further discoveries of other early HIV strains , adding more details to the history .

The CPS said it was satisfied there was no case for Baltic to answer An art gallery will not face any legal action over claims it displayed an indecent statue of Jesus Christ .
The artwork was part of an exhibition at Gateshead 's Baltic Centre featuring several plaster figures with erections .
A private prosecution was being brought by Christian group member Emily Mapfuwa , 40 , of Essex , on the grounds the statue outraged public decency .
The Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) stopped the action on Monday and said the gallery had no case to answer .
Warning signs Nicola Reasbeck , Chief Crown Prosecutor , said : " The CPS has the right to take over a private prosecution and prosecute it ourselves , take it over and stop the case , or allow the private prosecution to continue .
" Having considered the evidence in this case with great care , we are satisfied that there is no case to answer .
" We have taken into account all the circumstances , including the fact that there was no public disorder relating to the exhibition and that there was a warning at the entrance to the gallery about the nature of the work on display .
" The case has therefore been discontinued . "
The statue was part of Baltic 's September 2007 to January 2008 exhibition by controversial Chinese - born artist Terence Koh , " Gone , Yet Still " .
Mrs Mapfuwa , of Brentwood , instructed her lawyers to seek a private prosecution against the gallery for outraging public decency and causing harassment alarm and distress to the public .

The Linux platform is home to a vast and highly diverse ecosystem of open source software applications .
These programs are developed through a collaborative process that often relies heavily on the participation of volunteer developers .
Although there are many professional programmers who get paid to work on open source software , the efforts of volunteers can significantly accelerate development and often represent the bulk of the work that is done on many large - scale open source software projects .
The value that comes from harnessing volunteer development is what makes community - building such an important part of the open source software development model .
New contributors can bring new ideas and useful improvements that might have otherwise eluded developers who are deeply immersed in the code .
Some Linux application developers are finding new contributors for their open source software projects in an unlikely place : proprietary software platforms .
Some recent trends in the GNOME development community demonstrate that porting Linux applications to Windows and Mac OS X can help attract new contributors .
Porting Tomboy and Banshee to Windows and Mac OS X
Sandy Armstrong recently ported the Tomboy note - taking application to Windows and Mac OS X. Tomboy , which is built with the C# programming language and the GTK + widget toolkit , allows users to create searchable notes with cross-linking and basic tagging .
It is a very useful and intuitive utility that many Linux users ( including myself ) regard as indispensable .
Cross - platform compatibility has been a big win for the project and Armstrong has already started to receive patches from contributors who might never have known about Tomboy if he had n't ported it to other platforms .
Armstrong says that he has received patches from users who previously had virtually no experience with GTK + and are using Visual Studio for development .
His observations have led him to conclude that developers on other platforms are willing to learn how to use open source libraries and widget toolkits in order to help improve applications that they find useful .
This illustrates another intriguing advantage of porting Linux applications to other platforms : it helps familiarize a whole new audience of developers with open source toolkits and APIs .
This could help expand the ecosystem of Linux - compatible software , because some of the developers who focus on other platforms could subsequently decide to adopt open source widget toolkits for their own projects in the future .
Cross - platform support recently got a major boost in the GNOME community as a result of the release of a native GTK + toolkit port for Mac OS X .
This effort , which was largely undertaken by the software company Imendio , represents a major advance for GTK + portability and allows Mac users to run GTK + applications without having to rely on X11 .
Mono 2.0 , which was released earlier this month , has extensive support for OS X and includes the native GTK + port .
This made it possible for Armstrong to port Tomboy to Mac OS X .
Mac OS
X support is very important right now , because Apple 's operating system is becoming increasingly popular among software developers .
This trend is driven by the strong UNIX underpinnings of the operating system and the high quality of Apple 's development and debugging tools — such as its excellent graphical frontend for DTrace .
A growing number of open source software developers are converging on the Mac platform and use it for a lot of day - to - day development .
Porting Linux applications to Mac OS
X will make it possible for open source software projects to tap into that developer ecosystem .
The open source Banshee media player is another popular Mono application for Linux that is being ported to other platforms .
Lead Banshee developer Aaron Bockover wrote a blog entry last week that looked at some of the challenges and benefits of bringing Linux applications to Windows and Mac OS X .
Although most of the Banshee code is portable , he says that the big challenge is delivering that last little bit of platform integration polish .
" It 's virtually impossible to write a cross platform application that does not suck if you just stick to what a single framework provides , " Bockover wrote .
" The user experience would feel isolated and sandboxed . "
Developer Eoin Hennessy , who is responsible for much of the Banshee OS X porting effort , has ensured that the user experience feels natural by providing clean integration with the dock and system menu bar .
This makes the program feel more like a native application and will allow it to behave in a manner that is consistent with the expectations that OS X users have for their software .
One major weakness that remains in the GTK + port to OS X is that it does n't use native - looking widgets .
Developer Richard
Hult is working on addressing that issue by writing a GTK + theme engine that uses native OS X widget - drawing APIs .
Migration incentive
Although porting Linux applications to other platforms offers a lot of advantages , some critics believe that doing so will erode any incentive that may lure users of those platforms to Linux .
This argument derives from the belief that mainstream popularity of Linux will only come through the availability of killer apps that are exclusively available on the open source operating system .
We examined this argument back in January when we first looked at the KDE project 's cross-platform portability initiative .
Almost the entire KDE 4 application stack now runs on Windows and Mac OS X .
This was made possible by some nice licensing changes in Qt 4 and by KDE 's adoption of CMake , a vastly superior build system that offers a much higher level of portability .
Several KDE developers have worked hard on the Mac and Windows ports and the results are incredibly impressive .
In response to concerns expressed by some critics , Aaron Seigo argued that creating these ports will help bring more freedom and choice to Windows users at the same time it helps create a migration path that will make it easier for those users to eventually switch to Linux .
Similar sentiments can be heard within the GNOME community .
In his recent blog entry about portability , Bockover brilliantly articulates the same point and also argues that the end result will be a net gain in Linux adoption .
" What is important with all of this cross platform work is simple : infiltrate the proprietary platforms , attract users and developers to free software , and grow the open source ecosystem .
Ultimately , we 'd like to think this will help Linux adoption .
Applications are the key , not the platforms , " he wrote .
" Banshee on Mac OS X is symbolic to me .
It marks a period in our project where we step out of the realm of our comfortable and lovable GNOME community and into different communities , creating and bridging through the shared goal of open and free software .
Users unite ! "
Indeed , porting open source Linux applications to other platforms will help build bridges that encourage faster growth and more innovation .
This could , in turn , make Linux a stronger platform , bring software freedom to a new audience , encourage broader adoption of open source toolkits and APIs , and eventually attract more users to Linux .
To a casual observer , it looks no different from a standard modern Mini , the British classic reimagined , to great plaudits , by BMW .
But look closer and there 's something different about the Mini E , the latest addition to the range .
For a start , there are no back seats .
And instead of a grease - caked engine under the bonnet there is a neat and clean arrangement of motors , pipes and electronics .
On the dashboard , the rev counter is gone , replaced by a dial to show how much power is left in the car 's on - board battery .
But perhaps the most noticeable thing is the Mini E's lack of noise : step on the accelerator and the car moves off with only the faintest whisper .
Two years in the making , the all - electric Mini E was unveiled at BMW 's headquarters in Munich this week .
It has arrived just as the EU agreed to slash emissions standards for cars and the UK science minister , Paul Drayson , called on British industry to take electric vehicles into the mainstream to help the country meet ambitious targets to cut carbon emissions .
About 22 % of the UK 's carbon emissions come from transport , with 13 % of these from private cars .
According to a study for the Department for Transport , widespread adoption of electric vehicles capable of a range of 50 km or more could cut road transport carbon emissions in half .
" When people get out of the Mini E they smile , " said Patrick Muller , the engineer at BMW who led the project .
" People hear ' electric car ' and everybody has a golf cart in mind or something with a flimsy plastic body .
Here you get a full - blown car . "
The Mini E is powered by a 150 kW electric motor fed by a lithium - ion battery , giving it the equivalent of around 200 horsepower .
With a top speed of 95 mph , the car will travel 150 miles on a full charge and go from zero to 60 mph in 8.5 seconds - equivalent to a standard Mini Cooper .
BMW will produce just 500 of the cars at first , destined for urban trials in California , New York and New Jersey .
These cars , available to lease early next year for around $ 850 per month , will be followed by a further trial of 50 cars in Berlin in the summer .
A dozen of the cars in the European trial could come to the UK .
" The urban application is the ideal way to find out about everyday use and all - day capability of electric vehicles , " said Alexander Thorwirth , BMW 's marketing and operations manager .
" We want to investigate the habits of users ... and how electric driving works . "
Friends of the Earth 's senior transport campaigner , Tony Bosworth , said electric cars had a significant part to play in the solutions needed to cut carbon emissions .
" However , battery performance must improve , and the electricity should come from renewable energy sources . "
The manufacturers claim the Mini E retains the nimble handling of its petrol and diesel - based cousins , but the performance comes at a cost : the back seats have been replaced by the 250kg battery pack , making the Mini E not only a two - seater but also heavier than standard cars .
To squeeze as much range as possible out of the Mini E's batteries its brakes act as power generators , topping up the batteries as the car slows down with energy that would otherwise be wasted as heat .
The battery has a life of around 100,000 miles and can be fully charged in under two hours from a high - power socket .
A standard household socket will recharge the battery in around 10 hours .
The Mini , designed by Alec Issigonis , first rolled off the production line in 1959 .
The current model , which still retains many of the original 's distinctive features , remains an iconic vehicle .
Mini enthusiasts welcomed the new car .
Paul Mullett , editor of the mini2.co.uk website , said there had been much excited discussion as soon as rumours of the Mini E began circulating earlier this year .
" I think it 's a step in the right direction , " he said .
" It helps the whole move to alternative fuels as well .
If a brand like Mini start using the technology and they get more people interested , it gets more real as opposed to more obscure , smaller start - ups that people maybe do n't know . "
The Mini E trial cars will be built at the dedicated Mini factory in Oxford before being shipped to BMW headquarters in Munich to have the electric drive trains and batteries fitted .
BMW plans to use the results in the US and Europe to inform the conversion of the remainder of its cars into lower - carbon alternatives .
The Mini E is among the first fruits of BMW 's Project i , aimed at making cars of the future more environmentally friendly .
" We do n't think the internal combustion engine is going to disappear in the next five years , that 's clear , but we need to open up alternatives , " said Muller .
Last month the government announced a £ 100 m package to accelerate the development and deployment of low - carbon vehicles in the UK .
It included £ 20 m to buy electric and low - carbon vans for public sector organisations .

A young mother who tried to frame a secret lover for rape after her boyfriend found out about their one - night stand has been jailed for four months .
Stacey Challoner , 20 , falsely claimed John Mullholland had attacked her in woodland before forcing her into intercourse .
Police later arrested Mr Mullholland , a 27 - year - old married father - of - two and he was given a grilling about the incident .
But officers began investigating Challoner herself after he insisted he had a fling with her and described fully the inside of her house .
Scroll down for more ...
Manchester Crown Court heard Challoner of Moorfield Avenue , Denton , had told her long - term boyfriend she had been raped by Mr Mullholland after he suspected she had been cheating on him .
The mother - of - three broke down and confessed she had made up the rape and has since claimed to have produced a child due to the encounter with the victim .
Mr Mullholland later told police he'd been subjected to a hate campaign and considered killing himself .
He had been referred to as a rapist in the area and locals had spat at him in the street .
He has had to have CCTV fitted and he is considering moving away .
His marriage is now under threat .
Challoner admitted perverting the course of justice .
Passing sentence , Judge Iain Hamilton told Challoner : " An allegation of rape is one which is very easy to make and can be difficult for anybody who is falsely accused to refute .
" Rape is a very serious offence and those who are accused of rape are often vilified or shunned by friends or acquaintances within their community .
" The reason that you made the allegation was to dispel any suspicion that your partner had that you had been unfaithful to him .
The allegation you made is of such seriousness that any person should be put off making such a false allegation .
" Mr Mullholland is a married man with two children and the facts of the allegation created significant difficulties in his marriage .
" According to his statement , he even reached a stage where he had considered suicide .
All these consequences came from the lie that you told . "
Earlier , the prosecutor William Donnelly said the incident occurred in August last year after Challoner 's boyfriend was freed from jail where he had been serving a sentence for an undisclosed offence .
" Stacey Challoner says she came under pressure from him when he challenged her about what she might have been doing while he was away .
She says he is a man who has used violence against her and she was in fear of him .
" On August 17 , a complaint was made to the police about a rape .
That report was not made by her but by her partner .
She says it was made in the course of an argument between them . "
Challoner gave an hour - long formal statement by video telling of an incident when she went to her friend 's house and had had rather too much to drink .
Mr Donnelly added : " She said that she 'd had a full bottle of spirits .
She said that she wanted to go home and took steps to do so .
She went outside her friend 's house and bumped into the man whom she later accused of rape .
" She said that this man held her against a tree whilst he raped her .
" She made it clear that she did n't want anything to do with him , she hit him and then it stopped .
So she went into detail of where , when and how .
" She says that after the rape , she pulled her clothes back on .
She told nobody about it and eventually felt pressure from her partner .
" She says she did n't expressly tell him that she 'd been raped but he must have assumed that from the distress she was in when she confessed her infidelity to him .
" There is no question that an act of intercourse did take place between the two of them . "
Mr Mullholland was asked to attend a police station and he believed it was in connection with a report he had filed saying two men - including Challoner 's boyfriend - called him a rapist .
" When he arrived at the police station , it was n't anything to do with that and he described his shock at being arrested for a complaint of rape and was described as being extremely upset .
He said later on that he could n't believe what was being alleged .
" He was interviewed and told them about the intercourse that did happen between them but denies any act of rape .
" The following day , August 22 , the police began to investigate the allegation further .
The police interviewed the woman whose house Stacey Challoner was at when she had too much to drink .
" The police then went to see Stacey Challoner .
On August 23 , Stacey Challoner told the police that her complaint of rape was false and there was no truth in it .
In mitigation defence counsel Miss Carolyn Smith said : " She was in a relationship with a man who is described by her mother as manipulative and a bully .
" Stacey Challoner has three children and she says that her fourth child is the victim's .
" She was very much under the spell of her partner who is a violent man .
When he came out of custody in July of last year , he had suspected that Stacey Challoner had been unfaithful .
" She admitted that she had had a sexual relationship with Mr Mulholland and they had an argument .
She was seriously injured as a result of that argument and fled to her mother 's but she went back to him .
" Having gone back to him , the arguments resumed of her infidelity .
Whenever the incident was brought up , she began to cry so he became suspicious and asked : ' Did he force himself on you ? ' and she accepts that when that question was put she did n't desist him from that .
" He called the police despite her asking him not to .
She was too frightened to go back on the situation that she had created .
" Her three children were taken away from her in November of last year .
She gave birth in November to her fourth child .
" The defendant is maintaining that the son she gave birth to is Mr Mulholland 's child .
She says that the only person she had sexual intercourse with whilst her partner was in prison was Mr Mulholland .
" The other three children are with the paternal grandmother .
The court heard that Stacey Challoner does not now intend to get back with her partner who is the father of her three children .
WASHINGTON -- U.S. prosecutors announced manslaughter and weapons charges against five former Blackwater Worldwide guards , accusing the men of recklessly opening fire with automatic weapons and grenade launchers in a busy Baghdad traffic circle last year .
The Blackwater guards were part of an armored convoy providing backup to a State Department security team .
Seventeen people died in the Sept. 16 , 2007 , shooting , which strained relations between the U.S. and Iraq .

A strong economy must be built on a solid foundation of steadily rising wages .
If wages do n’t keep pace with production , the only way the economy can grow is through the expansion of debt , which leads to disaster .
From Bernanke and Greenspan ’s perspective , any small gain by workers is tantamount to communism .
They will continue to do everything in their power to preserve the current labor - debasing system which keeps workers just one paycheck away from the homeless shelter .
Consider this : the US economy is 72 percent consumer spending .
That means the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) cannot grow if salaries do n’t keep up with the price of living .
Low Income Families ( LOF ) –that is , any couple making less than $ 80,000 –represent 50 percent of all consumer spending .
These LOF ’s spend everything they earn just to maintain their present standard of living .
So , how can these families help to grow the economy if they ’re already spending every last farthing they earn ?
They can ’t !
Which is why wages have to go up .
The cost to short - term profits is miniscule compared to the turmoil of a deep recession which is what the world is facing right now .
The present crisis could have been avoided if there was a better balance between management and labor .
But the unions are weak , so salaries have languished while Wall Street has grown more powerful , stretching its tentacles into the government and spreading its anti-labor dogma wherever it goes .
The investor class has rejiggered the system to meet their particular needs .
Financial wizardry has replaced factories , capital formation and hard assets while real wealth has been replaced by chopped up bits of mortgage paper , stitched together by Ivy League MBAs , and sold to investors as priceless gemstones .
This is the system that Bernanke is trying to resuscitate with his multi-trillion dollar injections ; a system that shifts a larger and larger amount of the nation ’s wealth to a smaller and smaller group of elites .
When Alan Greenspan appeared before Congress a few months ago , he admitted that he had discovered a “ flaw ” in his theory of how markets operate .
The former Fed chief was referring to his belief that investment bankers could be trusted to regulate themselves .
Whether one believes Greenspan was telling the truth or not is irrelevant .
What really matters is that the wily Maestro managed to skirt the larger issues and stick to his script .
Congress never challenged Greenspan ’s discredited , trickle - down economic theories which guided his policymaking from the get - go .
Nor was he asked to explain how a consumer - driven economy can thrive when salaries stay flat for 30 years .
An answer to that question might have exposed Greenspan ’s penchant for low interest rates and deregulation , the two fuel - sources for the massive speculative bubbles which emerged on Greenspan ’s watch .
These are the tools the Fed chief used for 18 years to enrich his buddies at the big brokerage houses while workers slipped further and further into debt .
There ’s no “ flaw ” in Greenspan ’s thinking ; his views perfectly reflect his unwavering commitment to the rich and powerful .
That ’s never changed .
Since retiring , he has continued to ingratiate himself to his Wall Street paymasters while fattening his bank account with royalties from his best seller .
Unfortunately , his success has come at great cost to the country .
Millions of homeowners are now facing eviction , consumers are tapped out , and the job market is in a shambles .
When equity bubbles unwind , it ’s never pretty and the Greenspan implosion has been particularly nasty .
Assets are being sold at fire sale prices and there ’s a frantic rush to the safety of US Treasurys .
It ’s a catastrophe .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
That said , it may seem like a bad time to boost workers ’ pay , but that ’s not the case .
Crisis creates opportunities for change — real structural change .
And that ’s what ’s needed .
The bottom line is that this whole mess could have been avoided if demand was predicated on wage increases instead of asset inflation .
Of course , that precludes the Fed ’s traditional remedies for economic malaise–easy money and massive leveraging .
Just last week , Bernanke announced a plan to buy $ 800 billion of securities backed by mortgages and credit card debt in an effort to stimulate more borrowing .
The Fed chairman would rather drown the country in red ink than support pay raises for workers .
Go figure ?
This just illustrates the class bias that underscores the Fed ’s policies , which is why pointless to debate the issue or try to find common ground .
The only way to effect real change is with political power .
From Bernanke and Greenspan ’s perspective , any small gain by workers is tantamount to communism .
They will continue to do everything in their power to preserve the current labor - debasing system which keeps workers just one paycheck away from the homeless shelter .
This type of hostility is neither good for the economy nor the country .
It just intensifies class animosities by accentuating the chasm between rich and poor .
The only way to overcome these differences is by narrowing the wealth gap and rewarding hard work with fair pay .
John Bellamy Foster and Fred Magdoff explain how establishment economists and their corporate patrons developed their ideas of how to use equity bubbles to grow the economy and shift wealth from workers to elites .
In their Monthly Review article “ Financial Implosion and Stagnation ” :
“ It was the reality of economic stagnation beginning in the 1970s , as heterodox economists Riccardo Bellofiore and Joseph Halevi have recently emphasized , that led to the emergence of “ the new financialized capitalist regime , ” a kind of “ paradoxical financial Keynesianism ” whereby demand in the economy was stimulated primarily “ thanks to asset - bubbles . ”
Moreover , it was the leading role of the United States in generating such bubbles — despite ( and also because of ) the weakening of capital accumulation proper — together with the dollar ’s reserve currency status , that made U.S. monopoly - finance capital the “ catalyst of world effective demand . ”
Greenspan figured out how to strengthen the grip of the banking sector by creating asset bubbles .
That was his great contribution during the Clinton years .
The leveraging of complex financial products and the surge in real estate prices gave the impression of prosperity , but it was all smoke and mirrors .
The “ wealth effect ” vanished as soon as the interest payments on mortgages could no longer be paid .
That ’s when Maestro ’s bubble blew up and Greenspan retired to write his memoirs .
So far , world stock indexes have lost over $ 30 trillion and there will probably be another bloody leg down in 2009 .
As the underlying economy contracts , there ’s no need for a lumbering , oversized financial system .
Institutions will have to be shut down and their assets will have to be sold at auction .
That means prices will continue to fall , business activity will falter , and GDP will shrivel .
The mismatch between output and falling demand presages a painful correction .
When credit gets scarce , business activity slows , and nervous investors head for the exits .
That forces businesses to lay off workers which causes prices to fall even further , accelerating the pace of deflation .
Economist Henry
Liu made these observations in his article “ China and the Global financial Crisis ” :
“ US neoliberal trade globalization , having promised a primrose garden of economic growth , has instead led the global economy into a jungle of poison reed , resulting in the worst financial disaster in a century , setting the whole world ablaze with a financial firestorm .
This unhappy fate was finally acknowledged as having been policy - induced by Alan Greenspan , the former Chairman of the US Federal Reserve who was largely responsible for the monetary indulgence that had caused this hundred - year financial perfect storm … .
The Federal Reserve under Greenspan repeatedly created money faster than the global economy could profitably absorb , creating serial bubbles denominated in fiat dollars .
Greenspan insisted that it was not possible , nor desirable , to identify an economic bubble in the making as he was inflating it with easy money , lest economic growth should be prematurely cut short .
It was a perfect example of the rule that intoxication begins when a drinker becomes unable to know its time to stop drinking . ”
( Henry C.K. Liu China and the Global Financial Crisis ” , Asia Times )
The Fed wants to stimulate demand by slashing the price of money to 0 % while pumping trillions of dollars into the financial system ( quantitative easing ) .
But the millions of foreclosures , credit card and student loan defaults , indicate that the underlying economy is rapidly contracting and cannot support such an oversized system .
Something ’s gotta ’ give .
Homeowners and consumers are poorer than they were a year ago .
They ’re focused on paying down their debts not creating new ones .
Attitudes towards spending have changed ; people are hunkering down .
That ’s why Bernanke ’s radical liquidity experiment is doomed .
There ’s no way to reflate a bubble if consumers refuse to spend .
If the Fed is serious about fulfilling its mandate , it should abandon its serial bubblemaking altogether and return to basics ; productivity , good wages and sound money .
The country ’s future rests on its workers .
They do n’t need a bailout , just a raise .

President Bush looked slightly bemused after he ducked to avoid a shoe hurled at him .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki looked mortified , and as the assailant ’s second shoe came flying Sunday , he did what any gracious host would do : reached out and tried to catch it before it hit his American guest .
Maliki missed , but so did the shoe , landing like the first one with a loud thud against the wall behind the two leaders , who held their ground as other journalists and security officials at a news conference wrestled the shoe - thrower to the ground .
Later , Iraqi journalists identified him as Muntather Zaidi , a correspondent for Baghdadiya , a satellite TV channel that broadcasts from Cairo .
Colleagues said Zaidi has done extensive reporting from Baghdad ’s Sadr City district , the stronghold of anti-U.S. cleric Muqtada Sadr , and was rescued by Sadr ’s Mahdi Army militia after being abducted by an unidentified group in November 2007 .
Zaidi was one of several Iraqi journalists attending the Sunday evening news conference in Baghdad ’s heavily secured Green Zone .
His outburst came without warning as Bush and Maliki prepared to answer questions .

The first shoe flew over the heads of other journalists and might have hit Bush square in the face had he not ducked to avoid it .
“ This is a gift from the Iraqis .
This is the farewell kiss , you dog , ” the man said , according to a pool translation .
Seconds later , the journalist hurled his other shoe with similar precision as another Iraqi journalist reached over in an attempt to stop him .
“ This is from the widows , the orphans and those who were killed in Iraq , ” he said , according to the translation .

Maliki flung his arm in front of Bush ’s face , his hand outstretched like a baseball player reaching for a line drive in an attempt to block the flying object as it sailed over Bush ’s head .
After being pinned to the ground , the shoe - thrower was dragged out by security guards .
Officials from Baghdadiya refused to comment .
White House Press Secretary Dana Perino reported suffering a minor eye injury during the melee .
Bush played down the incident .

“ All I can report is it is a size 10 , ” he said jokingly .
“ So what if a guy threw his shoe at me , ” the president added , dismissing it as “ one way to gain attention . ”

Times special correspondents in Baghdad contributed to this report .
On Tuesday , Apple announced the retirement of Al Shipp , the company ’s senior vice president of enterprise sales .
As part of that announcement , Apple also said it had no plans to directly replace Shipp .
Instead , it plans to spread out his former responsibilities among other sales executives .
At first glance , this looks bad .
And it immediately raises some questions among the Mac IT crowd : Is Apple abandoning the Enterprise ?
Is this yet another step toward becoming “ the iPhone company , ” preceded by Apple ’s February move to knife the Xserve RAID ?
I think that depends on if you ever thought Apple was , or wanted to be , an “ enterprise ” company .
There are a lot of people out there who think that Apple is somehow trying to become an enterprise company — that is , to compete in the big enterprise world along with Microsoft , IBM , HP , and others .
But honestly , every time I see that meme go around , I have to wonder why people would think that .
Apple has never been an enterprise company , even when it had one of its pre-Return Of Steve “ Apple in the Enterprise ” spasms .
The company has less clue of how to be an Enterprise company than IBM had about selling computers to home users .
To be an enterprise company is , in a very real way , to cede a great deal of control over your product line to your customers .
Look at how many times Microsoft has tried to eliminate some kind of old software or hardware support from a product , only to change that plan because of customer outcry .
Intel tried for many years prior to the iMac to advance USB over serial , parallel , and PS / 2 ports to no avail .
Why ?
Because these are enterprise companies , and they cannot afford to do anything their customers do n’t approve of .
You want to know why Microsoft business software seems to be nothing but an ever - growing collection of features ?
I ’ll lay money now that 99 percent of new features in any Microsoft product come directly from customer request .
If a GE or a GM wants , they get .
Ask yourself when was the last time Microsoft , or IBM , or HP came out with some product that no one expected .
Or if they did , was it built in a way no one thought about ?
Go ahead , think about that , I ’ll get more coffee .
Done ?
Right , it ’s pretty rare .
Yet that ’s almost de rigueur for Apple .
The company literally makes a living out of surprising people , of ignoring common wisdom for something different and usually better .
That ’s been a fantastic business model for Apple , but would it work for an enterprise company ?
If Microsoft tried that , its big customers would be attacking Redmond with torches and pitchforks .
Here ’s the simple truth : Enterprise hates surprises .
It ’s not what they want .
Enterprise wants predictability .
They want to know when , what , how much , and that it will be all new and cool , yet change nothing .
( Yes that ’s contradictory .
Have you ever tried to use “ Enterprise Software ? ”
Winning usability awards is so not happening there . )
And they want to know everything in detail a year ahead of time .
Can anyone seriously imagine how long Apple would survive under that model ?
Right , not long .
The reason why Al Shipp ’s retirement is n’t the end of Apple as an enterprise company is because there was never a beginning of Apple as an Enterprise company .
Apple sells to enterprise companies .
Apple has products that can work in enterprise company networks .
But that ’s not the same as being an enterprise company .
At best , Apple is a Small - Medium Business , or SMB , company .
Its products , at least in the non-educational fields , are at their sweet spot in companies where a thousand users is huge .
That ’s not to say Apple ’s products can’t scale bigger , but it ’s not the company ’s primary focus .
That ’s not to say Apple gets a pass on some of the stuff it does that ’s annoying , bewildering , or just plain stupid .
Delaying security patches without even minimal notification to customers as to why ?
Stupid .
Dealing with Apple ’s enterprise teams is hit and miss far more than it should be .
If you have a good one , it ’s a fantastic experience .
If you do n’t … well , I ’ve dealt with both ends , and the not - good side is really not - good .
For a company that makes excellent communication tools , Apple is sometimes not so good at it .
There are areas where Apple could be more responsive to its customers in the business world , at all levels , without becoming an enterprise company or changing the fundamentals of its ( very ) successful business practices .
But that ’s not the same as becoming an enterprise company .
That ’s just working better with your customers .
So yes , Al Shipp ’s departure does look bad , but I submit that it only looks really bad if you had an unrealistic view of Apple as a company .
Sure , I ’d prefer a centralized point of control for enterprise sales , but the dismantling of that does not mean Apple is abandoning business products and support , because you ca n’t end what you never began .

The thigh 's the limit !
How our 5ft 2 3 / 4in man measured up on a date with the world 's longest legs
Had I met Svetlana Pankratova 20 years ago , I 'd have run a mile .
Not that it would have taken her very long to catch me .
Hold on a moment .
I ought to be honest with myself - there 's not a hope in hell that she 'd have made chase .
Just look at the maths .
Svetlana is many things .
She is blonde , big-eyed , confident and attractive .
She is also the owner of the longest pair of human legs on the planet .
Tall story : Svetlana Pankratova with the vertically - challenged Vincent
Her legs measure 132 cm , or 4ft 4in .
Meanwhile , my whole body comes in at 5ft 2 3 / 4in .
( And do n't you dare snatch that three - quarters of an inch from me . )
Despite all this , Svetlana has agreed to spend the afternoon with me , in an effort to give me a glimpse of what life is like for the big boys and girls .
We 're perched by the bar in a pub in London 's West End .
Sitting on her bar stool , she does n't appear to be overly tall .
It 's only when she uncurls her legs and stands up that you notice how extraordinary her body is .
Put it like this : the top of her legs line up with my shoulders .
I wo n't spell out where my head is when we stand facing each other .
But I wo n't be needing an umbrella today .
But it 's not Svetlana 's bust that has , over the past few days , enabled her to achieve a blast of worldwide fame .
She 's just earned herself a place in the book of Guinness World Records because her legs are officially the longest in the world , a full two inches longer than the shortie who had previously been claiming the title .
Such great heights :
The mismatched pair stretch out on a bed
Today , as she sips a pint of English bitter , her extraordinary limbs are housed in a pair of bright blue jeans that fit as tightly as a Harley Street surgeon 's rubber gloves .
And quite right , too .
She 'd be daft to hide them , even if she could .
For her legs are not just inexplicably long , they are also slim , toned and sexy .
At this point , I should point out to my lovely wife that these descriptions of my drinking companion 's body are delivered purely in the interest of scientific discovery .
And , in any case , Svetlana said : ' Though I do n't mind dating shorter men , I would n't go to extremes , of course . '
Would 5ft 2 3/ 4 in count as an extreme ?
' I'm afraid you would be too short for me , ' replies Svetlana , whose boyfriend is a mere 6 ft .
In fact , Svetlana , 36 , who was born in Russia but now works as an estate agent on Spain 's Costa del Sol , is not as tall as you might imagine .
Though her legs take up a whole 4ft 4in , her full body is ' only ' 6ft 5in .
' All my extra height is in my legs , ' she says .
' If I 'm sitting behind my desk at work , no one realises how tall I am .
' Above the waist , I 'm like everyone else .
It 's only when I stand up that people say " Wow " . '
Nor is she the product of unusual parents .
She 's brought her mother along to our little drink in the pub , and Lidia , a sweet white - haired woman , is a mere 5 ft 11in .
' She was an ordinary baby , not any larger than any of the other babies at first , ' Lidia says .
' She weighed 3.2 kg ( 7lb ) when she was born .
' But by the time she reached her first birthday , I realised that she was growing very fast . '
Her look is certainly eyecatching .
As we chat , two strangers peek their heads through the door of the pub .
It 's gawping time at the zoo .
Out come the mobile phone cameras .
Snap , snap .
' People stare a lot .
I suppose I 'm used to it , but sometimes I still get irritated by the reaction I get , ' says Svetlana .
' Some people do make nice comments , but most of them are pretty stupid .
' I 'm surprised that middle - aged men think it 's OK to behave like children when they see me .
And I do n't like it when people take pictures sneakily . '
Yet despite this , she appears to revel in the attention her body brings her .
In the cab to the pub , the driver instantly reached for his copy of the Daily Mail .
' You 're the lady who was in my paper , are n't you ?
' You 've got incredible legs , ' he said .
' Thank you , ' she beamed .
It was n't always like this .
' As a teenager , I was quite self conscious about my height . '
Her solution ?
She joined a basketball team .
' It would have been a waste not to have , would n't it ?
And it made me feel better being surrounded by tall people . '
These days , she flaunts what she 's got .
We leave the pub - eyes still swivelling - and walk along London 's Tottenham Court Road .
She often wears mini skirts ( they 're sold as knee - length , of course ) .
' I 'm very fond of my legs .
I 've got really nice legs , so why should I hide them ?
' It 's nice to show off the fact that I have the longest legs on the planet . '
The downsides are obvious .
She can't travel with easyJet or Ryanair .
She can't buy trousers very easily .
She can't bear it when people say to her : ' Did you know you 've got really long legs ? '
But mostly she appears to revel in her extraordinary physique .
She has n't ended up in the Guinness Book of World Records against her will - the entry is a direct result of an email she sent to the company when she realised that her legs were longer than the previous incumbent's .
Her trip to the UK is being funded by the publisher , and it may lead to a new career .
' Change is always nice , ' she says enigmatically .
' I would n't mind doing something else - in the media .
Or modelling .'
So , the million - dollar question : would she swop her 4ft 4in legs for mine ?
She pauses for second .
' No thank you , ' she says .
' I 'm quite happy the way I am . '

A Momon Woman and Spousal Abuse
How does one recover from Mormonism ?
How does one separate the cultural life as a Mormon from the noxious belief system ?
What happens when you learn that ' there is no Santa Claus ' and everything you have ever known , felt , or believed is a fraud ?
What happens when you have raised your children in this belief system and reach a point where you can no longer do that ?
After teaching and living Mormonism with your family , how do you put the brakes on and say , ' Hey kids , I was wrong ? '
What happens to you emotionally , mentally , spiritually , and physically when you discover that your life has been based on a lie ?
Those are some of the things which I have faced for the past seven years .
I grew up in a very Mormon family .
My ancestors crossed the plains and settled near Manti , Utah only to be sent to Southern Colorado to establish a Mormon colony there .
I came from a long line of stake presidents , bishops , patriarchs , mission presidents , relief society presidents , and musicians .
When I was born , my grandfather was the stake president , hosting general authorities for conference .
I was comfortable in the faith .
I grew up attending Primary , MIA , and four years of early morning Seminary .
I had wonderful experiences , attending youth conferences , performing in road shows , talent shows , going to dances and performing in dance festivals .
These wonderful experiences probably saved me from the problems so many of my friends had - experimenting with drugs , alcohol , etc .
Growing up in an area where the church was a minority , the kids in my ward and stake had a strong bond .
After a year of BYU , I was married in the temple to a returned missionary .
He seemed like such a catch !
I was living the Mormon dream .
Children began to join us - again and again and again until there were seven of them .
But there were severe problems .
Sometimes that dream was a horrible nightmare .
Sometimes that knight in shining armor was a monster .
Sometimes he hit , kicked , punched and spat on me .
But he was the Priesthood holder .
I must have deserved it .
There must have been some horrible things wrong with me .
The church was true and yet I was n't happy .
Were n't we promised that if we followed the teachings of the church and did everything they required that we would be happy ?
I tried .
I decided to read the scriptures more .
I had always had trouble reading the Book of Mormon .
It just did n't make sense to me .
Of course , that must have been because somehow I was n't ' worthy ' to understand .
But I could read and devour books on many topics and I could understand them !
What was wrong with me ?
I would sit in classes and hear what one general authority said , and then what others said and wonder about the contradictions and think , ' Hey wait a minute ! '
But it must have been because I was n't worthy to understand these things .
Of course , the church was true .
I asked for blessings .
I paid my tithing , I went to the temple .
I did everything I could think of .
I prayed and prayed and prayed .
The marriage became worse .
No matter what I did , it got worse .
I prayed that I would make him happy , that I could save the marriage .
I did n't realize that I was trying to play God .
I did n't realize that this was a serious problem and that we needed professional help .
I did what I had been conditioned to do .
I talked to the bishop .
I had talked to other bishops before and it had always been the same thing - 'it 's up to the woman to save the marriage . '
' You need to pray more ' , ' you need to try harder ' , and ' well , I would never treat MY wife like that . '
So for years , that 's just what I had done .
There was a point in my life that I was teaching 40 piano students , delivering newspapers , sewing for other people , sewing all the kids and my own clothes , teaching the kids at home , holding down 3 or 4 church jobs , making whole wheat bread 2 or 3 times a week , nursing a baby and was pregnant with another .
My former husband kept telling me that I was n't working hard enough and that I was lazy .
The crazy thing was that I believed him .
One thing about being so busy - I did n't have time to think or feel .
I shut down feeling anything .
The cycle of abuse continued to escalate .
Of course it was my fault .
I would sit in church and my stomach would churn .
If I was trying so hard , why was n't anything helping ?
Why would I sit in classes and have trouble believing what was said ?
I must really be awful .
Why does n't God love me ?
How could I ever hope to make it to the celestial kingdom ?
And I did n't dare even acknowledge my worst thoughts - if I have to be there with the FSU ( former spousal unit ) I do n't want to go there !
He would talk about how we would go on a mission together after the kids were raised .
I could n't stand the thought .
Two years stuck together constantly .
I told him he'd be going alone - if I had to do that , then I would die first .
I began to think a lot about dying .
There were a couple of things which began to happen .
I had been doing the music for a small Episcopal church in the community .
These people had something that I was missing .
Their God was n't a god of condemnation and punishment .
The women were treated well .
They were n't stuck in the dogma which was all I 'd ever known .
I enjoyed going to church there .
I enjoyed the love that was shared .
Going to St. David 's each Sunday seemed to give me a sense of hope and peace .
Another thing that happened was that the abuse became worse .
It became worse for the kids , too .
I had always tried to ignore it .
I was too weak to do anything about it at that time .
But one hot summer day in 1990 , my former spousal unit ( FSU ) got into an argument with Child # 2 .
He took that boy to the garage and beat him relentlessly .
He kicked him with steeltoed boots , punched his face , spat at him , screamed at him , beat his head against the wall of the garage .
I stood there screaming , trying to make it stop .
It just kept going .
I called the police .
( My FSU was on the town council and was part of the ' good old boys ' system in the town )
The police chief told me that I was just being neurotic and that FSU was just trying to discipline the kid and that he needed it .
Somewhere inside me , the thought occurred , " If you are n't going to do something about what he does to you , then at least do something about these kids . "
That day , I could n't comfort that son .
He hated me for not protecting him .
Of course , I turned to the church .
I talked to the bishop .
His advise was ' Go home and make FSU a cherry pie .
That will fix everything . '
He told me to pray more and try harder .
He asked ' What do you do to make him have to beat you ?
My wife would never do that ?'
Just what I needed , more guilt and shame .
So I tried harder .
I started going to the temple more .
Things did n't get better .
After one particularly nasty fight , I packed up and left for a few days , taking a couple of kids and hiding the rest .
The bishop and FSU decided that I needed counseling .
How right they were !
I began doing things I did n't understand .
I found myself getting my own post office box .
I got my own checking account .
( FSU had total control of all the money - even what I earned ) I began collecting some of my own piano money .
I had little stashes lying around .
I began making photocopies of important documents and hiding them .
I talked to an advocate for the Sexual Assault and Family Violence program .
I began to read about family violence , cycles of violence , learned helplessness , and other issues .
I discovered that I was not alone .
I asked FSU to get help .
Of course , he did n't need any .
So the bishop and FSU arranged for me to get help .
Funny , during my reading , I could see parallels between the church and control and oppression and my own marriage .
Hmmmm ...
I had an intake appointment with an LDS Social Services counselor .
I was one of the lucky ones .
I had a counselor who asked , " Is this what you think marriage is about ? " I said NO .
He said , " Good .
This may very well be a divorce situation . "
I felt validated and like there was hope .
This man referred me to a counselor in my area .
This was a key in helping me to understand myself and my situation .
Unknowingly , the bishop and FSU had tossed me a lifeline .
For the first time in my life , I began to realize that I was okay .
I realized I had choices and options .
This counseling was great !
FSU agreed to go see the counselor .
FSU spent the time telling the counselor what was wrong with me .
Of course , FSU was okay .
The counselor never tried to talk me into divorcing FSU .
However , after I made that decision , he was very supportive .
Bishop reported the counselor to Salt Lake because he was n't ' saving marriages . '
Bishop told me that he wanted me to sign a release so that the counselor could tell him what we talked about .
Bishop was conducting an ' investigation ' of my life .
The counselor wrote the bishop a letter advising him to leave me alone .
I was beginning to have some real doubts about the church .
FSU went to Idaho and he and his family had a meeting to decide what to do about me .
They decided that I should quit my part time job ( I was accompanist for the local school district ) and stay at home and be a good mother .
I should quit counseling because I was getting ' funny ideas ' and I should become more ' submissive . '
Whoops .
It was too late .
At one point , FSU 's father said that if I were his wife , he would be forced to kill me .
Hmm .
Strong words .
FSU decided he was going to make me love him again .
Whoops .
Again it was too late .
They also decided that I should not be going to St. David 's because I was getting ' funny ideas ' from them .
Whoops .
Too late for that , too .
About this time , I was playing for Stake Conference .
Boyd K Packer was the visiting authority , reorganizing our stake .
A man of God was coming to visit our community !
His talk was so oppressive towards women and demeaning in general .
More guilt and shame , only this time I was n't buying .
I remember his cold , unfeeling gaze .
I was playing some Bach prelude and Brother Packer sent someone to the organ telling me to play only ' hymns of the restoration ' and play them ' very quietly . '
Well , that 's just what I did .
I played VERY softly , but I played ' We Thank Thee O God For a Prophet ' in a minor key .
I do n't think anyone knew what was happening , but BKP looked over at me and I looked at him .
They were n't loving looks .
I thought , ' And this is a man of God ? '
Cold chills went down my spine and I realized that I was headed out of the church .
Maybe there was something wrong with the Church !!!
The cycle of abuse escalated further .
Our family was living a nightmare on an emotional roller coaster .
I was walking about 6 miles a day for my sanity .
I would also go to the playground and swing on the swings .
One night , FSU wanted to go with me because he did n't ' trust ' me .
We walked toward the park and he asked me if I was happy .
I told him that there were things which caused me unhappiness but that I was basically happy .
He told me that he did n't approve of the ways in which I was changing .
He added , ' You are n't making me happy . '
I turned toward him and said , 'I can't make you be happy .
You have to do that for yourself . '
I realized that the marriage was over .
Soon after that , he offered to take me out for lunch .
I could n't stand the idea of even being around him when he was trying to be nice .
I went to the cemetery to pray .
I had kneeholes at a bench where I used to spend much time .
My prayer had changed .
I was no longer asking God to help me save the marriage or to be a good Mormon anymore .
That day , I shouted out " God , is this what you want for me ?
If it is , then let me die !
I do n't want to be around him .
I can't fix him .
I can't even fix myself .
I know it 's a temple marriage , but I do n't care .
I want to be released from this .
Help me figure out if I even believe in the church anymore .
Why is it that I feel so angry when I am at church ? "
I screamed , I cried , I poured out my heart .
For the first time in my life , I was honest in my prayers .
I felt peaceful when I finished .
I realized that I was going to divorce FSU , that I would be okay and that I would n't be alone .
I felt a strength I 'd never known .
I went home and went to lunch with FSU .
I saw him through new eyes .
I saw him as a pathetic victim of his family and of the church .
But I knew that my job was not to fix him or accept any more of the abuse and pain .
I realized that deep within , I had known what I was going to do .
That 's why I had my own post office box , my own checking account , and why I had been copying papers .
I had been getting my ducks in a row , so to speak .
Things were falling into place .
I began to go to Church less and to look forward to attending St. David 's more .
FSU began to follow me wherever I went , including St. David's .
He 'd sit outside lurking while I was in there , then follow me home .
I became more afraid .
My SAFV advocate and I discussed what was involved in getting a protection order .
I decided to get my tubes tied because FSU was thinking that another baby might save the marriage and keep me in the home where I should be .
I thought that it would take a year to get everything over with .
I saw an attorney in early December 1990 .
She was very helpful and I got everything gathered up and in her office .
I informed FSU that I would be divorcing him and things got worse .
On January 2 , 1991 , I got a protection order .
Divorce papers were served at the hearing .
I began seeing friends from my growing up years .
One couple had left the church and gave me articles and books to read .
Other people popped into my life who had left the church .
I noticed that they were all happy .
I quit wearing my garments .
I quit attending church .
When the bishop began calling my friends in to question them about me , I stood up to him .
He informed me that I was being investigated for my membership .
I told him , fine , take it .
At that point he refused , saying that I needed my membership .
I told him it was funny how he would excommunicate me if he could , but that if I requested to leave , he would n't do it .
I left the area and went to school since I had no real marketable skills .
I got a five year degree in three years .
I continued counseling , dealing with issues of anger , religious abuse , domestic violence , PostTraumatic Stress Disorder , depression , and in creating an identity where none had existed .
My identity for the first 36 years of my life was as a Mormon girl , wife , mother , as FSUs wife .
I did n't know who I was and I am thrilled at finding out just who I am .
I attended 12 step groups .
I was baptized at St. David 's in May 1991 , shortly before I moved away from the small town I left .
I really did n't think my mormon baptism was worth much .
I was excommunicated from the church in June 1997 .
I have come to accept the cultural heritage as a Mormon child .
There were many wonderful people and wonderful times in my childhood and I can now look back on them with a smile .
I can laugh at the culture .
I can embrace the good things I learned and the parts from that system that I choose accept and leave the rest .
I do n't know when recovery is finished because it happens like layers of an onion , but I like to think that I am over the difficult parts .
I have grown to love myself and to become more loving with others .
I see a spark of divinity in each and every soul .
That hollow shell of a woman I used to be has died and reborn in her place is the person I am now .
Very much alive and happy about it .
No longer do I sleep with my fists clenched or in fear .
I am no longer afraid of church authorities .
The woman I am has an identity and a soul and is full of the fire of life .
I realize that I am responsible for my life and for the choices I make .
I will not become a victim of any type of abuse again .
I no longer hate the FSU .
He no longer controls me because I have chosen to be in control of my own life .
No longer am I in fear of church leaders .
One of the most important parts of my healing has been in becoming part of the Exmormon group .
I have found people who can understand what it is like to leave a religion , who have been hurt by the Church .
I have raged and ranted and cried and laughed with these people , and many of the people have become very important to me .
The outpouring of love and understanding is truly remarkable .
As far as my religious beliefs , I have found that spirituality and religion are not necessarily the same thing .
I feel that I have become a very spiritual person , although no longer espouse any formal religion .
I am making choices and finding what fits and what does n't .
I believe there is a Divine Presence and acknowledge that in my life .
I have been amazed at the miracles that occur in my life on a daily basis .
I do n't know if it gets any better than that .
My God is one of love and acceptance .
That has been a leap from the old one .
I am a product of the choices I make .
I realize that I am responsible for them .
I have found a gift in all of the pain I have seen and endured .
Not that I care to repeat any of it , but I embrace and accept it for what it has been .
I treasure my life and the experiences and people who are now part of my life .
I love myself and the journey I 'm on .
No , I do n't think it could be any better than that .

I just gave my talk and I think it went swimmingly .
One thing that really worked for me was putting it together in Keynote .
Despite having a ton of movies and images , most of the tedium was automatically handled by using keynote to do almost all of the work .
My process :
Come up with a talk proposal .
Six , actually .
Submit them .
Hope one gets accepted .
Assuming one gets accepted , accept the talk with the organizer .
Procrastinate , but hope that you subconsciously chew on it .
Work on an outline in omnioutliner .
This is important .
Print it out , scribble all over it , put edits back in document .
Once I ’m happy with it , export to powerpoint .
Open in keynote .
Select my theme , switch all slides to my normal slide master , color all of them bright pink .
This is also important .
Switch to outline view .
From the bottom , on a section by section basis , un - indent each outline item to the top level .
This makes a new slide .
For each section , switch masters to my section master ( but pink sticks ) .
Go to navigator view , indent each normal slide under the section / subsection slide .
This lets you collapse - all and work on a section - by - section basis easily .
Go either no navigator view or light table view and search out pink slides to work on .
Once a slide is “ done ” , Use “ Reapply Master to Slide ” to turn off pink .
Work on notes and start reading it out loud a lot .
Wherever something does n’t make sense , sounds clunky , or ca n’t be explained in < 5 seconds , add a slide .
Yes , you heard that right , add a slide , or three .
These areas need more slides to make connecting the conceptual dots easier for the audience .
Do not add more words to the slide .
Usually , steps 5 - 6 take me the longest amount of time and effort …
Getting the outline right is super important .
I would much rather fix things at this stage than in the slide stage .
Steps 10 - 13 get me from 0 slides to 200 + slides in a matter of minutes .
It feels fantastic .
Steps 14 - 15 also take a fair amount of time .
My Optimizations :
All of these steps benefit greatly by adding extra keyboard shortcuts via System Preferences -> Keyboards -> Shortcuts -> App Shortcuts .
I have :
Collapse All : Cmd-Opt-0
Expand All : Cmd-Opt-9
Fit in Window : Cmd-Opt-=
Light Table : Cmd-Opt-L
Navigator View : Cmd-Opt-N
Outline View : Cmd-Opt -U
Play Slideshow : Cmd -P ( why would I EVER print a keynote ? )
Reapply Master : Cmd-Control - M ( does n’t always work ?
Apple ?
Help ? )
Rehearse Slideshow : Cmd-R
I use these a lot and they help me keep moving .
My Automation :
Figuring stuff out :
Applescript can be a real PITA , but most of the stuff I do is pretty straightforward .
While I do n’t have a REPL for applescript , I can introspect on things fairly easily .
I almost always have a script on the side with something like the following :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 tell application " Keynote " tell front document tell current slide tell movie 1 properties end tell end tell end tell end tell
Which outputs something like :
{opacity : 100 , parent : slide 40 of document id " 1B0AA7F1 - A88F-4C42-A6BE-FC67CCC70D1A " of application " Keynote " , movie volume : 100 , class : movie , file name : " lines1.mp4 " , reflection showing : false , rotation : 0 , position : {260 , 80} , width : 1400 , reflection value : 0 , height :919 , repetition method : loop , locked : false}
That quickly let ’s me know what I can mess with , or let ’s me do the math I need to figure out positioning , etc .
Resize Movie
I made this in the midst of working on this latest talk .
The 10 - 15 minutes it took saved me a TON of time .
I had 43 movies and 46 images in this talk ( eg : count of movies of every slide ) .
It was easily worth the investment many times over .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 tell application " Keynote " tell front document set myWidth to width set myHeight to height tell current slide tell movie 1 -- since " constrain proportions " is on , only set one : set height to 919 -- set width to 1400 set position to {( myWidth / 2 ) - ( width / 2 ) , ( myHeight / 2 ) - ( height / 2 ) } set repetition method to loop end tell end tell end tell end tell
It takes the ( first ) movie in the current slide and does the following :
set the height ( or the width , but not both ) to fit for that master .
If I have different masters with different spacing , then I use multiple scripts .
I do n’t want applescript to have to figure that out ( tho , thinking about it , that should be easy based on the master name ) .
Calculate it ’s position to be centered by using the dimensions of the slide vs the dimensions of the image .
Turn on looping .
I ’d like it to turn on auto - start as well , but that ’s not a property of the movie for some reason and I did n’t want to dive into UI scripting .
This script already saved me a ton of time and I felt like I was ahead of the ball for once .
In another case , I was n’t centering so the maths were n’t as easy .
I wound up manually positioning it , figuring out the X/Y , and injecting some of those numbers straight in :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 tell movie 1 -- since " constrain proportions " is on , only set one : set height to 800 -- set width to 1400 set position to {myWidth - width - 84 , 193} set repetition method to loop end tell
Copy Body To Speaker Note
I also have some scripts to transfer content into speaker notes .
This one does the body :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 tell application " Keynote " tell front document set the base slide of the current slide to master slide " Takahashi Blue " tell current slide -- set myTitle to object text of default title item set myBody to object text of default body item set presenter notes to myBody set object text of default body item to " " set body showing to false end tell end tell end tell
Copy Title To Speaker Note
And this one does the title .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 tell application " Keynote " tell front document set the base slide of the current slide to master slide " Takahashi Blue " tell current slide set myTitle to object text of default title item -- set myBody to object text of default body item set presenter notes to myTitle set object text of default title item to " " -- set title showing to false end tell end tell end tell
Miscellaneous Tips :
cmd-F1 toggles mirroring .
Works even after you “ play ” your keynote .
Do this if your speaker notes do n’t show up on your laptop or projector .
“ x ” will toggle your speaker notes and slides .
Do this if your speaker notes go up on the projector .
“ w ” and “ b ” will blank the screen either white or black , respectively .
And very important :
YOU are being recorded .
The audience is not .
During Q&A , if you do not repeat the question , nobody watching this later will know what was asked .
If I ’m in your talk , I ’ll remind you , ONCE .
After that it is on you .
So … I hope that helps you work on your slides .
It certainly has helped me .
