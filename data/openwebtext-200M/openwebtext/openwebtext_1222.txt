UNITED States President Barack Obama has no plans to join a global treaty banning landmines because a policy review found the US could not meet its security commitments without them , the State Department said .
" This administration undertook a policy review and we decided that our landmine policy remains in effect , " spokesman Ian Kelly told a briefing five days before a review conference in Cartegena , Colombia on the 10 - year - old Mine Ban Treaty .
" We determined that we would not be able to meet our national defense needs nor our security commitments to our friends and allies if we signed this convention , " he said .
It was the first time the administration had publicly disclosed the decision .
The treaty bans the use , stockpiling , production or transfer of antipersonnel mines .
It has been endorsed by 156 countries , but the United States , Russia , China and India have not adopted it .
US Senator Patrick Leahy , a leading advocate for the treaty , called the decision " a default of US leadership . "
" It is a lost opportunity for the United States to show leadership instead of joining with China and Russia and impeding progress , " Senator Leahy , a Vermont Democrat , said in a statement .
Landmines are known to have caused 5197 casualties last year , a third of them children , according to the Nobel Prize - winning International Campaign to Ban Landmines ( ICBL ) , which links some 1000 activist groups .
The United States generally abides by the provisions of the treaty .
It has not used antipersonnel mines since the 1991 Gulf War , has not exported any since 1992 and has not produced them since 1997 , Steve Goose , director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch , told a briefing on Monday .
The review conference next Sunday is expected to draw more than 1000 delegates representing more than 100 countries , including ministers and heads of state .
It will look at the progress of a broadly popular treaty that has helped cut landmine casualties around the world and provided relief to victims .
Mr Kelly said the United States would send humanitarian mine relief experts from the State Department , Defense Department , US Agency for International Development and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to observe the conference .
" As a global provider of security , we have an interest in the discussions there , " Mr Kelly said .
" But we will be there as an observer , obviously , because we have n't signed the convention , nor do we plan to sign the convention . "
It is the first time the United States has sent observers to a gathering of states that have accepted the treaty , a move that was welcomed by anti-landmine campaigners .
" The very fact that they are showing up we take as a positive sign of movement on this issue within the Obama administration , " Mr Goose said .
" We hope they 're not coming empty - handed , " he added .
" We very much want them to come and say that they intend to join this convention .
" Even if they can't give a timeline , we want them to say they intend to join at some point in time . "
Anti-mine campaigners said a declaration of intent was important because the Bush administration reversed US policy on accepting the convention and said it would never join .
While Mr Kelly 's comment indicated no shift in administration policy , Jeff Abramson , deputy director of the nonpartisan Arms Control Association , said the United States was expected to make a statement at the conference that might shed more light on the decision .
He said it would be disappointing if such a statement shut the door to continuing a review of US policy .
Mr Kelly said the United States was the world 's single largest financial supporter of humanitarian mine action , having provided more than $ 1.5 billion since 1993 to support mine clearance and destruction of conventional weapons .
In contravention of the treaty , however , the United States stockpiles some 10 million antipersonnel mines and retains the option to use them .
But using mines would pose big problems for Washington , Mr Goose said , because most of its allies including all but one NATO country , are parties to the treaty and are pledged not to help other countries use the weapons .

It is hard for international observers of the United States to grasp the political paralysis that grips the country , and that seriously threatens America 's ability to solve its domestic problems and contribute to international problem - solving .
America 's governance crisis is the worst in modern history .
Moreover , it is likely to worsen in the years ahead .
The difficulties that Barack Obama is having in passing his basic programme , whether in healthcare , climate change , or financial reform , are hard to understand at first glance .
After all , he is personally popular , and his Democratic party holds commanding majorities in both houses of Congress .
Yet his agenda is stalled and the country 's ideological divisions grow deeper .
Among Democrats , Obama 's approval rating in early November was 84 % , compared with just 18 % among Republicans .
Fifty - eight percent of Democrats thought the country was headed in the right direction , compared with 9 % of Republicans .
Only 18 % of Democrats supported sending 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan , while 57 % of Republicans supported a troop buildup .
In fact , a significant majority of Democrats , 60 % , favoured a reduction of troops in Afghanistan , compared with just 26 % of Republicans .
On all of these questions , a middle ground of independents ( neither Democrats nor Republicans ) was more evenly divided .
Part of the cause for these huge divergences in views is that America is an increasingly polarised society .
Political divisions have widened between the rich and poor , among ethnic groups ( non-Hispanic whites versus African Americans and Hispanics ) , across religious affiliations , between native - born and immigrants , and along other social fault lines .
American politics has become venomous as the belief has grown , especially on the vocal far right , that government policy is a " zero - sum " struggle between different social groups and politics .
Moreover , the political process itself is broken .
The Senate now operates on an informal rule that opponents will try to kill a legislative proposal through a " filibuster " – a procedural attempt to prevent the proposal from coming to a vote .
To overcome a filibuster , the proposal 's supporters must muster 60 of 100 votes , rather than a simple majority .
This has proved impossible on controversial policies – such as binding reductions on carbon emissions – even when a simple majority supports the legislation .
An equally deep crisis stems from the role of big money in politics .
Backroom lobbying by powerful corporations now dominates policymaking negotiations , from which the public is excluded .
The biggest players , including Wall Street , the automobile companies , the healthcare industry , the armaments industry , and the real - estate sector , have done great damage to the US and world economy during the last decade .
Many observers regard the lobbying process as a kind of legalised corruption , in which huge amounts of money change hands , often in the form of campaign financing , in return for specific policies and votes .
Finally , policy paralysis around the US federal budget may be playing the biggest role of all in America 's incipient governance crisis .
The US public is rabidly opposed to paying higher taxes , yet the trend level of taxation ( at about 18 % of national income ) is not sufficient to pay for the core functions of government .
As a result , the US government now fails to provide adequately for basic public services such as modern infrastructure ( fast rail , improved waste treatment , broadband ) , renewable energy to fight climate change , decent schools , and healthcare financing for those who cannot afford it .
Powerful resistance to higher taxes , coupled with a growing list of urgent unmet needs , has led to chronic under - performance by the US government and an increasingly dangerous level of budget deficits and government debt .
This year , the budget deficit stands at a peacetime record of about 10 % of GNP , much higher than in other high - income countries .
Obama so far seems unable to break this fiscal logjam .
To win the 2008 election , he promised that he would not raise taxes on any household with income of less than $ 250,000 a year .
That no -tax pledge , and the public attitudes that led Obama to make it , block reasonable policies .
There is little " waste " to cut from domestic spending , and many areas where increases in public spending are needed .
Higher taxes on the rich , while justified , do n't come close to solving the deficit crisis .
America , in fact , needs a value - added tax , which is widely used in Europe , but Obama himself staunchly ruled out that kind of tax increase during his election campaign .
These paralysing factors could intensify in the years ahead .
The budget deficits could continue to prevent any meaningful action in areas of critical need .
The divisions over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could continue to block a decisive change in policy , such as a withdrawal of forces .
The desire of Republicans to defeat the Democrats could lead them to use every manoeuvre to block votes and slow legislative reforms .
A breakthrough will require a major change in direction .
The US must leave Iraq and Afghanistan , thereby saving $ 150bn a year for other purposes and reducing the tensions caused by military occupation .
The US will have to raise taxes in order to pay for new spending initiatives , especially in the areas of sustainable energy , climate change , education , and relief for the poor .
To avoid further polarisation and paralysis of American politics , Obama must do more to ensure that Americans understand better the urgency of the changes that he promised .
Only such changes – including lobbying reforms – can restore effective governance .
Copyright Project Syndicate , 2009
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Telecommunications giant AT&T struck back on Wednesday at Sen .
Herb Kohl , chair of a congressional antitrust panel , saying the lawmaker ’s concerns about a lack of competition in the wireless industry were unfounded .
Kohl wrote to the Justice Department ’s top antitrust regulator Christine Varney and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski on Monday to reiterate concerns over texting prices , large carriers failing to cooperate with smaller carriers to resolve roaming disputes , disputes over spectrum and deals that give one or another carrier exclusive access to popular phones like the iPhone .
AT&T argued that cell service had become progressively cheaper , with revenue per minute falling 89 percent since 1994 .
“ U.S. wireless prices are much lower than in any other major industrialized country , ” wrote James Cicconi , an AT&T senior executive vice president .
Cicconi argued that texting prices had fallen because of package deals , “ dropping almost 70 percent since January 2007 , ” and asserted that the pay - per-use price cited by Kohl represented less than 1 percent of AT&T ’s customers .
Cicconi also argued that exclusive handset arrangements allowed a carrier and a manufacturer to split the high cost of marketing “ an inventive but unproven new device . ”
Kohl had called the deals “ a serious barrier to competition . ”
“ I think AT&T is right on the handset exclusivity , ” said Orrick antitrust expert David Smutny , who argued that telecommunications firms were vying to help manufacturers to come up with the new cool phone -- the iPhone killer -- in order to compete with the AT&T / Apple alliance .
“ What AT&T cares about is getting people to sign up for its service and what Apple cares about is getting people to get its cool phone .
That ’s pretty pro-consumer , ” he said .
Cicconi said that AT&T complied with FCC regulations , which required it to allow other companies ’ customers to roam to get voice service but not data , which means that they may not get email or Internet service on their phones if they are out of their servers ’ area .
AT&T also defended early termination fees as a way for the company to recoup money spent discounting handsets .
Overall , Orrick ’s Smutny said he failed to see significant antitrust issues in the wireless industry .
“ Most people are served by at least three and sometimes five or six wireless carriers , ” he said .
“ On the specific issues that Sen .
Kohl raises , I think that AT&T has the better of the argument . ”
Many of the experiments Hauser tells us about are intended to delimit stages in child development .
Three - year - olds already know , for example , that “ if an act causes harm , but the intention was good , then the act is judged less severely . ”
Hauser takes this fact to support the claim that “ rather than a learned capacity ... our ability to detect cheaters who violate social norms is one of nature ’s gifts . ”
But do such facts as that children learn to use expressions like “ did n’t mean to do it ” at roughly the same time as they learn “ should n’t have done it ” help us draw a line between nature and nurture ?
Hauser does not spell out the relevance of data about child development to the question of whether internalizing a moral code requires a dedicated area of the brain .
Image Credit ... Boris Kulikov
To convince us that such an organ exists , Hauser would have to start by drawing a bright line separating what he calls “ the moral domain ” — one that nonhuman species cannot enter — from other domains .
But he never does .
The closest he comes is saying things like “ a central difference between social conventions and moral rules is the seriousness of an infraction . ”
He takes this to suggest “ that moral rules consist of two ingredients : a prescriptive theory or body of knowledge about what one ought to do , and an anchoring set of emotions . ”
Apparently both rules of etiquette and moral rules embody knowledge about what ought to be done .
All that is distinctive about morality is added emotional freight .
But , as Hauser tells us , many nonhuman species obey social conventions .
( For example , “ Do not start tearing at the carcass before the alpha male has eaten his fill . ” )
It is hard to see why evolution had to carve out a new , specialized organ just to generate the extra emotional intensity that differentiates guilt from chagrin .
Perhaps
Hauser does not mean to say that greater seriousness is the only , or the most important , mark of the moral domain .
But the reader is left guessing about how he proposes to distinguish morality not just from etiquette , but also from prudential calculation , mindless conformity to peer pressure and various other things .
This makes it hard to figure out what exactly his moral module is supposed to do .
It also makes it difficult to envisage experiments that would help us decide between his hypothesis and the view that all we need to internalize a moral code is general - purpose learning - from - experience circuitry — the same circuitry that lets us internalize , say , the rules of baseball .
Hauser thinks that Noam Chomsky has shown that in at least one area — learning how to produce grammatical sentences — the latter sort of circuitry will not do the job .
We need , Hauser says , a “ radical rethinking of our ideas on morality , which is based on the analogy to language . ”
But the analogy seems fragile .
Chomsky has argued , powerfully if not conclusively , that simple trial - and - error imitation of adult speakers cannot explain the speed and confidence with which children learn to talk : some special , dedicated mechanism must be at work .
But is a parallel argument available to Hauser ?
For one thing , moral codes are not assimilated with any special rapidity .
For another , the grammaticality of a sentence is rarely a matter of doubt or controversy , whereas moral dilemmas pull us in opposite directions and leave us uncertain .
( Is it O.K. to kill a perfectly healthy but morally despicable person if her harvested organs would save the lives of five admirable people who need transplants ?
Ten people ?
Dozens ? )
Hauser hopes that his book will convince us that “ morality is grounded in our biology . ”
Once we have grasped this fact , he thinks , “ inquiry into our moral nature will no longer be the proprietary province of the humanities and social sciences , but a shared journey with the natural sciences . ”
But by “ grounded in ” he does not mean that facts about what is right and wrong can be inferred from facts about neurons .
The “ grounding ” relation in question is not like that between axioms and theorems .
It is more like the relation between your computer ’s hardware and the programs you run on it .
If your hardware were of the wrong sort , or if it got damaged , you could not run some of those programs .

Everything Was Beautiful and Nothing Hurt
The year I met Steve Almond was also the year I picked up ( Not That You Asked ) and the year I read his gorgeous homage to Kurt Vonnegut , “ Everything Was Beautiful and Nothing Hurt . ”
It ’s the crown jewel of a solid essay collection , sixty pages that seems for a moment like a memoir but ultimately delves deeper into the meaning of Vonnegut ’s work than anything I ’ve ever read .
The essay stayed with me .
Like Steve , and so many people our age ( Gen .
Xers who hate to be marketed to and do n’t join groups but all agree that The Pixies is the most underrated band of all time ) I tore through Kurt Vonnegut in college .
There was something in the clunky sentences - a deep kindness , a piercing humor - that got right to the heart of things .
Kurt Vonnegut was born today , on Veterans Day , a day which is also called Armistice Day .
And that ’s what Vonnegut would tell people , that he was born on Armistice day .
He was a man with deep reverence for peace who knew firsthand the horrors of war and the ending of war was something to be celebrated .
Today , in honor of Vonnegut , we are reprinting Steve Almond ’s essay in full .
– Stephen Elliott
The Failed Prophecy of Kurt Vonnegut ( and How It Saved My Life )
Part One
You are writing for strangers .
Face the audience of strangers .
It would be fair to call me one of the Kurt Vonnegut cult , though a member in poor standing .
I read all of his books in high school and college , most of them six times , and I ’m sure I walked around for a good number of years spouting little Vonnuggets of wisdom , as his followers so incessantly do .
I devoted most of my senior year in college to a detailed study of his work , writing a thesis titled “ Authorial Presence in the Works of Kurt Vonnegut , ” a copy of which I recently asked my mother to send me , in her capacity as Chief Curator of the Steve Almond Archives , a capacity , I should add , that she views as the necessary burden of having raised an itinerant narcissist .
The Archives have fallen on hard times in the past few years .
The result being that the original bound copy of the document – which I feel compelled to note was dedicated to the Chief Curator – no longer exists .
It was apparently lent out to my uncle Peter , a man whose own literary archive resides in the backseat of his car .
The Chief Curator was able to find , after what she described as “ many hours of excavation ” a draft of the thesis , which included the proofreading marks of my college pal James Shiffer who , perhaps not coincidentally , no longer speaks to me .
The last page bore a circular stamp at the bottom right .
I initially took this to be some sort of academic notarization before coming to recognize it as a large , oddly filigreed coffee stain .
*
I was revisiting my thesis because I had been asked to write an appreciation of Vonnegut , a request I initially refused .
I was at work on a dying novel , after all , and I hate to be distracted in the midst of such satisfying masochism .
But the request lingered .
It activated certain deeply rooted fanboy tendencies .
I started thinking about how much Vonnegut had meant to me , and why , and whether writing about him might lead to a rendezvous .
That was what I wanted .
I wanted to interview him .
I wanted to sit around on his porch smoking Pall Malls with him , or at least breathing in his second - hand smoke .
Note : this is the fantasy of every single Vonnegut fan .
*
Eighteen years ago , upon my successful expulsion from college , I was invited to stay with a friend of my girlfriend , out in Sagaponeck , Long Island .
I was on the brink of breaking up with this particular girlfriend .
But it was also true that these friends of hers were neighbors of Vonnegut .
Friends , actually .
( They called him Kurt ! )
So I took a bus out there and hung around for a few days , feeling poor and unsophisticated and properly caddish .
In my backpack was a bound copy of my thesis .
All weekend , I fantasized about dropping it off in his mailbox , with a note explaining that I was staying just down the road .
He was a busy guy , and a notorious grouch , so he would n’t read my thesis immediately .
But eventually he ’d crack the thing and read a few pages and realize , with a discernable jolt , that , by God , this young Almond fellow knew a few things , that I alone , among his legion of literary investigators had divined his essence , understood his crusade , could be trusted with his secrets .
This would lead to an invite for cocktails , a long wistful discussion , many Pall Malls , and his eventual decision to adopt me .
But I chickened out .
*
Cluck cluck .
*
Fast forward to early 2006 .
I had agreed to write about Vonnegut .
But the word on the street was that no one got to Vonnegut .
The best I could hope for was to get a note to his attorney , one Donald Farber .
I imagined this Farber as a sour , bloodless figure , a dead ringer for Bela Lugosi , with a massive desk upon which sat a single small rubber stamp .
From time to time , a small , possibly deformed assistant would place a document before him , allowing Farber the solemn pleasure of whacking a bright red “ No ” on each request .
Around this time , I traveled down to Hartford , Connecticut [ 1 ] for a reading and by chance started thumbing through a local paper and suddenly saw Kurt Vonnegut staring at me .
He was slated to appear at something called the Connecticut Forum , along with Joyce Carol Oates and Jennifer Weiner .
This was obviously kismet , but I managed not to notice , and immediately filed this information away in the precise part of my brain that has been eroded by pot smoke .
The newspaper got tossed into my own backseat archive .
A month later , while uncharacteristically cleaning my car , I came upon the ad for the Connecticut Forum , which was taking place the very next evening .
I was no longer suffering under delusion that I would be able to contact Vonnegut directly .
And thus , a notion now took root inside my pointy little head : I had to go see Kurt Vonnegut .
I had to drive down to Hartford and ask him for an interview .
I became convinced this would be my one and only shot at a face - to - face .
The man was 83 years old .
He had been smoking those Pall Malls ( unfiltered ) for longer than my parents have been alive .
To put it indelicately : he would soon be dead .
*
The Connecticut Forum event was , naturally , sold out .
But my friend Catherine , who appears to know every person of consequence in Hartford , managed to finagle me a ticket .
And not just to the panel , but to the cocktail reception and dinner beforehand , at which the authors would be appearing .
I spent all that Friday composing a brief letter of introduction [ 2 ] and rehearsing what I would say to Vonnegut .
I bought a special envelope , one that would fit into his pocket .
I got a haircut .
For the first time in years , I had a pair of pants dry -cleaned .
*
About the haircut : it was the worst of my adult life .
I had asked my stylist Linda to make sure the bangs were n’t too long , as I did n’t like the idea of looking shaggy for Vonnegut .
I wanted him to be able to see my eyes , and specifically the nobility shining forth from them .
But Linda left the bangs about a half - inch short and boxy at the corners .
I looked like a Beatle , if you can imagine the Beatles reuniting for a tour at age 40 and returning ( ill - advisedly ) to the moptop look .
*
Another irrelevant detail : on the way down to Hartford I was pulled over by a cop for eating a ham sandwich .
It is illegal to eat pork on Connecticut byways .
*
I arrived in Hartford in an addled state .
It did not help that I was attending what I would call a corporate event .
Honestly , I had no idea what the Connecticut Forum was .
But it was immediately apparent they have a lot of money .
As soon as Catherine and I arrived at the venue we started to encounter people who had that unmistakable sheen of prosperity : tailored suits , jewelry , the subtle dermal cross - hatchings of a ski tan .
We got to talking to one such couple in the elevator .
“ Are you all Vonnegut fans ? ” I asked .
“ Not really , ” the man said .
He was probably in his mid-50s .
“ I ’ve never read any of his books . ”
“ None of them ? Not even Slaughterhouse - Five ? ”
He shook his head .
“ What about Joyce Carol Oates ? ”
“ What has she written ? ” he asked pleasantly .
*
And this is what I mean by a corporate event .
Most of the people at this cocktail / dinner thingee were there not because they were fans of the authors , but because it was a way of supporting the arts , being a good corporate citizen .
Being a good corporate citizen means shaving an infinitesimal portion from your profits – profits that have skyrocketed as the government has dedicated itself to the financial aggrandizement of the private sector , while virtually eliminating public funding for the arts ( forget the poor ) – and politely tossing it at programs like the Connecticut Forum , where lots of well - heeled patrons can experience the joys of literature or , at least , a literary dog and pony show , along with noshing on some truly excellent hors d’ouerves .
I ’m sounding angry here .
What I felt in talking with these folks in the elevator was something closer to despair .
Government scientists figure that one out of five male black bass in American river basins have egg cells growing inside their sexual organs , a sign of how widespread fish feminizing has become .
The findings come from the U.S. Geological Survey in its first comprehensive examination of intersex fish in America , a problem linked to women 's birth control pills and other hormone treatments that seep into rivers .
Sporadic reports of feminized fish have been reported for a few years .
The agency looked at past data from nine river basins , which cover about two - thirds of the United States — and found that about six per cent of the nearly 1,500 male fish had a bit of female in them .
The study looked at 16 different species , with most not affected .
The fish most feminized are two of the most sought - after freshwater sport fish : the largemouth and smallmouth , which are part of the black bass family .
Those two species also were the most examined , with nearly 500 black bass tallied .
" It 's widespread , " said USGS biologist Jo Ellen Hinck .
She is the lead author of the study , published online this month in Aquatic Toxicology .
She said 44 per cent of the sites where black bass were tested had at least one male with egg cells growing inside .
Past studies have linked the problem to endocrine - disrupting hormones , such as estrogen from women 's medicines .
While the fish still can reproduce , studies have shown they do not reproduce as well , Hinck said .
Intersex fish also are seen as a general warning about what some experts see as a wider problem of endocrine disruptors in the environment .
The egg cells growing in the male fish 's gonads can be seen only with a microscope after the fish has been caught and dissected .
The study used data from 1995 to 2004 , when the government stopped funding the research .
The only river basin examined that did not show any problems was Alaska 's Yukon River Basin .
The Southeast , especially the Pee Dee River Basin in North and South Carolina , had the highest rates of feminization .
In Bucksport , S.C. , 10 of 11 largemouth bass examined were intersex .
In parts of the Mississippi River in Minnesota and the Yampa River in Colorado , 70 per cent of the smallmouth bass had female signs .
Hinck said black bass seem to be more prone to the problem , but researchers do not know why .
She also found one common carp that was female with bits of male testes growing inside .
So there 's this guy in Florida running for the Democratic nomination for governor .
He has a plan to eliminate property taxes , create a million new jobs , provide free health insurance and free college for all residents , and lots more .
His plan hinges around a proposal to create the Bank of the State of Florida , which will pay 6 % for CDs and make mortgage loans at 2 % and other loans including small business loans at 3 % and make billions for the state .
How is this possible , you ask ?
Using " fractional reserve banking " just like every other bank , except using the profits for the public good .
Dr. Farid A. Khavari says he is " an economist , not a politician , " and he can make all of this happen .
He is also the author of a book , " Towards a Zero - Cost Economy - A Blueprint to Create General Economic Security in a Carefree Economy " that describes an economic system called " carefreeism , " which he compares to capitalism and socialism here .

Looking to permanently delete your Facebook account ?
Not surprising .
Over the years , Facebook has seen its share of controversy in regards to the privacy of its users .
It ’s hard to say what sparked all the excitement : Rapid growth of its service ?
Parents growing awareness of the site and how their kids were using it ?
The media ?
Or perhaps it deserved it based on its unethical business practices , privacy policy or terms of service updates ?
Whatever the reason , it ’s obvious some no longer trust the social giant , and I keep hearing the same question over and over again from my readers :
“ Is it possible to delete my facebook account ? ”
and
“ I managed to deactivate it , so it ’s deleted right ? ”
You would think the answer would be fairly straightforward .
But it took a lot of digging to come up with the solution surrounding account and profile deactivation — and full - blown account removal from the service .
After doing the research and walking through the deceptive complex process , it is apparent that Facebook has done it ’s very best to prevent its customers from leaving .
Because if that happened it would , of course , limit the amount of customer data they can scrub from its service .
Personally , I feel Facebook has crossed the line of unethical behavior on this .
After all , Facebook does n’t truly provide an interface to delete your account quickly and end your agreement with them regarding the use of your personal data per section 2.1 in its terms of service :

Deactivating Your Facebook Account : The same as Deleting your Account ?
Users can deactivate their Facebook account from the user interface without too much trouble .
Facebook will ask you to confirm your decision by displaying one of your friends and telling you “ Your Friend will miss you . ”
I ’m pretty sure it took , at least , a few days for “ P - Diddy ” to get over losing me as a FaceBook friend . :)
Once you confirm you want to deactivate your account , be sure to read the fine print .
It clearly outlines that account deactivation is not the same as deleting your account / profile .
By deactivating your Facebook account , you ’re merely disabling your ID , however , all your data remains on Facebook servers .
What surprised me was the fact that even after the account deactivates , you can still be tagged in photos , invited to events , etc . .
With this in mind , be sure to opt out of emails if that ’s the path you ’re going down .
So in short , deactivating your Facebook account is almost worthless .
It ’s Facebook ’s deceptive and clever practice of luring you into a false sense of security by making you think you ’ve removed your account , personal data and license to your IP ( intellectual property ) from the service when you have n’t .
The wrong part about this is even after your account deactivates , the license granted to Facebook in section 2.1 of its terms …
Section 2.1 of the Facebook Terms of Service
You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook , and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings .
In addition :
For content that is covered by intellectual property rights , like photos and videos ( IP content ) , you specifically give us the following permission , subject to your privacy and application settings : you grant us a non-exclusive , transferable , sub - licensable , royalty - free , worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook ( IP License ) .
This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others , and they have not deleted it .
… is still in effect !
And , being that pretty much anything you plug into Facebook is immediately shared with your friends , per the Facebook Terms of service ( see highlight in bold , ) the license you grant Facebook stays in effect indefinitely even if you do manage to delete your account permanently .
Oh , and it gets better .
To re-activate your account , all you need to do is sign - in to Facebook or use your Facebook ID to sign - in to another service ( or post a comment on some sites ) and everything is right back where you left it as if you never left – pictures , friends , posts , your IP … .
So I think everyone will agree with me in that the Facebook Account / Profile deactivation process is worthless if your goal is to delete your account and remove some of your data or IP from the service .
Seriously the “ real ” good news is there IS a way to delete your account .
How to Really Delete Your Facebook Account
Deep in the bowels of the Facebook help center , you can find the URL that will permanently delete your Facebook account .
Before I show you the link , however , please read the following carefully :
Deleting your Facebook will delete all of your account information and remove your ability to login to the service .
No photos , friends , messages , status updates , etc. According to Facebook , once your account permanently deletes , there is no way to restore your account or your data .
With that in mind , please move forward reading all large and fine print .
So let ’s get started on permanently deleting your profile .
Visit http://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=delete_account, Click Submit
You ’ll be asked to confirm .
Type in your password and solve the CAPTCHA .
Click Okay to continue .
All done , sort of .
How to Make Sure Facebook Permanently Deletes your Account
Even after confirming the deletion of your account , Facebook will only deactivate it , leaving you 14 days to log back in and cancel the entire deletion .
Sigh .
I know what you ’re thinking : “ Really ?
Fourteen days to delete my data ? ”
I completed the scavenger hunt and found the DELETE link .
I saw the BIG RED TEXT warning me my account would be permanently deleted .
I entered my password .
I helped translate a book for GOOGLE by solving the Captcha puzzle .
Lastly , I clicked the Okay button
I think it ’s pretty obvious by now Facebook does n’t consider you a customer from a customer service point - of - view .
Facebook is in the data business — more specifically , your data , and it will go to great lengths to keep information including your employment , school history , friends , network , photos , tagged face , etc … which it managed to collect from you over the years in its social web .
The 14 day grace period is Facebook ’s last - ditch attempt to lure you somehow back into the service either accidentally or from some subconscious Facebook addiction in order to abort the account cancellation process .
With this in mind , here are a few tips to make sure you do n’t “ accidentally ” log in to Facebook thus aborting your account nuke process .
Clear your browser cache and delete all cookies – Firefox / Internet Explorer / Secure Wipe w/ CCleaner Delete the Facebook Application on your iPhone ( do n’t worry , it ’s free if you ever want to add it again … )
Avoid clicking the Facebook Share button on any websites you read such as the button below ( sorry , could n’t resist )
5/5/2010 UPDATE : Reader UXP made a good point in his comment below reminding me that Facebook is also used by many people for single sign - on for commenting on blogs or logging into websites ( like digg.com for instance . )
Other examples – Facebook chat clients like Pidgin or Adium .
If you use these services , post a comment on a blog using Facebook Connect , or log in to a site using your Facebook account during your 14 - day waiting period , and your FB account will be reactivated .
Ouch … that one is going to hurt if your only Creds on DIGG.com or other sites is your Facebook account .
Now , I ca n’t make any promises that after all this work ( and 14 days of course ) Facebook will delete your account because it ’s not my company .
This is , however , the process that it laid out on its website ( if you managed to track it down ) .
Good luck ; unfortunately , you ’ll need it .
Blogging on App Engine , part 7 : Migration
Posted by Nick Johnson | Filed under tech , app- engine , coding , bloggart
This is part of a series of articles on writing a blogging system on App Engine .
An overview of what we 're building is here .
We 're finally going to tackle ( at least part of ) that big bugbear of blogging systems : Migrating from the old system to the new one .
In this post , we 'll cover the necessary pre-requisites , briefly cover the theory of importing from a blogging system hosted outside App Engine , then go over a practical example of migrating from Bloog ( since that 's what this blog is hosted on ) .
Regenerating posts
Before we can write migration or import scripts , we need to improve ( again ) our dependency regeneration code .
One thing that 's probably occurred to you if you 've been following this series is that there 's currently no easy way to regenerate all the resources when something global changes such as the theme or the configuration .
One could simply call . publish ( ) on each blog post , but that would result in regenerating the common resources , such as the index and tags pages , over and over again - potentially hundreds of times .
The same applies to migration :
We could publish each new post as we process it , but this would again result in much redundant work .
In order to facilitate a more efficient regeneration process , we 're going to do some refactoring .
For a start , we 'll refactor out the dependency generation part of BlogPost.
publish ( ) :
def publish ( self ) : if not self .
path : num = 0 content =
None while not content : path = utils.format_post_path( self , num ) content = static.add ( path , '' , config.html_mime_type ) num += 1 self . path = path self.put ( ) if not self .
deps : self .deps = {} for generator_class , deps in self.get_deps ( ) : for dep in deps : if generator_class.can_defer : deferred.defer(generator_class.generate_resource , None , dep ) else : generator_class.generate_resource( self , dep ) self.put ( ) def get_deps ( self , regenerate = False ) : for generator_class in generators.generator_list : new_deps = set( generator_class.get_resource_list( self ) ) new_etag = generator_class.get_etag(self ) old_deps , old_etag = self.deps.get(generator_class.name ( ) , ( set ( ) , None ) ) if new_etag != old_etag or regenerate : #
If the etag has changed , regenerate everything to_regenerate = new_deps | old_deps else : # Otherwise just regenerate the changes to_regenerate = new_deps ^ old_deps self.deps[generator_class.name ( ) ] = ( new_deps , new_etag ) yield generator_class , to_regenerate
Next , we 'll write a class to handle regenerating all content .
Add the following to handlers.py :
class PostRegenerator ( object ) : def __init__( self ) : self.seen = set ( ) def regenerate ( self , batch_size=50 , start_key =None ) : q = models.
BlogPost.all( ) if start_key : q.filter ( ' __key__ >' , start_key ) posts = q.fetch ( batch_size ) for post in posts : for generator_class , deps in post.get_deps ( True ) : for dep in deps : if ( generator_class.__name__ , dep ) not in self .
seen : logging.warn(( generator_class.__name__ , dep ) ) self.seen.add(( generator_class.__name__ , dep ) ) deferred.defer(generator_class.generate_resource , None , dep ) post.put ( ) if len( posts ) == batch_size : deferred.defer(self.regenerate , batch_size , posts [ - 1 ] .key ( ) )
This class stores a set of dependencies that it 's already generated in its ' seen ' attribute .
Run from the task queue , it fetches a batch of posts , then generates dependencies for them , and adds regeneration tasks to the task queue for any that have n't already been regenerated .
After processing a batch of entries , it enqueues another invocation of itself to continue where it left off .
This ' chaining ' pattern is a common one when using the Task Queue - we 've already seen it in use for generating listing pages , where each listing task generates one page , then creates a new task to generate the following one .
A straightforward admin handler takes care of invoking PostRegenerator on demand :
class RegenerateHandler( BaseHandler ) : def post ( self ) : regen = PostRegenerator ( ) deferred.defer(regen.regenerate ) deferred.defer(post_deploy.post_deploy , post_deploy .
BLOGGART_VERSION ) self.render_to_response("regenerating.html " )
Note that this handler also reruns the post_deploy task , making sure static pages also get regenerated .
Once again , we 've left out the template changes ; you can see these in the repository .
Migrating from an external blog
Since I do n't have an external blogging system to demonstrate this with , this section will be brief and theoretical , for now .
In future , we may address this for specific blog systems as they arise .
The advanced bulk loading series will be of use here - in particular , loading from alternate data - sources .
Here 's a skeleton for a BlogPostLoader :
class BlogPostLoader ( bulkloader .
Loader ) : def __init__ ( self , query , converters ) : self.query = query bulkloader .Loader.__init__(' BlogPost ' , converters ) def initialize ( self , filename , loader_opts ) : self.connect_args = dict(urlparse.parse_qsl(loader_opts ) ) def generate_records ( filename ) : db = MySQLdb.connect(self.connect_args ) cursor = db.cursor ( ) cursor.execute(self.query ) return iter( cursor.fetchone , None ) def finalize ( self ) : regen = PostRegenerator ( ) deferred.defer(regen.regenerate )
Nothing fancy going on here , except the presence of a finalize method .
The finalize method creates a PostRegenerator instance , and calls regen.regenerate ( ) on the task queue .
As of 1.2.7 , remote_api supports the Task Queue API , making this a particularly easy and convenient way to start generating the static content once importing the posts finishes .
Migrating from an App Engine blog
Migrating from a blogging system already hosted on App Engine is a different matter .
For this , we 'll use the task queue and a custom handler , rather than the bulk loader .
Add the following to a new file , migrate.py :
class BloogBreakingMigration ( object ) : class Article ( db. Model ) title = db. StringProperty ( ) article_type = db. StringProperty ( ) html = db. TextProperty ( ) published = db.DateTimeProperty ( ) updated = db.DateTimeProperty ( ) tags = db. StringListProperty ( ) @classmethod def migrate_one ( cls , post_key ) : logging .
debug ( " Migrating post with key %s " , post_key ) article = cls.Article.get ( post_key ) post = models .
BlogPost ( path=article.key ( ) .name ( ) , title=article.title , body=article.html , tags=set(article.tags ) , published=article.published , updated=article.updated , deps={} ) post.put ( ) @classmethod def migrate_all(cls , batch_size=20 , start_key =None ) : q = cls.Article.all(keys_only=True ) if start_key : q.filter ( ' __key__ >' , start_key ) articles = q.fetch ( batch_size ) for key in articles : cls.migrate_one( key ) if len( articles ) == batch_size : deferred.defer(cls.migrate_all , batch_size , articles [ - 1 ] ) else : logging .
warn ( " Migration finished ; starting rebuild . " ) regen = handlers .
PostRegenerator ( ) deferred.defer(regen.regenerate )
Note that like the Generator classes , everything here is a class method ; we 're merely using a class for containment .
The class is called BloogBreakingMigration because it's for migrating from a blog based on the ' breaking ' branch of my bloog fork ; a similar ' BloogMigration ' class would handle migration from regular bloog .
The method migrate_all iterates over all Bloog 's ' Article ' entities , using the same batch - and - chain method used above for post regeneration .
Each Article is migrated by calling migrate_one , and at the end of a batch , we chain a new migration task if there are more posts left ; otherwise , we start the regeneration process by creating and starting a PostRegenerator .
For now , we wo n't bother with a user interface for this .
To start it off , fire up a remote_api_shell , and enter the following commands :
notdot - blog > from google.appengine.ext import deferred notdot - blog > import datetime notdot - blog > import migrate notdot - blog > deferred.defer(migrate.BloogMigration.migrate_all_breaking , _eta=datetime.datetime.now ( ) -datetime.timedelta( days=1 ) )
Notice that we 're setting an ETA in the past for this task - this is a nasty hack to get around the issue that the remote_api console uses the local timezone , while App Engine expects the ETA to be in UTC .
Setting an ETA in the past ensures the task gets run immediately .
This starts the migration process ; keep an eye on the task queue for an idea of when it 's done .
Once finished , you can load up the blog homepage , and everything should have migrated over to the new system !
You 've probably noticed that we 've said nothing about migrating comments to the new blog ; doing so deserves a post all of its own , so we 'll cover it in the next post .

On Friday , my latest tweet was automatically posted to my Facebook news feed , as always .
But this time , Tom Scoville noticed a difference : the link in the posting was no longer active .
It turns out that a lot of other people had noticed this too .
Mashable wrote about the problem on Saturday morning : Facebook Unlinks Your Twitter Links .
if you ’re posting web links ( Bit.ly , TinyURL ) to your Twitter feed and using the Twitter Facebook app to share those updates on Facebook too , none of those links are hyperlinked .
Your friends will need to copy and paste the links into a browser to make them work .
If this is a design decision on Facebook ’s part , it ’s an extremely odd one : we ’d like to think it ’s an inconvenient bug , and we have a mail in to Facebook to check .
Suffice to say , the issue is site - wide : it ’s not just you .
As it turns out , it was n’t just links imported from Twitter .
All outbound links were temporarily disabled , unless users explicitly added them as links via an “ attach ” dialogue .
I went to Facebook , and tried posting a link to this blog directly in my status feed , and saw the same behavior : links were no longer automatically made clickable .
You can see that in the image that is the destination of the first link in this piece .
The problem was quickly fixed , with URLs in status updates automatically now linkified again .
The consensus was that it was in fact a bug , but it ’s little surprise that people suspected otherwise , given the increasing amount of effort Facebook puts into warning people that they are leaving Facebook for the big bad unsafe Internet :
All of this is well - intentioned , I ’m sure .
After all , Facebook is attempting to put in place privacy controls that allow its users to manage the visibility of their information — and the Web ’s expectation of universal visibility is not necessarily the best default for much of the information posted on Facebook .
But let ’s not kid ourselves : Facebook is a new kind of web site ( or an old kind redux ) , a world of its own , playing by different rules .
But this is n’t just about Facebook .
The Apple iPhone is the hottest web access device around , and like Facebook , while it connects to the web , it plays by a different set of rules .
Anyone can put up a website , or launch a new Windows or Mac OS X or Linux application , without anyone ’s permission .
But put an app onto the iPhone ?
That requires Apple ’s blessing .
There is one glaring loophole : anyone can create a web application , which any user can save as clickable application on their phone .
But these web applications have limits – there are key capabilities of the phone that are not accessible to web applications .
HTML 5 can introduce all the new application - like features it wants , but they will work only for web applications , and ca n’t access key aspects of the phone with Apple ’s permission .
And as we saw earlier this year with Apple ’s rejection of the Google Voice application , Apple is n’t shy about blocking applications that it considers threatening to their core business , or that of their partners .
And now , of course , we see the latest salvo in the war against the accepted rules of interoperability on the web : Rupert Murdoch ’s threat to take the Wall Street Journal out of the Google search index .
While most people have repeated the existing wisdom that to do so would be suicide for the Journal , a few contrarian observers have noted the leverage Murdoch holds .
Mark Cuban argues that Twitter now trumps search engines when it comes to breaking news .
Even more provocatively , Jason Calacanis suggested , a few weeks before Murdoch ’s announcement , that all big media companies need to do to cut Google off at the knees would be to block Google , while cutting an exclusive deal with Bing to be found only in Microsoft ’s search index .
Of course , Google would n’t take that lying down , and would likely make its own exclusive deals , leading to a showdown that would make the browser wars of the 90s seem tame .
I ’m not saying that News Corp and other mainstream media publications would adopt Jason ’s suggested strategy , or that it would work if they did , but it is becoming clear to me that we are heading into a bloody period of competition that could be extremely unfriendly to the interoperable web as we know it today .
If you ’ve followed my thinking about Web 2.0 from the beginning , you know that I believe we are engaged in a long term project to build an internet operating system .
( Check out the program for the first O’Reilly Emerging Technology Conference in 2002 ( pdf ) . )
In my talks over the years , I ’ve argued that there are two models of operating system , which I have characterized as “ One Ring to Rule Them All ” and “ Small Pieces Loosely Joined , ” with the latter represented by a routing map of the Internet .
The first is the winner - takes - all world that we saw with Microsoft Windows on the PC , a world that promises simplicity and ease of use , but ends up diminishing user and developer choice as the operating system provider .
The second is an operating system that works like the Internet itself , like the web , and like open source operating systems like Linux : a world that is admittedly less polished , less controlled , but one that is profoundly generative of new innovations because anyone can bring new ideas to the market without having to ask permission of anyone .
I ’ve outlined a few of the ways that big players like Facebook , Apple , and News Corp are potentially breaking the “ small pieces loosely joined ” model of the Internet .
But perhaps most threatening of all are the natural monopolies created by Web 2.0 network effects .
One of the points I ’ve made repeatedly about Web 2.0 is that it is the design of systems that get better the more people use them , and that over time , such systems have a natural tendency towards monopoly .
And so we ’ve grown used to a world with one dominant search engine , one dominant online encyclopedia , one dominant online retailer , one dominant auction site , one dominant online classified site , and we ’ve been readying ourselves for one dominant social network .
But what happens when a company with one of these natural monopolies uses it to gain dominance in other , adjacent areas ?
I ’ve been watching with a mixture of admiration and alarm as Google has taken their dominance in search and used it to take control of other , adjacent data - driven applications .
I noted this first with speech recognition , but it ’s had the biggest business impact so far in location - based services .
A few weeks ago , Google offered free turn - by - turn directions for Android phones .
This is awesome news for consumers , who previously could get this only in dedicated GPS devices or with high - priced iPhone apps .
But it ’s also a sign just how competitive the web is getting , and just how powerful Google is getting , because they understand that “ data is the Intel Inside ” of the next generation of computer applications .
Nokia paid $ 8 billion for NavTeq , the leading provider of such turn - by - turn directions .
GPS - maker TomTom paid $ 3.7 billion for TeleAtlas , the # 2 provider in the market .
Google quietly built an equivalent service , and is now giving it away for free — but only to their own business partners .
Everyone else still has to pay high fees to NavTeq and TeleAtlas .
What ’s more , Google upped the ante by adding in such features as Street View .
Most interestingly , this move sets the stage for the future competition between Google and Apple .
( Bill Gurley ’s analysis is an essential read . )
Apple controls access to the dominant device of the mobile web ; Google controls access to one of the most important mobile applications , and so far , is making it available for free only on Android .
Google ’s prowess is not just in search , but in mapping , speech recognition , automated translation , and other applications driven by huge , intelligent databases that only a few providers can offer .
Microsoft and Nokia control comparable assets , but they too are Apple competitors , and unlike Google , their business model depends on selling access to those assets , not giving them away for free .
It could be that everyone will figure out how to play nicely with each other , and we ’ll see a continuation of the interoperable web model we ’ve enjoyed for the past two decades .
But I ’m betting that things are going to get ugly .
We ’re heading into a war for control of the web .
And in the end , it ’s more than that , it ’s a war against the web as an interoperable platform .
Instead , we ’re facing the prospect of Facebook as the platform , Apple as the platform , Google as the platform , Amazon as the platform , where big companies slug it out until one is king of the hill .
And it ’s time for developers to take a stand .
If you do n’t want a repeat of the PC era , place your bets now on open systems .
Do n’t wait till it ’s too late .
P.S. One prediction : Microsoft will emerge as a champion of the open web platform , supporting interoperable web services from many independent players , much as IBM emerged as the leading enterprise backer of Linux .
I ’ll be speaking on this topic in my keynote at the Web 2.0 Expo in New York on Tuesday .
I ’ll look forward to seeing many of you there .

THERE is widespread disappointment with economists now because we did not forecast or prevent the financial crisis of 2008 .
The Economist 's articles of July 18th on the state of economics were an interesting attempt to take stock of two fields , macroeconomics and financial economics , but both pieces were dominated by the views of people who have seized on the crisis as an opportunity to restate criticisms they had voiced long before 2008 .
Macroeconomists in particular were caricatured as a lost generation educated in the use of valueless , even harmful , mathematical models , an education that made them incapable of conducting sensible economic policy .
I think this caricature is nonsense and of no value in thinking about the larger questions :
What can the public reasonably expect of specialists in these areas , and how well has it been served by them in the current crisis ?
One thing we are not going to have , now or ever , is a set of models that forecasts sudden falls in the value of financial assets , like the declines that followed the failure of Lehman Brothers in September .
This is nothing new .
It has been known for more than 40 years and is one of the main implications of Eugene Fama 's “ efficient - market hypothesis ” ( EMH ) , which states that the price of a financial asset reflects all relevant , generally available information .
If an economist had a formula that could reliably forecast crises a week in advance , say , then that formula would become part of generally available information and prices would fall a week earlier .
( The term “ efficient ” as used here means that individuals use information in their own private interest .
It has nothing to do with socially desirable pricing ; people often confuse the two . )
Mr Fama arrived at the EMH through some simple theoretical examples .
This simplicity was criticised in The Economist 's briefing , as though the EMH applied only to these hypothetical cases .
But Mr Fama tested the predictions of the EMH on the behaviour of actual prices .
These tests could have come out either way , but they came out very favourably .
His empirical work was novel and carefully executed .
It has been thoroughly challenged by a flood of criticism which has served mainly to confirm the accuracy of the hypothesis .
Over the years exceptions and “ anomalies ” have been discovered ( even tiny departures are interesting if you are managing enough money ) but for the purposes of macroeconomic analysis and forecasting these departures are too small to matter .
The main lesson we should take away from the EMH for policymaking purposes is the futility of trying to deal with crises and recessions by finding central bankers and regulators who can identify and puncture bubbles .
If these people exist , we will not be able to afford them .
The Economist 's briefing also cited as an example of macroeconomic failure the “ reassuring ” simulations that Frederic Mishkin , then a governor of the Federal Reserve , presented in the summer of 2007 .
The charge is that the Fed 's FRB / US forecasting model failed to predict the events of September 2008 .
Yet the simulations were not presented as assurance that no crisis would occur , but as a forecast of what could be expected conditional on a crisis not occurring .
Until the Lehman failure the recession was pretty typical of the modest downturns of the post - war period .
There was a recession under way , led by the decline in housing construction .
Mr Mishkin 's forecast was a reasonable estimate of what would have followed if the housing decline had continued to be the only or the main factor involved in the economic downturn .
After the Lehman bankruptcy , too , models very like the one Mr Mishkin had used , combined with new information , gave what turned out to be very accurate estimates of the private - spending reductions that ensued over the next two quarters .
When Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the Fed , warned Hank Paulson , the then treasury secretary , of the economic danger facing America immediately after Lehman 's failure , he knew what he was talking about .
Mr Mishkin recognised the potential for a financial crisis in 2007 , of course .
Mr Bernanke certainly did as well .
But recommending pre-emptive monetary policies on the scale of the policies that were applied later on would have been like turning abruptly off the road because of the potential for someone suddenly to swerve head - on into your lane .
The best and only realistic thing you can do in this context is to keep your eyes open and hope for the best .
After Lehman collapsed and the potential for crisis had become a reality , the situation was completely altered .
The interest on Treasury bills was close to zero , and those who viewed interest - rate reductions as the only stimulus available to the Fed thought that monetary policy was now exhausted .
But Mr Bernanke immediately switched gears , began pumping cash into the banking system , and convinced the Treasury to do the same .
Commercial - bank reserves grew from $ 50 billion at the time of the Lehman failure to something like $ 800 billion by the end of the year .
The injection of Troubled Asset Relief Programme funds added more money to the financial system .
There is understandable controversy about many aspects of these actions but they had the great advantages of speed and reversibility .
My own view , as expressed elsewhere , is that these policies were central to relieving a fear - driven rush to liquidity and so alleviating ( if only partially ) the perceived need for consumers and businesses to reduce spending .
The recession is now under control and no responsible forecasters see anything remotely like the 1929 - 33 contraction in America on the horizon .
This outcome did not have to happen , but it did .
Not bad for a Dark Age
Both Mr Bernanke and Mr Mishkin are in the mainstream of what one critic cited in The Economist 's briefing calls a “ Dark Age of macroeconomics ” .
They are exponents and creative builders of dynamic models and have taught these “ spectacularly useless ” tools , directly and through textbooks that have become industry standards , to generations of students .
Over the past two years they ( and many other accomplished macroeconomists ) have been centrally involved in responding to the most difficult American economic crisis since the 1930s .
They have forecasted what can be forecast and formulated contingency plans ready for use when unforeseeable shocks occurred .
They and their colleagues have drawn on recently developed theoretical models when they judged them to have something to contribute .
They have drawn on the ideas and research of Keynes from the 1930s , of Friedman and Schwartz in the 1960s , and of many others .
I simply see no connection between the reality of the macroeconomics that these people represent and the caricature provided by the critics whose views dominated The Economist 's briefing .

THE CREDIT TRAP THE CREDIT TRAP Part 9 : Anger at bank overdraft fees gets hotter , bigger and louder Part 8 : As lenders clamp down , credit scores take a hit Part 7 : Courtesy overdraft fees hit credit union customers , too Part 6 : Banks ' ' courtesy ' loans at soaring rates irk consumers Part 5 : Checking accounts are targets as banks find ways to boost fees Part 4 : Sliding economy raises questions about credit scores More Controversial bank account fees , which have fattened banks ' bottom lines at the expense of vulnerable consumers , are rapidly becoming a black eye for the industry .
Under siege are the fees charged to consumers who spend more than they have in their accounts , whether by check , debit card or at the ATM .
Last week , four of the nation 's largest banks said they would scale back some of their overdraft policies .
Their efforts , while meaningful , have failed to appease lawmakers , including powerful Senate Banking Committee Chair Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , who is preparing legislation to crack down on what he calls a pattern of " abusive " practices .
At first glance , banks ' practices seem reasonable enough : Overdraw your account , and the bank will cover the transaction — for a fee .
The problem is , most banks do n't ask consumers if they want their transactions automatically paid .
In recent years , as banks realized how lucrative these fees can be , they 've made it easier for consumers to overdraw their accounts , to the tune of $ 36.7 billion in revenue last year , USA TODAY research has found .
Banks have done this by covering debit card transactions as small as $ 1 and charging a fee as high as $ 35 .
Some also charge fees before consumers overdraw by deducting a purchase when it 's made , instead of when it clears .
And they 've processed transactions from highest to lowest dollar amount — which empties consumers ' accounts quicker and triggers more overdrafts .
Ironically , the changes banks have made to their overdraft policies are only fueling calls to reform the entire industry .
Overdraft coverage can be less regulated and cost more than other high - cost ( and equally criticized ) options , including payday loans , in an estimated $ 70 billion short - term credit market .
On average , consumers will pay a fee of $ 26.68 every time they overdraw their account , according to data from Moebs Services , an economic research firm .
That means that if consumers overdraw by $ 100 , they 'd pay an annual percentage rate ( APR ) of 696 % , if the credit is paid back in two weeks , according to a USA TODAY analysis .
This compares with an APR of 450 % on a $ 100 payday loan with an average fee of $ 17.25 .
" When consumers ( overdraw ) recurrently , it is a credit product , and they 're paying eye - popping rates , " says Sheila Bair , Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chair , who is pushing for banks to get consumers ' permission before covering overdrafts , for a fee , and to disclose APRs .
Banks have long said that customers appreciate automatic overdraft coverage and that this service helps consumers avoid the embarrassment of a declined transaction .
But they 're now acknowledging these fees can push consumers into distress .
Starting next year , Chase wo n't pay debit card overdrafts and charge a fee without consumers ' consent .
Bank of America is reducing the maximum number of daily overdraft fees consumers could be hit with , from 10 to four , and letting customers opt out of this coverage .
" We 've seen that the overdraft fees have become a bigger problem for customers , " says Brian Moynihan , president of BofA 's consumer and small - business banking group .
Tam Tran , 36 , of Columbia , Md. , has paid BofA more than $ 5,000 in overdraft fees in the past year .
In 18 years with the bank , Tran says he 's never had problems managing his money .
But when his father went into the hospital , overdraft fees piled up for small - dollar debit card items .
He repeatedly asked the bank not to approve transactions he did n't have money for and to stop clearing them from high to low dollar amount , but BofA kept doing so .
The bank said it approved his transactions because he had been a " good customer , " he says .
Tran says the bank 's recent changes are " just a little cork in a major hole . "
BofA has " set up a policy to capitalize to the point that the rapid accumulation of fees prevents a customer from ever rebounding , " Tran says .
" Charging that many fees in a matter of months ... should be illegal . "
BofA says it has a " long history of helping customers manage their finances . "
After USA TODAY contacted BofA , it refunded Tran $ 1,260 .
Tran says he takes responsibility for his mistakes , but BofA needs to take responsibility for its " bad policies . "
' Trapped in debt '
Through the years , banks ' high overdraft fees have become marketing fodder for payday lenders .
On its website , Advance America , one of the nation 's largest payday lenders , says its loans — which carry a fee of $ 12.50 to $ 22 per $ 100 borrowed — can be cheaper than bank overdrafts .
This marketing , coming from an industry that has long been criticized itself for steep fees that could push consumers into unmanageable debt , speaks to the challenge banks have in repairing their image .
G. Michael Flores , founder of Bretton Woods consulting firm , says younger consumers with low to moderate income are the ones using both payday loans and bank overdraft coverage .
" We 've been saying it for a long time , that ( with ) virtually any comparison of the cost of what we do and the cost of a ( bank automatic overdraft ) , the payday product is much cheaper , " says Billy Webster , board chair of Advance America .
The smaller the overdraft , the higher the APR .
On a median debit card overdraft of $ 20 , in which the lender charges a fee of $ 27 , the APR translates to 3,520 % , if the credit is paid back in two weeks , says a 2008 FDIC report .
Payday loans , meanwhile , carry an APR of 391 % to 449 % , assuming a $ 15 to $ 17.25 fee per $ 100 borrowed .
Yet , payday loans can cost more than overdraft fees on large - dollar transactions .
For instance , if a consumer overdraws by $ 200 , they 'd pay the same $ 27 fee ( a 348 % APR ) , but if they borrowed the same amount from a payday lender , they'd have to pay an average $ 34.50 fee ( a 450 % APR ) , Moebs Services says .
Michael Moebs , the founder of Moebs Services , cautions that " at the low end of any loan amount , we 're going to see very high APRs . "
He also points out that payday loans and overdraft coverage can cost less than the alternative .
Average bounced - check fees charged by the merchant and bank total $ 53.62 , he says .
Richard Hunt , president of the Consumer Bankers Association , says payday loans and overdrafts are a " day and night comparison . "
The first may cater to less creditworthy consumers , he says , while the other is a " service " to those who make a mistake .
Research released in 2007 by Marc Fusaro , then an assistant economics professor at East Carolina University in Greenville , N.C. , finds that 79 % of consumers who overdraw bank accounts do so by mistake .
The other 21 % are overdrawing because they need credit .
Advocates say consumers who need short - term credit should consider borrowing from family or finding cheaper alternatives , such as a line of credit .
Those who use payday loans or overdraw risk getting mired in debt , they note .
" Both industries are completely dependent on borrowers trapped in debt to generate most of their revenue , " says Eric Halperin , director of the Center for Responsible Lending 's Washington office .
Many borrowers can't pay back the payday loan with a single paycheck , but lenders still debit their bank account for the total due , possibly triggering bounced checks or overdrafts , says Jean Ann Fox of the Consumer Federation of America .
The FDIC is working to find affordable alternatives to payday loans and overdrafts .
A small - dollar loan program launched in 2008 has shown that " banks can provide lower - cost loans in a way that is profitable and more responsible , " Bair says .
The problem is that banks may be reluctant to " cannibalize " on their overdraft fee income with lower - cost loans , Bair wrote in a 2005 report when she taught at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst .
Probity Financial Services of Austin is offering an alternative to high overdraft fees :
It 's partnering with a small bank to offer a checking account that , for a $ 19.95 monthly fee , allows consumers to overdraw by as much as $ 500 , but wo n't charge them a fee each time they do so .
Bank changes ' fall well short '
Fusaro 's research feeds a frenzied debate about whether overdraft coverage should be regulated as loans and subject to an APR , similar to what 's imposed on payday loans .
Even though banking regulators have acknowledged that overdraft coverage is a form of credit , Fusaro believes it would be " misguided " to regulate them as loans .
Nevertheless , consumer advocates are clamoring for tighter restrictions on payday loans and overdrafts , such as a 36 % interest rate cap .
They also want banks to disclose APRs on overdraft products so consumers can compare their options .
Halperin says that banks ' recent changes to their overdraft policies , while an improvement , " fall well short of providing full protection for consumers . "
Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D - N.Y. , sponsored a bill she believes will give all bank customers " strong and consistent protections from deceptive overdraft policies . "
It would require banks to get consumers ' permission to pay an overdraft , and charge a fee , and clear transactions in chronological order .
The Federal Reserve , which has been criticized for not curtailing banks ' lending practices during the boom , is also under pressure to crack down on industry overdraft practices .
The Fed has said it plans to issue a rule by the end of the year .
If the Obama administration has its way , though , it would reform lending through the creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency , which would have the power to regulate credit products such as overdraft coverage and payday loans .
This agency is needed , says Elizabeth Warren , a Harvard law professor , because with financial products , " where it 's possible to change the agreements by including an extra piece of paper stuffed in a bill , the industry will constantly reshape the terms . "
" When Congress outlaws one practice , the industry just moves to a practice that accomplishes the same thing , " adds Warren , who chairs the Congressional Oversight Panel , created by Congress last year to study how financial institutions ' actions affect the economy .
" It 's like hammering fence posts in an open field : It 's easy to get around them . "
Banks have already found ways to minimize the impact of credit card reform passed earlier this year by Congress .
Even before the ink was dry on the law , banks raised rates for a broad spectrum of new and existing credit card borrowers .
In the first two quarters of 2009 , the lowest advertised credit card rates rose by 20 % , even as banks ' funding costs declined , Pew Charitable Trusts says .
Tran feels it 's not enough for banks to do " damage control " by changing some overdraft policies .
Regulators , he says , have to address a systemic problem where banks will charge unsuspecting consumers as many overdraft fees as possible .
Banks , he says , have " gone too far . "

The following is a brief breakdown of the 3 available plans .
The organizers of the 12th Annual Independent Games Festival -- the longest - running and largest festival relating to independent games worldwide -- are proud to announce record entry numbers for IGF 2010 's Main Competition , for which entries closed last night .
This year 's Main Competition -- just one of the three IGF competitions taking place this year -- amassed 306 game entries , many of them new titles from leading indie developers .
Information , screenshots and videos on each of the IGF Main Competition entries are now available on IGF.com .
This total entry tally comprises 35 % more games than last year 's record 226 Main Competition entries , itself a 30 % increase on the previous year -- showing the continuing popularity of independent games and the IGF .
This year 's IGF entries will be checked and distributed to the more than 150 notable industry judges for evaluation , before finalists are announced in January 2010 and winners awarded at the IGF ceremony during Game Developers Conference 2010 -- run by Think Services , as is Gamasutra -- in San Francisco next March .
IGF 2010 organizers are reminding that games are due for submission in the free to enter Student Showcase category by November 15th , 2009 , and entries to the IGF Mobile competition -- encompassing iPhone , mobile phone , PSP , DS , Android and other handheld games -- are due by December 1st , 2009 .
We ’ve reached a very strange point in human history when it is assumed that people who do n’t have access to food will have working cell phones :
In a test project targeting 1,000 Iraqi refugee families , the United Nations agency will send a 22 - dollar ( 15 - euro ) voucher every two months by SMS to each family , who will be provided with a special SIM card .
The beneficiary can then exchange the electronic voucher for rice , wheat flour , lentils , chickpeas , oil , canned fish , cheese and eggs at selected shops .
Addressing concerns about mobile phone ownership among the refugee population , WFP spokeswoman Emilia Casella said all the 130,000 Iraqi refugees currently receiving food aid from the agency in Syria have mobile phones .
In the annals of obscure accomplishments , even this is out there .
More than 1,000 people in gorilla suits crammed streets and bike paths in LoDo Saturday morning , setting a Guiness World Record for the most people dressed as gorillas in one location .
The 1,061 simulated simians were participating in the 6th annual Denver Gorilla Run , a 3.5 - mile charity run / walk to help mountain gorilla conservation .
The event is organized by the Denver - based Mountain Gorilla Conservation Fund , which seeks to continue the work of slain gorilla researcher and conservationist Dian Fossey .
The fund is in the midst of a drive to raise money for an expansion of a veterinary training facility in Uganda , in order to teach locals how to provide necessary veterinary care to mountain gorillas in their country .
Saturday ’s run cost $ 99.95 for first - time participants to sign up — but came with a gorilla suit that runners got to keep .
It followed a course through LoDo that began and ended at the Wynkoop Brewing Co .
The fastest runner finished in 22 minutes , according to race organizers .
The most common complaint against David Cameron is unfair and untrue .
Critics keep charging that he has no policies – but in truth , now he has dropped his early attempt at kum - bay - ya Conservatism , Cameron is offering a fairly detailed prospectus .
Unfortunately , it is of policies that will harm Britain .
There is a laboratory where these Tory policies are being played out now .
It is called London .
Boris Johnson said he was a " progressive conservative " who would " help the poor " and " green the city " .
One of his first acts in power was to lay off half the people in London government working on lowering the city 's carbon emissions , and to kick plans to limit pollution levels into the long grass .
One year in , it is clear he has delivered handsomely – for the rich .
He has given them a de facto tax cut by abolishing the extension of the congestion zone to well - heeled west London , and by abandoning the £ 25 - a - day charge for SUV drivers .
He has paid for it by pushing up costs for the poorest people in London , ramming up bus fares by 20 per cent .
He has opposed all new regulation on the City of London , and still praises sub - prime mortgages – the cause of the Great Crash of 2008 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Under the Conservative council of Hammersmith and Fulham – named by Cameron as a model for how he will rule – things have gone further .
It has paid for tax cuts by shutting down 12 homeless hostels , increasing the cost of meals on wheels for poor pensioners by 60 percent , and suddenly charging disabled people who need home help £ 12.40 an hour .
The council 's leader , Stephen Greenhalgh , says he wants to abolish council housing and let rents rise to market levels .
He argues that council estates today are " barracks for the poor " and complains their residents are " hard to get rid of " .
A recent meeting of Tory policymakers – including Cameron 's housing adviser Owen Inskip – dismissed council housing as a " dead end " and mooted charging market rents .
Prices for the poorest people in London would soar to between £ 150 and £ 650 , stripping many of a secure roof over their heads .
Yes , New Labour has often been dire – but the people who say nothing could be worse are learning the hard way that it ai n't so .
Poring through Cameron 's policy documents , I could find only one instance where there would be a clear improvement : he would not build a new terminal at Heathrow .
He deserves credit for that .
But otherwise , his announcements casually write off British lives .
For example , he says he will not erect any more speed cameras , no matter how bad a car crash hot - spot becomes .
When it is pointed out that they cut deaths by 40 per cent and currently save 900 lives a year , he keeps his eye on the speedophile vote and refuses to budge .
Cameron will oversee a huge rise in religious fundamentalist schools .
His policy is to allow any group of parents who want to establish a school to be given public money .
In every country where this has been tried , the groups organised enough to snaffle the cash are extreme religious followers who want to " protect " their children from secular values .
Secular campaigners are staring at Tory plans in a new kind of disbelief .
Of course , the most consequential policies so far cover the economy , where Cameron is promoting a fringe philosophy rejected by every other elected government .
Most economists believe that when private spending collapses , the Government has to fill the gap in demand by borrowing and spending – or a recession turns into a depression .
Yet Cameron says governments must cut spending to pay down the debt , however bad the economic weather .
The country that has steered out of the recession fastest – China – did precisely the opposite .
It ramped up state spending to 88 per cent of GDP growth .
Even Angela Merkel , who used to share Cameron 's analysis , was so struck by this she now plans a large debt - funded stimulus .
Professor David Blanchflower – one of the most distinguished economists in Britain – says Cameron 's policies mean another million people will lose their jobs .
" It could send the economy crashing into a ten - year depression , " he warns .
It is hard to escape the conclusion that Cameron and George Osborne can adopt policies that are so harmful towards ordinary people and the poor because they have never really known any .
Barely a week passes without Osborne making a slip showing he is surreally out of touch .
He recently claimed his inheritance tax cut on properties worth £ 1 m would be enjoyed by people living in ex-council houses .
He then said his £ 20,000 a year private school , St Paul's , is " incredibly liberal " because " your mother could be the head of a giant corporation , or a solicitor in Kew . "
If you think council houses are worth a million quid and solicitors in Kew are the lowest rung on the social ladder you can imagine , how does it affect your policies ?
Of course you can blithely advocate increasing the retirement age to 66 : I doubt he even knows that in the place where I was born , Glasgow , most men are dead years before they reach that age .
This Cameroon - cocoon is best captured by the soon - to - be Tory MP , Jacob Rees - Mogg , who at the age of forty is accompanied at public events by his nanny , who he calls " Nanny . "
He recently snapped : " If I 've got a nanny , I 've got a nanny .
And if anybody does n't like it – tough ! "
He then added : " I do wish you would n't keep going on about my nanny .
If I had a valet you 'd think it was perfectly normal . "
In the midst of all this , Cameron 's policy documents show he will try to change Britain 's political landscape to make it harder for the Tories to be defeated .
He will abolish 10 per cent of parliamentary seats , almost all in Labour areas .
He will scrap the rules requiring commercial broadcasters to be politically impartial , unleashing the rabid Fox News model against the British left .
And he will threaten to outlaw trade union funding for Labour .
So let 's be fair to him : David Cameron has policies .
Lots of them .
They suggest a sound - bite for the new election : Vote blue , and we 'll all be singing the blues .

Leila Safadi runs the Golan - based Banias website .
She lives in Majdel Shams , the biggest of five villages on the Golan Heights .
Twelve years ago , she left her hometown of Shehba , in south Syria , to join her husband across the border .
Many women come across the border to marry into a Golanaise family .
Often , the parents are related .
Those who are originally from the Golan Heights but live in Syria , often encourage their offspring to marry into a family still living in the now occupied territory .
In the past , a couple would get to know each other by exchanging photos .
Now , futures spouses tend to meet a few times in Jordan before getting married .
I met my husband Samih in Damascus in 1998 .
He 'd obtained permission [ from the Israeli authorities ] to study dentistry at Damascus University .
We fell in love and decided to get married .
We were optimistic , because of the peace talks going on at the time ; we thought things would change .
But in reality , nothing did .
For me to be able to move to the Golan Heights we got help from the Red Cross International Committee ( ICRC ) and asked both the Syrian and Israeli authorities respectively for me to leave Syria and enter Israel .
When I got to the border , I was overcome by fear .
A part of you dies when you cross the border .
You wave goodbye to your country , your family and your friends .
Two years ago my father died .
I asked for permission to go to the funeral but the Israeli authorities refused .
For three days , I staged a sit-in on the border crossing with my two children .
They finally gave me an 18 - hour visitor 's pass .
It had been ten years that I had n't seen my family .
MEXICO DF ( Reuters ) - La mexicana FEMSA ha mantenido conversaciones con dos grandes compañías rivales para la posible fusión de sus operaciones cerveceras , en una negociación que podría ascender a unos 9,000 millones de dólares , dijo el jueves el Wall Street Journal .
Las posibles compañías involucradas en la operación podrían incluir a SABMiller Plc y Heineken , agregó el diario estadounidense .
Tras la noticia , las acciones de FEMSA ganaron un 12.5 por ciento en la bolsa mexicana a 57.80 pesos , mientras en Nueva York cerraron con un alza de 16.69 por ciento a 44.40 dólares .
Las acciones fueron suspendidas en la bolsa mexicana hasta que la compañía informe sobre las versiones de la fusión .
El diario citó a fuentes familiares con el asunto diciendo que FEMSA ha contratado a la firma NM Rothschild & Son Ltd y que las conversaciones se han puesto más formales y serias recientemente .
Un portavoz de FEMSA , que opera una división de cerveza que produce las populares marcas Sol , Tecate y Dos Equis , a KOF - la segunda mayor embotelladora del sistema Coca - Cola - , y a la cadena de tiendas Oxxo , rechazó hacer comentarios sobre la información .
“ No comentamos sobre rumores ” , dijo a Reuters Carolina Alvear , una portavoz de Femsa .
En mayo , José Antonio Fernández , presidente de FEMSA dijo que la compañía no descartaba hacer alguna adquisición este o el próximo año , ante la posibilidad de tomar ventaja por la recesión de la economía , pero declinó dar detalles .
Analistas siempre han considerado el negocio cervecero de FEMSA como una atractivo objetivo de compra dentro de la consolidación de la industria , al que la compañía podría sacarle más valor vendiendo , que el que le asigna el mercado a través de sus acciones .

Finanzbranche Regierung plant Milliardenprogramm gegen Kreditklemme
Schwarz - Gelb fürchtet um die Kreditvergabe durch Banken :
Um die Geldvergabe durch die Finanzbranche anzukurbeln , will die Regierung nach SPIEGEL - Informationen nun ein milliardenschweres Hilfspaket auf den Weg bringen .
We all always think that why the person of opposite gender always communicate differently .
Many times it is observed that opposite gender communicate differently and which results in conflicts between them .
Some of the common conflicts are :
1. Getting freedom
2 . To have control
3 . Taking investment decision
4. Cleanliness
5 . How to behave in social life
6 . How to bring up children
7 . Who is right
Some of these conflicts increase so such that it becomes reason for departing .
Thus , it is necessary to know why men and women think differently and then try to understand your partner ’s feelings .
Here are few reasons why men and women communicate differently :
1 . Men wants to know the fact and women are emotional connected : when it comes to take decision about any situation , they both think differently .
Men wants to know the facts and thinks practically before taking any decision where as women thinks in emotionally more rather getting too practical .
The reason is that men frequently use their intellect part of the brain and in women brain there is more neural activity going on while communicating .
2. Women can do multitasking :
It is always seen that women prefer to do multitasking like cooking food , talking on phone or cleaning home at same time .
This is because their brains are made to do multitask .
Whereas , men can do one task at a time because he feels to do it perfectly and try to concentrate on one thing at a time .
3 . Women like to talk on personal matters while men do n’t :
Women feel relaxed when they share their feelings with others , it might be their personal feelings also , it is not necessary that she want the solution but sometimes she share feeling just to make you listen .
Men never discuss their personal feelings or problems with others .
He feels that when time will come he will solve the problem and store that problem at back of his mind .
It does n’t mean that he do n’t trust others or love his partner , it ’s just that he keep his problem away , back in his mind .
Whatever may be the reason for different thinking of men and women , but it creates misunderstanding like : 1 . Men start getting frustrated by listening continuously to women 2 . Women start thinking that men do n’t care about her feelings and neglecting her .
However both men and women think differently but it is not tough to get along with each other , only some understanding and feelings are requires .
Do share with us that what more can be reason for different thinking of men and women .

Despite seven months of intense effort to recruit physicists to sign a politically motivated petition disputing anthropogenic climate change , a mere , 0.45 % of the American Physical Society ‘s 47,000 members signed on .
It ’s a humiliating defeat for the climate change Deniers who make such false claims as ” many scientists dispute ’ and ‘ there is no consensus .
The Petition drive was announced in the prestigous journal Nature , APS publications , numerous popular and electronic media , as well as heavily promoted by the petition organizers .
Despite all of that effort and publicity , a mere 0.45 % was all that they could manage .
Consider that the success rate for Nigerian email scams is estimated to be 0.1 % to 0.2 % , ie roughly speaking about the same .
( Tip of the Hat to Grumbine for the genesis of seeking a comparison )
Of course the reason for that APS Council ’s rejection is unrelated to the number of the signatories , but rather was based the quality of the alleged “ science ” justifying the call .
The “ scientific ” claims are a sad cobbling together of the argumentum ad ignorantiam and appeal to authority logical fallacies , along with the unbelievably idiotic “ it ’s happened in the past ” argument .
As “ science ” it should embarrass a freshman .
Not that there was ever any risk that the APS would actually reverse it ’s stance ; they are scientists after all .
However the Deniers had hoped to demonstrate some meaningful level of grossly uninformed dissent within the APS , so the dismal showing is an embarrassment .
John Mashey has done an impressive ( 128 page ) analysis of the petitions signatories and the politics behind the petition which can be downloaded at DeSmogBlog .
Most significant is that of the signatories
– only one is / has ever been active in climate research
– all work ( ed ) in fields and specializations largely unrelated to climate science ( eg astrophysics , aerospace , defense , nuclear )
The effort was instigated by a core group dominated by members involved with four industry funded groups that pose as “ think tanks ” , but in reality are little better than Public Relations firms .
This is consistent with the pattern of climate change Denial being driven by a tiny handful of lobbyists and consultants ( here and here ) working through a network of phony think tanks and astro-turf “ citizens groups . ”
In this case the key relationships seem to have been to :
Science and Environmental Policy Project ( here , here , and here ) George C. Marshall Institute ( here , here , and here ) Heartland Institute ( here , here , here , and here ) CATO Institute ( here , here , and here )
As APSmith observed ( reported at Get Energy Smart Now !!! ) , they have been involved in campaigns that claimed :
that ozone depletion is nothing to worry about that smoking does n’t cause cancer that second - hand smoke is nothing to worry about anyway and now that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is nothing to worry about .
This petition seems to be just another in a long series of phony petitions which the core group has a “ a long history of manufacturing … ” ( here and here ) .
As Mashey documents , it ’s nothing more than another industry attempt to bypass science and influence policy politically .
In a rather sad attempt to spin the story , Chair of the Exxon funded G.C. Marshall Institute William Happer said “ They basically sent both statements back to their committee on public affairs and asked them to reconsider , I think it ’s a big victory for us . ”
Ever a bastion of scientific ignorance , Lubos Motl frames the defeat as “ APS fat cats stick to the sinking AGW bandwagon ” and even has a message for the APS , literally “ and tell them , fuck you . ”
A great example of the cogent , fact based scientific arguments we know so well from the Denialosphere .
Despite Lubos ’ delusions of APS political correctness , the truth is that [ emphasis added ] :
“ What this means is that the APS , which is the preeminent society of physicists in the US , and which tends to be extremely conservative in its policy and statements , continues to support the prevailing consensus of AGW model based on the scientifically available studies and results . ”
Physics and Physicists
Nonetheless we can expect that there will continue to be more attempts by this cabal of industry consultants and lobbyists to try and create the impression that “ the debate is not over . ”

Deciding what to do once you ’ve purchased a domain but have n’t yet launched the website is always a bit of a conundrum .
Leaving up your domain registrar or Web host ’s generic page seems unprofessional , especially if you ’re trying to drum up advance press for your new project .
At the same time , you do n’t want to spend too much time on a temporary page when you really should be working on the website itself .
Deciding what to do once you ’ve purchased a domain but have n’t yet launched the website is always a bit of a conundrum .
Leaving up your domain registrar or Web host ’s generic page seems unprofessional , especially if you ’re trying to drum up advance press for your new project .
At the same time , you do n’t want to spend too much time on a temporary page when you really should be working on the website itself .
The best thing to do is create a simple “ Coming soon ” page to notify visitors of what will eventually be there .
Good “ Coming soon ” pages come in two basic varieties : the informational design , which simply tells visitors what will be there after launch ; and the page that invites early visitors to sign up for updates or even to request a beta ( or alpha ) invitation .
Below are some great examples of each , followed by some best practices for creating your own “ Coming soon ” page .
You definitely wo n’t see among these the generic “ Under construction ” page ( with the cute construction graphic ) that used to litter the Web .

1. Tips On Designing A Good “ Coming Soon ” Page
Here are some best practices and tips to keep in mind when designing your own “ Coming soon ” pages , as well as examples .
Tell Us What to Expect
When someone lands on your “ Coming soon ” page , they should get an idea of what your website will be about and why it might be useful to them .
This is especially important if you ’re asking visitors to sign up for updates or to check back regularly .
If we ca n’t tell what the website is for , why would we bother coming back ?
Give us at least some indication of the website ’s purpose .
This does n’t mean you have to spell out everything the website will offer ; rather , hint that it ’s something we might be interested in .
For example , if you will be offering a time management app specifically for Web designers , you might say that the website will help streamline the workflow of Web designers .
It gives a taste of what the website will do , while maintaining some mystery .
Design a Successful Coming soon
Page is an article from SitePoint that covers some essentials of a good “ Coming soon ” page and includes some great examples .
KISSmetrics provides a ton of information on its “ Coming soon ” page , including a form to sign up for updates and a blog to keep abreast of new developments .
It ’s a great example of a “ Coming soon ” page that keeps visitors informed and gets them excited about the pending launch .
Birdboxx gives a basic explanation of the services it will provide when the website launches .
Anipals gives plenty of information on the website ’s features without giving away too much .
This “ Coming soon ” page explains what the new page will be about , when it will be released and also allows its visitors to sign up for the future updates .
Letting visitors sign up by email to be notified on the website ’s launch can be a useful marketing tool .
If you do n’t offer this feature , by the time your website does launch , those visitors may have forgotten about you .
Of course , how often you send out an update is entirely up to you .
Some websites send out an announcement only when the website has actually launched .
Others send out regular updates on the progress of website ’s development .
If you ’re trying to build advance buzz around your website ’s launch ( which , in all likelihood , you are ) , then sending updates on a semi- regular basis could go a long way to building your website ’s credibility and name recognition .
If you send an update every week or two , your prospects likely wo n’t forget about you .
Just indicate on the sign - up page that updates will be sent that often , to avoid being labeled a spammer .
You have a couple of alternatives to the standard email sign - up form , though .
One is to run a blog that keeps visitors updated on your progress .
This is most commonly done for Web apps , with the blog offering regular updates on development .
Another common method is to use a Twitter account to keep prospective users updated .
Just make sure that the link on your page to your Twitter account is prominent .
MyNiteLife lets visitors sign up for updates via email .
DesignSvn gives visitors the option to sign up for updates via email or to follow it on Twitter .
Remindness lets visitors sign up for email updates .
Brand Your “ Coming Soon ” Page
If you already have a logo , a basic design or color scheme and font picked out , include them on your landing page to start building the brand in your visitors ’ minds .
Advance branding sets your website apart from your competitors and generally does n’t cost any more to implement or take additional time .
Even something as simple as using your website ’s eventual font or color scheme can make you much more recognizable to future visitors .
When your website finally does launch , it will have an air of familiarity to your visitors .
Fontdeck includes its logo and what will presumably be the website ’s color scheme on its “ Coming soon ” page .
Silverback used the gorilla cartoon and basic design theme of its website on this “ Coming soon ” page .
Foundation
Six uses what will presumably end up as its logo and color scheme .
Create Some Intrigue
The point of your “ Coming soon ” page is to get people to talk about , and come back to , your website .
Even if you want to give some information on what the website will be about , creating some mystery around the launch is helpful .
Curiosity is a great motivator and may get more people to sign up for updates .
It also gets people talking , because visitors will ask their friends if they have any new information about the pending launch .
Advance buzz can bolster your launch traffic and even attract media attention .
Better Blogger gives us a basic idea of what its web site will be about without giving away too much .
Good Morning gives away virtually no information about what the app might do , but the name suggests that it might be related to time management or productivity .
uoOo seems to be somehow related to video , but it does n’t give us any more information than that .
Remember SEO
While a “ Coming soon ” page wo n’t likely make a big difference in your search engine ranking , that ’s no reason not to optimize it for search engines .
Use keywords and proper meta tags , and encourage those linking to your website to use good anchor text .
And if you use good SEO practices to begin with , you wo n’t be penalized by search engines ( and might even gain some decent credibility among search engines ) , meaning that when your website does launch , its search engine ranking will climb that much faster .

US - occupied Iraq , Afghanistan among world ’s most corrupt countries
By Bill Van Auken
18 November 2009
US - occupied Afghanistan is the world ’s second most corrupt country — after Somalia , where no government has functioned for two decades — while Iraq is the fourth worst , according to a report released by an international watchdog group .
The annual report conducted by the Berlin - based organization Transparency International ranks countries according a Corruption Perceptions Index , which is based on a survey of business and government experts .
A score of 10 represents minimum public sector corruption , and zero the maximum .
New Zealand , ranked the least corrupt country , scoring 9.4 , while Somalia ranked the worst , scoring 1.1 .
“ Fragile , unstable states that are scarred by war and ongoing conflict linger at the bottom of the index , ” the organization stated in its report .
“ These are : Somalia , with a score of 1.1 , Afghanistan at 1.3 , Myanmar at 1.4 and Sudan tied with Iraq at 1.5 .
These results demonstrate that countries which are perceived as the most corrupt are also those plagued by long - standing conflicts , which have torn apart their governance infrastructure . ”
Afghanistan received a worse rating this year than last , falling from 176th place to 179th .
The report stated in relation to Afghanistan that “ Examples of corruption range from public posts for sale and justice for a price to daily bribing for basic services . ”
It continued , “ This , along with the exploding opium trade — which is also linked to corruption — contributes to the downward trend in the country ’s CPI score . ”
The findings corroborated those issued by numerous other groups .
Integrity Watch Afghanistan , for example , estimated that the average Afghan household is compelled to pay $ 100 in bribes to police and officials every year — an immense burden in a country where 70 percent of the population lives on $ 1 a day or less .
The group estimated that as much as $ 250 million is paid in bribes each year , a sum equal to the country ’s entire 2006 national development budget .
In relation to Iraq , the report found rampant corruption as well , with corrupt government officials operating with impunity .
It cited a recent study by the Bertelsmann Foundation stating that in Iraq “ non-security institutions remain weak and debilitated .
The Iraqi leadership faces many structural constraints on governance , such as a massive brain drain , a high level of political division , and extreme poverty . ”
The release of the report will provide further grist for the mill in Washington ’s public pressure campaign on Afghanistan ’s President Hamid Karzai — who is to be inaugurated this Thursday for a second term based on an openly rigged election .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Sunday demanded that Karzai crack down on a culture of “ impunity for those who are corrupt , ” and threatened to cut off non-military aid if he does not .
She proposed that the Afghan regime form an anti-corruption task force to do the job .
Just a day later , the regime ’s interior minister announced the creation of just such a task force at a press conference where he appeared together with the US and British ambassadors .
There is a strong element of farce in such gestures .
This is the third such task force that the Karzai government has created over the past five years .
The first one had to be disbanded after it was learned that its chief had been convicted on drug charges and imprisoned in the US .
A second such commission was created last year , to little or no effect .
The report ’s assessment of corruption in Afghanistan and Iraq is no doubt accurate .
It ignores , however , the essential fact that both countries have been subjected to protracted US military occupation — Afghanistan for eight years and Iraq for six and a half .
With Washington exercising immense power in both countries , it seems logical that it would join them at the bottom of the list .
Transparency International , however , ranked the US at 19 , roughly equivalent with the ranking given to Japan .
The organization seems also to have turned a blind eye to the intimate complicity of the US government in the massive and catastrophic fraud carried out on Wall Street .
There is an undeniable connection between the blatant corruption of the Afghan and Iraqi officials and the corrupt character of the entire US project in both Afghanistan and Iraq from the outset .
In both cases , wars were launched based upon lies — the claims that the mission in Afghanistan was to hunt down Osama bin Laden , and in Iraq to eliminate weapons of mass destruction .
The real motive behind the invasion of both countries was the pursuit of the geo-strategic interests of US imperialism in the world ’s two greatest energy producing regions .
Alongside this essential goal , US corporations pursued their own interests through war profiteering .
Among the most well known examples is KBR , the subsidiary of Halliburton , the corporation formerly headed by Vice President Dick Cheney .
KBR has reaped more than $ 31 billion for contracting services in building and maintaining bases for the US military occupation in Iraq .
Even after Pentagon probes have uncovered massive overcharges , waste and negligence , the company saw its multi-billion - dollar contract renewed in 2008 .
On Monday , the company that serves as the main food supplier for the US troops in Iraq , Public Warehousing Company , was indicted for carrying out tens of millions of dollars in overcharges and other fraud in the multi-billion - dollar contracts that it signed with the Pentagon .
In Afghanistan , the US has appropriated more than $ 39 billion in non-military aid since 2001 , even as conditions of life for the country ’s impoverished people have further deteriorated .
According to a recent study made at the request of the Afghan regime ’s ministry of finance on the impact of international aid , three quarters of all US non-military aid is funneled through international contactors .
The study found that while aid provided directly to the Afghan government saw approximately 85 percent of the money used directly in local projects , with funds channeled through international contractors and NGOs , the rate was just 20 percent .
Such figures have convinced the Afghan population that the US government is every bit as corrupt as its puppet regime in Kabul and is complicit in the graft of Karzai ’s ministers and local officials .
It is estimated that as much of 54 percent of the $ 39 billion in aid money for Afghanistan has gone to international security contractors and to pay for other means of protecting US assets and personnel .
Private security contractors outnumber US troops today in Afghanistan .
The amount of money being siphoned off by US corporations and contractors makes the graft that has enriched Afghan officials pale by comparison .
Washington ’s demand that Karzai crack down on corruption is as hypocritical as it is futile .
Those most implicated in corruption — including Karzai ’s brother Ahmed Wali Karzai , a leading official in Kandahar province , who has been described by US officials as a heroin trafficker — are among the closest collaborators of the US occupation and the CIA .
Washington ’s demand for a crackdown on Afghan corruption is aimed , on the one hand , at placating American public opinion , which is heavily opposed to the Obama administration ’s deployment of more troops in Afghanistan .
On the other , it may yet serve as the pretext for putting an end to Karzai ’s presidency and the shapi ng of a regime even more tightly under the control of the US embassy and the American military .

Meat wastes water , creates greenhouse gases and could become as socially unacceptable as drink - driving
Vegetarian diet is better for the planet , says Lord Stern
Eating meat could become as socially unacceptable as drink - driving because of the impact it has on global warming , according to a senior authority on climate change .
Lord Stern of Brentford , former adviser to the government on the economics of climate change , said people will have to consider turning vegetarian to help reduce global carbon emissions .
" Meat is a wasteful use of water and creates a lot of greenhouse gases .
It puts enormous pressure on the world 's resources .
A vegetarian diet is better , " Stern said .
Farmed ruminant animals , including cattle and sheep , are thought to be responsible for up to a quarter of " man-made " methane emissions worldwide .
Stern , whose 2006 Stern Review warned that countries needed to spend 1 % of their GDP to stop greenhouse gases rising to dangerous levels , said a successful deal at the climate change conference in Copenhagen in December would massively increase the cost of producing meat .
People 's concerns about climate change would lead to meat eating becoming unacceptable , he predicted .
" I think it 's important that people think about what they are doing and that includes what they are eating , " he told the Times .
" I am 61 now and attitudes towards drinking and driving have changed radically since I was a student .
People change their notion of what is responsible .
They will increasingly ask about the carbon content of their food . "
Stern , a former chief economist at the World Bank and now IG Patel Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics , also warned that helping developing countries to cope with the adverse effects of global warming would cost British taxpayers about £ 3bn a year by 2015 .
Meanwhile , an international effort to ensure that biofuel used by Britain and other western countries to tackle global warming does not damage the environment is on the brink of collapse .
The Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil ( RSPO ) , an initiative of companies and campaigners , is divided over the need to control carbon emissions and could break up within days , insiders say .
Ministers last year introduced a demand on fuel suppliers to replace 2.5 % of petrol and diesel sold with biofuel , at least 8 % of which is currently palm oil .
The RSPO was established to set and enforce environmental standards for palm oil production , but has run into trouble after palm plantation companies in Indonesia and Malaysia blocked efforts to curb their greenhouse gas emissions .
" If this issue is not resolved and greenhouse gas emissions are not included in the standard , then I do n't see how the RSPO can continue to act as a certifying body , " said Marcus Silvius of environment group Wetlands International , who sits on the RSPO 's working group on greenhouse gases .
Haskell is beautiful in practice
I ’ve been writing a bit of Haskell lately ( see my GitHub page ) , and it ’s an absolutely beautiful experience .
And I mean that in every way :
The language itself of course , but also the community , the documentation , the package system and the Haskell platform ultimately help make the practice of writing Haskell more pleasing than any other I ’ve had any experience with .
I find that Haskell lets me translate so many ideas and abstractions naturally and without the fuzz of too much indirection .
My hope is to give you a small taste of what I ’m talking about .
Please note that this is going to contain some deliberate ( but mostly inconsequential ) inaccuracies and I will also leave out details here and there .
A lot of the code is also “ paraphrased ” to highlight the ideas behind it .
I recently wrote an implementation of BERT in Haskell ( github ) .
I had the need for an RPC mechanism , and it seemed to fit my requirements rather well .
“ BERTs ” are a subset of Erlang terms , which are composable and have a straightforward external representation ( albeit not as space efficient as something like Google ’s protocol buffers ) .
So I figured this might be a good starting point for demonstrating some of the substantial ways in which Haskell provides facilities to create programs that are not only succinct but also readable and robust .
At the same time , I hope to convince you that Haskell provides the kind of abstraction & encapsulation that is often much more natural than other approaches .
Types
We need to be able to represent BERT terms in Haskell .
Thus we introduce an algebraic type representing a Term ( github ) .
-- | A single BERT term .
data Term -- Simple ( erlang ) terms : = IntTerm Int | FloatTerm Float | AtomTerm String | TupleTerm [ Term ] | BytelistTerm ByteString | ListTerm [ Term ] | BinaryTerm ByteString | BigintTerm Integer | BigbigintTerm Integer
This is pretty straightforward to read : a Term can be either an IntTerm , a FloatTerm and so forth .
The right column specifies the data for the type .
The IntTerm carries an integer , etc .
An important detail here is that these are not different types : they are all type constructors for the type Term .
That is , these are different ways to create a Term type .
Algebraic types may also be recursively defined .
The ListTerm constructor represents a list of other Term s. Already with this simple declaration , we ’ve expressed most of the semantics of BERT terms .
We can now express composite BERT terms .
For example BERT defines dictionaries to be represented as {bert , dict , [ {key , value} ] .
In Haskell :
TupleTerm [ AtomTerm " bert " , AtomTerm " dict " , ListTerm [ TupleTerm [ AtomTerm " key " , AtomTerm " value " ] ] ]
Typeclasses
Term s encapsulate the BERT type representation , and we will write code that can encode Term values to a binary representation ( as per the BERT spec ) .
However , these values are not the most convenient to work with in other Haskell code .
Furthermore , many Term s have a natural “ more primitive ” Haskell type ( eg. IntTerm vs. Int , ListTerm vs. [ ] ) .
We would like to introduce Term s from these types and vice - versa .
The most primitive way to do this is via pattern matching ( this is ubiquitous in Haskell and other functional programming languages .
Also see my poor attempt at implementing pattern matching in Python ) .
listify ( ListTerm l ) = listify ' l listify ' [ ] = [ ] listify ' (( IntTerm x ) : xs ) = x : listify ' xs
This code introduces a list of integers ( [ Int ] ) from a ListTerm containing IntTerm s. Clearly going around creating little unpackers like this for everything is going to be quite cumbersome .
Haskell provides a very nice solution .
Typeclasses let you declare common traits to a set of types .
For example , I can define a typeclass that declares the ability to translate a value of that a given type into or out of a Term ( github ) .
class BERT a where -- | Introduce a ' Term ' from a Haskell value .
showBERT :: a -> Term -- | Introduce a Haskell value from a ' Term ' .
readBERT :: Term -> a
This introduces two new functions .
One to create a term from a Haskell value , and one to do the inverse .
So what kinds of types can introduce Haskell values from BERT or vice - versa ?
A few are quite simple .
The most trivial is for Term itself .
instance BERT
Term where showBERT = id readBERT = id
To convert a Term to a Term is just the id entity function .
We need to cover a few more primitive Haskell types .
The BERT definition for lists is :
instance ( BERT a ) =>
BERT [ a ] where showBERT xs = ListTerm ( map showBERT xs ) readBERT ( ListTerm xs ) = map readBERT xs readBERT _ = error " Invalid list type "
Unlike Haskell lists , BERT lists can be heterogeneous : they are lists of Term s which , being an algebraic type , may eventually contain different types of data .
Thus , to introduce a BERT list , we return a ListTerm that applies showBERT to every element in the list .
This also explains the typeclass restriction on a : we require that the list we are encoding contains a type that also has a typeclass instance of BERT .
Similarly , to decode a list , we call readBERT on each element , introducing a list with the decoded Haskell types .
But what about the other way ?
Certainly we could n’t introduce a Haskell list from a heterogeneous BERT list .
The code above looks deceiving in this way , but type inference is going on in the background here .
The type of readBERT is Term -> [ a ] .
This inference is propagated when we pass readBERT to map as well ; it ’s equivalent to the following code :
readBERT :: Term -> [ a ] readBERT ( ListTerm xs ) = map ( readBERT :: Term -> a ) xs
Note that you can also create your own typeclass instances that suits your needs .
For example if your application keeps some internal representation of some well defined value , you could create a typeclass instance to convert this representation to and from Term s .
Lazyness
The RPC specification for BERT provides a rather opaque notion of a transport .
The transport , in essence , is a channel through which you can send and receive BERT terms .
The terms are wrapped in a 4 - byte header specifying its length .
Haskell has a Handle type that is an opaque representation of a file - like object .
Sockets can also be fronted by handles .
A popular module , Data .
ByteString provides a lazy bytestring type that can be backed by a handle .
It ’s a type that looks like a bytestring , smells like a bytestring , and acts like a bytestring , except that when it needs more data , it requests it from the handle it ’s been constructed with .
Similarly , our binary term decoder reads from such bytestrings , so it does not take much imagination to produce a list that represents the infinite stream of packets coming from the BERT peer ( github ) .
packets :: ByteString -> [ Packet ] packets b | null b = [ ] | otherwise = p : packets b' where ( p , b' ) = parsePacket b
( In Haskell , : is the list constructor : it prepends an item to a list , eg. 1 : [ 2,3 ] == [ 1,2,3 ] . ) packets reads like a declaration : if our bytestring , b is null , it is the empty list , otherwise , it is the first parsed packet from b , plus the list of packets represented by the remainder of the string .
This works in Haskell because everything is evaluated lazily .
This in effect means that , unless you specify otherwise , values are not computed ( code is not evaluated ) until needed .
In practice , the Haskell runtime leaves a “ promise ” of a computation when the value is not needed immediately .
The list constructor : is no different : its arguments are not evaluated until needed .
In our example this means that the list defined by packets is lazily generated .
So if we create such a value with packet b , not until we examine the resulting list do we even begin parsing ( or generating the list , or reading from the socket ) .
This is an example by which we use lazyness to provide an abstraction .
It allows us to operate on the familiar list type while not being terribly concerned about how the list is being constructed .
It also relieves us of having to create any further abstraction : we can translate our model of a transport almost perfectly into a primitive Haskell concept without having to go about creating unfamiliar interfaces .
Monadic parsing
We created an algebraic type to represent terms , but their construction ( if you need to work with the term type ) can be a little cumbersome .
Our representation
TupleTerm [ AtomTerm " bert " , AtomTerm " dict " , ListTerm [ TupleTerm [ AtomTerm " key " , AtomTerm " value " ] ] ]
would be represented more succinctly in the erlang grammar as :
{ bert , dict , [ ( key , value ) ] }
If just writing code , you probably do n’t care too much about the difference : you typically do n’t make big static constructs , but rather create types programmatically anyway .
However , with the BERT implementation I wanted to have a command line tool that allowed for testing & inspection of results .
For example :
$ bert call localhost : 8181 mod proc " {1 , test , [ 5,6,7 ] } "
Luckily , Haskell provides an excellent facility for parsing : Parsec .
Parsec uses monadic actions to simultaneously lex & parse its input .
I wo n’t go into monads here , but for our purposes here it is essentially a means by which you can run code in a certain context , and manipulate that context .
It can provide a pure functional construct with which you can achieve the appearance of imperative programming .
In the context of Parsec , its monad maintains the parser state ( eg. where in the input are we , which rules have failed , which rules are yet to be tried , what is the output , etc. ) , and provides a set of functions that can operate within the context of the monad it provides .
Here ’s our parser for a term .
p_term :: Parser Term p_term = t <* spaces where t = IntTerm < $> p_num ( readSigned readDec ) < |> FloatTerm <$> p_num ( readSigned readFloat ) < |> AtomTerm < $> p_atom < |> TupleTerm <$> p_tuple < |> BytelistTerm .
C . pack < $> p_string < |> ListTerm < $> p_list < |> BinaryTerm .
B . pack < $> p_binary
Again , reading very naturally : a term is t possibly followed by some whitespace .
( a <* b means roughly “ run a , then b , but the value of the expression is the value of a ” ) .
t in turn can be either a p_num wrapped with an IntTerm , and so forth .
( In this context , < | > can very roughly be thought of as “ otherwise , try .. ” and < $> as “ wrap the results of the argument to the right with the thing on the left ” . )
The various p_* s are other parsers .
For example the one for tuples is
p_tuple = between ( char ' { ' >> spaces ) ( spaces >> char ' } ' ) $ p_term ` sepBy ` ( spaces >> char ' , ' >> spaces )
between is one of the Parsec functions that means : between the parses of the following arguments , try to parse the third .
The third argument states : “ try and parse a p_term that is separated by maybe some whitespace , a comma and maybe some more whitespace . ”
…
This is really just the tip of the ice berg .
Most of my descriptions , especially those regarding the use of monads belie the rigor and generality of these constructs .
If you ’d like to explore further , the Real World Haskell book is a great start point .
The Haskell community is simply fantastic .
Much conversation happens on IRC , where there is typically an armada of people just waiting to discuss the finer points of this wonderful language with you .
A subtle shift in power has recently taken place on the street in Jerusalem .
The confrontations during the past week between Palestinians and the Israeli police over perceived Israeli threats to the Dome of the Rock and al - Aqsa mosque bring home the growing role of the Israeli Islamic movement in the politics of the city .
As a result of the ineffectiveness of the secular and traditional Palestinian leadership , below the radar , Palestinians in the city are being mobilised by the northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel , led by the charismatic Sheikh Ra'ed Salah .
The emergence of this Islamic renaissance cuts across an opposite and equally problematic current in Israeli circles , creating an even more volatile situation in the city .
As a result of the protracted standoff between the Israeli and US governments over the exact nature of a settlement freeze , there has been a renewed determination and energy in activities by both government and Israeli settlers , which will consolidate the Israeli control over the city .
Most observers of developments in the city agree that the transformation of Israeli settlers from outriders of the radical right in Israel to mainstream politicians has been one of the most significant events in the city over the past decade .
Their funding by state institutions , and their penetration of government bodies such as the Israel Antiquities Authority ( with responsibility over excavations and renovations ) and the Israel Nature and Parks Authority , have provided them with a platform to act with impunity and renewed ambition .
One result of this mainstreaming is that even if there are divisions over the future of settlements in the West Bank , there is a much broader consensus in the Israeli public over holding on to Israeli gains in east Jerusalem .
The fractious Israeli coalition under prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu is able to exploit this trend to shore up its fragility .
There is a growing sense among Palestinians – Muslim and Christian alike – that Israel is about to pass beyond the point of no return in its polices in Jerusalem and that a line has to be drawn .
The undermining of the Islamic presence in the city through activities such as house and land acquisitions , excavations , reconstructions , the establishment of temporary exclusion zones and the neutralisation of former Palestinian allies in agencies such as Unesco , combined with the impact of the separation barrier and house demolitions , has heightened the pressure on Palestinian residents .
There is also an awareness that Palestinian Authority leadership based in Ramallah is unable to help them and that the Israeli government has successfully marginalised Hamas activists in the city .
Into this maelstrom Salah has stepped in like some deus ex machina with his " al - Aqsa is in danger " campaign and has become the pre-eminent Islamic defender of the contested site .
An initial convention in Umm al - Fahm has now evolved into an annual rally , drawing around 50,000 supporters and inspiring similar solidarity events across the Arab and Islamic world , from Lebanon to South Africa .
This is extended by subsidised trips to al - Aqsa for Palestinians in Israel , with more than 2 million visits to the site since 2001 .
Further campaigns under Ra'ad Salah 's leadership included renovation of the subterranean prayer halls in the south - east corner of the Haram al - Sharif compound in which al - Aqsa mosque lies .
Although Israeli permission for maintenance work at the halls had been granted to the Waqf authorities , the Islamic movement led the way in mobilising funds , supplying volunteers and helping to transform the site into one of the largest mosques in the world .
For Salah , the scheme greatly enhanced both the sheikh 's standing as an Israeli Palestinian leader and his position as a global Islamic figure .
In the words of a former PA adviser , " the Marwani halls were Salah 's gateway to Jerusalem " .
Less well - known in the west has been the Islamic movement 's involvement in the campaign against the plans of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre to build a Museum of Tolerance partially covering an ancient Muslim cemetery , Mamilla .
The Islamic movement once again led the way in mobilising street demonstrations and pursuing a legal injunction through the Israeli court system .
According to Salah , the very name , Museum of Tolerance , " illustrates their utter disdain .
They have raped our holy places in the name of tolerance …
This resolution is a serious violation of all the holy sites and not only to one cemetery . "
Although this legal case ultimately resulted in failure for the movement , it consolidated its reputation and leadership among many Jerusalemites , able to challenge Israel 's urban planning schemes for Jerusalem .
This has provided Salah a platform to be in the forefront of the recent confrontations .
An important dimension to these campaigns is the projection of the struggle on to the global scene .
By its use of different media , the Islamic Movement has positioned itself as a key agent in both the struggle on the ground and the regional and international debates over al - Aqsa and the status of Jerusalem .
Some senior PA officials now recognise that Salah 's public speeches and activities within Jerusalem have an impact upon their scope for negotiation and will undoubtedly influence future policy .
In the words of one such official , " This self - appointed sheikh of al - Aqsa has built his own kingdom within Jerusalem .
He is seeking to capture the hearts and minds of Jerusalemites as victory in Jerusalem offers him the greatest platform to Islamic victory in the Arab world . "
Such perceptions of the ambition of the Islamic Movement indicate the high stakes that are being played out in the city .

Troubled asteroid mission stumbles on road home
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : November 9 , 2009
Hopes are fading for the return of the Hayabusa space probe after another of its ion thrusters failed last week , leaving just one already - damaged engine to guide the hard - luck spacecraft back to Earth , potentially with the first precious samples of an asteroid .
An ion engine in ground testing .
JAXA
Hayabusa 's four experimental microwave discharge ion engines consume xenon gas and expel the ionized propellant at high speeds to produce thrust .
Two of the thrusters already failed before another engine shut down last Wednesday , according to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency .
Thruster D's failure was caused by a voltage spike due to problems with a neutralization vessel .
A similar anomaly triggered the failure of another engine in 2007 .
The fourth ion propulsion unit , called Thruster C , was already shut down after signs that it also might succumb to high voltage damage .
Engineers are now testing that engine to determine if it is capable of long - duration firings .
Ion engines are more efficient than conventional chemical thrusters because they use less fuel and can operate continuously for thousands of hours .
Hayabusa 's thrusters have accumulated almost 40,000 hours of burn time since the probe launched in May 2003 .
The engine that failed last week had been firing since February to bend the 950 - pound probe 's trajectory , allowing it to reach Earth by June 2010 and release a small re-entry capsule possibly carrying samples from asteroid Itokawa .
In February , JAXA officials said Hayabusa needed to accelerate by about 900 mph to reach Earth .
Thruster D was slated to continue operating until March , when Hayabusa would begin coasting toward its parachuted return over the desert of Australia .
Officials now say they are evaluating the asteroid mission 's return course after last week 's glitch .
Artist 's concept of Hayabusa .
JAXA
Hayabusa spent three months exploring Itokawa in late 2005 .
The probe took 1,600 pictures and collected about 120,000 pieces of near - infrared spectral data and 15,000 data points with its X - ray spectrometer to investigate the small potato - shaped asteroid 's surface composition .
The spacecraft approached Itokawa several times , attempting to fire a pellet into the asteroid 's surface and retrieve rock samples through a funnel leading to a collection chamber .
During a failed sampling attempt in November 2005 , Hayabusa made an unplanned landing and spent up to a half - hour on Itokawa , becoming the first spacecraft to take off from an asteroid .
Although telemetry showed Hayabusa likely did not fire its projectile while on the surface , scientists were hopeful bits of dust or pebbles found their way through the funnel and into the sample retrieval system .
Hayabusa was later stymied by a fuel leak and ground controllers temporarily lost communications with the spacecraft , which is about the size of an average refrigerator .
Controllers labored to overcome the issues , which were compounded by the loss of two orientation - controlling reaction wheels and power cells in an electrical battery .
The craft 's departure from Itokawa was delayed a year because of the problems , postponing its return to Earth from 2007 until 2010 .
On a cloudy morning at the veterans hospital in Menlo Park , a cozy bedroom community of workaholic Silicon Valley , Raymond Ortiz wheels out a red racing machine .
Wearing blue - and - white cycling tights , he parks the bicycle in the patio of the ward for vets suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder and glances over at mine .
“ That ’s a nice - looking old bike , ” the veteran of the first Persian Gulf War says politely .
To be exact , my outdated steel job is about 25 years older than his aluminum rocket , and I ’m feeling an even greater age difference as the rest of his fit cycling team shows up .
Over the years , about 170 veterans here have joined the hospital ’s cycling - therapy program .
Almost all of them had suffered a combat injury , from loss of limbs to shell shock , and then found civilian life to be a living hell .
Gil Ramirez , a readjustment counselor , arrives with an ultralight , carbon - fiber racer .
More than most endurance sports , he explains , cycling is a group activity , a sport that can pry emotionally and mentally wounded veterans out of their shells and bring them back to the peloton of friendship and life in general .
There ’s nothing like a long , challenging ride through pretty country to burn off built - up anger and push those ugly memories of battle to where they belong .
“ You can blow off a lot of steam , get past your physical pain , ” says Ortiz , who has a bad back and lingering numbness in his right foot .
Ortiz , Ramirez and four other members of the PTSD team bolt out of the hospital ’s spread - out campus and onto the commuter - jammed streets for a 15 - mile spin .
And soon I see , these boys are fast !
Struggling with PTSD
During the Battle of Marathon 2,500 years ago , the Greek historian Herodotus described an Athenian soldier who was not injured but became permanently blind after witnessing the death of a fellow soldier .
The modern understanding of PTSD dates from the 1970s and the Vietnam War .
We might say the search for a cure began only yesterday .
PTSD is an acute anxiety that anyone , child or adult , can get after suffering violence or traumatic injury , or just seeing something horrible happen to someone else .
In April 2008 , the Rand Corp. think tank reported that almost 20 percent of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan reported PTSD or depression .
In vets , Ramirez says , the common results can range from emotional isolation and chronic unemployment to divorce and homelessness .
“ We have n’t done any long - term studies yet , ” the readjustment counselor says as he pedals hard to keep up with Ortiz and his other patients .
“ Anecdotally , we have a lot of these guys who ’ll tell you that cycling has helped them as much as their therapy sessions . ”
Running , swimming , skiing and other endurance sports are n’t new in the treatment of physically , emotionally or mentally wounded soldiers .
But as a sustained therapy for PTSD , cycling appears to work wonders .
“ Of all the sports we ’ve tried , ” says recreational counselor Melissa Puckett , “ cycling is the one that ’s been the most effective . ”
Gift of real bikes
Looking for an exercise program to complement therapy sessions about four years ago , Ramirez and other therapists decided to give cycling a try .
The problem was , the Veterans Administration did n’t have a bike budget .
It still does n’t .
So they scrounged up some heavy mountain bikes and other clunkers .
Hearing about this , the Specialized bike company , headquartered in Morgan Hill , donated some spiffy new Allez road bikes .
On real bikes , the group ’s mileage , speed and endurance improved and , the veterans will tell you , so did their mental health .
“ I was skeptical at first , ” says Jose Reyes , who served with the Army in Iraq in 2007 and 2008 .
After riding 500 miles to Los Angeles last month , he says , “ I had never felt so good in my life .
We look forward to riding now .
I just clears our minds . ”
When I ask , they ’re reluctant to talk about their injuries .
That ’s because they ’re in the middle of serious talk therapy , which is designed to get them to stop dwelling on combat and move on to fixing themselves and their relationships .
Ramirez says most of them are still learning how to handle blood - and - guts questions from strangers and even loved ones .
Until they do , they can remain emotionally isolated and incapable of “ holding their babies , sharing good times with their wives , taking the kids to Disneyland , just living normal lives . ”
Or , as Ortiz put it , “ You just go into shutdown mode . ” ‘
I asked him , What ’s the therapeutic secret of cycling ?
“ It brings back the feeling of being on a team , ” he says , “ of looking out for each other . ”
Another veteran on the team said the long - distance rides have given him back something crucial : “ A sense of accomplishment I did n’t have for years . ”
Veterans with PTSD typically stay here for 60 to 90 days .
After that , they go home .
The donated bikes stay .
A lot of them , like Ortiz , do n’t have their own bikes but will come back occasionally to ride with the group .
However , that ’s another day .
As they break for breakfast , they decide to ride again that afternoon .
Fifteen miles was n’t enough .

Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers relive the cold winter 's day when they went to visit famously prickly writer Maurice Sendak , to talk about filming Where the Wild Things Are
Dave Eggers :
So here we are .
It 's always awkward doing this kind of thing together .
If we wrote this the way we wrote the script , fighting over every word , it would probably take a year .
Spike Jonze :
We should just have a conversation .
Then we can fight over every word when we edit it .
DE : But let 's be really eloquent .
We can talk , and then after we transcribe the talk , we can make ourselves seem articulate .
SJ : Yes , we shall do that .
It brings to mind something the bard once said : " Tis excellent to be spontaneous , tho better to be brilliant . "
DE : He did n't say that .
SJ : He did .
In one of his lesser - known plays , The Sisters of Hannah .
DE : So let 's talk about Maurice Sendak , about the first time we saw him together .
It was in the winter of 2003 , I think .
You and Maurice had known each other for a long time .
SJ : I had known him for about 10 years before we started making the Where the Wild Things Are movie .
I had gone to his house in Connecticut many times , because initially we were talking about doing a movie based on Harold and the Purple Crayon , which was another book I loved as a kid .
He was the trustee to the estate of its author , and so I needed his approval to do that movie .
That movie never happened , but Maurice and I became friends .
And , somewhere along the line , he and I started talking about a Wild Things movie .
DE : When you and I finally went up to Connecticut to see him , we were bringing in our general idea of how to do the movie .
You and I had only been working on it for a few months , but I had n't met him , and we wanted to give him a general idea .
It was a very cold day in December , and we drove up from New York .
I remember being really nervous .
I had idolised the man since I was about four or five .
He was one of the first authors whose name I knew .
SJ : That was a good sign for the whole process , the fact that you knew his work so well .
So I wanted you two to meet , and I wanted you to get a feel for him , and feel the support from him that I felt .
I knew you guys would hit it off .
DE : I guess he already had a sense that you were not going to do a typical adaptation .
SJ : I 'd spent the previous six months forming the ideas I wanted the movie to be about , taking notes and thinking about who I wanted to write it with , finding you and getting you on board with it .
So I had all the basic elements together .
But before we actually wrote it , I wanted to present our ideas to Maurice .
Do you remember your first impressions of meeting him ?
DE : I was struck by how strong he was .
He must have been 76 when we met him , but he was razor - sharp and very funny .
He 's a hilarious guy , incredibly vibrant .
We walked in , and he showed us some of his Disney collection .
SJ : He has these insanely rare Mickey Mouse figurines from the 30s – before they corrupted him , as Maurice says .
DE : The rest of the house was very much like a regular person 's house , would n't you say ?
I guess I 'm always surprised when artists like Maurice have normal houses .
SJ : Yeah , I would say that .
It 's a very . . . what 's that style of architecture ?
It 's like a New England style .
Very conservative .
Is it a farmhouse ?
DE : It looks a little bit like a farmhouse , in a sort of woodsy area .
I think it was during that first meeting that he told us about that shed in the backyard .
It 's sort of like a stable , and kind of falling apart .
I guess one of his neighbours complained about it being an eyesore .
Maurice lives in one of those neighbourhoods that used to be all country houses , where people kept horses and were actual farmers .
And now it 's all yuppies who are making this suburb tidy and just so .
SJ : Yeah , they 've built all these giant , 10,000 sq ft mansions that Maurice is violently opposed to .
DE : One of the neighbours complained about this " eyesore " farmhouse . . .
And said he 'd personally help remove it , if Maurice so desired , thinking he was being a big guy to help the old man get rid of the eyesore .
And Maurice told him if he ever mentioned it again , he 'd turn that stable into a whorehouse .
SJ : That was the last time that neighbour talked to him .
DE : That was when I was sure we would be kindred spirits .
It was pretty obvious that we all had kind of the same impatience for that kind of just - so mentality , the sort of person who scrubs clean anything distinct in art or nature or a neighbourhood .
So it was pretty obvious that he'd be OK with us making something distinct from the book .
SJ : He had just seen a pretty unfortunate adaptation of a friend 's book .
DE : Yeah , it was similar to Where the Wild Things Are , in that it was another classic book that was very original when it came out , and it had been adapted in a very large , Hollywood way .
Maurice was very candid about it .
He said it was grotesque .
SJ : " Soulless . "
DE : Right , " soulless " .
I think that was the operative word he kept using .
What was interesting to me was how candid he was .
Sitting around his dining room table , it was immediately clear that here is a very opinionated guy that would support us if we stayed true to the ideas we were talking about , and would only be a thorn in our side if we went a safe route .
Did you already know he was like that ?
SJ : I 'd known it , because he'd been as blunt as possible on the phone .
But to actually go to him with ideas that deviated from the book , and then have him say he respected that , is another thing .
DE : So there we were , sitting at that dining room table , giving him the basic gist of what we had in mind .
Did we already know that we were n't going to have Max 's room actually change , like it does in the book , and instead have Max run away from home , and get on an actual boat to sail to the island ?
SJ : Yeah .
That was actually the only thing that Maurice and I ever disagreed about in the process of making the movie .
DE : It 's funny that he was the first of many people who objected to the room not changing into the jungle .
SJ : But even in that first meeting – when we were a little heated about it – he'd always go back to , " Well , it 's your movie , you have to make what you believe in . "
DE : He definitely was n't shy about letting us know the things he really did n't like .
He can be an intimidating guy .
He 's incredibly smart and astoundingly eloquent , but he really understood this being your movie .
But he fought us on that bedroom part .
I think at some point , it might have been then or later , he even proposed a compromise on that bedroom scene , where the room would still change , but that Max would climb out the window on a vine .
SJ : Yeah !
He did suggest that .
DE : But it seemed like the idea of the movie being real and really dangerous would require
Max to actually be in a forest and on a real boat .
Because if he just goes to his room , we know everything that follows just takes place in his imagination .
And then there 's not as much at stake for the next hour of the movie .
We really wanted it to seem like a small boy actually sailed across the ocean and , when he was on the island , that he was truly in danger of being devoured .
That there was real fire , and real dirt , and real snow .
SJ : Maurice was struggling because – as much as he said , " I want you to make it yours " – he had lived with the book as his creation for 40 years .
DE : But I think that at that meeting it was really clear that we were going to take Maurice at his word .
He realised the movie was going to be a combination of his childhood and your childhood , and maybe a bit of mine , too .
So a lot of the themes were going to be brand new .
SJ : He based the book on themes and feelings from his life .
I was picking up the baton .
He and I would talk about what the book had meant to me as a kid , or had made me feel like .
I would say , " You and I had very different childhoods .
There were times when I might have been more sensitive to something than he would have been as a kid . "
But we did n't want to make Max a . . . a . . .
DE : A wuss like you were , yeah .
( Laughter . )
Most kids in modern movies are de-fanged .
They have no wildness .
What you and I and Maurice all figured out pretty quickly was that we all remembered what it was like to be an actual boy .
We did n't pretend that boys wore three - piece suits to school , sat with perfect posture , said please and thank you all the time .
We wanted to make sure that Max acts like a real boy – breaking things and throwing tantrums , the kind of kid who would play with swords and slingshots .
When I was a kid , I was pretty wild and got in trouble like Max .
And you had , and Maurice had been that way , too .
We also established the movies we thought had represented childhood accurately in the past .
We talked about The Black Stallion , My Life As a Dog , a couple of other movies . . .
SJ : The 400 Blows .
DE : Movies that did n't look down at a kid , but got inside him .
And actually there are so few .
It was kind of exhilarating , in a way , knowing how wide - open that playing field was .
SJ : Were you worried going into it ?
DE : Meeting Maurice was an earthquake in my life .
Meeting a guy around 80 who 's still so full of fire – and if anything , had grown more authentic as he got older .
We had yet to write anything for him to critique , so that gives you this great fear , like , " Holy crap , what 's he going to think when we write this ? "
Because here 's a guy who wo n't sugarcoat what he says .
SJ : He never did , for the next four years .
DE : When we left that day , there were big hugs and even kisses on the way out .
He 's very affectionate .
I remember being struck by how full of love he was .
SJ : I think he was also really excited that you were coming on .
He 'd read your first book and loved it .
It was another sign that the movie was n't going in the typical direction of Hollywood development , where you 're bringing on the " ace " screenwriter of the last big children 's movie .
DE : He 's had a lot of those people thrown at him throughout the years .
He would always tell these stories where he would do imitations of the people who came to see him and what they said .
" Mr Sendak , let me tell you how movies are made . . . "
SJ : " Mr Sendak , this is how you make a film for children . . . " or " This is what children like , Mr Sendak . "
When he does one of his imitations , look out .
DE : Oh man .
Driving back to New York , it was snowing .
It was like some kind of blizzard , windy and snowy .
There were people pulled over everywhere , and we were just driving , recounting every minute of the day .
SJ : I remember being excited .
It was like a relief , a weight off our shoulders .
Driving home , I just felt like we had a wind at our backs .
We went into the unknown , and it was Maurice behind us , pushing us with force in that direction .
We had no idea where it was going to take us .
This is an edited extract from Heads On and We Shoot : The Making of Where the Wild Things Are , published by It Books .
The film is released on 11 December .
NEW YORK -- Shortly after 9/11 , George W. Bush secretly signed two executive orders .
Both violated basic constitutional protections as well as U.S. obligations under international treaties , yet both carried the force of law .
They still do .
The first order grants the president ( and other officials , including the secretary of defense , the secretary of homeland security and presumably certain postal clerks ) the right to declare anyone -- including an American citizen -- an " unlawful enemy combatant . "
A person so declared has no redress , no way to appeal , no ability to challenge that designation .
Once a person has been named an enemy combatant , according to the Bush Administration -- and now to the Obama Administration -- he has no rights .
He can be held without charges forever , tortured , you name it -- well , actually , the president or the secretary of defense names it .
In the second covert executive order , Bush authorized the CIA to target and assassinate said " enemy combatants " -- again , including American citizens .
These two documents first came into play on November 3 , 2002 , when a CIA - operated Predator drone plane violating Yemeni airspace fired a Hellfire missile at a car containing Qaed Salim Sinan al - Harethi , supposedly Al Qaeda 's # 1 man in Yemen at the time .
U.S. officials did n't know that an American citizen , Kamal Derwish , was riding along .
( You know what they say about hitchhiking . )
" The Bush administration said the killing of an American in this fashion was legal ... this is legal because the president and his lawyers say so -- it 's not much more complicated than that , " CBS News reported at the time .
" I can assure you that no constitutional questions are raised here , " said Bush 's national security adviser , Condoleezza Rice , after the CIA assassinations .
" He 's well within the balance of accepted practice and the letter of his constitutional authority . "
It 's right there in the Constitution between the right to tax and the repeal of Prohibition .
Anyway , Congress tried to clarify matters in the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 , part of which -- the section that eliminated the writ of habeas corpus - - got struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court last year .
But the rest of the MCA remains in force , including a passage that defines an enemy combatant as anyone who provides " material support " to the " enemy . "
And who is the enemy ?
The enemy is anyone the president says it / he / she / they is .
Again , there is no distinction between foreigners and U.S. citizens .
Jose Padilla , the so - called would - be " dirty bomber " held in a Navy brig since 2002 , was tried and convicted of such " material support " charges in 2007 .
( The government could n't prosecute Padilla for their original dirty bomb charges because they had tortured him so severely that he had been reduced to mental mush . )
Now that times have supposedly changed , it 's time to ask : why has n't President Obama abrogated Bush 's controversial executive orders ?
If Obama truly seeks a break with the lawlessness of the prior administration , what better way to enact it ?
Simply put , no one man -- not even a nice , articulate , charismatic one -- ought to claim the right to suspend a person 's constitutional rights .
Not in America .
Certainly no one man -- not even a young , handsome , likeable one -- should be able to have anyone he wants whacked .
Even in dictatorships , the right of life and death is reserved for judges and juries operating under a system purportedly designed to support impartiality and a search for the truth .
But that 's not the case here in the United States .
In 2002 Scott Silliman , director of the Center on Law , Ethics and National Security at Duke University asked : " Could you put a Hellfire missile into a car in Washington , D.C. , under [ the Bush ] theory ?
The answer is yes , you could . "
Nothing much has changed since then .
Obama has eliminated the use of the phrase " enemy combatant , " but The New York Times reported that the change is merely meant to " symbolically separate the new administration from Bush detention policies . "
The words may have changed , but Obama attorney general Eric Holder 's definition of who can and cannot be held , said the Times , is " not significantly different from the one used by the Bush administration . "
These days , Obama has ramped up the assassination of political opponents of the U.S. and the U.S. - aligned authoritarian regime in Pakistan , deploying more Predator drone plane attacks than Bush .
But that 's just for now .
Obama could still personally order a government agency to murder you .
Which is weird .
But not nearly as weird as the fact that you probably do n't care enough to do something about it .

Ah , gadget violence : if you want to create a viral video , it cannot fail .
That 's what Sony Australia was thinking when they created a video in which a PS3 Slim gets smashed into a Sony Bravia LCD TV at 50 mph ( 22 meters per second ) .
We give Sony points for not trying to hide the fact that they 're behind the video : it 's part of a promotion during which Sony Australia is giving away 25,000 PS3 slims for buyers of selected Bravia LCD TV models .
A couple of blogs were invited for the event , which included a specially - constructed sled that hurled the 3.2 kg heavy PS3 Slim into the Sony Bravia KDL46X 3100 Full HD LCD TV which was standing some 60 m away .
You can read the gory details over here , or simply check out the beauty of sheer destruction ( in slow motion ) in the video below .
THE Church of Scientology is denying claims by Nick Xenophon of a cover - up , while the senator remains frustrated in his call for a parliamentary inquiry into the religion .
Yesterday Stephen McBride , whose Scientologist brother committed suicide two years ago , travelled to Canberra to plead with the Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , to order an investigation of the church .
A coroner 's inquiry into his 2007 death found that Edward McBride had taken out a $ 20,000 loan to pay for his Scientology courses .
In the days before he died , the Defence Force officer was contacted by church members 19 times .
And against the wishes of police , the church sent files on Mr McBride to the US where they remain out of reach .
'' The bombardment of 19 telephone messages backed him into a corner with no room to breathe , '' Mr McBride said .
'' We 've been through hell the last two years - please do n't let my brother 's death be in vain . ''
But Senator Xenophon and the Greens have so far been unsuccessful in their calls for an inquiry .
The Opposition has signalled it would not support an inquiry , and it is understood the Government is cool on the idea .
It ’s not hard to obtain a computer flatbed scanner for nothing – they ’re a frequent discard that can be found at garage sales , kerbside hard rubbish collections and the tip .
But what use can be made of the parts inside ?
Despite first appearances , quite a lot .
Pulling the scanner apart is easy : most models just clip together and can be separated by the judicious use of a screwdriver .
Inside you ’ll find a moving carriage on which the cold cathode fluorescent lamp ( CCFL ) , focusing lens and charge coupled device ( CCD ) image sensor are mounted .
In addition , the carriage contains two or three mirrors to reflect the image to the lens .
The carriage is moved by a geared - down stepper motor that operates a toothed belt to which the carriage is attached .
Image processing circuitry is included , as is ( usually ) a position sensor to detect when the carriage is at its ‘ start ’ position .
So getting the bits is easy – but what uses can you put them to ?
CCFL
The Cold Cathode Fluorescent Light ( CCFL ) is run by a high voltage ( HV ) power supply .
( It ’s important to realise that it ’s high enough in voltage to give you a shock or burn your skin ! )
Salvaging this part of the system is very easy – in most scanners , the HV power supply is mounted close to the CCFL on the carriage , or alternatively , is mounted remotely and is connected to the CCFL via some HV wires .
The HV power supply is a separate circuit board and contains a transformer , inductor , a few capacitors and some transistors .
The power supply is fed by either two or three wires .
When there is a pair , you ’ll normally find that they are red and black – red for positive , black for negative .
Observing the polarity , connect a variable voltage power supply to these wires and slowly wind up the voltage .
The CCFL will first light at anywhere from 4.5 – 21 V .
If the original input voltage is unknown , go up only a few volts over the ‘ light - up ’ voltage of the CCFL .
In the case of three wire power supplies , in addition to the red and black wires there ’ll be a ‘ control ’ input .
With power connected via the red and black wires , supplying this control input with a small voltage ( eg 1V ) will cause the CCFL to light .
Scanner CCFLs have a measured power of 2-3W .
The CCFLs have some major advantages over other lighting sources .
First , the tubes are extremely thin – 2.5 mm is common .
Second , they provide a diffuse light , usually with good colour rendition .
Finally , they are quite bright !
However , you must remember that the tubes are also fragile – where possible , they should be supported in the same way as they were in the scanner carriage and you cannot expect them to be anywhere near as rugged as LEDs .
Also remember that in use , the power supply must be well insulated away from probing fingers .
Ex -scanner CCFLs are ideal in model railway layouts ( where they can provide concealed factory and station lighting ) , for low voltage lighting ( eg in a caravan or solar home ) , or for instrument and gauge lighting .
At Zero Cost High Tech Interior Lamp we used an ex-scanner CCFL as a new boot - light , a job it did brilliantly ( pun intended ! ) .
Front Housing
The front of the scanner consists of a flat sheet of high quality glass mounted in a plastic housing .
And that ’s it - most times , the electronics , carriage and motor are all in the bottom half of the scanner .
So what use is this top half ?
Well , if the housing is placed over a shallow tray that ’s been filled with soil , an ideal device for germinating seeds is formed .
Want some other uses ?
The front housing can also be used to provide a layer of protection for solar cells that are n’t already under glass , or you can make a picture frame that matches the glass size .
When I was a kid , I made a solar pie warmer that used a front glass sheet very similar in size to a typical flat bed scanner ’s glass panel – so there ’s another use .
In short , wherever you need a pre-cut , zero cost small sheet of good quality glass , here it is !
Why on earth would you throw it away ?
Stepper Motor
Scanners use stepper motors that are attached to compact reduction gears .
Unlike many discarded consumer goods from which you can obtain steppers , the scanner stepper and its gear - train often comprise a standalone , easily removable assembly .
So wherever you want a small stepper ( they ’re typically 25 – 35 mm in diameter ) that ’s integrated with a ~ 16:1 reduction drive and forms an assembly that ’s only about 70 x 50 x 40 mm , reach for the nearest discarded scanner .
To drive these motors you ’ll need a stepper motor control circuit .
Of course , the scanner already incorporated this but it ’s easiest to use new circuitry to achieve the control you want – electronic kits are available that can do this .
But you do n’t need to electronically drive the stepper - instead you can apply physical effort to rotate the output shaft and so generate power !
The 16:1 reduction ratio then becomes a 16:1 step - up ratio .
By adding a crank handle to the output cog ( this is easy because this cog originally needed clearance to drive the belt and so always stands proud ) , you can take advantage of the gear - train to turn the stepper motor at an easily - achievable 1500 rpm !
The power produced is enough to charge a battery or run a white LED .
The benefit of taking this approach over using a larger , direct - driven stepper is that a very compact generator or hand - cranked torch can be built .
( And the disadvantage is that the plastic gear - train will have a finite life . )
Miscellaneous
Also , do n’t forget the other bits and pieces inside the scanner .
I always salvage the chrome - plated steel bar on which the carriage rides ( and it runs in bronze bushes , no less ! ) .
These bars are typically 8 mm in diameter and if you have a metal turning lathe and / or a set of thread - cutting dies , make an excellent raw material for all sorts of projects .
You ’ll also find front - faced mirrors ( that is , the reflected light does n’t have to pass through the glass ) and Hall - effect position sensors .
And I nearly forget one of the gems – the final focusing lens .
Scanners contain a variety of pre-focusing lenses - and curved mirrors - but it ’s the lens closest to the image sensor that ’s the good ‘ un .
Often only about 8 mm diameter by 10 mm long , these very short focal length lenses ( eg. a focal length of 15 mm ) make for extremely effective close - up hand lenses .
They ’re not super bright , but they ’re of excellent quality and provide huge magnification .
Finally , most scanners that you ’ll find discarded are powered by plugpacks – and many people throw these away at the same time as they ’re getting rid of the scanner .
And you can never have too many different voltage / current plugpacks on the shelf …
Conclusion
Perhaps you ’re not interested in free , high efficacy , compact low voltage fluorescent lighting .
Or maybe seed germination boxes leave you cold .
Or perhaps you ca n’t think of any uses for geared stepper motors or hand - cranked generators .
A compact , high magnification hand lens ?
Well , it bores you .
Having a range of different plugpacks available without cost ?
Who cares !
And all that ’s OK – just make sure you give any old scanners that you find to someone who does n’t share your ideas !
River Valley farm stands at the end of an earth road leading out of Holcomb , a small town on the western edge of Kansas .
You can see its pretty white gabled roof floating above a sea of corn stubble .
The house is famous for the elm trees which line the drive , giving it the tranquil air of a French country lane .
The trees are in poor shape though , and desperately in need of pruning ; their branches , leafless now , protrude at wild angles .
There 's something else not quite right about the setting .
There is a large " stop " sign at the entrance to the road , backed up by a metal barrier and a hand - written poster in red paint proclaiming : " No Trespassing .
Private Drive . "
The warnings seem belligerent for such a peaceful spot .
The explanation for these warnings lies about half a mile away in Holcomb 's local park .
A memorial plaque was unveiled there two months ago in honour of the former occupants of River Valley farm : the Clutter family , who lived in that house at the end of the elm drive until one tragic night half a century ago .
The plaque carries a lengthy eulogy to the family , recording the many accomplishments of the father , Herb Clutter , and telling us that the family 's leisure activities included " entertaining friends , enjoying picnics in the summer and participating in school and church events " .
Towards the end of the inscription it says that Herb , his wife Bonnie , and two of his four children Nancy and Kenyon , " were killed November 15 1959 by intruders who entered their home with the intent of robbery " .
That is a very minimalist way of describing a multiple murder that devastated the town of Holcomb , inspired one of the great books of American 20th - century literature and spawned a stack of Hollywood films on that fateful night exactly 50 years ago this Sunday .
" Four shotgun blasts that , all told , ended six human lives . "
That was how Truman Capote summed up the murders with somewhat greater drama , referring to the four Clutter victims and their two attackers who died later on the gallows .
After reading a short newspaper account of the killings , he decided to make the 1,700 km journey from his home in New York to Holcomb to chronicle the impact of terrible violence on a small community .
The result , six years later , was In Cold Blood .
It propelled him to household fame and fortune , and in the process ensured that Holcomb was put on the map , and changed forever , in ways that many of the townspeople did not – and still do not – appreciate .
It is hard to think of any murder case involving six relatively unknown individuals that has captured so many imaginations .
In Cold Blood has sold millions of copies and been translated into 30 languages .
It was made into a black - and - white film of the same name in 1967 and there was a colour remake in 1996 .
The story of how it came to be written became the 2005 movie Capote , followed by Infamous the following year .
Kevin Bascue , the sheriff of Garden City , Holcomb 's neighbouring town , is well used to the attention .
He spreads out on his office table a set of files relating to the Clutter case , one of which records recent visitors who have come on a sort of In Cold Blood pilgrimage from Italy , Japan and all over the US .
Next week Bascue will host a producer from Boston who wants to turn the book into a musical .
" The fact that someone from New York like Truman Capote felt compelled to come out all this way to tell the Clutters ' story I suppose means it 's forever going to be ingrained in people 's minds , " the sheriff says .
There are many reasons why In Cold Blood has become so ingrained .
There is the precision of Capote 's writing , which resonates from the first sentence : " The village of Holcomb stands on the high wheat plains of western Kansas , a lonesome area that other Kansans call ' out there ' . "
There is the depth of his research , which he carried on to the end as a witness at the killers ' hanging in 1965 .
There is also something monumental about the timing of the book .
America in 1959 was at a crossroads .
It was still bathing in the victory of the second world war and ensuing economic boom .
The country was confident and secure , and the body blows of Vietnam still lay ahead .
Nowhere was this sense of purpose more evident than in the US heartlands , with their hundreds of tight - knit communities , like Holcomb , scattered along railway lines across the Great Plains .
Capote noted with satisfaction that Holcomb itself lies almost in the exact middle of the continental US .
If Holcomb was representative of that small - town rootedness that defined 1959 America , then the Clutters were representative of Holcomb .
" Of all the people in all the world , " Capote quotes a local detective , " the Clutters were the least likely to be murdered . "
Herb Clutter was an upstanding , dependable character .
As the memorial plaque notes , he was involved in the local schools , hospital , church , and was president of the National Association of Wheat Growers – a title that meant something in those days before the advent of mass - production farming .
" He was a big influence in my life – when you know somebody like that it tends to kind of inspire you , " says Holcomb resident Bob Rupp .
" He could see above what most people could see , and visualise how things should be . "
It was Rupp 's idea to erect a plaque for the Clutters .
He knew the family well .
So well , in fact , that In Cold Blood 's first chapter heading implicitly refers to him : " The Last to see Them Alive . "
Rupp was 16 at the time of the killings .
His childhood sweetheart of the same age was Nancy Clutter .
" She was just a beautiful , outgoing person who had many , many friends .
She was just a stand - out individual , " he says now .
Rupp was indeed the last person to see the Clutters alive – other than the killers – having gone over to River Valley farm on the Saturday night .
" Herb was in his study , but Nancy , Kenyon and I sat and watched TV .
When the news came on at 10 o'clock it was time for me to leave . "
He had planned to go that night with Nancy to a midnight movie but Herb had persuaded them to go the night before .
Had they gone after all , things might have been different , at least for Nancy .
" You never know . . . "
Rupp says , then tails off .
A few hours after he left the farm to walk home , in the early hours of Sunday , tragedy arrived at River Valley farm in the form of Perry Smith and Dick Hickock , recently discharged thieves who had driven 400 miles expressly to rob the Clutter home , expecting to find in it a safe containing $ 10,000 .
In Capote 's telling , Smith and Hickock were the other , dark side of Herb Clutter 's America .
They were everything he was not : impetuous , profane , rootless , lost .
All Herb 's striking moral strength was just as strikingly absent in them .
Sheriff Bascue 's files contain the killers ' confessions .
Smith 's statement , typewritten on faded yellow paper , is particularly chilling .
" That 's when I cut Mr Clutter 's throat , " he tells the officer leading the investigation , Alvin Dewey .
" I says , ' Should I shoot him ? ' and Dick looked at me and he says , ' Yeah , go ahead ; go ahead . '
I raised the shotgun and pulled the trigger . "
Hickock 's statement , written in the third person , describes the shooting of Nancy .
" Before Dick shot her , Nancy said , ' Oh please do n't , please do n't . ' "
Another file contains the police forensic photograph of Nancy 's body .
She is curled up in a foetal position , her hands tied behind her back , blood splattered on her bedroom wall .
When they left the farmhouse , leaving behind the bodies of the Clutter parents and their two younger children , Smith and Hickock took with them all the cash that Herb had on him – the princely sum of about $ 40 .
Capote does n't shrink from exploring the brutality of the killers , but he also forces us to consider their wounded humanity .
In Perry , in particular , he captured an extraordinarily complex character , one capable of placing a pillow beneath Kenyon 's head to make him more comfortable minutes before shooting him dead .
If the moral clash between Herb Clutter and his killers lies at the core of In Cold Blood , a clash of a cultural kind lay behind its writing – between Capote and the farming folk of Holcomb whom he came to live among .
Capote was 5ft 4in , openly gay , with a squeaky voice and flamboyant fashion sense , as portrayed brilliantly by Philip Seymour Hoffman in his Oscar - winning role in Capote , and Toby Jones in Infamous .
Holcomb men , by contrast , dressed then pretty much as they do now .
When I meet Rupp he is wearing a baseball cap , blue denim shirt and jeans , and cowboy boots .
" The type of person Capote was threw me off right away , " Rupp says .
" He was n't the kind of person I wanted to spend time with – he was very , very strange . "
Nelle Harper Lee , Capote 's friend and fellow writer who came with him to Holcomb , once said : " Those people had never seen anyone like Truman – he was like someone coming off the moon . "
Capote 's first few days in town were difficult .
Everyone gave him the brush - off .
Harper Lee was crucial in overcoming the initial hostility .
She had just finished writing To Kill a Mockingbird , and was awaiting publication .
She agreed to accompany Capote to act as what he called his " assistant researchist " .
Her affable southern manner – she and Capote were childhood friends from Monroeville , Alabama – made for a much happier connection with the plain - spoken inhabitants of Holcomb .
Rupp recalls that in the one interview he granted Capote , most of the questions were asked by Harper Lee , so much so that " sometimes I wonder who really wrote that book " .
Delores Hope , who in 1959 was a columnist for the local paper , the Garden City Telegram , also noted Harper Lee 's vital role .
" Nelle sort of managed Truman , acting as his guardian or mother .
She broke the ice for him . "
Delores and her husband , Cliff Hope , were also crucial ice - breakers .
Hope was the Clutters ' family lawyer , and arranged for Capote to look around River Valley farm so he could describe firsthand the murder scene .
He is one of the few people acknowledged by Capote at the start of the book .
As Christmas approached in 1959 , Delores took pity on Capote and Harper Lee , imagining them sitting in their hotel rooms with nowhere to go .
So she invited them to Christmas lunch .
" We asked them to come over at one o'clock , " recalls Cliff .
" Truman said : ' We 'll be there at two . ' "
Capote arrived at the Hopes ' doorstep clutching a bottle of J&B whisky for his own consumption , and from the minute he stepped indoors , as Delores puts it , " he pretty well took over the conversation " .
While Capote held forth , Harper Lee accompanied Delores into the kitchen , where they bonded over cooking a goose .
They became great friends , and remain in touch to this day , despite Harper Lee 's reputation , at the age of 83 , for being reclusive .
The Hopes still live in the same house where they welcomed the odd couple .
The simple wooden home , with its postwar furniture , has changed remarkably little , as if stuck in 1959 .
As they describe Capote 's effervescent monologue , you can almost see him sitting on the beige cloth couch , legs crossed , waving his arms around as if starring in his own movie .
With the help of the Hopes , Capote and Harper Lee went on to inveigle themselves into the lives of other key figures in town , notably the Deweys with whom Capote became lifelong friends .
He and Harper Lee were at the Deweys ' house on the night when news came through that the killers had been arrested in Las Vegas .
The extent to which Capote won over key figures of the community was such that when he left to return to New York in January 1960 after his first tranche of research , he told a friend : " At first it was hard .
But now I 'm practically the mayor ! "
Yet there are few visible relics of of Capote 's time in Kansas .
In Holcomb , there is River Valley farm that still looks on the exterior largely as he described it .
It now belongs to its third set of owners since the Clutters , the Maders ; they used to give tours of the property but grew so bothered by the endless stream of In Cold Blood pilgrims that they posted the " stop " sign .
In Garden City , the Wheat Lands motel where Capote and Harper Lee stayed , is still there , though a photo of Capote posing in front of the building has been stolen from the foyer .
The courthouse where Smith and Hickock were put on trial still stands as imposing as it was then .
In the cemetery there are three neat tombstones , all bearing the date 1959 : Herb and Bonnie together in the centre , Kenyon on the right and Nancy to the left .
Someone has left a vase of blue cloth flowers ; it has tumbled over .
Those signs apart , the local community is barely recognisable 50 years on .
The family farm as the prime social unit , of which the Clutters ' was the epitome , has declined and given way to huge mechanised operations producing animal feed .
Holcomb , population 270 in 1959 , has grown tenfold and is now dominated by one of the world 's largest meat - packing factories .
It is the last sad irony of Herb Clutter that just a few years after his own violent death , his way of life died too .
For Truman Capote the outcome of his sojourn in west Kansas was decidedly mixed .
In Cold Blood , which he immodestly heralded as a new form of non-fiction novel , was received with delirious approval ; Norman Mailer dubbed Perry as one of the great characters in American literature .
The book earned its author more than $ 2 m , which he used to buy homes in Manhattan , the Hamptons , Palm Springs and Switzerland .
But by all accounts such heavenly success also went to his head , and contributed to his downward spiral in a haze of lavish parties , drink and drugs .
He failed to write another substantial work , and died in 1984 .
In Holcomb and Garden City , some of the residents welcomed his book .
Alvin Dewey , the chief police investigator , championed it to the end .
The Hopes too remain fans , cherishing the first - edition copy that Capote autographed for them .
But many in the town continue to resent its intrusion , and refuse to talk about it or any of the subsequent films .
Cliff
Hope puts the ongoing hostility down to Capote 's unblinking portrayal of the killers .
" Many people thought he should have written about the Clutter family , rather than the murderers . "
Delores 's theory is that some local people have closed minds .
" There will always be people who think it 's none of anybody 's business to come out here and write about their affairs .
You will never change their opinions . "
Bob Rupp has a third view .
He says he has never read In Cold Blood , nor seen the movies , and never will .
But he believes that Capote was unfair to the Clutters , because he left to posterity a memory of them that is dominated by the gruesome manner of their deaths rather than the wonderful accomplishments of their lives .
He still thinks about the Clutters often , hence his idea for the memorial .
But he has moved forward .
He married in 1963 and now has four children and eight grandchildren .
So does he think that Capote 's fateful arrival in Holcomb all those years ago has in the long run damaged the town ?
" I do n't know it 's really been damaging .
I do n't think he did the Clutter family justice , is all . "
Dewey , who nailed the killers and became Capote 's good friend , was asked the same question before he died in 1987 .
" What happened , happened , " was his answer .
" Four good people were murdered .
An author came and wrote a book about it .
In all communities , things happen .
Good and bad .
Those are the facts . "
I just got back from Venice , where I attended a conference on Algorithmic Decision Theory .
This is a new conference series ( optimistically numbered the first conference , implying at least a second ) revolving around issues in uncertainty in decision making , preference solicitation , learning and other issues .
From the conference web page :
A new unique event aiming to put together researchers and practitioners coming from different fields such as Decision Theory , Discrete Mathematics , Theoretical Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in order to improve decision support in the presence of massive data bases , combinatorial structures , partial and / or uncertain information and distributed , possibly inter-operating decision makers .
Such problems arise in several real - world decision making problems such as humanitarian logistics , epidemiology , risk assessment and management , e-government , electronic commerce , and the implementation of recommender systems .
This area has been very active , particularly in computer science where there are a host of applications .
I was asked to give one of the invited talks , and spoke on “ An Operations Research Look at Voting ” .
I was a little worried about giving this talk , since my main qualifications come from papers published twenty years ago .
When I was a doctoral student at Georgia Tech , I worked with John Bartholdi and Craig Tovey on computational issues in voting .
Being the first to look at those issues , we got to prove some of the basic results in the area .
These include
For some natural voting rules , it is NP - hard to determine who the winner is .
For some natural voting rules , it is NP - hard to determine how to manipulate the rule ( where manipulation means misrepresenting your preferences so as to get a preferred outcome ) .
For some natural voting rules , optimally using the powers of a chair to form subcommittees or otherwise manipulate the voting process is NP - hard .
We published this work in Social Choice and Welfare ( after getting it rejected from more mainstream economics journals ) where … it was soundly ignored for 15 years .
No one referred to the papers ; no one followed up on the papers ; no one cared about the papers at all !
This work was my job talk in 1987 / 88 , and it got me a wonderful job here at the Tepper School ( then GSIA ) , Carnegie Mellon .
And , without Google Scholar , it was not obvious that the papers were being ignored , so they added to my vita , and made it a bit easier to pass through the various steps .
But I did like the work a lot , and regretted ( and still regret ) that my economist colleagues did not take computational limits more seriously in their models .
But then something amazing happened about 5 years ago : people started referring to the papers !
The references were mainly in computer science , but at least the papers were being recognized .
The counts of these papers in the Web of Science ( formerly Science Citation Index ) are particularly striking .
In the associated graph , the x -axis is years since publication ; the y - axis is the number of references in Web of Science in that year ( Google scholar numbers are higher of course , but there is a bias towards more recent papers there ) .
In my talk , I compare that graph to my “ normal ” papers , which reach a peak after 4 or 5 years then decrease .
It is really gratifying to see the interest in these papers along with all the really cool new results people are getting .
I closed off the talk with some work I have done recently on creating voting trees .
Suppose there are three candidates , “ a ” , “ b ” , and “ c ” , and you really like candidate “ a ” .
Many voting systems proceed as a series of comparisons between two alternatives ( think of standard parliamentary procedure ) .
If you are the chairperson , you might try to bring the candidates forward so as to increase the chances of “ a ” winning .
In fact , if you set the agenda to be “ b ” against “ c ” and the winner against “ a ” , then “ a ” will win as long as “ a ” beats someone ( and no one beats everyone ) .
In this problem , the goal is to do the manipulation without knowing other voters ’ preferences .
Can you do this for four candidates ?
If you want “ a ” to win , “ a ” must be in the top cycle : the group of candidates ( perhaps the entire set of candidates ) who all beat all the other candidates .
The “ Condorcet winner ” is the minimal top cycle : if some candidate beats all the other candidates one - on - one , then that candidate must win any voting tree it occurs in .
So , assuming “ a ” is in the top cycle , can you create a voting tree so that “ a ” wins with four candidates ?
The answer is yes , but it is a bit complicated : first “ a ” goes against “ c ” with the winner against “ d ” then the winner against “ b ” who plays the winner of ( “ a ” goes against “ b ” with the winner against “ d ” … ) …. actually , the minimum tree has 14 leaves !
I am biased , but I think the tree is beautiful , but it goes to show how hard it is to manipulate agendas without knowledge of others ’ preferences .
I am in the process of generating the trees on 4 candidates : there is a very natural rule ( “ Copeland winner with Copeland loser tie break ” : see the presentation for definitions ) that requires more than 32 leaves ( if an implementation tree for it exists ) .
Sanjay Srivastava and I made a conjecture almost 15 years ago that would imply that this sort of manipulation would be possible no matter how many candidates .
Little progress has been made but I think it is still a great problem ( the economists know this as implementation by backwards induction and characterizing rules implementable on trees is an important problem in social choice / mechanism design ) .

The long - coming commercial real estate bust has arrived in the U.S. and elsewhere , a result of sky - high prices met by a severe downturn .
Prices could only work in a best - case economic scenario and large busts are now coming ( see my posts on Stuyvesant Town and Capmark Financial ) .
This bust is certainly another major impediment to a sustained recovery – along with a host of other wild cards like unemployment , trade conflict , and oil prices .
But , the most worrying aspect about the CRE market is the marks on the balance sheets of our capital - constrained banks , which do not reflect the level of distress evident in the marketplace .
And since securitization plagues the CRE market , some analysts expect bankruptcy to be the only workout option for many troubled deals .
You will recall , this problem with securitized assets is a dynamic which has also plagued residential real estate ( see posts here and here ) .
The video below explains how this real estate bust is different and what it will mean for the U.S. economy and likely bank failures .

NEW YORK , Nov 9 ( Reuters ) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N is lifting a salary freeze it put in place last year , according to an internal memo , a sign of its growing confidence in the economic recovery after it reported several quarters of improving investment - banking profits .
Separately , the bank said it is adding more than 300 staff to its branches to support a $ 4 billion increase in small business lending .
The initiative , like its mortgage modification program for homeowners , is an effort to show it is extending lending and helping to revive the U.S. economy .
As year - end bonus season approaches , bankers ’ compensation looms as a hot - button issue again .
When the financial crisis was deepening , the industry came under fire from lawmakers for paying large bonuses to its executives even as it was being propped up with taxpayer money and cutting loans to a trickle .
The decision by JPMorgan to lift the salary freeze is part of its year - end performance and compensation review process , according to the memo from human resources director John Donnelly .
The memo was confirmed by a spokesman for the firm , which has returned $ 25 billion it got from the government -- unlike peers Citigroup Inc C.N and Bank of America Corp BAC.N .
JPMorgan believes its pay practices for top executives follow best principles , Donnelly wrote in the memo , noting that the bank ’s senior executives receive most of their compensation in stock that vests over multiple years and it eliminated so - called golden parachutes for executives in 2005 .
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon did not receive a bonus last year and it is not yet clear whether he will get one this year .
For 2008 , he received about $ 19.7 million in total compensation , including a $ 1 million salary and stock and options awarded in previous years , according to regulatory filings .
The second - largest U.S. bank will also return to matching eligible U.S. employees ’ 401 ( k ) pension plan contributions , after suspending those payments earlier this year , according to the memo .
REGULATION
The Federal Reserve last month issued bank pay guidelines aimed at curbing incentives for risk - taking that officials say contributed to the financial crisis .
U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd was expected on Tuesday to unveil draft legislation to tighten bank and capital market regulation .
[ ID :nN094842 ]
“ It is possible that the regulatory rules will change compensation standards and we will , of course , adhere to all regulatory standards , ” Donnelly wrote in the memo .
“ We will continue to be committed to being highly competitive and paying for performance , ” he added .
Dimon has publicly defended the bank ’s need to pay for talented staff , although at a recent industry gathering he said the bank would not actively seek to hire from banks including Citi and Bank of America that still face pay restrictions .
The New York - based bank will pay a $ 500 special award to employees globally that receive less than $ 60,000 in total compensation , Donnelly wrote in the memo .
As JPMorgan announced it was boosting staffing for its small business lending , the Federal Reserve on Monday announced the percentage of banks tightening lending standards declined in the third quarter , while the pace at which loan demand was falling eased as the economy began to grow .
While showing credit was still tight and loan demand soft , the Fed ’s October survey of bank loan officers signaled a further easing in the number of banks tightening credit , which hit a peak last year in the depths of the financial crisis .
JPMorgan this summer repaid $ 25 billion it received from the U.S. government ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program but the Treasury still holds warrants to buy the bank ’s stock as part of that program .
The bank has said it is letting the Treasury auction the warrants , rather than pay an inflated price to buy them back .
Citigroup and Bank of America have yet to return the money they got from the government and still face pay restrictions for their top executives .

If you ’re looking for a job right now , your prospects are terrible .
There are six times as many Americans seeking work as there are job openings , and the average duration of unemployment  the time the average job - seeker has spent looking for work  is more than six months , the highest level since the 1930s .
You might think , then , that doing something about the employment situation would be a top policy priority .
But now that total financial collapse has been averted , all the urgency seems to have vanished from policy discussion , replaced by a strange passivity .
There ’s a pervasive sense in Washington that nothing more can or should be done , that we should just wait for the economic recovery to trickle down to workers .
This is wrong and unacceptable .
Yes , the recession is probably over in a technical sense , but that does n’t mean that full employment is just around the corner .
Historically , financial crises have typically been followed not just by severe recessions but by anemic recoveries ; it ’s usually years before unemployment declines to anything like normal levels .
And all indications are that the aftermath of the latest financial crisis is following the usual script .
The Federal Reserve , for example , expects unemployment , currently 10.2 percent , to stay above 8 percent  a number that would have been considered disastrous not long ago  until sometime in 2012 .
And the damage from sustained high unemployment will last much longer .
The long - term unemployed can lose their skills , and even when the economy recovers they tend to have difficulty finding a job , because they ’re regarded as poor risks by potential employers .
Meanwhile , students who graduate into a poor labor market start their careers at a huge disadvantage  and pay a price in lower earnings for their whole working lives .
Failure to act on unemployment is n’t just cruel , it ’s short - sighted .

Grand Rapids , Michigan ( CNN ) -- Sarah Palin's book tour came through my city the other day and I scooted over to the mall , looking to get an autograph and a handshake .
Unfortunately , I got neither .
I was n't in line at 5 a.m. , so I was n't one of the 1,000 or so people who obtained the special wristband necessary to gain access to the rogue one .
However , I did get a lot of strange looks from the line , which I guess was to be expected .
After all , I 'm a black man with dreadlocks and , judging by the racial makeup of most of the cities Palin has scheduled for her tour , it does n't seem I 'm her target audience .
I 'm not suggesting that she should avoid going to places like Noblesville , Indiana , or Washington , Pennsylvania , both with overwhelmingly white populations .
It just seems that in going to few diversely populated cities , she 's purposefully steering clear of minorities .
I mean , what author with a $ 5 million book deal avoids promoting books in large cities ?
Palin 's curious tour schedule takes me right back to some of the more disturbing displays during last year 's campaign , when people at some campaign rallies at times made racist remarks .
This is not to say I believe Sarah Palin is a racist .
But she said or did very little to address the racist ugliness around her during the campaign .
In fact , she egged it on with her smiles and nods and calculated silence .
She knew she was in the midst of a dangerous fire but , instead of dousing it , she opted to feed it and bask in its warmth and light , exchanging the ethics she talked about for the votes she lusted after .
Holding different views from an opponent on abortion or the economy is one thing ; saying " He 's not one of us " in reference to then - Sen .
Obama , or ignoring the chants of " Kill him , " is totally different .
That 's not about a healthy debate over policy .
That 's using equivocal language and timely silences to massage racist views under the guise of rallying supporters .
It 's irresponsible , it 's immoral and it 's dangerous .
The Southern Poverty Law Center has found a near - 35 percent increase in antigovernment militias and white supremacist groups since 2000 , and the center said opposition to Obama 's election has only increased the phenomenon .
There was even a Facebook poll -- quickly taken down -- asking if the president should be killed .
A lot of this has nothing to do with Sarah Palin , of course .
As long as the sun shines , there will always be potentially violent racists festering along the fringes .
But for all of her speaking out in high - profile interviews -- against David Letterman , Newsweek , charges about her campaign wardrobe -- I have yet to hear Palin so much as acknowledge that some of the activity and chants at her own rallies were unacceptable .
Or that the images and hateful race - based rhetoric circulating now -- such as trying to link Obama to al Qaeda because he 's a person of color and his middle name is Hussein -- is unacceptable .
You do n't have to be black , or a Muslim , or a Democrat , or even a maverick to denounce such talk -- just a person with a conscience .
As a Midwesterner with some Southern roots , I actually have a lot in common with Palin .
I 've hunted with dogs , fished , had a kid in hockey , I go to church on Sundays and , having worked in New York and L.A. , I 've had my fair share of run-ins with elitist , liberal snobs .
This is why I am so profoundly disappointed with her .
Instead of using her popularity and influence to highlight our similarities and move the nation forward , she has allowed some of the nation 's most painful wounds to be re-opened to advance her career .
I do believe she faced a lot of sexism in her career .
But I also believe she did n't mind stirring up some " isms " of her own -- when it was politically advantageous .
In her book , Palin quotes Dr. Martin Luther King and says she was influenced by the courage of Harriet Tubman .
She mentions the challenges faced by her husband Todd , who is part Yupik Eskimo , and his family , and writes about listening to LL Cool J. " Like every other ordinary American , I 'm tired of the divisions and the special interests that pit us against each other , " she writes .
" Whatever your gender , race , or religion , if you love this country and will defend our Constitution , then you 're an American . "
If this was true , then why look into a crowd of frustrated white people and call them " real Americans " or describe the state they live in as " pro-America " ?
Who are the fake Americans ?
Where are the anti-America states ?
Can the answer be found in her book tour ?
I did n't hear any of that red -state rhetoric from her brief speech in Grand Rapids , but by snubbing many racially diverse cities , Palin is repeating that " us against them " message in a more subtle but equally effective way .
She can't blame Katie Couric for that .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson .
At the height of the Cold War when paranoia about Russia 's space program was ramping up , a 12 - year - old Denis Cox fired off an " urgent " letter to " a top scientist " at the Woomera Rocket Range containing his designs for a world - beating rocket .
Now , 52 years later , Cox will finally get a response .
Cox as a boy .
A fellow space aficionado and blogger , Bob Meade , tracked him down after the letter was dredged up by the National Archives of Australia and published on its website as the " Find of the Month " in May .
The publicity caught the eye of David Kilmartin , editor of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation 's Connections magazine .
Nouriel Roubini believes that a " wall of liquidity " is chasing all kinds of assets , yet once the economy disappoints expectations , it will all come crashing down .
Yet for Dr. Doom , gold is n't the answer .
According to him , despite the temporarily asset bubbles right now , we 're still in a deflationary world and we 'll realize it soon enough once growth stagnates and all kinds of inflated asset categories come falling down .
IndexUniverse : Roubini : I do n’t believe in gold .
Gold can go up for only two reasons .
[ One is ] inflation , and we are in a world where there are massive amounts of deflation because of a glut of capacity , and demand is weak , and there ’s slack in the labor markets with unemployment peeking above 10 percent in all the advanced economies .
So there ’s no inflation , and there ’s not going to be for the time being .
The only other case in which gold can go higher with deflation is if you have Armageddon , if you have another depression .
But we ’ve avoided that tail risk as well .
So all the gold bugs who say gold is going to go to $ 1,500 , $ 2,000 , they ’re just speaking nonsense .
Without inflation , or without a depression , there ’s nowhere for gold to go .
Yeah , it can go above $ 1,000 , but it ca n’t move up 20 - 30 percent unless we end up in a world of inflation or another depression .
I do n’t see either of those being likely for the time being .
Maybe three or four years from now , yes .
But not anytime soon .
When Job Loss Impacts Your Rights and Obligations in a Virginia Divorce
In years past , people who were going through divorces did not need to consider how the economy affected divorce - related issues .
However , today , people who fail to contemplate current market and economic issues may suffer significant consequences .
Many times , our clients come to us at a loss for what to do .
In a sense , they are frozen by the emotional trauma of divorce .
However , with over 20 years of family law experience , we know the issues in divorce .
We help our clients address critical issues in their divorce negotiations , including planning for unexpected issues — like losing a job or having your hours ( and thus your income ) cut .
Spousal Support and Alimony Modifications Are Possible in Virginia
Job loss can put undeniable and significant financial strain on someone making regular spousal support payments .
Sometimes , unfortunately , spousal support cannot be modified .
If the spousal support was ordered by the court , it can be modified if there is a material change in circumstance .
However , if spousal support was determined in an agreement , it can only be modified if there was a clause in the agreement that indicates future modifications are allowed .
If the agreement does not indicate that it can be modified , the court cannot change it — even if one party suffers job loss , illness or disability .
Therefore , if you are in the process of drafting a divorce settlement agreement , it is essential that you have a divorce lawyer who will protect your rights and interests by addressing such important issues .
Child Support Modifications Are Also Able to Be Modified
Every child has a right to be supported by both parents .
Parents do not have a right to contract away child support obligations as they may do with spousal support payments .
Therefore , by statute , child support is always modifiable .
If there has been a material change in circumstances , such as a job loss , child support obligations can be modified .

Osborne ’s descriptions of life in upper - class Edwardian London , “ an age overflowing with millionaires , ” are bracing .
Adultery is commonplace .
The country enters World War I , and while husbands and entire families of sons are obliterated on French battlefields , Sackville ’s set is desperate for fun , injecting morphine , attending “ bottle parties ” and downing vats of White Ladies , whiskey sours and Bronxes .
( “ The Bolter ” does double duty as a history of cocktails . )
Osborne vividly describes a social class unhinged by too much money and too much death .
By 1921 , “ nudity was all the rage . ”
Women were dancing on tables , wearing transparent dresses .
One hostess greeted her guests “ wearing nothing but a famous string of family pearls which reached her pubic hair . ”

Sackville ’s husband falls in love with the architect Edwin Lutyens ’s daughter , prompting Sackville ’s first bolt .
From there the narrative moves to Mombasa , where Osborne deftly sketches in the milieu of a colonial empire , with its 600 - mile Iron Snake , the Uganda Railway , which would make it possible for the British to control Egypt and the Nile .
“ All that was needed was farmers , ” Osborne writes , “ for no fewer than two and a half million acres needed tending to .
. . .
Given the unwillingness of the indigenous people to surrender their lands , all the better , went the thinking , that the territory should be occupied by men who knew how to handle a rifle . ”
With the end of the war , Britain was flooded with soldiers who wanted a new life ; Africa was “ an earthly paradise ” whose landscape was “ genuinely familiar , indeed almost Scottish , ” and would provide food for a hungry Europe .
Africa became Sackville ’s true love .
Over the course of five marriages , she would build — and leave — three farms , working side by side with the African laborers .
“ Like the local Kikuyu tribesmen and much to their amazement , ” Osborne writes , “ she both walked and rode barefoot ” over thorny fields .
But she also kept servants , rode out on safari for weeks at a time and partied hard .
She thrived on sexual adventure and set up a mirror over her bed so as not to miss anything .
Osborne is fascinating on the social rounds of this new African empire .
We catch glimpses of the Sitwells ; Cecil Beaton ; Stephen Spender ; and Beryl Markham , Karen Blixen and their lover Denys Finch Hatton .
People met at weekend house parties , races and livestock auctions .
Sackville was a magnet .
Within several years of her arrival , there were so many partners changing beds that it became a political scandal , with the British government appalled at the inability of the colonial administration to control the miscreants .
“ The joke ‘ Are you married , or do you live in Kenya ? ’ was doing the rounds . ”
The Crash of 1929 seems to have done little to stop the dizzying frivolity .
The spending never stops .
And the houses !
The extravagance of the furnishings !
At some point , as the Happy Valley crowd sank into an addled haze , I wanted to cover my eyes — probably during the “ sheet game ” : men would hide behind a sheet strung across the room , circles were cut into it through which a woman would grope a hand , a nose , an elbow , to identify the owner ; as the alcohol content went up , the holes in the sheet were cut lower , and the men unbuttoned their trousers .
Sackville is finally reunited with her eldest son , but the chaos does not end .
World War II arrives and Sackville ’s newfound connection to her family is cut short .
The last decades of her life are unbearably sad ; she seems cursed .
It can be hard to appreciate Sackville ’s incessant charm , her ability to engage and seduce anyone she wanted , her generous and kind nature , and her capacity for lifelong friendship .
But the reader falls under her sway , too .
Metasploit Project Sold To Rapid7
Open - source Metasploit penetration testing tool creator HD Moore joins Rapid7 , commercial Metasploit products to come
Vulnerability management vendor Rapid7 has purchased the popular open - source Metasploit penetration testing tool project and named Metasploit founder HD Moore chief security officer of the company .
Moore , who is synonymous with the Metasploit Project , will continue as chief architect of Metasploit in his new role at Rapid7 .
He 'll have an initial team of five Rapid7 researchers dedicated to the open - source project , some of whom already have been regular contributors to Metasploit .
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed .
Rapid7 plans to enhance its NeXpose vulnerability management product line and its own penetration testing services with Metasploit technology .
The details on how Rapid7 -- which uses Metasploit in its penetration testing engagements -- will productize Metasploit are still being ironed out : Corey Thomas , vice president of products and operations at Rapid7 , says he expects Rapid7 to keep Metasploit as a separate product with " high integration " with its existing products .
" But this is all conjecture at this time , " he says .
The goal is to leverage Metasploit 's exploit technology to help identify which vulnerabilities discovered by NeXpose are actually exploitable , according to Thomas .
" One of the things our customers have been pushing us for is how to get better data and information about their risk , " he says .
" And exploits are the key to that . "
Either way , the potential for a commercial version of Metasploit represents a major shift in the penetration testing market , where vendors such as Core Security and Immunity have offered more user - friendly tools for enterprises .
Moore says the Rapid7 acquisition of Metasploit gives the project full - time resources ; Moore and his co-developers of Metasploit traditionally have done their work on the tool after hours , during lunch breaks , and over weekends .
" We are pretty competitive with Core and Immunity based on exploit coverage and features .
But this is a great way to push the project forward ... and kick ass in the commercial sector if we want to go in that direction , " Moore says .
This also will speed turnaround of new features in Metasploit , he says .
" It 's night and day , " Moore adds .
" I can now get a feature done in a business day , not over an entire weekend ... I 'm excited to be able to work on this full - time . "
Metasploit will also have Rapid7's vast lab resources and the ability to get more exposure for the project , he says .
Opportunities for existing Metasploit contributors will expand , as well .
Both Moore and Rapid7 say they are well - aware of previous open - source and commercial marriages that have gone south , however , such as the Nessus scanning tool , which went from an open - source to a proprietary , closed - source license under Tenable Network Security .
They say they are focusing on the open - source community to leverage Metasploit .
" Our goal is to make sure we improve the open - source [ element ] , " Thomas says .
" Metasploit will remain open source . "
" My goal is if we decide to go commercial , all the features and components are going into open - source [ Metasploit , as well ] , " Moore says .
Rapid7's
Thomas says his company started talking to Moore and his Metasploit team a few months ago about how to tie in the exploit data with its products and offerings .
" How could we invest and contribute to the project over time for a more robust database [ of exploits ] at our disposal ? " he says .
" We want to use high - quality exploit data to help prioritize risk and get better insight into which attacks are most likely , " for example .
Moore says the combination of Metasploit 's exploits and Rapid7's vulnerability reports would go " a lot further than any tool in the market " today in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing .

Imagine that you 've used a free , Web - based e-mail system for years , one that does n't support the POP or IMAP protocols for downloading messages to a desktop client .
Then , one day , you want to switch to a spiffy new webmail provider — how do you do it ?
Very , very slowly .
One obvious problem with Web services is that many make it difficult to leave and take one 's data with you ( the " data as hostage " business model ) .
This is a special concern about companies like Google , which collects data in many ways and at such a rapid pace that it could conceivably lock up user data in a truly dizzying variety of ways : e-mail , blogs , search history , documents , spreadsheets , presentations , calendar , appointments , pictures , and even map route searches .
Taken together , this provides an uncomfortably complete picture of a human life .
This sort of thing will still worry privacy advocates , but those concerned more with data portability should find a lot to like in Google 's announcement today of its new Data Liberation Front .
The Front is an in - house engineering team with a simple mission statement : " Users own the data they store in any of Google 's products .
Our team 's goal is to give users greater control by making it easier for them to move data in and out . "
The team works with all of Google 's product managers to make sure that services from Gmail to Maps to Orkut to Analytics to YouTube all provide a " way out " when users decide to take their data to another service .
As a site that makes most of its advertising money on the back of user - generated content ( Web searches , e-mail , etc. ) , this seems like a smart long - term move — which is exactly Google 's plan .
" We 'd rather have loyal users who use Google products because they 're innovative — not because they lock users in , " said today 's announcement .
" You can think of this as a long - term strategy to retain loyal users , rather than the short - term strategy of making it hard for people to leave . "
According to the new project website , the Data Liberation Front is " two - thirds of the way through " its work on Google 's various services .
The team has been around internally since 2007 , but they 're now going public with a branded website and name chosen to echo " The Judean Liberation Front " in Monty Python 's Life of Brian .
The group uses open standards for data export , such as OPML for Google Reader and KML for Maps data , and is n't pushing for any new data formats .
It 's also not trying to launch a " consortium " publicly , though " we'd be thrilled if other companies followed our lead . "
For now , though , going public with the commitment to openness looks like savvy marketing ; it shows a confidence in Google 's products , and also offers a chance to remind users of the company 's ostensible non-evil nature .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- CIT Group Inc. , one of the nation 's leading funders of small and medium - sized businesses , filed for the fifth largest bankruptcy by assets in U.S. history Sunday as part of a reorganization plan that has the support of an overwhelming majority of debtholders .
In a statement , the company said it is asking the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York for a quick approval of the prepackaged plan .
CIT said none of its operating subsidiaries would be affected by the filing , allowing them to continue operations .
" The decision to proceed with our plan of reorganization will allow CIT to continue to provide funding to our small business and middle market customers , two sectors that remain vitally important to the U.S. economy , " said CIT ( CIT , Fortune 500 ) chairman Jeffrey M. Peek .
In the bankruptcy filing , CIT said it had $ 71 billion in assets and $ 64.9 billion in liabilities .
Only Lehman Brothers , Washington Mutual , Worldcom and General Motors had more in assets when they filed for protection .
CIT 's position in the business world is crucial .
It says it is the leading provider of factoring , a key element in the day - to - day financing of the retail industry .
Its key role in shipping goods is illustrated by its statement that it is the nation 's third - largest lessor of rail cars and the world 's third - largest lessor of aircraft .
While the required percentage of debtholders approved the prepackaged bankruptcy procedure , the company said it did not receive the required support from bondholders for a $ 5.9 billion debt exchange offer that would have prevented the Chapter 11 filing .
CIT said it expects the reorganization to total debt by approximately $ 10 billion , significantly reduce its liquidity needs over the next three years , enhance its capital ratios and accelerate its return to profitability .
CIT said an additional $ 4.5 billion in credit obtained Wednesday will allow it to meet the needs of its clients and continue day - to - day operations during the bankruptcy approval process .
The company said it has also obtained an additional $ 1 billion in credit to provide supplemental liquidity .
The company also said it has filed motions in the bankruptcy court to allow for the continued payment of employees , and to allow the company to pay vendors and other creditors in full .
Common shareholders , however , will be out of luck .
CIT said all existing common and preferred stock will be cancelled upon emergence from bankruptcy protection .
That would likely include preferred stock from the $ 2.3 billion in funding from the U.S. government 's Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) the company received in its efforts to stay afloat .
CIT sought a second federal bailout in July but was rejected .
It was then able to get a $ 3 billion loan from bondholders in order to stave off bankruptcy -- at least for a little while .
CIT shares were trading at 64 cents after hours Friday , having closing at 72 cents during regular trading hours .
The stock traded above $ 60 as recently as 2007 .
On Friday , it reached an agreement under which Carl Icahn , a prominent investor who had opposed the company 's efforts to reorganize .
will now support the firm 's restructuring .
Icahn 's hedge fund firm , Icahn Capital LP , will provide CIT with a $ 1 billion credit line .
The credit line can be used as debtor - in - possession financing as part of the bankruptcy procedure .
Separately , the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday that it had struck an agreement with Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) to change the terms of a loan it had originally sought from the Wall Street firm in June .
In reducing the size of the loan to $ 2.125 billion from $ 3 billion , CIT Group will pay Goldman a termination fee of $ 285 million and will post $ 250 million in collateral .
In return , Goldman agreed not to terminate the credit facility in the event of a CIT bankruptcy .
Prior to Friday 's announcement , Goldman Sachs was poised to collect $ 1 billion when CIT filed for bankruptcy , according to reports .

Add a new item to the long list of political shenanigans that backfire once discovered .
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - TX ) has decided to run for Texas governor against incumbent Rick Perry , and her new campaign website contained hidden text that read " rick perry gay . "
The resulting flap led to the firing of the Web development firm involved , drew heated responses from Perry 's office , and ( perhaps worst of all ) saw Hutchison 's campaign website yanked from Google 's search index .
Texas newspapers uncovered the hidden text last week .
The " rick perry gay " reference was one of only thousands of phrases tucked into the source code for Hutchison 's site , apparently to help draw search engine traffic .
Hutchison 's campaign initially told the Austin American - Statesman that " a vendor sold them on a tool that generates the phrases hourly or less in an attempt to divine the most frequent Web searches made by individuals who search online using one or all of the terms ' Rick Perry , ' ' Kay Bailey Hutchison ' and ' Texas ' " — and plenty of people search for " rick perry gay . "
The tool was allegedly used to help make banner ad buying decision , said the campaign , a claim that makes little sense on its face .
Why would such a list be inserted in the website 's source code unless the goal was to draw search traffic to the site ?
Whatever the reason for it , the Hutchison campaign blamed the vendor who developed the site and removed the Perry reference .
On July 30 , Google removed the campaign 's site from its search index as a penalty for using more than 2,000 hidden terms .
Yahoo then followed suit .
The campaign then announced that it was firing its Web design firm .
It also redirected the original standbykay.com to texans.forkay.com .
Rick Perry 's campaign then sent us an e-mail crowing about the situation , saying , " It is reassuring that Google and Yahoo had the sense to ban Sen .
Hutchison 's attempt at more anonymous dirty tricks and under - handed black hat tactics .
This is remarkable third - party validation that Sen .
Hutchison is taking the low road in a campaign that should be about the issues .
We look forward to the senator breaking her embarrassed silence with an apology to Gov. Perry . "
While the issue will no doubt blow over like a Texas rain shower , it could have longer - term consequences for the site vendor , the nonpartisan ElectionMall .
The DC - based firm builds and manages websites , mailing lists , and online stores , but stuffing your website with thousands of search terms and getting a candidate temp - banned from Yahoo and Google does n't look good on the old r�sum� .
Video : Undergoing hypnosis
The power of hypnotism ( Image : figlioDiOrfeo♥ / Flickr )
I AM about to have my left leg paralysed , my arm taken over by an alien force and , quite possibly , be made blind .
I confess I ’m a bit nervous .
But also , strangely , I hope it all works .
These insults to my body will not be inflicted with a scalpel , but instead induced using hypnosis .
The effects , if they occur , will only be temporary , my hypnotist , David Oakley , reassures me .
It ’s all being done in the interest of science .
Oakley is an emeritus professor at University College London .
He is one of a handful of researchers who hope that by taking hypnosis seriously , they will help to dispel its quackery - tainted image ( see “ What is hypnosis ? ” ) .
“ I think hypnosis is underaccepted and undervalued , ” says psychologist Irving Kirsch at the University of Hull , UK .
“ Partly because of lurid tales published in books and movies , which lead to views of hypnosis as a strange and unbelievable state .
Still many people scoff . ”
Aside from improving the reputation of hypnosis , Oakley also aims to better understand some of the strangest neurological conditions out there .
The idea is to use hypnosis to induce symptoms in otherwise healthy people .
This creates “ virtual patients ” with symptoms that can literally be switched on and off with a snap of the fingers , making it easier to study the abnormal brain activity that causes them .
“ It ’s like reverse engineering , ” says Peter Halligan , a neuropsychologist at Cardiff University , UK , who works with Oakley .
“ It ’s only when things break down that you appreciate the mechanism involved . ”
“ They create virtual patients with symptoms that can be switched on and off …
It wo n't go zero to 60 , but it will go for 40 miles on a single charge .
The Wheego Whip zoomed around the City by the Bay on September 2 , with a test drive tackling San Francisco 's steep hills and narrow dead - end streets .
The all - electric low - speed vehicle is headed to dealerships on Friday , September 4th , and retails for just less than $ 19,000 .
With federal and state incentives , this all - electric car could be a great benefit for companies looking to green their fleets .
The Whip will cost approximately $ 0.03 per mile to operate and estimates the lithium lead battery pack will last about seven years , according to CEO Mike McQuary .
The full - speed version of the Wheego is currently undergoing crash tests , and the company hopes the highway - safe vehicle will be ready soon .
While he did not have a lifetime total cost of ownership figure , McQuary said there are few maintenance costs with no oil to change and very little transmission fluid and brake fluid used .
For a small business such as the solar panel installer A1 Sun , based in Berkeley , Calif. , using an all - electric low speed vehicle is a great way to reduce the company 's carbon footprint .
CEO Larry Giustino purchased a Zenn car two years ago from Berkeley 's only all electric vehicle dealer because it was the only " real car " that was available .
The Zenn 's maximum speed is only 25 miles per hour , but Guistino noted that there are times when an extra 10 mph –- or having a highway - capable vehicle -- would be beneficial to his business .
At the University of California , Berkeley , the fleet system is decentralized , so each department is in charge of deciding which vehicle to purchase -- which can make purchasing electric cars challenging , said Eric Robinson , the fleet administrator , in a telephone interview .
Robinson said he has the power to approve or deny requests from departments , but said he " promote [s ] low speed or all - electric vehicles as heavily as we can , " especially for departments that drive less than 3,000 miles per year .
Greening the university 's fleet is just one way the campus is working to reduce its carbon footprint .
{related_content}
The Berkeley campus currently has 24 electric vehicles , including three Zenn cars , several GEM cars and two Toyota Rav - 4s that were spared from destruction .
While some departments may only use their vehicles in town , Robinson noted that a highway - capable electric vehicle could help persuade purchasers who are on the fence .
" If they have the perception there is a limitation they are hesitant [ to purchase an all - electric vehicle ] , " he said .
If purchased in the remaining months of 2009 , owners can get a $ 7,500 tax credit for the low - speed vehicles and beginning in 2010 , there is a 10 percent federal tax credit for the first 200,000 units of the Whip .
Not to mention the state incentives : in California , zero emission vehicles can drive in the HOV lane with a single passenger , and in Oklahoma , there is a 50 % state tax credit , in addition to the federal incentive .
While the Wheego may not be suited for Oklahoma 's sprawling metro area ( around 600 square miles ) , it could be perfect for many different fleet applications , said Ryan Deatherage , president of Amp Control , Inc . The Piedmont , Okla . - based company sells electric and remote - controlled mowers , in addition to the Wheego .
Deatherage noted that courier services , flower delivery services , and security services could benefit from having an all - electric vehicle in their fleet .
Amp Control has already sold three of the five
Wheegos it has been allocated , he said .
Wheego 's McQuary said 100 of these low - speed
Whips are on their way to dealerships , but if a large company wanted to purchase 100 for their fleet , it would take approximately six weeks to assemble them in their plant in Ontario , Calif .
Trivia
Principal photography for Ip Man ( 2008 ) began in March 2008 and ended in August ; filming took place in Shanghai , which was used to architecturally recreate Foshan .
During filming , conflicts arose between the movie 's producers and filmmaker Kar - Wai Wong over the film 's working title .
Wong , who had been developing his own Ip Man biopic , clashed with the producers after learning that their film would be titled " Grandmaster Ip Man , " which was too similar to the title of the other film .
The producers agreed to change the film title , despite Wong 's film being in development hell .
Kar - wai's film , titled The Grandmaster ( 2013 ) , was released on January 10 , 2013 .

A federal judge on Thursday ordered a Santa Cruz company to immediately quit selling Beatles and other music on its online site , setting aside a preposterous argument that it had copyrights on songs via a process called “ psycho- acoustic simulation . ”
A Los Angeles federal judge set aside arguments from Hank Risan , owner of BlueBeat and other companies named as defendants in the lawsuit EMI filed on Tuesday .
His novel defense to allegations he was unlawfully selling the entire stereo Beatles catalog without permission was that he — and not EMI or the Beatles ’ Apple Corp — owns these sound recordings , because he re-recorded new versions of the songs using what he termed “ psycho- acoustic simulation . ”
Risan faces perhaps millions of dollars in damages under the Copyright Act .
And copyright attorneys said his defense was laughable and carries no weight .
If successful , however , it would have turned copyright on its head , leaving musical rightsholders defenseless against wanton infringement .
“ They ’re hosed .
That just does n’t make any sense , ” said Scott Mackenzie , a Dallas copyright attorney .
“ I do n’t even see the basis of their theory . ”
Ben Sheffner , of the Copyrights and Campaigns blog , points out that BlueBeat ’s defense rested on copyright law allowing musicians to produce cover versions of songs for a licensing fee .
“ It does not permit a company to re-record a recording by some new technical means — even a ‘ psycho - acoustic simulation ’ device — and then sell the ‘ new ’ recordings , ” Sheffner , a copyright attorney , wrote .
Risan told EMI in an e-mail ( Exhibit A , below ) that he successfully registered his “ new ” copyrights with the United States Copyright Office .
The ID3 tags of the Beatles songs sold on BlueBeat.com list “ 2009 BlueBeat.com ” as the copyright holder .
“ Defendants independently developed their own original sounds , ” BlueBeat told the court .
But U.S. District Judge John F. Walter was not buying it , ruling ( .pdf ) BlueBeat did not submit “ any declarations or reliable evidence in support of their claim that they ‘ independently developed their own original sounds . ' ”
Neither Risan nor his attorneys returned inquiries for comment to explain the company ’s “ psycho- acoustic simulation ” method .
To get a sense of how much these “ new ” recordings resemble the originals , listen to this short sample of The Beatles ’ “ Sun King , ” which I purchased from BlueBeat.com on Friday :

GINOWAN , Japan ( Reuters ) - Thousands of Japanese gathered in sweltering heat on the southern island of Okinawa on Sunday to demand that a U.S. Marine base be moved out of the region , days ahead of a visit by President Barack Obama .
The row over the re-siting of the Futenma air base threatens to stall a realignment of the 47,000 U.S. military personnel in Japan and sour defense ties between the two countries , seen as key in a region home to a rising China and an unpredictable North Korea .
It could also prove a domestic headache for Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama , whose support ratings have slipped since his landslide election victory in August .
“ Okinawa ’s future is for us , the Okinawan people to decide , ” Ginowan mayor Yoichi Iha told a supportive crowd which spilled out of an open - air theater by the beach .
“ We can not let America decide for us . ”
Organizers put the number of protesters at 21,000 .
Under a 2006 U.S. - Japan agreement , the Futenma Marine base in the center of the city of Ginowan is set to be closed and replaced with a facility built partly on reclaimed land at Henoko , a remoter part of the island , by 2014 .
The deal , which Washington wants to push through after years of what a military official called “ painful ” negotiations , is part of a wider plan to re-organize U.S. troops and reduce the burden on Okinawa by moving up to 8,000 Marines to Guam .

U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has urged Japan to approve the plan ahead of Obama ’s visit , which is scheduled to start on November 12 .
EMOTIVE ISSUE
Hatoyama , who has vowed to build a more equal relationship with the United States , said in the run-up to his August election victory the base should be moved off the island .
That view was supported by 70 percent of Okinawa residents in a poll published this month by the Mainichi newspaper .
“ I think getting rid of Futenma would be a good starting point for the removal of all the U.S. bases from Okinawa , ” said a 60 - year - old woman at Sunday ’s protest , who gave her name only as Shinzato .
Okinawa , controlled by the United States until 1972 , makes up only 0.6 percent of Japan ’s land mass , but hosts about half the U.S. troops in Japan .

“ Nature is important , but the primary responsibility of a politician is to protect people ’s lives and property , ” said Kosuke Gushi , a regional assemblyman with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party that signed off on the plan while in government .
He and other backers of the existing plan , including Ginowan businessmen , say they are concerned re-opening the issue will mean an indefinite delay to the closure of Futenma , where a 2004 helicopter crash added to fears over safety .
Gushi also sees the row as potentially undermining Japan ’s U.S. - dependent security policy , leaving the country vulnerable .
“ If we ca n’t provide the bases as we have pledged to do under the U.S. - Japan security treaty , the Americans could pull out and say they are no longer responsible , ” Gushi said .
Hatoyama has said he needs time to review the existing base plan , but his Defense Minister Toshimi Kitazawa has more or less endorsed the current agreement .

Tens of thousands of Yemenis have been displaced by fighting
A number of displaced Yemenis have been killed during a fight between the army and rebels at a camps run by the UN refugee agency , the agency has said .
The UNHCR described women and children being among the dead and injured at al - Sam camp in Saada province , but was not able to supply the exact numbers .
It said the deaths occurred when a rocket or a mortar shell hit the camp .
Saada has seen some of the worst fighting between the government and Houthi rebels from the Zaidi Shia sect .
The UN said around 500 people were staying at the facility and that the security situation in that area had been " deteriorating over the past few days " with " indiscriminate targeting of Yemeni civilians forced to flee their homes " .
Houthi rebels first took up arms against the government in 2004 .
They say they want greater autonomy and an public role for their version of Shia Islam , complaining of discrimination by the government in Sanaa .
Yemeni officials accuse Houthis , who are the majority in the north of Yemen , of wanting to re-establish Shia clerical rule .
The government launched a fresh offensive in August 2009 which has precipitated a new wave of intense fighting .
Aid agencies say tens of thousands of people have been displaced .
Researchers Researchers at the Swedish medical university Karolinska Institutet have discovered a mechanism that controls the brain 's ability to create lasting memories .
In experiments on genetically manipulated mice , they were able to switch on and off the animals ' ability to form lasting memories by adding a substance to their drinking water .
The findings , which are published in the scientific journal PNAS , are of potential significance to the future treatment of Alzheimer 's and stroke .
" We are constantly being swamped with sensory impression , " says Professor Lars Olson , who led the study .
" After a while , the brain must decide what 's to be stored long term .
It 's this mechanism for how the connections between nerve fibers are altered so as to store selected memories that we 've been able to describe . "
The ability to convert new sensory impressions into lasting memories in the brain is the basis for all learning .
Much is known about the first steps of this process , those that lead to memories lasting a few hours , whereby altered signalling between neurons causes a series of chemical changes in the connections between nerve fibers , called synapses .
However , less is understood about how the chemical changes in the synapses are converted into lasting memories stored in the cerebral cortex .
A research group team at Karolinska Institutet has now discovered that signalling via a receptor molecule called nogo receptor 1 ( NgR1 ) in the nerve membrane plays a key part in this process .
When nerve cells are activated , the gene for NgR1 is switched off , and the team suspected that this inactivation might be important in the creation of long - term memories .
To test this hypothesis they created mice with an extra NgR1 gene that could remain active even when the normal NgR1 was switched off .
" Doing this , we found that the ability to retain something in the memory for the first 24 hours was normal in the genetically modified mice , " says Professor Olson .
" However , two different memory tests showed that the mice had serious difficulties converting their normal short - term memories to long - term ones , the kind that last for months . "
In order to be able to switch the extra NgR1 gene on and off , the group attached a regulatory mechanism to the gene that reacted to a harmless additive in their drinking water .
When the extra gene was then switched off , the mice retained their normal ability to form long - term memories .
By subsequently switching it off at different times after a memory - forming event , they were able to pinpoint the effect of the NgR1 gene to the first week after such an event .
" We know that concussion can cause someone to forget events that occurred in the week before the injury , what we call retrograde amnesia , even though they can remember events that occurred earlier than about a week before .
This we believe tallies with our findings , " says Alexandra Karlén , one of the scientists involved in the study .
The scientists hope that their findings will eventually be of use in the development of new treatments for memory impairments , such as those related to Alzheimer 's and stroke .
Medicines designed to target the NgR1 receptor system would be able to improve the brain 's ability to form long - term memories .
The studies were conducted in collaboration with American researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) , NIH .

Never let the absurdities of history get in the way of a box - office blockbuster .
The inside story of the cozy relationship between big box office American war movies and the Pentagon .
Hollywood 's dirty little secret
02/20/05 " The Age " - -
It 's the scripts that pay a high price when Hollywood goes into battle .
Brian Courtis looks at one of the movie world ’s murkier truths .
Well , we 've known the rules .
We 've known them since Errol Flynn liberated Burma without any help from British , Australian or New Zealand forces .
Churchill and a few Diggers may have been upset , but the fact is when it comes to Hollywood only the good guys win and , since we 're playing with their toys , those good guys must inevitably be Americans .
Never let the absurdities of history get in the way of a box - office blockbuster .
They really do not want to discuss this , of course , in Tinseltown .
They still see only their heroes and our villains .
And they continue to win everything alone .
Remember Steven Spielberg 's D - Day spectacular Saving Private Ryan ?
Someone simply forgot that 72,000 British and Canadian troops were also involved .
And if Hollywood is to be believed , it was the Americans who captured the Enigma coding machine from a German submarine ; never mind that the Brits were there and accomplished that six months before the Yanks entered the war .
Not everything has been quite so eagerly promoted .
We hear less , for instance , about the effects of the powerful relationship that has grown over the years between the Pentagon and the Hollywood studios , a partnership that not only can save millions of dollars for filmmakers and produce fine recruiting propaganda for Washington , but can twist history and reality to produce the ultimate in international spin .
In Operation Hollywood , filmmaker Emilio Pacull follows up an investigative study by film industry journalist Dave Robb on the help producers have sought from the military over the years .
Robb , who worked for Variety and The Hollywood Reporter , says he found himself obsessed with the minutiae of these negotiations with the boys with ships , tanks , materiel , information , bases , access to land , troops and some very real - looking fireworks .
His report , a page - by - page study of scripts submitted by the studios to the Pentagon , reveals an intriguing pattern of censorship and propaganda .
For Hollywood , acceptance of this system means the difference between " full co-operation " and no co-operation .
For the military , it involves maintaining an idealised image of the forces , their behaviour , their view of the world , the superiority of their form of patriotism , and for that matter , their reasons for going to war .
So why , they would argue , should the Pentagon spend its money on pacifism or promoting the darker side of the soldier 's world ?
Why reward a Platoon when The Green Berets is what you 're after ?
Among those with an opinion in Operation Hollywood are Australian director Phil Noyce , Phil Strub from the US Department of Defence , historian Lawrence Suid and Joe Trento , author and president of the anti-war Public Education Centre .
This , they all agree , is a world where lines , plots and nationalities are changed so that film producers can gain access to expensive military hardware .
In the 1995 James Bond movie Goldeneye , for example , the original script had a US Navy admiral betraying state secrets .
This was changed to make the traitor a member of the French navy .
After that the military 's co-operation was forthcoming .
Pacull and Robb takes us from the pedantry to the powerful in examining the changes to scripts .
They list the producers and the movies that have fallen into line and show how the military 's script editors work .
Interestingly , it 's not the censors who come under fire here quite so much as those co-operative , self - censoring filmmakers .
Still , as Robb says , in what has become ostensibly his campaign against this system , the long - term effect on generations of young Americans is an unknown .
“ How many of those killed in Iraq died because they joined up after they saw what was presented in a film ? ”
How many have died as the result of unknown recruiting propaganda ?
All a producer needs do for assistance , it seems , is submit five copies of his script to the Pentagon for approval , make whatever script changes the Pentagon suggests , film the script exactly as approved by the Pentagon and preview the finished product for Pentagon officials before it 's shown to its broader audience .
And , according to Robb , as he puts the boot firmly into Jerry Bruckheimer , Tom Goldberg ( Stripes ) , John Woo and other producers and directors , many do this gladly .
It is , he insists , Hollywood 's dirtiest little secret .
Not that the big screen is alone .
Among the early changes we hear about is a scene from an episode of the children 's television series Lassie in which a light aircraft crashing in the woods concerned the Pentagon .
A change to the script was called for .
The military did n't want children , the subject of its future recruitment drives , to get the idea that the US Army produced faulty equipment .
Not surprisingly , Washington will back what it sees as the positive message every time .
There is enthusiasm for such gung - ho films as The Longest Day , Top Gun or , believe it or not , Pearl Harbor .
There is no point talking to them about Apocalypse Now , Platoon or Dr Strangelove .
As for films about the wounded and traumatised victims of war , concentration camp horror , or civilian casualties ... well , that has nothing to do with them , does it ?
Use your imagination , however , and make a heroic star of yet another four - star general and you will be marching step - in - step with America 's medal - winning movie buffs .
And be rewarded for it .
There are other ways to win the day .
It would be interesting , for example , to see how the Pentagon would react to the sentimental reflections on wartime that British television so enjoys .
In the escapism of Foyle 's War , for example , the message is one of sacrifice and understanding .
Michael Kitchen's wise old police chief , Foyle , uses wisdom , patience and tolerance in an idyllic Sussex setting against petty crimes and sabotage .
This , rather than some one - sided battlefield slaughter , shows us the old values we 're fighting for .
Soldiers and civilians are generally given positive treatment ; blimpish landowners , politicians and generals get short shrift .
This week , in They Fought In The Fields , the sweet and splendid Sam ( Honeysuckle Weeks ) is on the farm with a troubled gang of land girls , while her boss is out sorting spies from prisoners of war .
There are few fireworks , few toys from the boys , but a gal 's still gotta do what a gal 's gotta do .

A team of pioneering South Korean scientists have succeeded in producing the polymers used for everyday plastics through bioengineering , rather than through the use of fossil fuel based chemicals .
This groundbreaking research , which may now allow for the production of environmentally conscious plastics , is published in two papers in the journal Biotechnology and Bioengineering to mark the journal 's 50th anniversary .
Polymers are molecules found in everyday life in the form of plastics and rubbers .
The team , from the prestigious KAIST University and the Korean chemical company LG Chem , led by Professor Sang Yup Lee focused their research on Polylactic Acid ( PLA ) , a bio - based polymer which holds the key to producing plastics through natural and renewable resources .
" The polyesters and other polymers we use everyday are mostly derived from fossil oils made through the refinery or chemical process , " said Lee .
" The idea of producing polymers from renewable biomass has attracted much attention due to the increasing concerns of environmental problems and the limited nature of fossil resources .
PLA is considered a good alternative to petroleum based plastics as it is both biodegradable and has a low toxicity to humans . "
Until now PLA has been produced in a two - step fermentation and chemical process of polymerization , which is both complex and expensive .
Now , through the use of a metabolically engineered strain of E.coli , the team , have developed a one - stage process which produces polylactic acid and its copolymers through direct fermentation .
This makes the renewable production of PLA and lactate - containing copolymers cheaper and more commercially viable .
" By developing a strategy which combines metabolic engineering and enzyme engineering , we 've developed an efficient bio - based one - step production process for PLA and its copolymers , " said Lee .
" This means that a developed E. coli strain is now capable of efficiently producing unnatural polymers , through a one - step fermentation process , "
This combined approach of systems - level metabolic engineering and enzyme engineering now allows for the production of polymer and polyester based products through direct microbial fermentation of renewable resources .
" Global warming and other environmental problems are urging us to develop sustainable processes based on renewable resources , " concluded Lee .
" This new strategy should be generally useful for developing other engineered organisms capable of producing various unnatural polymers by direct fermentation from renewable resources " .

NEW YORK --
When the phone rang , Zack Greinke let it go -- he did n't recognize the number .
Only after listening to the voice mail did he call back and find out he'd won the American League Cy Young Award .
The Kansas City Royals ace easily beat out Felix Hernandez for the honor Tuesday after a spectacular season short on wins but long on domination .
Winning left the extremely shy Greinke with mixed emotions .
" Back in Orlando , I have n't really got a whole lot of attention from people , which has been nice , " he said .
" So I hope it does n't get that way , where everyone is like , ' Oh , hey , Zack , hi . ' "
He 'd prefer to remain anonymous when he 's not on the mound .
He 's not looking forward to being introduced at banquets as " Cy Young Award winner Zack Greinke " for the rest of his life .
" In that way , it 's kind of like a negative for me , " he said .
It 's been quite a turnaround for Greinke , who led the AL in losses in 2005 and quit baseball for six weeks the following year after being diagnosed with a social anxiety disorder .
Greinke went 16 - 8 with a major league - low 2.16 ERA this season and received 25 of 28 first - place votes and three seconds for 134 points in balloting by the Baseball Writers ' Association of America .
Hernandez , 19 - 5 with a 2.49 ERA for the Seattle Mariners , drew two firsts , 23 seconds and one third for 80 points .
" I thought it was going to be real close between the two of us , " Greinke said .
Detroit's Justin Verlander was third with the remaining first - place vote and 14 points , followed by the Yankees ' CC Sabathia ( 13 ) and Toronto 's Roy Halladay ( 11 ) .
" Greinke deserved it .
Before the season was over , I said my vote was for him , " Hernandez said in Venezuela .
" This has taught me that I need to be perfect , I will prepare myself to be stronger next season .
I will need a superb year because just a good one , it 's not enough , " he said .
The NL winner will be announced Thursday .
Despite what he 's overcome , Greinke does n't view himself as a role model .
" I really do n't like having a bunch of attention , so even if I did see myself in that light , I do n't do anything about it , " he said .
" I 'm real uncomfortable doing stuff like that , to be around people and doing stuff like that , " he said .
Very different types of political whores
And you 'd better not forget it .
Some things transcend partisan ID , political party , ideology and the rest , not the least of which is the class solidarity of the stinking Inside the Beltway elite .
Alan Grayson did n't say they should all be lined up against a wall and shot ; he probably would n't even agree with that as an excellent way to help get the country back on a good footing -- especially because there actually are some good one in the lot .
But one of those good ones is decidedly not Linda Robertson .
Inside the Beltway hacks -- even some relatively good ones , policy - wise , are all over Grayson for referring to Robertson , a lobbyist recently hired as a public relations operative ( or lobbyist ) for the Federal Reserve , as " a K Street whore . "
None of the outraged and offended congressmembers -- who realize a charge like this is an affront to all of their self - proclaimed senses of dignity -- cares to discuss the substance of the claim .
But she was , after all , the head of Enron 's lobbying office -- a position that defines the word " whore .
"
The characterization is a little too close for comfort for almost any member of Congress , since so many of them are whores as well , taking immense sums of money from the very corporations on whose interests they are legislating .
Hence the outrage over Grayson 's plainspoken declaration .
Robertson 's current job is to paint a rosy picture of an institution , the Fed , at the heart of the near collapse of the American financial structure .
A former close associate of Wall Street shill Lawrence Summers and of bankster Robert Rubin , Robertson was already blackballed for a job at Treasury because the Obama Administration was still trying to persuade people ( and itself ) that they did n't hire lobbyists .
Now , you might ask , are all lobbyists whores ?
Well , maybe not a lobbyist for the Society for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or a lobbyist for a firm urging the beating of swords into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks -- but that 's not the kind of lobbyist Robertson has ever been .
Pure and simple , Grayson hit that nail on the head : she 's always been a whore .
Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers ( R - WA ) took Grayson 's remark quite personally -- and for good reason .
Shrieking that Grayson " is out of control " -- one of the reasons why so many Americans love him -- she did n't mention that she sits on the Committee on Natural Resources ( and it 's subcommittee on water and power ) and has solicited immense sums of money ( thinly veiled bribes ) from forest products companies , oil and gas companies , and electric utilities and , coincidentally , I 'm sure , votes in their interests and against the public interest .
And if people start calling lobbyists like Linda Robertson whores , how long before they start realizing that the Honorable Congresswoman from Spokane is also a whore -- as are almost all of her colleagues .
Of course it is n't only corrupt Republicans who found Grayson 's candid assessment a little too close for comfort .
The king of Democratic Party congressional whores , the Honorable Steny Hoyer , called the remark " inappropriate and unfair . "
Steny 's office once asked me to interview him -- it was when he was running for Majority Leader and noticed I was far from a fan of his rival , Jack Murtha ( another corrupt disgrace ) -- and only asked I observe one ground rule .
" Please do n't call him a shill or a whore . "
Ron Paul 's legions , on the other hand , knew exactly what Grayson was talking about .
If you do n't know about K Street whores , may I suggest you read a fantastic book by Ken Silverstein , Turkmeniscam , the exposé on the relationship between lobbyists and members of Congress and those looking to buy congressional support .
I might add that the Blue America ActBlue page , Getting Grayson 's Back , is still open .

Note : The Pakistani military has launched its offensive in South Waziristan since this article was published .
With the Taliban offensive against military , police , and government installations as well as against soft civilian targets in full swing , the Pakistani government and military have been forced to make a decision on taking the fight to the Taliban .
The operation has been discussed since early June , when the military claimed it was moving into South Waziristan to defeat Baitullah Mehsud ’s forces .
But moving into South Waziristan via the ground was tabled and replaced with punitive air and artillery strikes designed to weaken the Taliban .
While discussions about an operation were underway just prior to the current Taliban terror offensive , the military was content with pushing an operation back until next year .
But after a spate of attacks , including terror assault teams striking at the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi and three police centers in Lahore , action against the Taliban in South Waziristan could no longer be delayed .
Following a meeting between senior military and government leaders on Oct. 16 , the Pakistani Army has been given the green light to attack in the Taliban stronghold of South Waziristan .
The operation will target the Mehsud branch of the Taliban in South Waziristan , as this group is deemed to be the major threat against Pakistan .
A military offensive in Waziristan will pit Pakistani troops against the best fighters the Taliban have to offer .
The military has been defeated four times in South Waziristan since 2004 , and has signed a series humiliating peace agreements in an effort to keep the Taliban at bay .
Instead , the Taliban insurgency has metastasized throughout the tribal areas and into the Northwest Frontier Province .
The Waziristan Taliban
The Waziristan region is divided into two tribal agencies , North and South Waziristan .
There are four major Taliban figures in the two agencies , with an array of allied terror groups based in the region .
The operation will focus on only one Taliban group , based in South Waziristan .
In North Waziristan , the Haqqani Network operates in and around Miramshah , while Hafiz Gul Bahadar controls much of North Waziristan .
Other Taliban commanders include Saddiq Noor and Maulana Abdul Khaliq Haqqani .
Al Qaeda operative Abu Kasha al Iraqi runs a fiefdom in the Mir Ali region .
In South Waziristan , the two main Taliban leaders are Waliur Rehman Mehsud , based in the Makeen - Ladha - Sararogha region , and Mullah Nazir , based in the Wana region .
Qari Hussain Mehsud , the notorious trainer of child suicide bombers and a senior military commander , is based in Kotkai .
Al Qaeda , the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan , the Islamic Jihad Union , Hezb - i- Islami Gulbuddin , and a host of Pakistani jihadi groups such as the Jaish - e - Mohammed , the Lashkar - e - Taiba , the Lashkar - e - Jhangvi , and the Harakat - ul - Mujahideen all have bases in both North and South Waziristan .
The target
The Pakistani military has made it clear that the operation will be limited to South Waziristan and will focus on the Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan , which is run by Hakeemullah Mehsud and based throughout the tribal areas and the wider Northwest Frontier Province .
Waliur Rehman Mehsud runs the South Waziristan branch of the Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan .
The military has sought to sideline the Haqqanis , Bahadar , and Nazir in order to focus on the Mehsud branch of the Taliban in South Waziristan .
The military purportedly has cut a deal with Nazir to remain out of the fight , and is currently in negotiations with Bahadar .
The Haqqanis project little power in North Waziristan as the bulk of their forces are oriented towards the eastern Afghan provinces of Paktia , Paktika , and Khost .
It is imperative that the Army keep Nazir and Bahadar out of the fight as it does not have sufficient forces to take on all three groups at once .
Even if sidelined , Bahadar and Nazir likely will provide safe havens and supplies to the Mehsuds to bleed the Pakistani Army .
The Mehsud Taliban are estimated to have 10,000 hardened , trained fighters who have battled both the Pakistani Army during past operations and NATO forces in Afghanistan .
Another 20,000 tribal fighters are thought to be at the disposal of the Taliban ; the Mehsud tribes have backed the Taliban in the past and there are few indications they will not do so in an upcoming operation .
Nazir is estimated to have 5,000 to 10,000 experienced fighters , and Bahadar another 20,000 .
The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan is also thought to have substantial forces in the region .
It is estimated that some 500 to 6,000 Central Asian fighters are at the disposal of the Taliban .
Another 30,000 Taliban fighters from Bajaur , Swat , Mohmand , Arakzai , Kurram , Kohat , and throughout the northwest are potentially at the disposal of Hakeemullah .
However , with military operations underway in many of these areas , these forces are likely to be tied down .
The Pakistani military
The Pakistani Army is said to have been massing two or more divisions , or an estimated 28,000 soldiers , on the outskirts of the Makeen - Ladha - Sararogha region .
The Pakistani military is tight - lipped on deployments , so it is unclear what type of forces are arrayed against the Taliban .
Given past operations in Bajaur , Swat , and Waziristan , the military will likely rely heavily on infantry from both the regular Army and the paramilitary Frontier Corps , supported by tank formations and air and artillery assets .
In the past , the military has not deployed its advanced armor against the Taliban , but instead has relied on older , poorly armored tanks .
Troops are often transported in pickup trucks and open - bed trucks , making them susceptible to deadly IED and suicide attacks and ambushes .
The Pakistani Air Force has deployed F - 16 fighter - bombers and the Army has deployed Cobra attack helicopter gunships to target the Taliban by air , and has relied on artillery to pound bunkers and bases from the ground .
Pakistani air and ground fire has been typically heavy - handed ; villages are often attacked indiscriminately , increasing the odds of civilian casualties .
The military has the advantage of having the vast resources of the state to throw into the battle against the Taliban .
One question that remains unanswered is the will of the senior military and political leaders .
Some senior military leaders are reluctant to destroy the Taliban as they are viewed as assets against the Indians .
And the Pakistani government is ultimately beholden to the military .
Also , there are varying reports of troop morale in the wake of the operation in Swat , where the military has been successful in dislodging the Taliban during the spring and summer .
Some reports claim the officer and enlisted ranks are flush with success , while others claim the troops suffered heavy casualties and some units refused to fight .
During prior operations in Waziristan , some units refused to fight or surrendered en masse without firing a shot .
The battlefield
The terrain in both North and South Waziristan is a difficult place for a modern army to fight .
Thick with mountains and having few roads to support large - scale troop movements , the ground favors the defenders .
Winter snows usually begin in November and block the mountain passes .
The Taliban have been in overt control of the region since 2004 and have had time to prepare the battlefield .
They will have dispersed ammunition and weapons caches , built bunkers and fighting positions , and seeded the region with mines ( IEDs ) .
The Taliban have fought on this ground and know it well ; they have defeated the Pakistani Army in four separate engagements since 2004 [ see below ] .
There are three main roads leading to the Makeen / Ladha region : from Ramzak in the north ( in North Waziristan ) , Wana in the southwest , and Jandola in the southeast .
The military maintains brigade - sized garrisons in these three towns , which will be important hubs for the operation .
The Taliban will operate in small units , melt into the population , and focus on ambushing supply and troop columns on these three roads in an attempt to cut off and kill Army and Frontier Corps units .
The Taliban will also attempt to hit the military in Ramzak , Jandola , and Wana to prove they can strike where the military is mustering .
The Pakistani military will attempt to control the roads ; occupy the high ground ; set up garrison in the towns ; and starve out , freeze out , and bomb out the Taliban .
Since June , the military has sought to isolate the Mehsud Taliban by blockading major roads and cutting off supplies to the Makeen - Ladha - Sararogha region .
But the military has been clear that it has not blocked off secondary routes and traditional smuggling paths .
The Pakistani military has relied on airstrikes and artillery barrages to weaken the Taliban and destroy bunkers and bases .
The US has also weighed in with a series of unmanned Predator and Reaper strikes aimed at Taliban leaders and camps .
The campaign was ramped up from mid-June through July ( nine straight US airstrikes in South Waziristan were carried out in six weeks ) , and culminated in the Aug. 5 attack that killed Baitullah Mehsud , the former leader of the Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan .
The wild card : the US
The US has a vested interest in Pakistan succeeding against the Taliban in South Waziristan .
The US has argued that Taliban fighters based in the region have been conducting attacks against NATO and Afghan forces in Afghanistan .
The US is reportedly rushing arms and equipment , including guided munitions for aircraft and helicopters , night vision equipment , and other aid to help the Pakistani military , which has said it lacks proper equipment to take on the Taliban .
But recent reports indicate the Pakistani military has been funneling US support allocated to fight the Taliban to units on the border with country ’s traditional enemy , India .
The US will also likely provide intelligence support .
Unmanned US aircraft can provide ISR ( intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ) support to Pakistani forces .
Predators and Reapers can even be used to strike Taliban positions .
US special operations forces are unlikely to be engaged due to political difficulties .
The Pakistani military does not want US forces operating on the ground and fear that knowledge of this will stir up support for the Taliban .
While a Pakistani military offensive in South Waziristan will be welcomed , the US will find that the operation will fall well short of crushing the Taliban threat from Pakistan .
The Pakistani government and military , by focusing on the Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan , is targeting the one group that directly threatens the Pakistani state , while leaving Taliban groups that operate primarily in Afghanistan ( Nazir , Haqqanis , Bahadar ) intact .
The Pakistani government will also find that the Taliban is not merely based in South Waziristan , but has tentacles throughout the northwest and in Punjab , Sindh , and Baluchistan provinces .
The “ Punjabi Taliban ” have taken credit for the recent attacks in Lahore and Rawalpindi , while the Pakistani jihadi groups created by the military to fight in Kashmir have allied with the Taliban as well .
Past operations in Waziristan
The Pakistani military has avoided directly confronting the Taliban in North and South Waziristan after suffering a string of humiliating defeats there between 2004 and 2008 .
The most recent operations in Waziristan resulted in peace agreements that have ceded control of the region to the Taliban .
The last time the Pakistani military took on the Taliban in North Waziristan was in October 2007 .
The Pakistani military and the Taliban fought pitched battles after the military launched artillery barrages and helicopter and attack aircraft assaults against Taliban - controlled villages in North Waziristan .
The Taliban responded by setting up complex ambushes , including surface - to - air missile traps , a senior US military intelligence official told The Long War Journal .
Several Pakistani
Army helicopters were said to have been shot down during the fighting .
The Pakistani military claimed that 120 Taliban and 45 soldiers were killed in the fighting , but independent reports put the number of soldiers killed much higher .
At the end of October 2007 , the government pushed for a peace deal , and the fighting waned .
The Taliban , led by the Haqqani Network and Hafiz Gul Bahadar , remained entrenched in the region .
In February 2008 , an official peace agreement was signed .
The military has insisted the agreement rains intact to this day , despite a spate of Taliban attacks against the military during the summer of 2009 .
The Taliban even negated the agreement .
The last major operation against the Taliban in South Waziristan took place in late January 2008 .
The military launched an offensive with the declared aim of dislodging Baitullah Mehsud ’s forces from entrenched positions .
Prior to the military ’s offensive , the Taliban overran two military forts and conducted numerous attacks against Pakistani forces .
More than a dozen of Pakistan ’s elite counterterrorism commandos were killed in a single engagement .
The military claimed to have ejected the Taliban from strongholds in Kotkai and Jandola , however , and said it killed Qari Hussain .
But Hussain later mocked the government during a press conference in May 2008 .
Just 11 days after the fighting in South Waziristan had begun , the military sued for peace .
The Taliban retook control of Jandola four months later , after murdering dozens from a rival tribe while the military looked on .
The military has since abandoned several forts in South Waziristan and has kept activity there to a minimum , instead relying on punitive air and artillery strikes .

" Does everybody like ( the trapezoid ) ?
Probably not .
Does everybody like that you can't shoot the puck over the glass ?
Probably not .
But , the whole package is there and the package says that in 2003 goal - scoring was down , our 100 - point men were down , our 50 - goal scorers were down . "
-- Canadiens GM Bob Gainey
While there is some movement , perhaps even a growing sentiment , to eradicate the goalie trapezoid from NHL , it wo n't happen any time soon .
That 's because many of the GMs on hand at Tuesday 's general managers ' meeting at the Westin Harbour Castle believe the entire rules package coming out of the 2004 - 05 lockout -- which included the trapezoid -- has been so successful in re-introducing offensive flow to the game .
Other rules in that offense - stimulation package that evolved out of the season - long stoppage included a more stringent enforcement of obstruction fouls , the elimination of the two - line offsides , as well as the re-introduction of tag - up offsides .
Also , the clearing of a puck in the defensive zone over the protective glass by a defending player became a mandatory delay - of - game penalty .
" It goes into the package of things , " Montreal GM Bob Gainey said after Tuesday 's afternoon meeting broke .
" Does everybody like ( the trapezoid ) ?
Probably not .
Does everybody like that you can't shoot the puck over the glass ?
Probably not .
But , the whole package is there and the package says that in 2003 goal - scoring was down , our 100 - point men were down , our 50 - goal scorers were down .
" So there were these things we were attempting to accomplish that when we look five years later , we can see tangible evidence that it is a more wide - open , a faster , more exciting game without the holding , hooking and stuff like that .
" Statistically , the evidence is on the side of Gainey and those that advocate the status quo .
In 2003 - 04 , the year before the lockout , there was a three - way tie for the League 's goal - scoring lead at 41 goals , while Tampa Bay 's Marty St. Louis led all point - getters with 94 points .
In 2007 - 08 , three players topped 50 goals , including a League - leading 65 goals by Alex Ovechkin .
Last season , four players -- including who broke the 100 - point barrier -- topped St. Louis ' 2003 - 04 League - leading point total .
" There was an attempt to go back and ask why did we put it there and try to bring up to the surface why this was included in that group of changes in 2005 that we felt was important to increase speed and the offense and the general level of play to have it more fun for the players and the fans , " Gainey said .
There was also a consensus among GMs on Tuesday that the trapezoid has been a part of the success in opening the game back up , despite the fact that it limited the ability of some NHL goalies to play the puck and serve as a third defenseman .
" I can only remind them , if you take away the trapezoid , you are going to have the same issues you had in the past -- goalies out there playing the puck , putting their back to the play , " NHL Vice President and Director of Hockey Operations Colin Campbell said .
" We had tons of issues that way with goalies playing pucks .
That was one issue and the other issue was it became a ping - pong game -- throw the puck in , throw the puck out .
Guys forget that part of that whole aspect we put into place was to reward offensive hockey coming out of the lockout and penalize defensive hockey .
" These rules , taken as a whole package , opened the game up and when we get a couple of hiccups or burps , we have to hang in there with resolve .
" But there are some dissenters , most of whom are more concerned with the potential for defensemen chasing after dump-ins can get hurt as unimpeded forecheckers are given a free run into the attacking zone to hunt down the puck and initiate a board battle .
San Jose GM
Doug Wilson introduced the issue onto the agenda for that very reason , but seemed to take Tuesday 's defeat in stride .
"
We ask questions to hear other people 's response , " Wilson said .
" It was a good discussion .
You can learn from listening to others .
" Carolina GM Jim Rutherford is on Wilson 's side in this debate , and he seemed to be the most displeased out of those proposing the elimination of the trapezoid .
He believes that the inability of a goalie to play the puck up to his defenseman has left defensemen vulnerable along the end boards , resulting in the potential for injury .
Many defenders of the trapezoid argue that there is little empirical evidence that players are being hurt in the end - board battle scenario outlined by Rutherford , but the long - time executive and former player trusts his eyes more than any statistics .
" What 's happening now is ( the defensemen ) are going back to get the puck and the first player going back is kind of tip - toeing back there , trying to tie the guy because he is so afraid he 's going to get whacked into the boards and you are going to peel him of the glass , " Rutherford said .
" I 'm surprised that more guys did n't want to take a closer look at it . "
Tony Blair will be quizzed over a devastating official memo warning him that war on Iraq would be illegal eight months before he sent troops into Baghdad , it was claimed last night .
The Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war will consider a letter from Lord Goldsmith , then Mr Blair 's top law officer , advising him that deposing Saddam would be in breach of international law , according to a report in The Mail on Sunday .
But Mr Blair refused to accept Lord Goldsmith 's advice and instead issued instructions for his long - term friend to be " gagged " and barred from cabinet meetings , the newspaper claimed .
Lord Goldsmith apparently lost three stone , and complained he was " more or less pinned to the wall " in a No 10 showdown with two of Mr Blair 's most loyal aides , Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan .
Mr Blair also allegedly failed to inform the Cabinet of the warning , fearing an " anti-war revolt " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Lord Goldsmith allegedly threatened to resign over the issue , but was " bullied " into backing down .
He eventually issued carefully drafted qualified backing for the invasion .
But according to The Mail on Sunday , his advice was radically different in July 2002 , when ministers were allegedly told the US and UK planned " regime change " in Iraq .
Then Lord Goldsmith reportedly wrote a letter to Mr Blair on 29 July , flagging up the legal difficulties of the plan of campaign he had apparently thrashed out with President George Bush .
The letter pointed out : ( 1 ) Although UN rules permitted " military intervention on the basis of self - defence , they did not apply in this case as Britain was not under threat from Iraq ; ( 2 ) While the UN allowed " humanitarian intervention " in certain cases , that too was not relevant to Iraq ; ( 3 ) It would be very hard to rely on earlier UN resolutions in the Nineties approving the use of force against Saddam .
Lord Goldsmith ended by saying " the situation might change " – although , in legal terms , it never did .
The advice , and the decision to commit it to an official record , reportedly caused great friction between the two men , as it was feared publication of the details could undermine the case for war and damage Mr Blair 's credibility .
The revelations follow testimony from a series of by figures at the Chilcot inquiry who have questioned Mr Blair 's judgement and honesty , and the legality of the war .
The Independent on Sunday understands , after only four days of testimony , the former prime minister was already furious that his reputation could be " shredded " by senior civil servants taking revenge on him during the inquiry into the Iraq conflict , it emerged last night .
Mr Blair has been appalled by the high - profile evidence given by mandarins who have appeared before the Chilcot inquiry since the first round of public hearings began last Tuesday , close friends have revealed .
His image has taken a battering over the past six days , as a series of current and former public servants have given evidence that conflicts with the Government 's account of the intelligence assessment of Iraq 's weapons capability before the invasion in March 2003 .
Among the devastating details presented to the inquiry was the revelation that British spies reported 10 days before the invasion that Iraq had " disassembled " what chemical weapons it had – but Mr Blair went ahead and sent troops into battle .
Britain 's former ambassador to Washington , Sir Christopher Meyer , claimed Mr Blair and Mr Bush had signed a secret deal " in blood " to remove Saddam almost a year before the invasion .
He said the agreement in effect left officials scrabbling to find " a smoking gun " to justify going to war .
Mr Blair 's friends claimed last night that he has found some of the evidence given so far " distasteful " , and potentially damaging to his reputation .
" It is clear that the headlines so far have not been helpful to him , " a former minister said .
" But more troubling is the sense that some of the people involved are so keen to stick the knife in .
It is quite distasteful . "

Another Blair ally said the former leader had made clear his concern that " his reputation could be shredded by the Chilcot process " .
" He is furious that mandarins are seeking revenge and discovering their principles after the event , " one friend added .
Sir Christopher Meyer has attracted much criticism from Blairites following a flamboyant appearance during which he claimed Mr Blair 's view on " regime change " in Iraq hardened after a private meeting with Mr Bush in 2002 .
He also compared Mr Blair unflatteringly to Margaret Thatcher .
The former diplomat told the inquiry on Thursday : " She would have insisted on a clear , coherent political / diplomatic strategy and I think she would have demanded the greatest clarity about what the heck happened if and when we removed Saddam . "
Sir Jeremy Greenstock , who worked beside Mr Blair in his attempts to gain UN blessing for the invasion , said the war was of " questionable legitimacy " even though it is unlikely to be proved illegal .
The former UK ambassador to the UN said the invasion did not have the backing of most UN members or the British public .
Mr Blair assured MPs in the run-up to the invasion that " extensive , detailed and authoritative " intelligence showed " beyond doubt " that Saddam had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons ; tried to develop nuclear weapons ; and that he had already produced chemical weapons – and used them on his own people .
His government produced two dossiers on Saddam 's weapons capability , to back up the case for war .
It has since been shown that much of the intelligence received by the Government in the run-up to the war was confused and inaccurate .
Sir William Ehrman , the Foreign Office director general for defence and intelligence at the time , told the inquiry that a report suggested Saddam may not have been able to use chemical weapons .
A separate report suggested Iraq might also " lack " warheads capable of spreading chemical agents .
Tim Dowse , the director of counter - proliferation at the Foreign Office between 2001 - 2003 , said most evidence suggested Iraq 's chemical and biological programme was largely " destroyed " in 1991 .
He said intelligence in late 2002 suggested Iraq was rebuilding its capability , although its actual position was unclear after weapons inspectors were expelled in 1998 .
And now it appears the inquiry could become more uncomfortable for Mr Blair .
It is understood the Chilcot panel has already been given Lord Goldsmith 's letter .
The two are both likely to be interrogated about it when they give evidence in the new year .
Critical evidence from key figures to Chilcot inquiry
Sir Peter Ricketts
" We quite clearly distanced ourselves from talk of regime change ... that was not something we thought there would be any legal base for . "
Sir William Patey
" We were aware of those drumbeats from Washington [ about regime change ] .
Our policy was to stay away from that end of the spectrum . "
Sir Michael Wood " [ Establishing no - fly zones over Iraq ] was very controversial ...
The US government was very careful to avoid taking any real position on the law . "
Sir William Ehrman
" We did , on 10 March , get a report that chemical weapons might have remained disassembled and Saddam had n't yet ordered their assembly . "
Sir Christopher Meyer " Suddenly , because of the unforgiving nature of the military timetable , we found ourselves scrabbling for the smoking gun . "
Sir Jeremy Greenstock
" I regarded our participation in the military action against Iraq in March 2003 as legal , but of questionable legitimacy . "

New ground measurements made by the West Antarctic GPS Network ( WAGN ) project , composed of researchers from The University of Texas at Austin , The Ohio State University , and The University of Memphis , suggest the rate of ice loss of the West Antarctic ice sheet has been slightly overestimated .
" Our work suggests that while West Antarctica is still losing significant amounts of ice , the loss appears to be slightly slower than some recent estimates , " said Ian Dalziel , lead principal investigator for WAGN .
" So the take home message is that Antarctica is contributing to rising sea levels .
It is the rate that is unclear . "
In 2006 , another team of researchers used data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ( GRACE ) satellites to infer a significant loss of ice mass over West Antarctica from 2002 to 2005 .
The GRACE satellites do not measure changes in ice loss directly but measure changes in gravity , which can be caused both by ice loss and vertical uplift of the bedrock underlying the ice .
Now , for the first time , researchers have directly measured the vertical motion of the bedrock at sites across West Antarctica using the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) .
The results should lead to more accurate estimates of ice mass loss .
Antarctica was once buried under a deeper and more extensive layer of ice during a period known as the Last Glacial Maximum .
Starting about 20,000 years ago , the ice began slowly thinning and retreating .
As the ice mass decreases , the bedrock immediately below the ice rises , an uplift known as postglacial rebound .
Postglacial rebound causes an increase in the gravitational attraction measured by the GRACE satellites and could explain their inferred measurements of recent , rapid ice loss in West Antarctica .
The new GPS measurements show West Antarctica is rebounding more slowly than once thought .
This means that the correction to the gravity signal from the rock contribution has been overestimated and the rate of ice loss is slower than previously interpreted .

" The published results are very important because they provide precise , ground - truth GPS observations of the actual rebound of the continent due to the loss of ice mass detected by the GRACE satellite gravity measurements over West Antarctica " said Vladimir Papitashvili , acting director for the Antarctic Earth Sciences Program at the National Science Foundation , which supported the research .
WAGN researchers do not yet know how large the overestimation was .
A more definitive correction will be conducted by other researchers who specialize in interpreting GRACE data .
Previous estimates of postglacial rebound were made with theoretical models .
Assimilation of the direct GPS results into new models will therefore produce significant improvements in estimations of ice mass loss .
The results will appear in the electronic journal Geochemistry , Geophysics , Geosystems of the American Geophysical Union and the American Geochemical Society .
A team from The University of Texas at Austin 's Jackson School of Geosciences ( Ian Dalziel , lead principal investigator ) , The Ohio State University 's School of Earth Sciences ( Michael Bevis ) , and The University of Memphis ' Center for Earthquake Research and Information ( Robert Smalley , Jr. ) performed the WAGN project .
The network consists of 18 GPS stations installed on bedrock outcrops across West Antarctica .
Precise , millimeter level , three - dimensional locations of the stations , which are bolted into the bedrock , were determined during measurements made from 2001 to 2003 and from 2004 to 2006 , the two measurements being at least three years apart .
The difference in the positions during the two time periods indicates the motion of the bedrock .
The WAGN data were supplemented with data from the first year of the Polar Earth Observing Network ( POLENET ) project , a project to establish a more sophisticated , continuously recording network of GPS and seismic stations , including the already established WAGN sites .
POLENET will further improve our understanding of the interaction between the solid earth and ice sheets at both poles .
The lead principal investigator of the U.S. Antarctic contribution to POLENET is Terry Wilson of The Ohio State University .
The West Antarctic GPS Network and the U.S. Antarctic contribution to the Polar Earth Observing Network of the International Polar Year were both funded and logistically supported by the Office of Polar Programs of the National Science Foundation .
才能があるプログラマの考え方や生き方に迫る本連載。4人目は、筑波大学付属駒場中学校に通う3年生、金井仁弘（まさひろ）氏を紹介する。
筑波大学付属駒場中学校は、東京都内にある中高一貫の国立校だ。入学試験の偏差値と東京大学への進学率の高さから“東の筑駒、西の灘”と称される進学校である。強いのは受験だけではない。国際情報オリンピックや国際数学オリンピックでは、同校の生徒が毎年のように金・銀メダルを制するなど才能あふれる理数系人材が多数在籍している。
金井氏はこの夏 の 「 セキュリティ＆プログラミングキャンプ2009」（2009年8月12〜16日）に参加し頭角を現した中学生プログラマである。
今年に入って 、Ruby 1.9のフィボナッチ数列による演算（多倍長加算）が、Ruby 1.8よりも遅いことに気付いた金井氏は、キャンプの自由課題でRubyの高速化を選択。参加者一同を前に、同様の問題が生じていた、RubyのString型、
Array型（構造体型オブジェクト自体にデータが埋め込まれている可能性のある構造体）の一部メソッドを高速化し、注目を集めた。講師陣も舌を巻いたといわれるほどの逸材だ。キャンプ後もRubyの高速化に取り組み続け、ループ内で定数化するマクロを除去することで一部メソッドを最大で約63％、全体で約8％の高速化に成功した。この修正パッチはRuby開発者コミュニティで採択され、Rubyのtrunkに取り込まれている（2009年10月5日）。Rubyの開発者や多くの職業エンジニアでさえ気が付かなかった問題に目を付け、問題の解決まで根気よく粘るというのは、プログラマとして1つの才能ではないだろうか。
本稿では、金井氏が普段どんなことを考え、何をしているのかを中心に、職業エンジニアにも生かせるスキルやキャリアへのヒントを届けたい。インタビュアーは、本連載ではもうお馴染み、東京大学
情報理工学系研究科 創造情報学専攻 教授 竹内郁雄氏である。今回も、才能あるプログラマの発掘・育成のためならばとボランタリーで引き受けてくださった。
ご挨拶は名刺 で
インタビューは2009年9月某日、東京大学 情報理工学系研究科で行われた。竹内氏が名刺を差し出すと、金井氏からも……。
名刺交換の風 景
（※対談風景の撮影は編集部、以下同様）
竹内氏 竹内です。よろしくお願いします。おや金井君、名刺なんか持っているの？
金井氏 はい、自分で作りました。周りで持っている人は多いです。セキュリティ＆プログラミングキャンプでは名刺交換タイムがあるくらいですから。
竹内氏 へ〜！ 名刺交換の仕方も覚えて感心だね。しかしながら外国人が日本に来るために名刺を作ってくるという話を聞きます。日本は名刺がないとあいさつもできない国だと思われているのかなぁ……。
セプキャンで はRubyの高速化に成功 【課外活動編】
竹内氏 セキュリティ＆プログラミングキャンプではどんなことをやったの？
金井氏 講師の笹田耕一さんから自由課題を与えられたので、僕 はRubyの高速化を選びました。
Rubyでは、メモリ節約のため、ある一定以下の容量の情報は、構造体に直接埋め込まれて保持されます。
Ruby 1.9では、“ 構造体に埋め込まれているかどうか”の判定を、ループ内でマクロを呼び出したときにいちいち行っていたため、処理速度が遅くなっていました。そこで、ループ内で構造体に埋め込まれてるデータが不変のとき、マクロ（＝その判定の条件分岐）をループの外に出し、高速化をしました。
具体的には、array型などが実装されているソースコード、array.c、string.c、struct.cそれぞれから、問題となり得るマクロ、
・RARRAY_PTR , RARRAY_LEN ・RSTRING_PTR, RSTRING_LEN
・RSTRUCT_PTR,RSTRUCT_LEN
を探し、文脈を確認しながら、高速化するという作業（マクロの値がループ内で不変でループの外に出せるものをループ外に出す）です。
竹内氏 中学生でこれに気付くのはすごい。コンピュータでいう低レベルな深いところまで掘っている。そういう根気や気迫があるの素晴らしいと思います。
金井氏 キャンプでは、吉岡弘隆さんからいろいろな指導を受けつつ自分たちでボトルネックを探して修正していくということをしていました。
竹内氏 5日間でしたよね。修正を終えるまでにどれくらいかかった？
金井氏 5 日 間で一応終わらせたのですが、キャンプ後に笹田さんからskypeでバグを指摘されまして、キャンプ後も必死に修正しました。
竹内氏 修正にバグがあったわけ ？
金井氏 make testは通るのですが、rb_yield ( ) の存在によって、array に破壊的変更が加わ

竹内氏 なるほど。多少そういう課題は残っていても、わたしとしては中学生からこんなことを聞くのは初めてで感心してしまいます。
金井君を育て た “ 筑駒パ研 ” 、縦のつながり 【部活編 】
竹内氏 いつごろからコンピュータに触り始めたの ？
金井氏 小学校1〜2年生からです。学校の授業がきっかけです。
竹内氏 金井君の年代なら小学生でコンピュータに触るのは珍しくないよね。初めてコンピュータに触った時期と、コンピュータに目覚めた瞬間は違うと思います。後者はいつごろだった？
金井氏 本格的にコンピュータを使い始めたのは、中学に入学し、部活動「 筑波大学付属駒場 中高パーソナルコンピュータ研究部」、略して“ 筑駒パ研 ” （以下、パ研）に入ってからです。
竹内氏 お〜、パ研というのがあるんだ？ ！
金井氏 はい、パ研に入ったことで、コンピュータを使う側からコンピュータでものを作る側になりました。
竹内氏 パ研はスパルタなの ？
金井氏 放任主義です。パ研に入部希望を出すと、当時高校1年生（2009年現在高校3年）の先輩に本を1冊渡されました。「これを読んできて。分からないところがあったら教えてあげるからね」といわれたんです。
竹内氏 パ研は中高一貫なんだね。その本は何 ？
金井氏 粂井康孝氏の『猫でもわか るC言語プログラミング』、略して『 猫C』です。
竹内氏 猫！！ それは読みやすかったの ？
金井氏 僕には読みやすかったのですが、 「 猫にしか分からない 」 と「 猫でも分かる」の2つの意見があります。
竹内氏 ほ〜。おおむね分かりやすく書かれているけど、少し脱線すると分からなくなるという、入門書にありがちなことだね。先輩も『猫C』で学んだの？
金井氏 はい。パ研にはいくつか入門書架があり、『
猫C』はそのうちの1冊です。いまの中学1年生にも貸し出していて、代々受け継がれています。パ研では、コンピュータの経験がない新入生には、取りあえずC言語の解説書を渡すというルールがあるんです。
竹内氏 顧問の先生はあまり絡まないのかい ？
金井氏 基本的にパ研は放任主義です。先輩が後輩に教えたり、部員同士で教え合う文化です。「（部室は）いつでも開いているからいつでも来い」というスタンスです。
竹内氏 部室がたまり場になっていて、仲間がいれば話すし、いなければ孤独にパチパチと作業をするんだね。
金井氏 そういう雰囲気ですね 。
竹内氏 中高一貫は長い目で見て良いと思うなぁ。高校受験制度を見直すべきだと思うよ。

Hundreds of chemicals likely to be identified by the European Union ( E.U. ) as " substances of very high concern " are produced throughout the U.S. , sometimes in large quantities .
In fact , chemicals such as varieties of plastic - softening phthalates — linked to developmental and reproductive problems because they mimic hormones — are produced in excess of hundreds of million of pounds per year , according to a new report from Environmental Defense Fund ( EDF ) that is based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) data from 2001 .
" Many chemicals that the E.U. has already identified as dangerous and will eventually regulate are produced in the U.S. by many different companies at many different sites , " says biochemist Richard Denison of EDF , author of the report " Across the Pond : Assessing REACH 's First Big Impact on U.S. Companies and Chemicals " .
" The market is going to respond to that , companies that use those chemicals will be looking to find safer alternatives . "
These dangerous chemicals have been identified via the E.U. 's 2007 Registration , Evaluation , Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals ( REACH ) law , which requires the disclosure of all chemicals sold in the E.U. in quantities of more than one metric ton per year .
As it stands , 16 chemicals , including three phthalates , are already on the REACH list as chemicals of concern .
And in coming years , the REACH law will require that companies prove the safety of a given chemical before it is allowed to be sold ; those chemicals deemed dangerous — or " substances of very high concern " due to associated human health risks — will only be sold with special governmental permission .
Of the 267 chemicals on the potential expanded REACH list compiled by the International Chemical Secretariat in Sweden , two are regulated in some form under U.S. law — asbestos and hexavalent chromium ( chromium VI ) — and only one third have even been tested by the EPA .
" Asbestos is the poster child for what 's wrong with the Toxics Substances Control Act , " the 1976 U.S. law governing such chemicals , Denison says .
EPA attempted to craft a regulation to ban its use only to have it rejected by courts .
" They could n't even do it for asbestos , " which causes lung disease and cancer .
All told , the U.S. manufactures more than one billion pounds ( 455 million kilograms ) of 14 potential REACH - listed chemicals , including two varieties of toluene ; 85 more are made in quantities exceeding one million pounds ( 455,000 kilograms ) , like the phthalates which have already been regulated in some cases in the E.U .
BASF , Chemtura , Dow , DuPont and Equistar make the most of these suspect chemicals in the U.S. , and Kentucky , Louisiana , Michigan , New Jersey , New York , North Carolina , Ohio and Texas host operations that manufacture them .
Some of the most commonly produced dangerous chemicals include benzene , formaldehyde , styrene , hexane and butadiene .
Whereas Germany - based chemical giant BASF " unreservedly supports the goals of REACH in protecting man and the environment , " it remains unclear how that will impact its chemical operations in the U.S. " Chemical manufacturing is our core business , " BASF spokesman Daniel Pepitone says .
" We have already begun an internal product evaluation and , based on risk assessment , we want to review all substances produced or sold worldwide in the BASF Group in quantities of more than one metric ton . "
" Information regarding the hazardous properties of substances is simply one component that is needed for the safe and responsible handling of chemical products , " he continues .
" Further information , such as the type and extent of potential exposure to humans and the environment , is also required . "
And some U.S. states are taking matters into their own hands : California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ( R ) signed into law yesterday two bills that will attempt to identify dangerous substances manufactured or used in the state , develop safer alternatives to commonly used dangerous compounds as well as create a web - based database of common chemicals for individuals .
This legislation " puts an end to the less effective chemical - by - chemical bans of the past , " Schwarzenegger said in a statement .
" We will stop looking at toxics as an inevitable by - product of industrial production .
Instead , they will be something that can be removed from every product in the design stage — protecting people 's health and our environment . "
This season is going so bad , the Raiders can't even thank God on church day when things actually go right .
Just ask cornerback Chris Johnson , who was flagged for unsportsmanlike , umm , religious activity during Sunday 's 29 - 6 loss to the Texans .
The foul :
He fell on bended knee and lifted his hands toward the unretracted roof after his end - zone interception just before halftime .
The back judge deemed it excessive celebrating and threw his flag .
" I 'm just getting on my knees giving my respect to God , " Johnson said .
" I do n't see how that 's a personal foul or anything like that .
" We 're in Houston , they made the call , so I had to honor it . "
If there ever was a play to rejoice over , it was this one : an intercepted fade - route pass in front of Pro Bowl wide receiver Andre Johnson .
Chris Johnson gave the same thanks after his three other career interceptions , all last season , and was not flagged .
The Raiders get penalized enough doing things like pulling hair and hitting late .
When they get busted for faith - based behavior , that 's when you know it 's going to be a long day .
" That was ridiculous , " said defensive end Greg Ellis , who runs a team Bible study on Mondays .
" Hey man , that guy is a Christian man .
He 's just thanking his God for blessing him with a play . "
So what have we got ?
Dinosaurs ?
Demonic soul - reapers ?
Parallel globo - Nazis ?
Hyperspherical juggernaut - beings ?
Come on
Anyone who has watched a TV , read any sci- fi or seen any movies will be well aware that hyperdimensional spacewarp wormhole portals do n't normally lead to anything boring like empty space , parallel civilisations where humanity lives in peace and harmony or anything like that .
Rather , it seems a racing cert that we 're looking here at an imminent visit from a race of carnivorous dinosaur - men , the superhuman clone hive - legions of some evil genetic queen - empress , infinite polypantheons of dark nega - deities imprisoned for aeons and hungering to feast upon human souls , a parallel - history victorious Nazi globo - Reich or something of that type .
We took the matter up with Dr Mike Lamont , a control - room boffin at the LHC .
" We 're hoping to see supersymmetry and extra dimensions , " he confirmed .
Pressed on the matter of doors through which something might come , as hinted at by Bertolucci , Lamont rather elliptically said " well , he 's a theorist " , before recommending the book Warped Passages by physicist Lisa Randall .
This explores ways in which extra-dimensional space and entities might interact with our own .
It uses among others the example of how a sphere moving in 3D space would appear to someone living on a single 2D plane - space - that is as a mysterious circle suddenly blossoming into existence , growing , perhaps moving about and then shrinking down and vanishing again .
" There 's no maths in it , " added Lamont encouragingly , having assessed the intellectual level of the Reg news team with disconcerting percipience .
Summarising , then , it appears that we might be in for some kind of invasion by spontaneously swelling and shrinking spherical or wheel - shaped creatures - something on the order of the huge rumbling stone ball from Indiana Jones - able to move in and out of our plane at will .
Soon the cities of humanity will lie in smoking ruins , shattered by the Attack of the Teleporting Juggernaut - tyrants from the Nth Dimension .
Dr Bertolucci later got in touch to confirm that yes indeed , there would be an " open door " , but that even with the power of the LHC at his disposal he would only be able to hold it open " a very tiny lapse of time , 10 - 26 seconds , [ but ] during that infinitesimal amount of time we would be able to peer into this open door , either by getting something out of it or sending something into it .
" Of course , " adds Bertolucci , " after this tiny moment the door would again shut , bringing us back to our ' normal ' four dimensional world ...
It would be a major leap in our vision of Nature , although of no practcal use ( for the time being , at least ) .
And of course [ there would be ] no risk to the stability of our world . "
We say : Excellent .
Who said the LHC was a waste of money ? ®
All of us put our money into a big pot , and when you have medical expenses , you take some money out of the big pot .
That — in 25 words — is everything you need to know about health - care insurance .
This is no different from the Golden Rule , originally formulated by Rabbi Hillel , who added , “ The rest is commentary . ”
But here ’s some commentary .
Those who are sick will have enough money to take out of the pot because many who put money into the pot will not be sick and wo n’t need any money .
Those who typically wo n’t get sick — the young , a healthy portion of the aged — are buying an insurance policy in case they fall off a cliff or win the unfortunate lottery and get something like cancer or Parkinson’s .
( And if you keel over suddenly from a heart attack , you wo n’t need any of the pot money either . )
This is no different from the millions who have been driving for decades , paying their automobile insurance premiums , but never had an accident .
It ’s nice to know the money will be there , on the off chance you will need it .
If only sick people put money into the pot , there will not be enough to pay for their illnesses .
That ’s why everyone needs to be in the pot .
Some of us do n’t put our own money into the pot , because our employers will do it for us .
Others do n’t put our own money into the pot , because we do n’t have any money .
So we adjust the amount of money from those who have it to make sure there ’s enough for those who do n’t .
What about insurance companies ?
I do n’t understand why they need to exist in their current form .
Basically , they exist to mind the pot — or their own private pots .
They spend loads of money trying to induce people to put money into their pot rather than their rivals ’ pots .
So , cumulatively , there ’s less money in all pots .
Since their pots are private , they take some money out of their pots to pay those people ( shareholders ) who own the pots .
And because the pot owners want as much money as they can get , the pot managers come up with reasons why you ca n’t take money out .
Doctors and other health - care providers have to hire people to argue with the pot owners about getting pot money — which means there will be less money for the pot .
All you need is a computer to regulate input and output from the pot .
I tend to believe that there should be only one pot — single payer .
It ’s simpler .
There ’s less overhead .
You get to choose your own doctor and make your own decisions without government interference .
Medicare , essentially the one - pot system for those over 65 , is — along with the VA , another government system — the most popular government program .
As a health - care provider , I can attest that it is the most hassle - free reimbursement vehicle , and that if there were Medicare for all , all those people in doctors ’ office who spend their days arguing with the private pot owners could be put to more productive uses .
Medicare for all is , in fact , a form of socialism .
It is socialized health - care insurance .
The health care system itself will remain largely private .
But I am willing to accept the idea that Medicare for all — or another single payer system — may be a bridge too far in our political terrain .
So taking a cue from places like France , or Japan , or Germany , or Korea , or Switzerland , I ’m willing to accept the continued existence of insurance companies as long as they — like all of the aforementioned countries — mind their pots on a nonprofit basis .
In these countries , everyone is covered , and nobody goes bankrupt .
Inability to pay medical expenses is the number one reason for bankruptcies in the United States .
And we rank behind all other industrialized countries in health care outcomes — pesky little things like life expectancy and infant mortality .
What about doctors ?
One of the reasons why Medicare works is because its huge pot can demand lower rates , meaning less money is needed for the pot .
Doctors like to complain about this , but they do n’t imagine a world without Medicare .
Would they be driving their BMWs and Lexuses if the millions of the elderly had no Medicare ?
I do n’t think so .
Who would be paying for their tax deductible auto leases ?
Another problem is that doctors graduate with huge loan liabilities to pay for the hundreds of thousands of dollars their medical cost .
This is why there is a glut of highly paid dermatologists and a shortage of less highly paid primary care physicians .
I ’m all for a program that would pay for the medical education of a majority — if not all — doctors in exchange for five years of public health service .
And so they wo n’t feel deprived compared to their peers who went before them , as part of the deal , they will be granted the luxury car of their choice .
I hope it ’s an Escalade .
Buy American .

COME AND SEE US HERE YOU BIG SMASHER !
The tongue - eating louse is the only example of a parasite that lives by crawling into another animal and after dispatching with a body part lives as a rather awkward replacement .
It does so with relatively little harm to the poor bloody fish , though it is said the poor bloody fish rarely gets a smooch these days .
He ’s an unwanted guest , like some insufferable bugger from college who comes around and stays far too bloody long , at least he would be if that guest came in ate your chaise longue and quickly proceeded to decimate your wine cellar and did n’t leave until the day they died .
The tongue - eating louse is quite possibly the most repugnant thing on the planet , worse than the Major ’s wife and even a sniper would n’t take her out .
This louse is quite simply a monster , albeit a little one .
The crustacean crawls into the gills of a fish , scrambles up to the mouth and stabs its claws either side of the fishes tongue .
Despite its name it does n’t actually eat the tongue , the organ atrophies as the parasite slurps the blood taking with it all the oxygen and nutrients and what not .
There the louse sits for the rest of its life , why the blazes they never evolved to eat the tasty morsels the poor bloody fish is eating is anyone ’s guess .
One also wonders how they find this living - in - a - fishy mouth lifestyle satisfying .
So do we at The Proceedings wish we ’d never mentioned the horrible buggers ?
Quite the opposite we think they are really rather grand !
An incredible example of a pinnacle of evolution ….
you see parasites rather obviously live off another animal to the hosts detriment .
It ’s a rather lazy , but devilishly clever survival technique that has arisen again and again independently throughout the course of evolution .
It ’s safe to say almost every single animal of any size has at least one .
The really really clever , or more to the point the really well - evolved parasites , tap the hosts resources all the while leaving the host to live quite normally and hence as long as possible ….
so that the parasite can tap more and more resources , and make more and more horrible little offspring .
And we at The Proceedings can think of no other parasite that does it quite so well .
Indeed the closest we could think of is our own offspring , living off the nutrients of the blood of its mother , before popping out being a bit of a pain until you can eventually pack them off to a cripplingly expensive boarding school at the age of four .
Which is at least some good news for the parents as they get back to smooching , a smooch that contains millions of micro-organisms , some of which are parasites .

Update : see our complete review and our later take on the new ads that roll as certain apps launch .
The Zune HD goes on sale today , and the firmware for the new device should be available by the time you read this ( initial devices were shipped without the needed firmware , making them all but useless until hooked up to a PC ) .
Hopes that Microsoft might offer support for the Mac or for Linux machines did n't pan out ( and were always a long shot ) , but the Zune does have a few slick tricks up its sleeve .
Let 's run them down in preparation for our full review later today :
3.3 inch OLED screen : Sure , we knew all about it , but how does it look ?
With a unit in our grubby little hands , we can confidently say it looks pretty damn good .
Colors are saturated and the screen is terrifically bright — so much so that even my dad (! ) commented on it after seeing the device begin playing its demo movie .
Resolution is 480 by 272 , and the Zune HD features an accelerometer this time in order to do automatic screen rotation .
The screen is driven by NVIDIA 's high - def , low power Tegra chip .
Apps :
Yes , apps are coming to the Zune , but in a limited way .
Here 's how Microsoft puts it : " Simply go to the apps catalog and select the ones you want and sync them to the device .
Zune apps are free .
We are introducing a handful of new and updated casual games , along with a select group of utility apps , such as weather and calculator .
These first apps for Zune HD are an introduction of what will be an ever growing library . "
Sounds neat , and should add a good bit of utility to the device , especially if Microsoft rolls out a competent e-mail reader ( a Web browser is built into the operating system ) .
But it 's also clear there will be no third - party app ecosystem — probably a wise choice , given Microsoft 's small market share here and the wide range of competing smartphone platforms and portable game devices , each with their own app stores and developer ecosystems .
Size : The Zune HD is much smaller than expected from pictures — significantly smaller than either an iPhone or an earlier hard - drive Zunes .
In fact , it 's half the depth of the earlier hard - drive Zunes .
It 's larger than the iPod nano and the earlier Zune flash units .
Two models are available , 16GB and 32 GB flash units , in five colors .
Rich artist information : Zune HD will automatically grab album art but also extra material like biographies and related artist information when synced to a PC , even if the songs came from somewhere besides the Zune music store .
This information will be viewable on the device while playing back media .
Codec support :
All the bases are covered here .
The Zune HD can handle WMA , AAC , and MP3 audio along with H.264 , MPEG - 4 , and WMV video , along with ( hugely ) limited support for DVR - MS files from the company 's own Windows Media Center DVR .
When provided with the right connectors ( sold separately ) , it can output some HD video over HDMI .
Wireless : Still present , and the Zune HD is still capable of syncing its media wirelessly with a PC .
Like Zunes before it , the Zune HD can also stream music directly from the Zune music store for those with an unlimited monthly music pass .
802.11b/g are supported , but not 802.11n .
" Hello from Seattle " : Yup .
It 's written on the left side of the device in tiny , totally lowercase gray text .
The headphone jack :
It 's on the bottom .
We 'll be bringing you our complete Zune review later this evening .
If you have any questions you 'd like answered , leave a comment and we 'll do our best to oblige .
Liposuction New York City , NY
At New York City Liposuction Specialty Clinic – our specialists focus on basically 3 procedures : Liposuction , Brazilian Butt Lift , and Fat Transfer to Breasts .
Dr. Joffrey is one of the rare doctors in New York City who has chosen to specialize exclusively in performing liposuction surgery .
Liposuction is the procedure everyone is talking about .
With unparalleled safety and minimal discomfort , Liposuction & Brazilian Butt Lift are the most popular cosmetic surgeries in our modern era .
Downtime is very little , bruising is now minimal compared to traditional methods .
More and more individuals opt to finally get rid of those love handles and add curves with a Brazilian Butt Lift .
Big changes in the methods of anesthesia and the instruments used in the procedure are all part of the positively remarkable change in Liposuction today .
Local anesthesia is injected in the fat tissue to numb the treatment area .
Patients fully alert and completely comfortable during the whole procedure .
Dr. Joffrey personally does each and every liposuction consult from start to finish .
He urges prospective patients to settle for nothing less when getting different opinions about lipo .
Most patients want to have liposuction done by a specialist .
A liposuction specialist is someone who performs this procedure almost daily .
Focusing specifically on liposuction allows the doctor to develop experience and skills .
Never should a patient settle for a meeting with a consultant or surgical educator .
What is liposuction ?
Liposuction is the removal of fat cells from the body by suction - assisted surgery .
With liposuction , the surgeon restores the harmonious shape of the patient ’s body .
Removing stubborn fat deposits can improve the cosmetic appearance of any individual .
At our office , we offer the latest Liposuction techniques – Lipo360 , WaterLipo , SmartLipo .
All our fat removal procedures are supported by standard tumescent infiltration .
Our specialists gently extract fat through tiny incisions using an extremely thin tube ( that looks like a straw ) .
Our special surgical sculpting and contouring technique is known as micro-liposuction .
This provides a very high - level of precision .
Liposuction is not a weight loss alternative , but we often use it as a catalyst in heavier patients to push them in the right direction and give them a head start .
Laser Lipo at the New York City Liposuction Specialty Clinic
The patient receives a mild sedative .
The doctor numbs a small area of the skin
Then makes small incisions in the skin in the target area .
He or she then injects a special tumescent solution into the tissues under the skin through the incisions .
This tumescent solution numbs the fatty tissues and makes it easier to remove .
Finally , excess fat is suctioned out of the body through a tiny tube ( known as a cannula ) that ’s attached to a vacuum device .
Trough the cannula ( a very tiny tune )
Lasers , water , or ultrasound may be used by surgeons during liposuction procedures to accomplish specific goals like tightening the skin or dislodging fat that may otherwise be hard to remove .
The tumescent solution consists of a combination of :
Saline
Epinephrine to minimize bleeding
Lidocaine to numb the area
The doctors at New York City Liposuction Specialty Clinic have many types of technology and instruments that are perfect for many different patient types .
The primary target during a procedure is excess fat located between the skin and the muscle tissue , but our secondary target is the skin .
We use special techniques and instruments to enhance skin tone and elasticity in the target areas .
Extremely small tubes suction the excess fat from the body , keeping the incision - size and scarring to a minimum
Liposuction Cost in New York City
Liposuction cost can vary greatly depending on the patient .
We can explain this with 2 example cases .
An average size woman 5 ’ 2 ” and 135 lbs – ( BMI 24.7 ) .
who desires a slimmer abdomen can expect the following costs :
The price of Liposuction starts at $ 4 , 00 0 for only 1 area ( Abdomen in this case )
( Abdomen in this case ) Let ’s now add the mid-section ( waist / hips ) , this is $ 1500 more
more
Now the subtotal is $ 5 5 00
The pricing increases by $ 1,000 to $ 1,500 for every additional lipo area
Now let ’s analyze the case of a larger patient with a higher BMI – 5 ’ 7 ” and 190 lbs – ( BMI 29.8 ) .
This patient wants to have liposuction of her chin , inner / outer thighs and abdomen .
The price breakdown would be the following :
Abdomen : $ 4,500
Inner Thighs : $ 1,800
Outer
Thighs : $ 1,700
Chin : $ 1,200
As you see the cost for liposuction depends on the size of the patient ( the amount of fat to be extracted ) and the number of body parts to be treated .
In general , liposuction of a larger area like the abdomen will cost more than liposuction of a smaller area , such as the chin .
Our doctor will personally discuss any costs with you .
We only engage patients with simple , straightforward surgical quotes .
We do not utilize high - pressure sales tactics or follow up phone calls .
Yes , we do offer financing !
Absolutely !
At New York City Liposuction Specialty Clinic , we offer several different financing options to make it easier for our patients to afford all of the benefits of liposculpture .
Our clinic has strong relationships with reputable finance companies that regularly help our patients by offering both advice and financial assistance .
Nowadays with so many financing companies , liposuction , and any other cosmetic procedure are accessible to almost anyone .
Even if you have a bad credit score .
Just contact us to discover our financing options .
Financing applications take only a few minutes to complete .
The process is easy and afterwards , patients make affordable monthly payments .
What Modality is Best for Me ?
This is a VERY good question and important topic when deciding to let someone re-shape your figure .
There are so many fancy ads , gimmick devices , and sexy or alluring names for liposuction out there that it is extremely confusing for those considering “ what is best ” .
Dr. Joffrey takes a lot of pride in educating the public on the types of lipo available and what each one does .
We are a true lipo specialty clinic and therefore uses several different technologies for body enhancement .
Dr. Joffrey prefers hand micro liposuction , smart lipo ( laser liposuction ) , and ultrasonic assisted liposuction .
It is VERY IMPORTANT to understand the following , however :
“ We use many technologies and bells and whistles when we sculpt bodies but I ALWAYS tell my patients upfront that none of that is really important .
Meaning it is certainly NOT the machines that are giving patients an accurate , sculpted look but instead it is the surgeon .
It is confusing to patients because there are so many ads with sexy names like vaser lipo , high def lipo , ultrasonic lipo , smart lipo , tickle lipo , slim lipo , cool sculpting , liposonix , bodyjet , etc .
I am not a fan of this method of advertising or exaggerating .
I would hope that patients come to us because Lipo is the only surgical procedure that we perform and therefore feel that we greatly improve their chance for optimal results . ”
– Dr. Joffrey
Am I a candidate for liposuction ?
In the United States , liposuction is the most common cosmetic surgical procedure performed for a reason : it works and the results are dramatic , particularly for the right patients .
But are you a good candidate for liposuction ?
The right patient has certain important qualities .
I look for patients who have realistic expectations about micro-liposuction and what it can do for them .
This procedure is n’t for everyone , but there are several things I look for in the ideal liposuction patient :
18 years or more .
Good overall health .
Max BMI 30 .
Not smoke .
If you meet the above requirements , chances are , liposuction surgery is a good fit for you and you ’ll see good results from it .
If you ’re unhappy with how your body is proportioned ( for example , you have too much weight in the hips and too little in the breasts ) , then liposuction might be a good choice for you .
Liposuction cannot take the place of weight loss .
What we do find , however , is that even heavier patients who engage in lipo are then more incentivized afterword to lead a healthier lifestyle .
It can be a great kick start !
Treatment Areas
Liposuction is possible in almost any area of the body .
Many of our patients opt to target more than one area of the body during their liposuction procedure because we offer discounts for multiple target areas and because , by targeting multiple areas , patients see much more pronounced results .
The weight of the patient and the extension of the treatment areas , determine the number of treated areas in one procedure .
Doctors can only extract a limited amount of body fluid ( fat cells ) in a single session .
Face Liposuction
Cheeks
Fat removal in the cheeks can give patients a slimmer overall appearance since the face is the first thing that most people notice .

Jowls
Fat tends to accumulate in the jowls as people age .
Removing this fat produces results as striking as a facelift .
Upper Body Liposuction
Bra-Bulge
The bra -bulge is actually back - fat that rolls and pooches out around the bra .
The fat in this area of the body is particularly resistant to exercise and diet .

Upper Arms
After extreme weight loss and as women get older , the upper arms can get flabby .
Liposuction fixes this problem .
Also , even young women who hate their profile when they have their arms down at their side are ecstatic after removal of that bulge in there upper arm are a( where it meets the back ) .
Lower Body Liposuction
Tummy Bulge
A lot of women come to us for help repairing a post - pregnancy tummy .
We help women repair that tummy bulge and get their pre-pregnancy body back .
With modern lipo techniques , we can often even avoid the need for a tummy tuck !
Saddle Bags ( Outer Thighs )
Saddlebags are some of the most popular target areas for liposuction because the thick skin in this area tends to tighten up well after the procedure .
Women who use liposuction to get rid of saddlebags see dramatic , life - changing results that beautify the whole body .
Love Handles / Muffin Top Midsection fat is clingy .
It does n’t respond to diet and exercises even when fat on the rest of the body is melting away .
Contouring this area of the body changes the appearance of the whole body .
Buttocks
We do n’t recommend removing fat from here but instead , we often transfer fat into the buttocks for a much more shapely butt !
Liposuction and Fat Transfer
Liposuction and fat transfer ( also known as fat grafting or fat injection ) are procedures that complement each other very well .
We offer both at New York City Liposuction Specialty Clinic .
A liposuction removes excess fat deposits , while a fat transfer adds volume to certain body areas .
By combining these two procedures , both men and women can re-proportion their bodies to achieve the most aesthetically pleasing effects possible .
Many of our patients seek fat transfer to combat the aging process .
Adding volume to the face , hands , buttocks , and breasts can give them a youthful “ lift ” that knocks years off your appearance .
The results are natural because we are only transferring your own tissues from one part of the body to another !
Fat Transfer Target Areas
Fat can be reinjected in the following areas of the body to add lift or volume :
Buttocks

Hands

Prior Liposuction Procedures
Fat grafting corrects previously botched lipo procedures .
Fat Transfer Risks
In a fat transfer procedure , fat is first harvested using liposuction .
Then , it is carefully prepared and purified before being injected back into the body in the final phase of the procedure .
Patients remove fat from areas of the body where there is too much and move the fat to areas of the body where it is too little .
Fat transfer is a safe , simple procedure that allows patients to add volume to the body naturally without inserting implants .
Using the patient ’s own natural fat cells , there is no risk of allergy or sensitivity reactions .
Most patients recover quickly from the procedure .
And fat transfer offers smooth , natural - looking results that are permanent .
Realistic Results : What to Expect
Most liposuction patients have high hopes for their surgery , but it ’s important that you keep your expectations realistic .
There are many misconceptions out there about what liposuction can do for patients , but I want my patients to have a realistic view of what liposuction is , and what it can do for them .
When our patients have realistic expectations , they tend to be very happy with their results .
Patients who are realistic about what they can expect from liposuction often get a boost of self - confidence along with an improved appearance , which is always my goal .
No cosmetic procedure can offer permanent results because human bodies are constantly aging .
However , patients who take good care of themselves after their liposuction surgery by eating a healthy diet and exercising moderately will see very long - lasting , dramatic results from this surgical procedure .
The bottom line is , patients who understand that liposuction has limitations are more likely to be satisfied with the results of their procedure .
What patients can expect from their micro-liposuction procedure at New York City Liposuction Specialty Clinic is the following :
Very tiny scars or no scarring at all
A quick recovery
A dramatic final result

Centaurus A ( NGC 5128 ) is one of the most studied objects in the Southern sky , because it is the giant elliptical galaxy with the closest proximity to our own Milky Way .
It lies 11 million light years away from the Milky Way , and is believe to have merged with another gaseous galaxy about 200 to 700 million years ago .
The result of this galactic mashup : the birth of hundreds of thousands of stars in a kiloparsec - spanning ring near the core .
This is the first time that the inner structure of the galaxy has been resolved in such detail .
Using the SOFI large field Infra -Red ( 1 - 2.5 micron ) spectro-imager at the ESO New Technology Telescope , a research team led by Jouni Kainulainen of the University of Helsinki and Max Planck Institute for Astronomy was able to image a large ring of stars that have formed – and are still continuing to form – near the center of the galaxy .
The brightest sources in the ring are red supergiants , or low - mass star clusters .
“ It is important to note that it is not decisively the instrument ( the telescope or the instrument attached to it ) that enables us to see through dust , but the data analysis technique that is used to analyze the images taken with it .
Of course , the instrument plays a big role in a sense that adequately high - quality images are needed to perform the analysis , ” Dr. Kainulainen said in an email interview .
“ There is a fundamental difference between the images we use in our paper and the Spitzer images : the wavelength that the images cover .
In the images we used in our work , the dust lane of Centaurus A shows itself as “ a shadow ” , or more precisely , as an absorption feature ( the wavelength is 1 - 2 micrometers ) .
The Spitzer images represent somewhat longer wavelengths , and show the radiation emitted by the dust itself .
As a concrete example , the most famous Spitzer image of Centaurus A … shows a parallelogram - like structure , but the image describes radiation mainly from dust , not from stars , ” he said .
There is a large , S - or bar - shaped dust lane straight through the center of Centaurus A that obscures observations in the visible light spectrum .
As shown in the image below , the ring structure of star formation is obscured by dust , but visible in the near - infrared .
Centaurus
A is believe to house a supermassive black hole that has the mass of 200 million Suns at its core , evidenced by the radio emissions streaming out from the galaxy .
Previous images of the galaxy from the Spitzer Space Telescope , the ESA ’s Infrared Space Observatory and the Hubble Space Telescope revealed some aspects of the structure of the galaxy .
The infrared eyes of Spitzer peered partway through the dust to show a warped parallelogram , the cause of which is the gravitational disturbance caused by the merger of Centaurus A with a smaller spiral galaxy .
The presence of rings such as the one seen in Centaurus A is probably not common among other elliptical galaxies , but other such galaxies are known to exist .
It ’s possible that they are present during only certain periods of an elliptical galaxy ’s formation after it merges with another galaxy .
Dr. Kainulainen commented on this possiblity : “ One should consider that seeing so bright ring structure is probably quite time - critical .
The rings are believed to be induced by “ a violent event ” of merging galaxies , and they may evolve rather quickly to something that no longer looks like a clear , bright ring .
Therefore , they might actually be quite common for merging galaxies , but they “ last ” only such a short time that we do n’t see them in so many galaxies . ”
The analysis technique used by the team could be applied to other galaxies to resolve formation structures previously hidden by dust , and provide more information about how violent events alter the formation of elliptical galaxies .
“ Potentially , the technique can be applied to any relatively nearby galaxy showing prominent dust features .
Such targets could be M31 , M83 , M51 , Fornax A , or any similarly large , bright , dust containing galaxy .
Due to geometrical reasons , Centaurus A was a very suitable target for applying the method .
It will be more challenging in the case of , for example , normal Spiral galaxies .
However , we have already experimented with such galaxies and feel positive about the possibilities they give , ” said Dr. Kainulainen .
The striking image of Centaurus A’s ring of star formation was a somewhat surprising result of the imaging that the astronomers took of the galaxy , though there were hints from images taken by other telescopes that stellar formation was present in the obscured , dusty core .
Dr. Kainulainen said , “ It was very surprising that the structure contained so much stars and star - forming activity , and that we could reveal it in such great detail .
However , it was expected that a structure of this kind exists there , and contains at least some star formation .
This was evident , for example , from the earlier Spitzer images .
But when I first saw our result , “ The Naked Picture of Centaurus A ” , on my computer screen , it really was a big WOW - feeling ! ”
Further observations of Centaurus A are definitely in order to further explore the structure of the stellar ring , and the gravitational dynamics that allowed for its formation .
“ Our plans include observations with the Very Large Telescope ( European Southern Observatory ) and the Hubble Space Telescope .
In that work , the information we got about the dust lane in our published Letter will play a significant role .
The planned observations aim particularly at determining how long , and in what magnitude , the structure has been forming stars in the past .
Such information will help to understand galaxy - merging process , which is not an uncommon event in the Universe .
Dr. Kainulainen and his team published their results in a letter to Astronomy & Astrophysics , published online July 2nd , 2009 .
The full text of the letter is available here .

US Attorney Preet Bharara just sent chills through hedge funds and Wall Street trading desks .
" We 're not finished , " the prosecutor who has charged 20 people with insider trading said .
" How pervasive is insider trading ?
The answer is we do n't know .
But we intend to find out , " the prosecutor said .
He also issued a call for anyone involved in insider trading to come forward .
" You should knock on our door before we knock on yours , " he said .
Once again , the investigators in the case used hardcore criminal law enforcement techniques to catch alleged insider traders .
Phones were tapped and cooperating witnesses wore wires to meetings .
Even attempts by the targets of the investigation to avoid surveillance by using prepaid cell phones were apparently foiled .
A very bad deal to pass a very good bill
The final compromises before a bill comes to the floor are never very pretty .
This one , however , is worse than I anticipated .
Opposition from anti-abortion Democrats , driven in large part by aggressive activism from the Catholic Church , forced Democratic leadership to allow a vote on Bart Stupak 's amendment limiting elective abortion coverage from both private and public insurers on the exchange .
It reads :
The amendment will prohibit federal funds for abortion services in the public option .
It also prohibits individuals who receive affordability credits from purchasing a plan that provides elective abortions .
However , it allows individuals , both who receive affordability credits and who do not , to separately purchase with their own funds plans that cover elective abortions .
It also clarifies that private plans may still offer elective abortions .
Because of the limits placed on the exchanges , most of the participants will have some form of premium credit or affordable subsidy .
That means most will be ineligible for abortion coverage .
The idea that people are going to go out and purchase separate " abortion plans " is both cruel and laughable .
If this amendment passes , it will mean that virtually all women with insurance through the exchange who find themselves in the unwanted and unexpected position of needing to terminate a pregnancy will not have coverage for the procedure .
Abortion coverage will not be outlawed in this country .
It will simply be tiered , reserved for those rich enough to afford insurance themselves or lucky enough to receive from their employers .
The amendment is expected to pass with relative ease .
Republicans will join with anti-choice Democrats to push it over the finish line .
Once the amendment passes , the bill is cleared for a vote , and all parties expect that vote to succeed .
Today looks likely to end with a historic , and important , vote .
A vote that is a first step towards helping more than 30 million people secure health - care coverage , and making sure hundreds of millions are better protected from the vagaries of the insurance industry .
But Stupak 's amendment is a bitter start .
It is , however , not the end .
Even if it muscles into the House bill , it will also have to pass in the Senate , and then survive conference , before it becomes law .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The health reform bill making its way through the House of Representatives will include a public insurance option , but negotiations are continuing on the details of the plan , Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday .
“ At the end of the day we will have a public option ” in the House bill , Pelosi told a news conference .
She noted it was possible the Senate might include a public insurance option in its final health reform bill .
As a result , negotiations over the House bill were not just about the public option but are looking at the shape of a final bill that could be approved by both chambers , Pelosi said .
Both the Senate and the House have approved multiple health reform bills that must now be molded into a final bill that can be approved by each chamber .
The two bills will then have to be reconciled for final adoption .
President Barack Obama has been pushing for a public insurance option to provide competition for private insurers and hold down prices in his effort to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system and extend coverage to 46 million people who are uninsured .
The public insurance option would be available in a government - sponsored marketplace for small businesses and people who do not get insurance through their employers .
Most Americans have health insurance through their employers .
Polls show a majority of American support a public insurance option , but insurance firms are opposed , fearing a non-profit public insurer would have a competitive advantage that could drive them out of business .

Farmers in Argentina are pooling their resources to combat insect problems .
The government 's inability to properly fund fumigation efforts around the country has left many wheat farmers frustrated in their dealings with a plague of locusts :
Bloomberg : “ Farmers in southern Buenos Aires province will use money out of their own pockets to fumigate locusts in upcoming days because the government funds are not enough , ” Diego Raimundi , an agronomist for the Regional Agricultural Experimentation Consortium farmers group , known as Crea , said today in a phone interview from Coronel Pringles , Buenos Aires province .
Farmers are coordinating efforts because “ it makes no sense to fumigate if your neighbor doesn’t , ” Raimundi said .
No word yet on exactly how the farmers plan to raise money .

Jennifer Aniston wows in a tiny purple bikini in Mexico
When Jennifer Aniston went sunbathing in a small purple bikini on holiday , there was no shortage of people to help carry bags , umbrellas and towels for the actress .
And it was no wonder as the star , who recently turned 40 , drew plenty of admiring glances as she hit the beach and showed off her enviable figure in a pretty two - piece and straw hat .
The former Friends actress is holidaying in Cabos , Mexico with friends .
Beach break : Jennifer Aniston was spotted in Cabos , Mexico , yesterday while holidaying with friends
She has rented a large villa on the coast at the exclusive One and Only resort .
There , hotel staff whisked the trim star on a golf buggy to find the perfect sunbathing spot .
An onlooker said that after Jen had applied lotion , bodyguards and friends erected umbrellas so she could lie on her lounger to read a book and listen to music hidden from fans .
Trim :
The actress , who recently turned 40 , looked healthy and happy as she relaxed in an exclusive resort
Entourage :
The popular Marley And Me star was accompanied by assistants carrying her things to the beach as she covered up in a sarong
While she is in Mexico , the actress will be hoping to escape reports that Angelina Jolie spread rumours about her around the time that she divorced Brad Pitt .
Author Ian Halperin ’s new book , The Untold Story Of Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie , claims that Jolie , her manager and brother planted negative press stories about Jennifer in 2005 .
One of the stories was that Jennifer put her career ahead of starting a family - which put her directly at odds with Pitt , who was desperate to become a father .
Relaxing : Jen poses with her hands on her hips as a staff member stands guard and a friend points out the scenery
Lift :
The actress and friends took a golf cart to their sunbathing spot , where a bodyguard and friends carried her belongings
In the book , Halperin writes : [ Angelina ] was convinced that this is the story that would resonate with all these women who saw her as a man-stealing bitch . '
In the past , Jennifer has revealed that she ’d happily have a child through artificial insemination .
' I ’m ready for anything , ' she said of using a sperm donor .
' Bring it on .
I would n’t rule anything out .
It would not be my first choice though . '
Stroll : Jennifer looked stunning in a simple white cotton dress and was accompanied by a hotel staff member
The Marley And Me star has recently finished work on The Baster , a romantic comedy about a single mother , and The Bounty , with Gerard Butler .
Both hit the big screen next year .
Pre-production has also begun on The Goree Girls , where she will star as a Texas prisoner who joins a country band with her fellow inmates .

On today 's Ledger Live , we gear up for Thanksgiving with a visit to
Tammy the Turnpike Turkey
, a wild turkey who has evaded capture - and many , many near misses in heavy traffic - to live on at the New Jersey Turnpike 's Interchange 14B toll plaza in Jersey City .
Frankly , when I set out to shoot video of the turkey , I thought my chances of getting any decent footage was slim .
Turkeys are elusive birds , fairly shy .
And my only encounters with them were on periodic jogs through the woods when vacationing on Cape Cod .
I could never really get close .
Tammy , is , well , a bit different .
Not your average turkey .
For one , there 's her decision to spend most days hanging around the toll booths .
And then , perhaps as a result of spending so much time around people and traffic , there 's her relative friendliness .
She lets you get pretty close .
Tammy - watching , though , is no warm and fuzzy affair .
It 's a nail - biting experience , given her propensity to walk right into the busy roadway on her way too or from her evening roost on the Liberty State Park side of the off ramp .
It 's like watching a real life version of the old video game Frogger .
Something tells me this story is not going to end well .
I hope I 'm wrong .
In the meantime , keep an eye out for Tammy when you 're getting on or off the turkeypike in JC .
And please , drive slowly .

Two researchers say they have built a cylinder that acts as an ersatz electromagnetic black hole , soaking up radiation in the microwave regime like the astrophysical version sucks up matter and light .
Qiang Cheng and Tie Jun Cui of the State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves at Southeast University in Nanjing , China , detailed their creation in a paper posted to the online physics preprint Web site arXiv.org last week .
Cheng and Cui report engineering a thin cylinder 21.6 centimeters in diameter comprising 60 concentric rings of so - called metamaterials — composite structures specifically crafted to possess unique light - bending capabilities .
Unlike ordinary magnifying glasses , lenses made from metamaterials can have a negative index of refraction , meaning that refracted light bends to the same side of the " normal , " the imaginary line perpendicular to the surface of the lens , as does the incident light .
In the past few years , research groups around the world have harnessed metamaterials to create " superlenses " as well as for so - called invisibility cloaking , in which light is bent around an object as if it were not there .
The laboratory black hole is based on a similar approach — establishing a graded index of refraction to bend electromagnetic radiation inward to the cylinder 's core .
The core , in turn , is an efficient absorber of electromagnetic radiation .
In one possible application , the core would be replaced with a " payload " such as a solar cell , with the outer layers funneling light inward .
But Cui cautions that such an implementation is a long way off , requiring both that the device be modified to work at visible wavelengths and that the two - dimensional ring be extended to three dimensions .
Cheng and Cui's work represents the preliminary realization of a theoretical proposal put forth just this year by Evgenii Narimanov and Alex Kildishev of Purdue University for a metamaterial structure that could absorb incident light from all directions .
Narimanov , a professor of electrical and computer engineering , says that in the wake of his work with Kildishev , as well as the many studies into extreme light manipulation with metamaterials , he is not surprised to see the theoretical made real .
" It 's impressive , though , how quickly they have done it , " he says .
John Pendry , a physicist at Imperial College London who was among the first to harness the unusual properties of metamaterials , says the new research " constitutes an entirely novel way of constructing an absorber , but at the same time keeping control of the absorbed radiation . "
Nevertheless , Pendry notes , the analogy to black holes is imperfect .
" Black holes absorb incident radiation and other objects , but the key point about real black holes is the prediction of Hawking radiation emitted by the black hole , " he says , referring to physicist Stephen Hawking 's hypothesis that is rooted both in general relativity and quantum mechanics .
Were it observed , Hawking radiation would provide critical insight into the complicated boundary of the two theories .
" A real black hole powers the radiation through its gravitational energy , " Pendry says , " but the device reported in this paper has no internal source of energy and therefore cannot emit Hawking radiation . "
Besides , the metamaterial black hole is not as ruthlessly voracious as the gravitational kind .
Cui estimates that the demonstration black hole only absorbs 80 percent of the microwaves that hit it but that increasing the frequency of the incident light — to visible wavelengths , for instance — will increase absorption .
Such an artificial black hole for optical light is in the works and might even be developed by the end of the year , Cui says — a prediction that may raise a few eyebrows in the field .
" I think that the authors are rather optimistic in projecting into the visible region , " Pendry says .
" But I would be very happy to be proved wrong . "

We had professor William Black on TechTicker this morning .
A former regulator who handled the S&L resolution , Prof .
Black remains appalled at how this latest round of bailouts has been handled .
Case in point ?
CIT Group .
Once again , the white knight who stepped in to save the company -- the U.S. taxpayer -- gets completely hosed .
It did n't have to be this way , says Prof .
Black .
And the man responsible is Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner .
Peter Gorenstein : Another one of the nation 's largest lenders has filed for bankruptcy .
On the brink for months , CIT filed for Chapter 11 protection on Sunday .
The prepackaged plan allows CIT to restructure its debt while trying to keep badly needed loans flowing to thousands of mid-sized and small businesses .
The plan keeps CIT 's operations alive and makes it possible for the company to exit bankruptcy by year 's end .
But here 's the bad news :
While senior debt holders will only lose 30 % of their investment , we , the U.S. taxpayer , will lose the entire $ 2.3 billion we lent the company this summer .
William Black , professor at the University of Missouri - Kansas City School of Law is dumbfounded .
" We put ourselves on the hook in a completely inept way where we lose first .
We lose entirely as the taxpayers . "
Black , a former top federal banking regulator , blames Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner for negotiating such a bad deal on behalf of the American public .
His argument goes as follows :
The government was in no way obligated to lend the struggling CIT money and , in fact , initially refused to provide it bailout funds .
More importantly , being the lender of last resort , the government should have guaranteed we'd be the first to get paid if CIT eventually filed Chapter 11 .
By failing to do so , " it 's like he [ Geithner ] burned billions of dollars again in government money , our money , gratuitously , " says Black .
Black believes the problem stems from regulators ' fears that if the banks recognize a loss on the bad assets it will create a domino effect that will wipe out the entire financial system .
" If that 's true we 've got to get rid of capitalism , " he warns , " because if we can't recognize losses in a capitalist system we have no future . "
It would be a shock if “ Antichrist ” had turned out to be anything but shocking .
After all , the giving of offense has long been the stock - in - trade of its writer and director , Lars von Trier , the man who brought us “ Breaking the Waves , ” “ The Idiots , ” and “ Dogville . ”
This year , the new film was jeered to the rafters at the Cannes Film Festival , although the energetic snagging of attention is as hallowed a Cannes custom as the hiking of prices in the local seafood joints .
Better by far to see the movie now , and thus to establish , under less seething conditions , if the provocation was indeed a mere flourish of perverse P.R. , or whether it remains an essential part of some more solemn design .
We begin at the deep end , with copulation and death .
An unnamed man , listed in the credits only as He ( Willem Dafoe ) , and his wife , otherwise known as She ( Charlotte Gainsbourg ) , are in the bathroom of their family home , busy doing It .
This is a rapturous occasion , shot in glittering monochrome , featuring slow - motion closeups of the conjugal act , and stirred by the dolorous strains of a Handel aria .
“ May sorrow break these chains of my sufferings , for pity ’s sake , ” the libretto tells us : a curious invocation — we expect joy , not sorrow , to perform that task — and one that von Trier is only too eager to obey , closing the sequence with the orgasm of the adults and , simultaneously , the fatal fall of their young son , who climbs to a window and drops into the snow - thickened night .
Because their attention was distracted by desire , their grief will be compounded and crazed by guilt .
At this point , we shift into color , although anyone expecting the director of photography , Anthony Dod Mantle , to revisit the hot hues of his previous film , “ Slumdog Millionaire , ” will be disappointed .
“ Antichrist ” is set in Seattle and the wilds of the Northwest , as far from Mumbai as can be imagined , and the glum interiors — the bathroom where the couple made love is now a scummy blue — compete for desolation with the great outdoors .
Our first hint that the natural world will be a wellspring not of pastoral ease but of mystification and threat comes at the heroine ’s bedside , in a clinic ; she lies there , leaden with loss , while the camera closes in on the stalks of a well - wisher ’s flowers in a vase next to her — rotting stumps of green , in a swirling murk .
Her husband , a psychologist , takes her home and tells her not to dodge her distress but to meet it face to face .
“ Will it get worse ? ” she asks .
“ Yes , it will , ” he replies .
He asks her to nominate the place where she is most afraid .
“ The woods , ” she says , and so into the woods , for the rest of the film , they go .
“ Antichrist , ” whose title I do n’t claim to understand , is split into chapters , with headings like “ Despair ( Gynocides ) ” and “ Pain ( Chaos Reigns ) . ”
It would be hard to prove that these mean much , or refer to any cogent structure in the film .
At best , they are a mocking mirror of the steps undertaken in therapy , and one thing that rises from “ Antichrist ” is a disdain for the limitations of the shrink .
There are more things in heaven and earth , the film suggests , than are dream ’d of in our psychology , and there is true venom in the wife ’s voice when she says to her spouse , “ I never interested you till now .
Now I ’m your patient . ”
What is more , the savagery that has earned the film its noisome reputation begins only after she has announced , “ I ’m cured , I ’m fine . ”
Civilizing science , in other words , has done its duty and withdrawn , allowing the bestial — that part of humanity which lies beyond the reach of reason — to emerge and flex its jaws .
By this time , He and She are in Eden , their secluded shack in the countryside .
Call me fanciful , but I think the name is on the loaded side , for it is here that the fall of man and the collapse of woman take place , and where the landscape , its trees as lopped and blasted as those on a battlefield , looks anything but prelapsarian .
A fox lies bleeding in the long grass , which rustles like the suburban lawn at the start of “ Blue Velvet ” ; a startled doe runs off with a half - born fawn still swinging from her rump ; a chick , splayed on the ground but not yet dead , swarms with marauding ants .
The humans , too , are under siege : first from acorns that rifle onto the roof like bullets and from weird spores — is that what they are ?— that smother the man ’s hand when he wakes in the morning , and , second , from each other .
For every promise of affection , there is a snap of wrath , and the woman who declares , “ I love you , darling , ” is the same person who , not long after , fetches a drill to bore a hole in her beloved ’s leg , plus a pair of scissors for herself .
If you have eyes , prepare to shut them now .
A word to the squeamish : there is no shame in leaving as the tools — and I use the word advisedly — come out .
In a way , you will be getting the best of “ Antichrist , ” which until now has been a film of awkwardness , confusion , and great beauty .
I see no reason to ally oneself wholeheartedly either with those who despise von Trier for his horrific silliness or with those who revere his ambition .
Both have a point , and the problem is that von Trier , even at his most objectionable , can summon a wealth of images that defy explanation .
I am thinking of the forest , at night , and the couple , unclothed and entangled , amidst the gnarled roots of a tree , with white hands sprouting from the earth as if to drag them down ; or of the woman alone there , pleasuring herself in a kind of fury , with the man — and his paltry pleasures — no longer required .
At Cannes , the film received two prizes : one for Charlotte Gainsbourg , as Best Actress , and a scornful anti-trophy for von Trier , awarded for misogyny by the Ecumenical Jury .
How the two should be squared I am unsure .
The movie certainly shudders with a terror of female power , and the last thing we see is a monstrous regiment of women , their faces blanked out , streaming up a hillside , like the nightmare of a Puritan preacher .
Yet so plain is Gainsbourg ’s dramatic dominance , as opposed to her place in von Trier ’s mad ideological scheme , that she carries the tale with a conviction barely hinted at in the script .
Dafoe is game but wearily baffled , as if he were only just realizing what he signed up for , and how it adds to his list of screen punishments : first he had hot wax dripped onto his sternum by Madonna , in “ Body of Evidence , ” then he suffered the intense humiliation of being beaten up by Tobey Maguire , in “ Spider - Man , ” and now he has a log being used as a battering ram on his private parts .
Even Madonna would have frowned at that .
The worst aspect of the violence here is not so much its methodical nastiness , or even its taint of exhibitionism ( “ Gaze upon this , if you dare , ” von Trier seems to say ) , as the way in which it debases the milder but more serious acts of aggression in the earlier scenes .
The couple ’s lovemaking , after the child ’s demise , has an edge of extremity that is both upsetting — the woman bites the man , and later asks him to hit her — and dangerously credible .
To my eyes , this is the one area in which “ Antichrist , ” so often ridiculous , makes sense : as a study of the kinship between loss and lust .
Few subjects are trickier to approach .
A. D. Nuttall , in “ Shakespeare the Thinker , ” published posthumously in 2007 , argues that when the newly widowed Lady Anne , in “ Richard III , ” yields to the advances of the disfigured hero she is “ compliant not so much in spite of her bereavement as because of it . ”
Then , there is Gerald , in D. H. Lawrence ’s “ Women in Love , ” stealing into Gudrun ’s bedroom three days after his father ’s funeral : “ into her he poured all his pent - up darkness and corrosive death , and he was whole again . ”
Some hope .
Cinema has given us the married couple , stricken by their daughter ’s drowning , in “ Do n’t Look Now , ” who can still take an audience aback with the urgency of their grappling ( might they be trying for another child ? ) , and Nanni Moretti , in this year ’s “ Quiet Chaos , ” who is numbed by the passing of his wife at the start of the film , but who jolts himself awake toward the end , with a strenuous bout .
In each case , the equation is simple : the pulse of life , felt most strongly in sex , is greater than the terrifying zero of death .
The same applies to “ Antichrist , ” with a twist : it was sex that led to death in the first place .
That ’s why the movie is so self - involved , and leaves you fighting for breath , and why I believe von Trier when he describes the whole thing as a “ dream film . ”
That would account for the want of logic , for the claustrophobia , and for the incantatory manner in which details loop round and recur .
I can no more rid myself of the memory of the wife , in a glowing white dress , crossing a moonlit bridge , than I can of Arthur Rackham drawings in a book of fairy tales from my childhood .
I feel the same way about the fox in the film ; without warning , it speaks , and most people giggle at the sound , but we accept something similar in “ Peter and the Wolf , ” so why the derision here , since von Trier is clearly carving out a fable ?
Maybe that should be his next challenge : a PG rating .
Skip the mutilation , stay in the woods , and make as strange a film as possible for kids .
We can take it . ♦
Magnifye is developing the technology to produce the strongest permanent magnets in the world with a one - inch magnet able to lift a lorry .
These magnets can be used for anything from trains to MRI machines and because of the size of the magnet make it possible to shrink these large scale industrial applications .
Using rare earth superconductors Magnifye 's technology enables these to be magnetised to fields orders of magnitude greater than that available from ordinary permanent magnet materials such as NdFeB and SmCo .
Magnifye has developed a heat engine which converts thermal energy into currents of millions of amps .
The thermal energy is used to create a series of magnetic waves which progressively magnetise the superconductor much in the same way a nail can be magnetised by stroking it over a magnet .
As long as the superconductor stays cold , the currents will flow uninterrupted , providing powerful , stable , shapeable magnetic fields for a wide range of applications .
These powerful magnets can be small enough to fit in the palm of the hand and large enough to power a train or a cruise liner .

All we 'll swear to is this being the real deal , the absolute first moneyed college booster sentenced to the big house for NCAA rules bustin ' .
That and overspending on a marginal Memphis - bred defensive tackle , Albert Means .
Meet the big - talking booster who 's sat atop the NCAA 's list of suspicious characters for the better part of three decades , longer probably than anyone else : Logan C. Young Jr .
Since the days when Joe Namath was quarterback , Logan Young has been perhaps ' Bama 's most influential booster .
Name does n't ring a bell , you say ?
Well , if you live in SEC Country where college football is a 365 - day - a - year topic of conversation at the local Waffle House , in law offices and around corporate boardrooms , you damn well know the legend of Logan Young .
Heard his name bandied about on sports talk radio from Little Rock , Ark. , to Lexington , Ky. , often linked to ' Bama 's recruiting .
And the tales of his hanging with college coaches , most notably the late Paul " Bear " Bryant , whom , the story goes , valued the gregarious Logan as a close ally and drinking buddy .
So , was Coach Bryant 's old chum set up for the ultimate booster fall ?
Did Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer , fuming over getting beat on top players in Memphis , call upon a handful of Vols loyalists to dig up the goods on Young and then hand them over to Southeastern Conference and NCAA investigators , ultimately leading to charges being brought by the U.S. Attorneys office in Memphis ?
Heck , yeah .
That does n't pardon Young , nor should it necessarily wipe away a pending six - month prison gig .
Yet while sullying a rival program or its coach has turned trendy of late ( think Larry Eustachy and Iowa State , Mike Price and Alabama , Rick Neuheisel and Washington ) , what went down here is rife with enough dark conspiracy and shadowy characters to carry a slam - bang John Grisham suspense novel .
Catch the images : A private eye under contract to the SEC casing Logan Young 's house , waiting curbside for a chance to sift through his pea - green trash bin .
The NCAA enlisting at least 11 secret witnesses , led by Fulmer and his booster buddies .
Fulmer warning the SEC that one of his boosters is " a queer . "
Lest we forget the NCAA hierarchy , those guardians of academic integrity , cutting a deal for Means to leave Alabama and immediately become eligible at the University of Memphis .
Means just missed playing for Rip Scherer , who happened to be a secret witness in the case against Alabama before he was fired as Memphis ' head coach .
And , in something of a first , the NCAA never questioned Mean 's eligibility even though his former Trezevant High coach laid out how he paid a teammate $ 30 to take the college entrance exam for Means .
All this wonderful theater going on while authorities hunted and eventually shut down perhaps college football 's most notorious fan .
And the irony is Young never set foot in a Tuscaloosa classroom .
Vanderbilt was his school , though he never graduated .
" Logan Young got the bad end of the deal , " the sympathetic wife of a secret witness told ESPN.com .
" This guy was a target .
...
Maybe they thought he was cheating on some players .
Maybe he was , but when someone 's life is altered it is wrong .
It went too far . "
Security will be on guard around Phillip Fulmer when the Tennessee coach leads his Vols into Tuscaloosa on Saturday .
And so the page turns on what promises to be another wacky chapter Saturday when Tennessee visits Bryant - Denny Stadium for the first time since word leaked of Fulmer 's role in the NCAA case .
Tennessee might have supplanted Auburn as Alabama 's biggest rival .
Officials say that this might be the hardest ticket to come by in stadium history .
Uniformed sideline security guards around Coach Fulmer promise to be on full display in Tuscaloosa , but , hey , that 's a Saturday ritual with Southern football coaches , anyway .
Fulmer , surely , will be a target of scorn by Alabama fans , who caught wind of his involvement in the investigation since the Vols came to town two years ago .
In a statement to NCAA investigators , which surfaced as part of discovery in a lawsuit filed by two fired Alabama assistant coaches , Fulmer casts Young as " Bryant 's bagman . "
In a confidential memo to then SEC Commissioner Roy Kramer , Fulmer went so far as to suggest Young " was connected to the Mafia , " advising : " I do n't know if he is or not , or how far he would take retaliation , but I can't operate my program with that jerk buying players from under our nose ! "
Mafia , death threats and what an old Alabama coach terms the college game 's " most unhealthy rivalry . "
As you might expect , the fallout runs deep :
• The storied Alabama football program was spared the NCAA " death penalty , " only to be hit with five years probation , a two - year bowl ban and the loss of 21 scholarships .
• Two Alabama assistant coaches lost their jobs -- though they are fighting back in the courts .
• Three Alabama boosters were officially " disassociated " by the university .
As for Logan Young , the most prominent of those three boosters , Alabama officials stuck a lifetime ban on him and pulled his 24 - seat skybox ( price tag : $ 40,000 ) after he came under investigation for illegal recruiting in 2000 .
Logan says he has n't been back since , except to spend time with old Sooners coach Barry Switzer at the Oklahoma game in 2003 .
The good Lord willing , he 'll prop himself up and watch the game on a TV from his bed at Methodist Hospital Central , where he underwent kidney transplant surgery Thursday morning .
He might be wearing a hospital gown that ties in the back like everyone else , but he 'll be recuperating in a two - room suite , with a TV tuned to the game in each room .
Young , who turns 65 in November , might be watching Alabama from behind bars next year .
Once he has sufficiently recovered from his surgery , it 's off to federal prison for six months , unless his conviction for bribing a " public servant " is overturned on appeal .
" For Your Eyes Only ! ! ! "
On a dreary Friday afternoon in late September , Young answered the door of his English Tudor home in an exclusive neighborhood bordering the Pink Palace Museum , looking frail in a beige knit golf shirt and gray slacks that hung loosely from his belted waist .
He appeared shorter than expected for such a powerful dealmaker , maybe 5 - foot - 8 or 5 - 9 , with near perfect Jimmy Johnson hair .
And , of course , there are gentle reminders of his ' Bama allegiance ( the late - model Jaguar is white , however ) .
The shiny , crimson No. 12 Alabama helmet -- signed " Joe Willie Namath " -- on the kitchen counter .
The memorabilia scattered about his first - floor office , set off by a large photo of Logan and Coach Bryant that is hung on the wall .
Young leads the way to his spacious , second - floor bedroom .
This is where he watches his sports on a large - screen TV .
Where , according to former Trezevant High coach Lynn Lang , the two periodically huddled , beginning in 1999 , for the payments on Means -- routinely $ 9,000 dispensed in $ 100 bills .
Paul " Bear " Bryant , a longtime friend of Young 's father , became a father figure to Logan when his dad passed away in 1971 .
Now , Logan is sifting through piles of records and statements used in the NCAA case against him , seeing some for the first time .
His mood runs from bursts of laughter to outbursts of rage .
No matter the weight of evidence or the jury ruling against him , Young rambles on and on about his innocence .
And he swears Alabama could have torpedoed the NCAA case , if only the school had investigated and fought the charges against him .
But most of his venom is spewed at Kramer , the old SEC boss , Fulmer and a band of Memphis - bred UT boosters .
Guys like local Democratic Party operative , real estate developer and UT trustee Karl Schledwitz and wealthy businessman Duke Clement , for whom the last four digits of his home phone number spell " VOLS . "
And yes , Roy " TennStud " Adams , one - time president of the UT Alumni Association and a Young rival known for posting what he calls " street - talk " on a popular Tennessee fan Web site .
" I think they 're jealous as hell of Alabama , always have been over the national championships and SEC championships , " begins Young , leaning forward in his thick , cushioned seat .
" I mean they won 13 SECs and Alabama has won 21 .
The fact that Coach Bryant used to come up here and see me , and I 'm friendly with a lot of coaches . "
" If you ask me , " Young begins again , " Schledwitz was just looking for some kind of political publicity .
I 'm sure Fulmer asked him to get involved .
I mean Fulmer directed the investigation .
All because Alabama recruited a couple players in Tennessee and he blamed me for buying them , and it is a lie .
He said I bought them .
I mean he goes [ into ]
Alabama and gets players .
That is OK .
But if he loses players over here , somebody paid for them . "
Logan is right about at least one thing : Fulmer piqued Kramer 's interest enough to kick the SEC office into an investigative mode , and later lined up potential witnesses to chat up lead NCAA investigator Rich Johanningmeier .
All of this is clear from an exhaustive paper trail of documents uncovered in a lawsuit that offers a rare glimpse into the underbelly of an NCAA probe .
In faxes ( at least six , between April 13 and Sept. 16 , 1998 ) to the SEC commissioner , Fulmer lays out how Alabama allegedly is busting the rulebook .
The documents , typed on Tennessee football letterhead , are variously labeled " Confidential " and " For Your Eyes Only ! ! ! "
Each cover sheet is addressed to " Coach Kramer . "
Kramer forwarded the information to ex-FBI agent Bill Sievers , then under contract to the conference , who in turn hired a private eye to work the case in Memphis .
It is apparent Fulmer was frustrated and consumed by Young .
In a memo to Kramer , Fulmer rehashed Young 's ties to the late Bear Bryant , offering up phone numbers , addresses and points of contact in a who 's who of players Young allegedly bought -- " usually defensive linemen that are black and poor . "
" [ Young ] is very wealthy and often drinks a lot and brags about his boys he gets to go to Alabama , " Fulmer wrote to Kramer .
Roy Adams is perhaps better known as " TennStud , " the handle he uses when posting gossip on UT fan Web sites .
With assets worth $ 14 million , Young could afford to sink $ 1 million into his legal defense team , which was led by former Watergate prosecutor James Neal .
Born into money , Young inherited Osceola Foods .
By the mid-1980s , he and his partners split $ 25 million after selling a local Pepsi-Cola bottling operation .
As owner of the USFL's Memphis Showboats , Young brought professional football and former UT standout defensive end Reggie White to his hometown .
Young was a well - heeled booster , but not much better off than UT rival Duke Clement , whose estate was valued at $ 5.3 million in a divorce settlement last December .
Like Young , he inherited the family business , belongs to the Memphis Country Club and is a member of a couple of hunting clubs .
He , too , has been known to drink to excess , at least according to his ex-wife , who graphically described his raucous , frat boy behavior in divorce filings .
In a tape - recorded interview with NCAA investigators , Clement described himself as " personal friends " with Coach Fulmer , then set out to define the lifestyle of Logan Young .
He reveled in the story of Young hiring a limo one night to cart Clement and his wife , along with Young 's then - girlfriend , to the Horseshoe Casino in nearby Tunica , Miss .
Told of Young winning 25 grand in less than an hour at the blackjack table .
Talked about a dinner party where Young , fueled by J&B and water , bragged on end about recruits he'd bought .
" He always says , ' I learned from the master , ' " Clement said after being granted secret witness status by the NCAA .
" I ask him , ' What are you talking about ? '
He said , ' The Bear taught me how to do it . '
He said , ' I learned from the master . ' ...
He 's cussin ' and he 's sayin ' , ' I 'm so much smarter than that NCAA .
They 'll never catch me . ' "
Unbeknownst to Young , SEC gumshoes already had tailed him to places like The Grove Grill and Folk 's Folly , assigned to " observe Young at his hangouts and overhear conversations . "
Among the gems uncovered in the detailed investigative reports was news that when the scotch kicks in , Young " will begin to shout ' Roll Tide ' and / or sneeze . "
Thanks to a July 26 , 1999 , memo from his ex-FBI agent , Commissioner Kramer also knew that Mean 's high school coach , Lynn Lang , had put his services up for bid -- at least six months before Means signed with Alabama .
UT assistant Pat Washington called the investigator to say Lang had told him it would take a house and a car for Means ' mother , plus 50 grand for Lang and something for his assistant , Milton Kirk .
In a memo to Kramer , the SEC investigator recommended using the UT assistant as bait : " We have the opportunity to have Washington tape record his conversations and have law enforcement authorities prosecute Lang . ... I believe it will put a stop to high school coaches soliciting money from SEC coaches . "
Kramer nixed the idea , yet never warned Alabama officials to be careful dealing with Lang .
Whether the SEC alerted other conference schools about Means ' coach is unclear , and Kramer recently declined comment when asked about it by ESPN.com .
What 's certain , however , is that the SEC no longer hires private investigators after Mike Slive succeeded Kramer in 2002 .
" Again , it 's not so complicated to put together what happened here if you look at how Fulmer used Kramer to get Alabama , " says Montgomery - based attorney Tommy Gallion , who represented Alabama assistant coaches Ronnie Cottrell and Ivy Williams , who were fired for their part in recruiting Means .
" They knew about Albert Means .
They let Alabama fall into the trap . "
" I 'll pay you $ 50 if you 'll sing Rocky Top "
Almost nine months after Young 's conviction on bribing a high school coach , the UT boosters who were party to his demise do n't see what all the complaining is about .
Logan C. Young Jr. is a convicted felon -- case closed .
Move on .
They did their jobs , and have no regrets .
When a visitor showed up at Roy Adams ' house for one of his recent Saturday football parties , the amiable host was eager to catch up on his old drinking buddy .
Told that Young continues to swear he did n't buy a soul , Adams called across the room to Chuck Cole , another Tennessee booster who played a part in Young 's demise : " Chuck , you 're not gonna believe this -- Logan still says he 's innocent . "
Laughter erupted in a domino path around a room littered with UT fans and friends , local high school coaches , current and former Memphis players who come and go until late night , checking out the games on six TVs lining a long wall .
" When I see Alabama , I see Logan Young , " rants Adams , playing to the crowd .
" Dollar signs here , dollar signs there .
Rich S.O.B. had more money than brains .
Corrupting something I love . "
Once friends with Logan Young , Tennessee booster Roy Adams now takes delight in his ' Bama rival 's legal demise .
Adams is one of Tennessee 's troubling boosters .
Fulmer described him as " a bad guy ! " in a memo to Kramer .
Questioned his sexual orientation too in another correspondence .
He also claimed Adams had been disassociated from the UT program , though his own compliance director says that is not the case .
Adams , in fact , says he's had two season tickets , perched above the 25 - yard line , for the last 30 years ( some the stubs are framed and hang on his living room wall ) and still contributes $ 500 annually to the university .
Before the NCAA tightened restrictions on booster involvement in the late 1980s , Adams admits to taking care of some UT players .
Now , the 70 - year - old bon vivant claims to keep his distance , though casting himself as a " friend of athletes " in general .
But how removed is he ?
Adams produced a recent letter in which a former UT player implied that an Alabama booster tried to buy him coming out of high school , only to conclude his correspondence by soliciting Adams ' aid in finding a job .
The reputation of helping kids is n't anything Adams runs from , and loudly declares that it's his constitutional right to lend a hand , especially at schools where he is n't a booster .
He tells of buying a car for a Florida kid he steered to LSU more than a decade ago .
Former Miami and Seattle Seahawks star defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy , who grew up in nearby Osceola , Ark. , is an occasional houseguest and has a key to a second - floor room .
At Adams ' house later this night , three University of Memphis players -- two redshirts and a starter lost to a knee injury -- fill their plates with ribs and chicken and watch their Tiger teammates play at Tulsa ( Adams ' nephew , Trey , is a backup place - kicker for Memphis ) .
" If he is a booster , what he does is illegal , " Young says of Adams .
" It 's not legal to have high school coaches and give them whiskey .
Give them anything .
I mean Roy , he 'd call players on the phone in my presence .
He called [ former UT tailback ]
Jay Graham and said , ' I 'll pay you $ 50 if you 'll sing Rocky Top . '
I did n't think anything about that .
I mean , so what ?
Yet they made a big to - do out of [ me ] talking about football , and laughing and joking . "
Everybody but Logan Young , Lynn Lang and other ' slave traders ' are welcomed at Adams ' Saturday football parties .
The two boosters admit to enjoying a night of gambling at the casinos across the Mississippi line .
Adams posted the rumor on the Internet , as well as offered it up in a sworn deposition , that Young might have funneled money to players inside one of the casinos .
In his videotaped deposition , Adams explained how it works : Sign for a $ 100,000 marker , play a little blackjack , then cash out and walk away with the rest -- a booster 's perfect laundering scheme .
" You ca n't go to casino and do what Roy said I was doing , " said Young , shaking his head .
" No. 1 , the FBI went to the casino .
They told them every time I came and who I came with , and how much I played and when I left and what I left with .
He did n't understand that they got videos in casinos .
Ca n't lie about what you 're doing . "
In some ways , Adams and Young are boosters with more in common than either cares to admit .
Until a falling out 10 years ago , the two found time to comfortably kibitz about football over food and drinks .
A defining moment in this scandalous mess came in 1995 when Peyton Manning , then a mere sophomore , led Tennessee to a 41 - 14 victory that ended a nine - year winless string against Alabama .
As Adams recalls , a few weeks later Young invited him to meet at Folk 's Folly , a popular steakhouse on Memphis ' east side , and proceeded to spout what Adams ' took as a declaration of war .
" He 'd been drinking , and he said , ' I want to tell you one God damn thing : Soon as Peyton Manning leaves y'all never beat Alabama again , ' " recalls Adams , who admits to his own love of liquor .
" And they had just gone through this [ NCAA ] investigation , had to forfeit 10 games the previous season .
I had never said a negative word about Alabama or him to his face .
It had built up and built up , frustration .
I said , ' Let me tell you another God damn thing , we have n't been put on probation and had to forfeit games . '
And that was the end of our 10 - year friendship , over a damn football game .
" If that did n't happen , I would have still covered for him .
Or would never have said anything or told the truth about him .
I mean during that 10 - year period over drinks and wine , Logan made no secret of how he was able to buy players and stuff like that .
I knew .
I had to cover up for him .
In fact , the NCAA had come to town questioning me about something else .
They said , ' You think Logan is buying players ? '
I said , ' Oh no , that is just Tennessee people and other people talking . ' "
Says Young : " I might have said , ' Hey , y'all not gonna be worth a damn when Manning leaves . '
So what ?
You gonna try and put somebody in prison for that ? "
" He loved Alabama -- ' not too wisely , but too well ' "
What got the feds all hot about something normally handled inside the NCAA ?
Young suspects Schledwitz , a political mover , of drawing interest to the case .
Others speculate liquor store owner Arthur Kahn , himself a former assistant U.S. attorney who is now married to Young 's one - time girlfriend , of playing a role .
( Kahn admits helping the feds fill in some blanks late in the case , but nothing else . )
Or maybe the story was just too hard to ignore .
The fervor picked up after Schledwitz , a booster friend of Fulmer 's and now a UT trustee , met with the coach while helping arrange a donation to the athletic department .
It was then that Fulmer vented his frustration over Logan Young , and let it be known he could use a friendly hand sorting through the mess in Memphis .
" Yeah , I 'd say that is accurate , " Schledwitz told ESPN.com .
Schledwitz proceeded to phone Adams , among others , and overnight gave organization to what had been only gossip and rumor .
Cole , the UT booster with an ear to recruiting gossip , got a call from Fulmer late one night .
Based on what he told Fulmer , the NCAA met with Cole in Room 930 of the Memphis Marriott East .
" Fulmer 's deal was he wanted a level playing field , " Cole told ESPN.com .
" I advised him one time -- ran through Logan and the things he was doing -- and he expressed the same frustrations he'd told Karl . "
All the rumors and innuendo still would n't have held the NCAA 's attention if not for Adams , the chatterbox face of the boosters , getting Milton Kirk to spill his guts after a chance encounter at a Memphis Touchdown Club meeting on Oct. 24 , 2000 .
Rumor had Kirk being stiffed on a SUV that was promised as part of the deal that sent Means to Alabama .
And so , standing in the lobby of the Chickasaw Country Club , Adams jokingly asked about his ride .
" He just laughed and smiled , and began to tell me the whole story about what went down , " Adams says .
" Hell , we had never got any first - hand information , so I immediately called a couple of the Tennessee people over to let them listen to it in case we could do something to follow through . "
Even with James Neal defending him , Young could n't beat the charges that UT boosters helped investigators build against him .
The adrenaline rush was such you 'd have thought Peyton Manning re-upped for another four - year gig .
Adams set up a dinner meeting with guest of honor Kirk the following week at Jim's Place East , one of the top restaurants in Memphis .
Schledwitz , who records reveal was interviewed at least twice by NCAA investigators , was then brought in to close the deal , to ensure Kirk 's cooperation with the NCAA .
His presence insured Kirk 's cooperation with the NCAA and Schledwitz ultimately served as Kirk 's attorney .
" Chuck Cole and a couple other folks sat there talking to Milton , " Adams recalls .
" I was still having him repeat this story , cause I did n't want to get involved unless I absolutely felt comfortable he was telling the truth .
So I was making sure he told the same story over and over .
Well , we 're having a few drinks before Karl arrived .
The NCAA had got on him , but he had refused to sign anything , refused to be tape recorded .
He wanted this to get out , but he did n't want to get that involved .
But when Karl Schledwitz walked through that door , Milton 's whole persona changed , ' cause Karl Schledwitz is the white Democrat in this black community .
He had managed the campaign for Milton 's brother [ Cleo ] , who is a prominent black politician on the county commission .
" So over dinner and drinks , Milton told the story again and so Karl believed him and felt comfortable .
Milton threw himself at the mercy of Karl , and he did everything that Karl said to do .
Karl immediately called the NCAA .
And within a couple days they flew into Memphis and , at the Marriott Hotel , Milton agreed to be tape recorded , signed statements and everything .
" The NCAA , who had been after Logan Young for 20 years , finally had something . "
And Phillip Fulmer had perhaps his finest coaching victory .
The booster scandal soon left the recruiting scene and Young was indicted by a federal grand jury and convicted of paying $ 150,000 to lock up Means , the local schoolboy defensive tackle , for his beloved Crimson Tide .
Pending a successful appeal , Logan C. Young Jr. is heading to federal prison .
" Mr. Lang committed a crime for greed -- money , " Neal , Young 's defense attorney , argued at sentencing .
" Mr. Young 's sin here -- his motive -- it was n't for greed .
To quote Shakespeare , he loved Alabama -- ' not too wisely , but too well . ' "
Said U.S. Attorney Fred Godwin in his closing argument : " He spent his money -- not wisely , but well . "

Speaking of books , here ’s a passage from Mark Kleiman ’s When Brute Force Fails that I ’ve been meaning to blog for a while :
Given the decrease in lead exposure among children since the 1980s and the estimated effects of lead on crime , reduced lead exposure could easily explain a very large proportion — certainly more than half — of the crime decrease of the 1994 - 2004 period .
A careful statistical study relating local changes in lead exposure to local crime rates estimates the fraction of the crime decline due to lead reduction as greater than 90 % .
Mark ’s book is focused on a particular strategy for reducing crime , so this topic gets only a couple of pages in a chapter on miscellaneous methods of crime control .
But surely it deserves more ?
1
If it ’s really true that lead reduction was responsible for most of the post - 1990 decrease in crime , and if changing demographics played a role as well , does n’t that mean that everything else probably had almost no effect at all ?
Broken windows , open - air drug markets , three - strikes laws , CompStat , bulging prison populations , etc. etc. — all of them together could n’t have had more than a minuscule impact if lead and demographics explain almost everything .
I do n’t really have a lot to say about this , actually .
Mainly I just wanted to highlight this passage because it ’s pretty interesting .
It seems a little discouraging , though , if it ’s really true that all our best efforts to reduce crime over the past couple of decades have had a collective impact only barely different from zero .
On the other hand , it certainly means that federal spending to eliminate lead from houses ought to be a no - brainer .
It would cost about $ 30 billion , but as Mark says , it would probably save us at least $ 30 billion per year in reduced crime .
The fact that Congress did n’t allocate this money long ago makes you wonder if maybe the Capitol building could use a lead abatement program of its own .
2
1 Of course it deserves more .
So here ’s a bit more .
2 The stimulus bill included $ 100 million for lead abatement , which is fine .
But considering just how effective lead reduction is on all sorts of policy levels , it ’s sort of a crime that they could n’t manage to dig up a little more than that out of an $ 800 billion total .
Reflection : Balloon Kid ( Gameboy )
[ UPDATE : The Balloon Boy was found hiding in his home .
Yes , it ’s the kid in the well all over again . ]
Yes yes , it ’s WAY TOO SOON .
However , today ’s news of the 6 yr- old Balloon Boy ( which at this time still has us glued to our TVs and internets ) bares a slight resemblance to a 1990 Gameboy game ( and re-released in 2000 on the Gameboy Color ) from Nintendo .
Okay , not really .
We can at least take a minute to reflect on the extremely fun game , which itself was somewhat based on Balloon Fight .
The game stars Alice , a heroine who must flap her hands wildly to float through the levels collecting items and avoiding enemies and pencils ( the game is set in Pencilvania , get it ? ) all the while picking up more balloons left by her bother Jim .
Boasting some intriguing physics for the little portable system , BK never really hit it big .
Sound bizarre ?
It ’s not half as bizarre as the Balloon Boy news : flying saucers , Wifeswap , and Martian Pyramids are all taking a role in this developing story .
We do n’t want to sound insensitive as we pray for the kid ’s safety , but hope to God that the parents are given the Darwin Award .

Did you know that 69,054,299 more people voted for Barack Obama than voted for Olympia Snowe ?
And did you know that , like the majority of Americans who voted for Barack Obama and support the public option , the majority of Mainers also do ?
If you read Daily Kos regularly , you did know that already .
From Research 2000 polling done for Daily Kos last month :
Research 2000 for Daily Kos. 9/14 -16 .
Likely voters .
MoE 4 % .
Do you favor or oppose creating a government - administered health insurance option that anyone can purchase to compete with private insurance plans ?
Favor Oppose Not Sure
All 58 29 13
Dem 81 16 3
Rep 18 58 24
Ind 67 20 13
Look at those Independent numbers -- 67 percent in favor !
Hell , even 42 percent of Republicans like it or are n't sure that it 's such a bad idea .
Lest anyone think that poll was an outlier , here 's another that backs up those findings .
A new poll of Maine voters [ pdf ] from the Pan Atlantic SMS Group , which regularly surveys the state , offers a glimpse at the home state pressure on Olympia Snowe -- and Susan Collins -- to break with her party and back health care legislation , and suggests that they would be rewarded at home for backing a public option .
The survey finds that 58 % of Mainers approve of how President Obama is doing his job , and that a plurality of 46 % back his plans for health care .
A twenty - point majority favor a public option , asked like this : " Would you favor or oppose the government offering everyone a government administered health insurance plan – something like the Medicare coverage that people 65 and older get – that would compete with private health insurance plans ? "
Politico's Ben Smith is actually sort of burying the lede there , because the actual story is n't the 46 % backing his plan for health reform .
It 's the twenty - point majority of Mainers - - 57.4 to 37.2 -- who approve a government option that 's the story .
Their Senators are going to be disappointing them .
Snowe 's record on it is clear -- she 's going to try to trigger it to death , and Collins spent the morning shooting down the rumor that she was open to reform at all .
So why is President Snowe going to be at the table on reform for the country when she 's not even representing her own state ?
Across the country , the movement to ban smoking in residential buildings is gaining traction .
The Department of Housing and Urban Development has strongly encouraged public housing agencies to ban smoking in some or all of their units .
Image Brian Mossotti , who lives in a nonsmoking apartment on West 23rd Street , now goes to the street or the roof to smoke .

So far , about 50 public housing agencies have now forbidden smoking , according to Betsy Feigin Befus , a lawyer with the National Multi Housing Council , a landlord trade group that has tracked the efforts .
Other cities , through legislation or by initiatives of developers , have taken similar steps .
In California , for example , all apartments and condos in Richmond , near San Francisco , must outlaw cigarette smoking , according to an ordinance passed in July .
Across the bay in Belmont , a ban on smoking in apartments took effect in January after a 14 - month grace period , with $ 100 fines possible for offenders .
While there is no question about the dangers of secondhand smoke , there is debate about whether the amount of smoke that may be transmitted from one apartment to another is harmful .
A recent study by New York City ’s health department found that about 57 percent of nonsmokers had been exposed to substantial levels of cigarette smoke , raising suspicions among experts that apartment dwellers might be susceptible to secondhand smoke from their neighbors .
New York City has been at the forefront of efforts to ban smoking in bars and restaurants , and the city ’s health commissioner , Dr. Thomas A. Farley , said in September that he supported a ban on smoking at city beaches and parks .
But the city , he said , has no plan to push for a smoking ban in public housing developments .
The city did help Related research the health effects of smoke in apartment buildings , Dr. Farley said , adding , “ Our focus would be on individuals having their homes smoke - free . ”
Pan Am Equities , a real estate management company , may have been one of the first in New York to introduce a smoking ban to an apartment building .
About 18 months ago , the company asked new renters to promise not to smoke ; the ban did not affect existing tenants , according to David Iwanier , a company vice president .

This position united together independent economists and the members of the economic team of the NDSV ( the party of the former Bulgarian tsar Simeon Saxecobourggotta , now outside parliament ) .
At a discussion about Budget 2010 the former deputy finance minister Lyubomir Datsov said that the budget last month has been balanced on the 26th which means that 4 days of spending had been saved .
To rely that this spending will be compensated next year by unexpected revenues is illogical , he said .
His opinion about the accounting balancing of the budget was supported by the economist from the Centre for Liberal Strategies Georgi Ganev who said that it was high time the budget to calculated nominally and not only on an accounting basis .
He even suggested that this can happen next year .
" Honestly speaking , if this can be done , you will again prove guilty ( the ex-rulers ) .
I think that they will have a political stimulus when the budget starts putting pressure on them , to do this , to publish it and again you will prove to be guilty for the current situation , which is a fact but , maybe , in the long - term it will be good the budget to be published " , Georgi Ganev added .
The economic team of NDSV also criticised the unofficial and inaccurate information about the obligations of the state to the business .
According to some business organisations the amount of the debt is 1.5 bn levs ( 0.76 mn euro ) and according to other sources the sum is less than 1 bn levs .
In all cases the yellow party called for more efforts the debt to be paid off by the end of the year even risking the budget to end with a deficit .
The idea was supported by Mr. Ganev .
However Georgi Angelov from the Open Society Institute said that it was impossible the debt to be 1.5 bn levs .
He also said that whatever the sum was , a paying off and ending with a big deficit would be shocking for foreign observers .
Another dispute caused the idea for decrease of social securities burden .
This time all economists shared single opinion , no matter whether they were politically bound or theoretics .
There positions varied only with regard to scale of the decrease .
Against were the representatives of the trade unions .
Mika Zaykova from the Confederation of Labour " Podkrepa " said that the union had a lot of reserves about the decrease of social securities because for the last 8 years such measures had been introduced with no significant increase of investments in high technologies that would lead to a tangible increase of competitiveness of Bulgarian goods .
She added that if , anyway , any decrease was introduced it should be conditional .
Ms. Zaykova said that Bulgaria continued to gain competitiveness by offering cheap labour which was not good .
The senior economist at the Open Society Institute Georgi Angelov commented that the decrease of social securities should even be greater , in spite of what the trade unions were saying because this had always been a successful policy .
" Each decrease leads to positive results which are commensurable , visible and are included in the anti-crisis plan of the European Commission " , the economist added .
This measure was recommended as a working policy to boost labour markets and is now applied in 18 EU member states .
Mr. Angelov criticised the budget for 2010 which is to be approved by parliament on a second reading , because its volume is big .
" The budget is bigger as a sum from this year's .
What we see is cuts of all spendings to allow more money to be paid for pensions because pensions have been increased by 20 % which is 3 - 4 % of GDP .
We have a seizure from all expenditure sectors to pay pensions .
The government has not dared to abolish the increase of pensions which means , though , that all other sectors suffer .
This is a political decision " , he underlined .
Georgi Angelov also focused on the still not kept promise of the government to make 15 % cuts of administration , of which the less cuts are in the Ministry of the Interior where " for some reason no one is talking about reforms " .
The system of the Interior is too large in terms of employees and Bulgaria is the country with the largest number of policemen per capita .
The problem with the low wages can easily be solves - less policemen with higher wages .
This problem the coordinator of the economic team of NDSV Vladimir Karolev called " policemanship " , which he found in all 160 pages of the governing programme of the government .
He also criticised the lack of binding of ideas with concrete terms and methods of achievement .
The former finance minister Plamen Oresharski , although his party ( BSP - Bulgarian Socialist Party ) refused to debate the budget in parliament , also criticised the lack not only of concrete terms but also of financial support for the priorities .
" In the priorities in the expenditure part of the budget I cannot find only the defense " , Mr. Oresharski exclaimed .
Most of the participants at the discussion did not approve the planned increase of the excise for cigarettes and alcohol .
Milen Velchev , who was a finance minister in the government of Simeon Saxecobourggotta ( 2001 - 2005 ) supported the increase but not " before we are certain that the reforms in the customs administration will guarantee that this would not lead to stimulating the smuggling " .
A much more important issue is the social securities , added Mr. Velchev .
Plamen Oresharski on his behalf asked who this excise increase supported given the structure of the increase - the cheapest cigarettes will become 2 times more expensive that the most expensive right now .
Besides , he added , why the beer was not included in the increase of alcohol excise ?
The NDSV also criticised the increase of the redistribution of the GDP - 42.3 % even before the promised 150 mn levs for agriculture to be included as well as the 450 mn levs for healthcare .
The yellow party recalled that one of the pre-election promises of the ruling party GERB was to decrease the redistribution to 35 % of GDP .
Everyone at the discussion agreed that in times of crises it was best to start reforms .
The NDSV , which have a congress on Saturday to elect a new party leader , pointed out numerous contradictions in the governing programme of the government .
Vladimir Karolev was mostly outraged of the fact that there were only 2 - 3 sentences about privatisation in the programme and a total lack of the word concession .
Asked by euinside whether the word concession had turned into dirty phrasing after the several failures for a concession of highways in Bulgaria during the 8 - year long presence of NDSV in government , Mr. Karolev explained that the " Trakiya " highway could had been built on a concession long time ago if it had n't dropped dead in the election campaign of 2005 .
He recalled that the concession agreement was already made public by the Ministry of Regional Development and it could be seen that there was no fraud in the deal .
The former minister of state administration Nikolay Vassilev reminded how many times the NDSV had called for concessions of ports , airports and highways but the coalition partners would either behave indecisively or would disagree .
Lyubomir Datsov concluded that for Bulgaria there was no other way that concession and public procurement because for at least the last 15 years there is shortage of public financing
He reminded that the former government had filed a bill about public procurement which was now in the files department pf parliament .
He called the bill to be withdrawn and filed again so that the opportunity of public procurement could be opened again .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Eating fruits and vegetables , and drinking tea and red wine may offer overweight men and normal weight women some protection from colon and rectal cancers , hint study findings from the Netherlands .
Plant - based foods contain flavonoids , compounds thought to interfere with cancer - causing processes , the study team notes in the International Journal of Cancer .
Colinda C.J.M.
Simons , a PhD student at Maastricht University , and her co-investigators estimated the intake of specific flavonoids in 120,852 men and women , 55 to 69 years old , who filled out dietary surveys as part of a large designed to assess ties between diet and cancer .
Over about 13 years , 1,444 men and 1,041 women developed colon or rectal cancer .
Specific flavonoid intake did not seem to influence the risk for colorectal cancer when the investigators allowed for multiple factors potentially tied to the development of colorectal cancer , including age , family history , smoking , drinking alcohol , physical activity , and eating habits overall , plus estrogen use among women .
But when they allowed for weight , it seems “ there may be protective effects of some of these compounds in subgroups of overweight men and normal weight women , ” Simons noted in an email to Reuters Health .
Compared with the least intake , the greatest intake of catechins -- common in berries , grapes , black chocolate , tea , red wine , and some beans -- seemed to be associated with lower colorectal cancer risk among both overweight men and normal weight women .
The researchers observed a similar trend for flavonols -- found in onions , kale , apples , pears , tea , wine , and fruit juices -- in normal weight women .
“ The fact that the inverse trend was observed for most of the specific catechins and flavonols argues against the associations being spurious , ” Simons said .
She and colleagues , therefore , call for further investigations to shed more light on the how these compounds alter colon and rectal cancer risk and how weight modifies this impact .

Benefits of Estate Planning
Estate planning here in Arizona is surrounded by myths and misinformation , which probably explains why many people neglect this aspect of financial planning .
Among these myths are that estate planning is only for the super - rich , that it only protects one ’s assets after they ’ve died , and that it ’s easier , quicker , or cheaper to let one ’s surviving heirs make the decisions .
But that ’s exactly what they are , myths !
Contrary to what you may think about it , here are some reasons why estate planning is actually a good move to make :
It is beneficial to everyone , not just to the super - rich .
Sure your estate may not be as large as other people ’s , but it ’s an estate nonetheless , and it deserves to be protected under Arizona and federal laws .
You can invoke this protection through estate planning instruments such as wills , trusts , and power of attorney .
It protects your assets during your lifetime .
It is possible that , before you pass , you may face challenges and attempts to capitalize on your estate or assets .
To legally protect these assets , estate planning allows you to remove your name from the assets and transfer them to trusts , limited liability entities , or other similar vehicles that are protected by the law .
It helps you minimize the length of the process , delays , and expenses .
Having an estate plan means being able to speed up the probate process that would otherwise take at least a year on average .
It also helps you avoid unnecessary expenses on costly probate proceedings as well as estate and gift taxes .
Estate planning is an uncomfortable and even scary topic for many people , but it definitely is a practical one .

We understand that no one - size - fits - all estate plan exists .
It has to be professionally prepared according to the assets that you have , the situation you are in , the plans you have in mind , and many other factors .
Our Tucson probate lawyers here at Tucson Probate Attorney are ready to help you through the process or protecting your assets and safeguarding your future .
Understanding Trusts
Trusts are tools used in estate planning that help in managing the distribution of a person ’s assets by transferring the benefits and obligations connected to it to different people .
This is done when the owner ( the trustor ) transfers legal ownership of a property to a person or institution ( the trustee ) ; the trustee is then given the responsibility to manage the property for the benefit and solely in the best interest of the beneficiary .
Trusts allow the trustors to specify the conditions for the distribution of the property or benefits .
This means that they can arrange that the payment of benefits be spread over a particular period of time and not be given all at once .
Trusts can either be living trusts or testamentary trusts .
In a living trust , the transfer of property starts during the lifetime of the trustor but can be arranged to continue after the trustor ’s death .
It is designed to avoid probate proceedings , reduce taxes , ensure probate record privacy , and regulate the use of assets in case the trustor becomes incapacitated .
In a testamentary trust , the transfer is done only after the death of the trustor .
Just because a particular type of trust is most beneficial to one person does n’t mean it ’s beneficial to the next .
Every client ’s estate planning needs is unique and requires unique attention from accomplished attorneys .
Having been a trusted probate law firm here in the Tucson , Tucson Probate Attorney understands this , and it ’s been our mission to provide every person the unique legal solutions that they deserve .

Drafting A Last Will & Testament
Here in Tucson , a person is allowed to provide for the needs of their spouse , children , and other loved ones even after death .
One of the ways this is done is by creating a last will and testament that specifies how one ’s real and personal property should be distributed after death .
Having a last will and testament allows a testator to clearly express their last wishes and instructions for property distribution to loved ones .
This avoids confusion , conflict , and frustration among their surviving heirs , as well as delays , complications , and unnecessary expenses during the process .
While you can write your own will , it ’s important to remember that the said documents needs to meet the standards set in Arizona law in order for it to be legally binding :
The testator must be 18 or older
The testator must have testamentary intent
The testator must possess testamentary capacity
The testator must not be unduly influenced
The testator must sign and date the will , or direct someone to do it on their behalf
The final will must also be signed by two witnesses
Drafting a will and testament can sound like a simple thing , but it can come with a host of requirements and possible complications .
It needs to meet the stringent demands of Arizona law ; otherwise the probate judge will invalidate it .
A document such as a last will and testament is just too important and too crucial to DIY .
Instead of risking invalidity , the best decision would be to seek the help and expertise of an estate planning attorney from an established law firm such as Tucson Probate Attorney .

Top 10 States in Fiscal Peril From California to New Jersey , states are being crushed by deficits .
Nov. 16 , 2009  --
Enormous budget deficits in nearly every state across the country are " wreaking havoc " on government employees , the services they provide , and the residents who need them most , according to a new report by the Pew Center for the States .
Dwindling state tax revenues during the recession have forced states to furlough workers , raise taxes , crowd more kids into classrooms , and trim social services .
But experts say those measures and others can only go so far in keeping many states from going broke .
" There 's no question this is extraordinary .
The worst situation in 50 years , " Susan Urahn , director of the Pew Center for the States , told ABC News .
" Fiscal year 2010 will be just as bad as it was last year .
We saw a $ 180 billion cumulative budget gap in 2009 and predict the same for 2010 . "
Urahn says despite much national attention on California 's budget crisis – the worst in the country -- nine other recession - stricken states are facing a similarly dire situation .
Arizona lawmakers are staring down a $ 1 billion gap in their 2009 budget with no immediate solution in sight .
Rhode Island , the smallest state , continues to post among the highest unemployment and foreclosure numbers in the country .
Michigan is grappling with " a 1960s - sized budget , " while Nevada struggles to raise taxes in light of a provision that requires voters to first amend the state 's constitution .
Oregon , which experienced the greatest drop in state revenue over last year , faces a similar dilemma as voters in January 2010 get the final say on new income taxes to close the gap .
The Pew report lists Florida , New Jersey , Illinois and Wisconsin also among the top ten states facing the worst combination of foreclosure rates , jobless numbers , state revenue losses , budget gaps , legal obstacles to balanced budgets and legislators ' poor money - management practices .
" These are the worst numbers we 've ever seen in the decades , " said Scott Pattison , director of the National Association of State Budget Offices .
He says state budget crises have impacted every part of state government , including the employees and residents they serve .
Can State Layoffs , Furloughs Close Budget Gaps ?
" The impact of plummeting tax revenues is really coming home to roost now , " Steve Kreisberg of the American Federal of State , County and Municipal Employees told ABC News .
More than 110,000 state and local employees have been fired in the current recession , according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research .
That number includes over 40,000 teachers and 4,000 police and firefighters .
Some states have opted against layoffs in favor of forcing workers to take furlough days , or unpaid days off .
On Thursday , New Mexico became the latest state to implement furloughs after Gov. Bill Richardson ordered 19,000 workers to take five unpaid days off .
The move is expected to help the state deal with a $ 650 million budget shortfall .
" It amounts to a 2 percent pay cut in lieu of laying off maybe 400 people , " Kreisberg said of the New Mexico case .
But furloughs come with additional costs for workers and residents .
In Hawaii , where school teachers have been furloughed for 17 days this year , students will receive less time in the classroom and parents will be forced to find and pay for childcare .
Furloughs are also meaning longer waits for unemployment claims processing and other services , in some states , and reduced numbers of police and firemen to protect public safety .
" What 's also overlooked , " Kreisberg said , " is the tremendous increase in stress on the workforce at a time when workloads have increased and pay has decreased . "
Staffing reductions and increased demand for state services during the economic downturn are making it impossible for some workers to afford taking time off .
" Many state workers have said they simply cannot afford furlough days .
They work from home or sneak into the office out of extreme dedication and passion for public service , " Kreisberg said .
Is there a light at the end of the tunnel for states in murky financial waters ?
Kreisberg says unless states can devise creative solutions , the coming year will be " absolutely disastrous not just for state workers but for the entire economy . "
The Pew Center 's Urahn agrees .
" It 's tough to continue to do across the board cuts in states like Michigan , where you 've cut for years and years and years , " she said .
" I think it 's gonna be tough ... the challenge is that it's not a ' this - year ' problem ; it 's a structural problem with how states spend . "
And those are the types of problems that do n't tend to get resolved quickly .
National Governors Association director Raymond Scheppach predicts , " states will not fully recover from this recession until late in the next decade . "
This image shows two young brown dwarfs , objects that fall somewhere between planets and stars in terms of their temperature and mass .
Image credit : NASA / JPL - Caltech / Calar Alto Obsv. / Caltech Sub. Obsv .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope has contributed to the discovery of the youngest brown dwarf ever observed -- a finding that , if confirmed , may solve an astronomical mystery about how these cosmic misfits are formed .
Brown dwarfs are misfits because they fall somewhere between planets and stars in terms of their temperature and mass .
They are cooler and more lightweight than stars and more massive ( and normally warmer ) than planets .
This has generated a debate among astronomers :
Do brown dwarfs form like planets or like stars ?
Brown dwarfs are born of the same dense , dusty clouds that spawn stars and planets .
But while they may share the same galactic nursery , brown dwarfs are often called " failed " stars because they lack the mass of their hotter , brighter stellar siblings .
Without that mass , the gas at their core does not get hot enough to trigger the nuclear fusion that burns hydrogen -- the main component of these molecular clouds -- into helium .
Unable to ignite as stars , brown dwarfs end up as cooler , less luminous objects that are more difficult to detect -- a challenge that was overcome in this case by Spitzer 's heat - sensitive infrared vision .
To complicate matters , young brown dwarfs evolve rapidly , making it difficult to catch them when they are first born .
The first brown dwarf was discovered in 1995 and , while hundreds have been found since , astronomers had not been able to unambiguously find them in their earliest stages of formation until now .
In this study , an international team of astronomers found a so - called " proto brown dwarf " while it was still hidden in its natal star - forming region .
Guided by Spitzer data collected in 2005 , they focused their search in the dark cloud Barnard 213 , a region of the Taurus - Auriga complex well known to astronomers as a hunting ground for young objects .
" We decided to go several steps back in the process when ( brown dwarfs ) are really hidden , " said David Barrado of the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid , Spain , lead author of the paper on the discovery in the Astronomy & Astrophysics journal .
" During this step they would have an ( opaque ) envelope , a cocoon , and they would be easier to identify due to their strong infrared excesses .
We have used this property to identify them .
This is where Spitzer plays an important role because Spitzer can have a look inside these clouds .
Without it this would n't have been possible . "
Spitzer 's longer - wavelength infrared camera penetrated the dusty natal cloud to observe a baby brown dwarf named SSTB213 J041757 .
The data , confirmed with near - infrared imaging from Calar Alto Observatory in Spain , revealed not one but two of what would potentially prove to be the faintest and coolest brown dwarfs ever observed .
Barrado and his team embarked on an international quest for more information about the two objects .
Their overarching scientific objective was to observe and characterize the presence of this dusty envelope -- proof of the celestial womb of sorts that would indicate that these brown dwarfs were , in fact , in their earliest evolutionary stages .
The twins were observed from around the globe , and their properties were measured and analyzed using a host of powerful astronomical tools .
One of the astronomers ' stops was the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory in Hawaii , which captured the presence of the envelope around the young objects .
That information , coupled with what they had from Spitzer , enabled the astronomers to build a spectral energy distribution -- a diagram that shows the amount of energy that is emitted by the objects in each wavelength .
From Hawaii , the astronomers made additional stops at observatories in Spain ( Calar Alto Observatory ) , Chile ( Very Large Telescopes ) and New Mexico ( Very Large Array ) .
They also pulled decade - old data from the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre archives that allowed them to comparatively measure how the two objects were moving in the sky .
After more than a year of observations , they drew their conclusions .
" We were able to estimate that these two objects are the faintest and coolest discovered so far , " Barrado said .
Barrado said the findings potentially solve the mystery about whether brown dwarfs form more like stars or planets .
The answer ?
They form like low - mass stars .
This theory is bolstered because the change in brightness of the objects at various wavelengths matches that of other very young , low - mass stars .
While further study will confirm whether these two celestial objects are in fact proto brown dwarfs , they are the best candidates so far , Barrado said .
He said the journey to their discovery , while difficult , was fun .
" It is a story that has been unfolding piece by piece .
Sometimes nature takes its time to give up its secrets . "
These observations were made before Spitzer ran out of its liquid coolant in May 2009 , beginning its " warm " mission .

Dubai ’s request for a debt moratorium for its Dubai World conglomerate is worrying global markets , but the Gulf city state can count on Abu Dhabi , its deep - pocketed rich brother , to avoid default , analysts say .
‘‘ Dubai as a state ... is not on the verge of bankruptcy , thanks to the support of Abu Dhabi , ’’ said Pascal Devaux , Middle East risk assessment economist at BNP Paribas .
Dubai is one of seven city states that make up the United Arab Emirates , along with Abu Dhabi .
On Wednesday , it announced that it intends to request a ‘ ‘ standstill ’ ’ for at least six months on the maturing debt of Dubai World , its largest and most - indebted state - run holding .
That sent jitters through major world stock markets on fears of a potential default by Dubai , which has a total debt of around $ US80 billion , mostly owed by state companies .
Standard and Poor ’s estimated last month that Dubai state - related companies are due to repay some $ US50 billion in debt over the next three years , which represent 70 per cent of the emirate ’s gross domestic product .

The man pages will then be displayed with Vim called as " view " and will use the < man.vim > syntax highlighting .
I myself use some additional highlighting which is enabled by putting the following file into <.vim/after/syntax/man.vim >.

As part of the man filetype plugin delivered in Vim 6.0 , the user command : Man is setup to view man pages in a similar fashion .
( On Unix ) I 've sym - linked the man.vim filetype plugin from the distribution into the plugin directory .
That was the : Man command is available whenever you need it .
runtime ftplugin/man.vim source $ VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/man.vim e ? :]
I had to use PAGER variable instead of MANPAGER .
Version of the man tool I use is 2.3.10 .
People who would like to try this may like to check tip VimTip121 too .
Some notes :
1 . Some versions of sh do n't support setting environment variables and exporting on the same line .
In that case , you 'd have to do :
> MANPAGER =" col - b | view -c ' set ft=man nomod nolist ' -" > export MANPAGER
2 . Another comment mentioned that their man does n't support the MANPAGER env var , so they had to use PAGER .
You probably do n't want to do that on a permanent basis , since PAGER is used for many other things besides man .
Instead , you might create a small script in your $ HOME / bin that sets it in a subshell , for example ( vman.sh ) :
#!/bin/sh PAGER=" col - b | view -c ' set ft=man nomod nolist ' - " export PAGER man $*
and then do ' vman ls ' or whatever .
Replace PAGER with MANPAGER if your man supports it and you want to use the script .
3 . You might want to add ignorecase to the list of settings passed to Vim ( view ) to more closely match the searching of most man pagers ( less and more ) .
Even simpler way
What I did was :
1 ) renamed my less to less.orig 2 ) edited the less.sh script :
if test $ # = 0 ; then vim -c ' so $ VIMRUNTIME/macros/less.vim ' - elif test $* = " - is " ; then less.orig $* else vim -c ' so $ VIMRUNTIME/macros/less.vim ' $* fi
3 ) symlinked $ VIMRUNTIME / macros/less.sh to /usb/bin/less
So as you can see when the man is called , it just passes the parameters to less.orig .
On my Red Hat 7.2 system , view invokes vi ( vim in vi compatibility mode ) , so extra Vim features such as syntax highlighting are not available .
To use vim instead of vi for the pager , either manipulate the / bin / view link , or set substitute " vim - R " for " view " .
Replace view with less.sh of Vim will maintain the same keystrokes as less .
The following set the MANPAGER for sh , ksh and bash :
export MANPAGER=" col -b | /usr / share/vim/vim61/macros/less.sh -c ' set ft=man nomod nolist ' -"
There 's now a while - you 're - in - vim solution -- check out script #489 for < Manpageview.vim > for a new : Man command and support for the K normal - mode command .
Using MANPAGER does n't work so well with script #489 instead , I now use a Korn shell function .
Similar functions could be developed for other shells ( bash , zsh ) , I 'm sure :
# man : function man { /usr / bin / man $* | col -b | /usr / local / bin/ view -c ' set ft=man nomod nolist ' - }
I have done the following to make Vim work as my PAGER and it works really well .
Like other people in this thread my man( 1 ) does n't use MANPAGER , it uses PAGER .
I had trouble with vim's filetype autodetection picking up that it was indeed a manpage coming in over the pipe , so I 've written a scripts.vim to match manpages by regex and set the filetype accordingly .
Otherwise , I got no syntax highlighting .
The shell I quote is tcsh - specific , but easily portable to another shell .
Also , I assume you already have a ~ / bin and that it is in your path and that you already have a ~/.vim .
If not , you will need to do these things .
% ln -s / path/to/VIMRUNTIME/macros/less.sh ~/bin/vless % cat >> ~/.vim/scripts.vim if did_filetype ( ) finish endif if getline ( 1 ) =~ '^\(.\+\) ( \d\{1} ) .\+\1 ( \d\{1} ) $ ' set filetype=man endif ^D % cat >> .cshrc # config pager if ( - X vless && - X col ) then setenv PAGER ' col - b | vless ' alias less vless alias more vless else if ( - X less ) then setenv PAGER less setenv LESS " - e " alias more less else if ( - X more ) then setenv PAGER more else echo " WARNING : No pager found , PAGER not set . " endif ^D
Actually , here 's a smarter way to do that scripts.vim ( the original was taken from the Vim manual | new - filetypes - scripts | ) :
if did_filetype ( ) " filetype already set .. elseif getline ( 1 ) =~ '^\(.\+\) ( \d\{1} ) .\+\1 ( \d\{1} ) $ ' set filetype=man endif
The previous example works but would n't allow you to add anything else to your scripts.vim .
I 've been using brandon 's little script for a while but I modified it with the help of this little sh script :
#!/bin/bash # # timball MAN= / usr / bin/ man { if [ $ 1 = " - k " ] ; then $ MAN -k $ 2 exit else if [ $ TERM = " screen " ] ; then screen $ MAN - P " col - b | view - R --noplugin -u ~/lib/vim/vman.vim -" $ 1 exit else $ MAN - P " col - b | view - R --noplugin -u ~/lib/vim/vman.vim -"
$ 1 exit fi fi }
To avoid the problems with Vim in the PAGER or MANPAGER variable , use the following bash - function :
vman ( ) { man $* | col - b | vim - c ' set ft=man nomod nolist ' -; }
If you view a manpage within Vim now , the K - button will work right .
In bash , adding :
alias man= 'vman '
... after the vman function , in your . bashrc file , will let you use the man command again .
Simply renaming the vman function to ' man ' gave me a string of errors .
When using UTF - 8 as your locale , bad things happen .
So this is how to make it work :
function man { /usr / bin / man $* | col - bp | iconv -c | view - c ' set ft=man nomod nolist ' - }
, August 21 , 2003 23:15
If MANPAGER does not work and PAGER should not be used for the aforementioned good reasons then the lucky ones with GNU man simply write ( csh )
alias man ' /usr / bin / man - P
" col - bp | iconv -c | view - c ' " ' " ' set ft=man nomod nolist ' " ' " ' -" \!*' ( this is tick - quotes - tick - quotes - tick in the middle ) resp . ( sh ) alias man= " /usr/ bin/ man - P
\ " col - bp | iconv -c | view - c ' set ft=man nomod nolist ' - \ " " and the ones without write ( csh ) alias man ' env PAGER = " col - bp | iconv -c | view - c ' " ' " ' set ft=man nomod nolist ' " ' " ' -" man \!*' resp . ( sh ) alias man= " env PAGER= \" col - bp | iconv -c | view - c ' set ft=man nomod nolist ' - \ " /usr / bin/man " and are done .
And with the SunOS 5 man ( 1 ) from SunOS 5 it is :
alias man ' env PAGER= " ( col - bp | view - c ' " ' " ' set ft=man nomod nolist ' " ' " ' - ) < " /usr/bin/man \!*'
( and analogously for sh ) since this man( 1 ) calls PAGER with the name of a temporary file ...
If you are following Kerosin 's advice above , make sure you use " /usr / bin / man " instead of just " man " so you wo n't get circular aliasing .
That bug brought my machine to it 's knees .
vman ( ) { /usr / bin /man $* | col - b | vim - c ' set ft=man nomod nolist ' -; } alias man= 'vman '
Nice .
I added this little tidbit " - c ' nmap q : q < CR > ' " so that I can quit with one keystroke like I did in the old days with less ...
vman ( ) { /usr / bin /man $* | col - b | vim - c ' set ft=man nomod nolist ' - c 'nmap q : q < CR > ' -; } alias man= 'vman '
There 's probably more than one way to handle this , but instead of calling all sorts of bits 'n' pieces I prefer this :
# call Vim , ensure that ftplugin / man.vim is loaded , call Man with default manpage=man if no args , make sure this is only window function vman ( ) { vim -c " runtime ftplugin/man.vim " -c " Man $ { 1 - man} " +" wincmd o " }
One may also use manpageview script #489 in a like manner :
function man { vim -c " Man $ * " -c only }
For those who have g:manpageview_winopen=" only " , a preferred way to get command line man is to :
vim -c " Man $ * " -c " silent ! only " .
Avoids a " Already only one window " message .
When using the shell function described above , you launch Vim even when there is no man pages for the words you typed .
The following code will correct that :
vman ( ) { if [ $ # - eq 0 ] ; then /usr / bin / man elif whatis $* ; then /usr / bin / man $* | col - b | vim -c ' set ft=man nomod nolist ' - fi } alias man= 'vman '
This does not work on Debian and Ubuntu Linux systems , but it is trivial to fix .
Technically , PAGER and MANPAGER are not guaranteed to be passed to a shell , so you do n't know that the pipe from ' col ' to ' view ' would work .
On some systems PAGER is run under a shell , but on others PAGER is executed directly like any external command .
The trick is to add a / bin / sh to make sure that the pipe gets interpreted .
This works on almost any Linux flavor :
export PAGER= " / bin/sh -c \ " col - b | view - c ' set ft=man nomod nolist ' - \ " "
Yet another variant .
Together with manpageview script I 'm using the following function for bash .
function man { /usr / bin / whatis " $ @ " >/ dev/ null if [ $ ? - eq 0 ] ; then vim -c " Man $ * " -c ' silent ! only ' -c ' nmap q : q < CR >' else man " $ @ " fi }
Note .
I had to modify " whatis " script so that it sets non -zero exit status when it found nothing appropriate .
If you have a error like that ..
Reformatting man( 1 ) , please wait ... col : invalid option -- c usage : col [ - bfhpx ] [ - l nline ] man : command exited with status 256 : /usr/bin/zsoelim /tmp/zmanGiFFlw | /usr/bin/tbl | /usr/bin/nroff -mandoc -rLL=89n - rLT=89n - Tutf8 | col - b | view -c set ft=man nomod nolist titlestring =MANPAGE -
then the solution is ... this $ PAGER definition makes the assumption that it 's passed to sh -c ( you use pipes and quotes ) .
The man manpage does n't say that $ PAGER is passed to sh -c , it says it will use $ PAGER as the program to display the manual page .
I suggest you use :
export PAGER =" sh -c \ " col - b | view -c ' set ft=man nomod nolist titlestring =MANPAGE ' -\ " "
which explicitely calls sh -c to handle pipes and quotes in the expected way .
You may also use your own / usr / local / bin / pager with :
#!/bin/sh col - b | view -c ' set ft=man nomod nolist titlestring =MANPAGE ' - and with PAGER = / usr / local / bin / pager .
I am reassigning to man for the man manpage to be clarified with respect to the way $ PAGER is called .
copy from http://www.gatago.com/linux/debian/devel/10008053.html
On OS X 10.5 , using Terminal.app , append this to your ~/.bash_profile to use vi ( Vim ) as your MANPAGER .
export MANPAGER ='col - bx | vim -c " : set ft=man nonu nolist " - R -'
You might want to add
-c ' set nonumber '
in the export PAGER =... command in your . bashrc file .
For certain linux distributions such as Alpine Linux and Void Linux setting the `MANPAGER` will not work due to a different / lightweight implementation of `man` ( non - GNU ) .
It handles word splitting on a more rudimentary level and may return
- bx : 1 : - bx : Syntax error : Unterminated quoted string
To correctly wrap a call to man in a function use
man ( ) { vim - c ' set ft=man nolist nomod ' -c " Man $ * " }
The other proposed wrapper functions do not handle the tagstack correctly ( jumping between references to other manpages wtih < C - T > and < C - [ > ) .
The downside is not to be able to use arguments to the `man` command ( use `command man ...` in that case to bypass vim or rename the function to vman ) .
`$ *` makes sure you can use section numbers .
Dems blast Sessions women - to - smokers comparison
Rep. Pete Sessions ( R - Tex . ) , the head of the Republicans campaign committee , caused a stir at last night 's Rules Committee meeting when he suggested that treating female - related health conditions was comparable to insurance - company imposed restrictions on smokers .
" Why should a woman pay more than a man ? " asked New Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone , according to the Courthouse News Service .
" Well , we 're all different , " Sessions explained .
" Why should a smoker pay more ? " he said before interrupted .
That prompted major pushback from Democrats , who say that it proves that House Republicans do n't care about working - class women .
“ The NRCC and extreme right wing of the Republican Party are totally out of step with women , " said Jennifer Crider , spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
" First , the NRCC says that a man ought to put the first woman Speaker of the House ‘ in her place . ' ... I do n't know what 's scarier , whether NRCC Chairman Pete Sessions actually believes women are second class citizens or whether he believes it 's political beneficial for the NRCC to say so . "

Two Brazilian policemen have been killed after their helicopter was shot at in Rio de Janeiro during clashes involving police and drug gangs .
The helicopter came down and burst into flames , after the pilot was hit in the leg by a bullet .
At least 10 other people were reported to have died in the fighting .
Several buses were also set on fire .
It was the worst outbreak of violence since the city was awarded the 2016 Olympic Games two weeks ago .
The attack on the helicopter followed an outbreak of fighting between rival drug gangs in a shanty town in the north of the city .
One resident said it was the one of the most intense gun battles he had witnessed in the area in recent years .
The helicopter exploded after making a crash landing
The police helicopter exploded after trying to make an emergency landing on a football field .
Two policemen were injured in the crash .
A new gun battle then began between the gangs and dozens of policemen .
In total , 10 alleged gangsters were reported to have been killed .
Authorities were not able to confirm if it was the first time that one of their helicopters had been brought down by gunfire .
Following is an excerpt from a speech delivered by PA President Mahmoud Abbas at the Arab American University in Jenin .
The speech aired on Palestinian Authority TV on October 13 , 2009 .
Mahmoud Abbas :
When the [ Israeli ] aggression took place , [ Hamas leaders ] in Gaza and abroad said : “ We do n’t care if Gaza is erased . ”
They do not care if Gaza is erased .
All they care about is that the Hamas movement continue to exist .
They said this .
Haniya and Mash ’al said :
We do n’t care what happens .
Mash ’al went even further and said : “ What is happening in Gaza is insignificant and does not affect us . ”
Then they said that the Hamas movement is alive and well .
This was at a time when there were thousands of martyrs from among our people , thousands of wounded from among our people , and tens of thousands of destroyed houses .
To this day , 100,000 Palestinians in Gaza are homeless , with no place to live .
Yet the Hamas movement is alive and well .
The Hamas movement was hiding under the domes [ of mosques ] .
The Hamas leaders – and I say this for the first time – fled to the Sinai in ambulances , leaving their people behind to be slaughtered .
Then they say :
We put up resistance .
Amazon.com will start shipping an international version of its Kindle e-book reader Monday to 100 countries , but not Canada .
The Kindle 2 electronic reader is still not available in Canada .
( ( Associated Press ) )
The new e-reader will sell for $ 279 US and will be sold to customers outside of the U.S. , in countries such as the U.K. , Australia , Japan , India and Germany .
A message on the Amazon.com website reads : " Unfortunately , we are currently unable to ship Kindles or offer Kindle content in Canada .
We are working to make Kindle available to our Canadian customers as soon as possible . "
A spokesperson for Amazon refused to say why the device is not being made available in Canada .
The international edition of the Kindle will be able to download content wirelessly over AT&T 's international cellphone network .
The U.S. version connects to Sprint 's network , and international users must connect the reader to a computer via USB to download e-books .
The Kindle will be available in some countries , such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sri Lanka , without wireless support .
Amazon also cut the cost of the U.S. Kindle to $ 259 .
The device , which has a 15 - centimetre screen that displays in shades of grey , debuted in 2007 at $ 399 .
Amazon is trying to stay competitive in an increasingly crowded e-reader market .
The Kindle currently has 60 per cent of the U.S. market , according to a Forrester Research report , and Sony has 35 per cent .
Sony 's Reader is available in Canada , as is its smaller Reader Pocket Edition and its larger touch - screen version .
None of them can connect wirelessly , although Sony announced that it would begin selling the Reader Daily Edition in the U.S. in December .
The Daily Edition will connect to the AT&T network .
No Canadian launch date has been announced .

This is a word that we are conditioned to say from a very young age .
Some estimates claim that we hear " No ! " 65,000 times by the age of 5 .
I am not certain how many times this is impressed upon our young minds .
Nevertheless , it is a lot .
Societal conditioning starts at a young age .
When looking at the BDSM world , most claim to understand the exchange of power that is part of our lifestyle .
They feel that being in a position to submit to another is what they truly desire .
Unfortunately , reality strikes them hard when they realize what the lifestyle is all about .
Naturally , we always need to differentiate between a sub versus a slave .
As I write quite often , a sub , by his or her definition , has more control .
The submission process is not as absolute as in the M/s world .
Usually , the power given only pertains to the sexual arena .
Even there , one might still retain some degree of control through the use of safe words , etc ...
When one chooses to be a slave , the decision is made to cede all power over to the Master ( or Mistress ) .
This means that one is agreeing to follow all instructions as set down before him or her .
Here is where the tendency to say " No ! " comes into effect .
It is something that should rarely be done by a slave .
" No , I do n't want to " is not a part of a slave 's vocabulary .
While I acknowledge there are situations where it is unsafe for a slave to obey a Master 's directions , most instances do not meet this requirement .
Usually when a slave denies her Master 's wishes , it is because she does not want to do it .
It matters little that a slave feels embarrassed , upset , or awkward .
Her duty is to obey .
As long as a Master is treating her in a way that is mindful of past abuses , her position is to carry out his instructions .
Many slaves , especially those who post things online , seem to feel that " No ! " is an option for them .
To me this shows how disconnected they are from the true nature of M/s. Some tend to make this a regular part of their life .
Occasionally refusing to do something can be chalked up to nervousness , lack of trust , or failure to grow .
However , continually doing this leads me to believe that one might be better suited to seek out a D/s relationship .
Begin the process of trying to eliminate the word " No ! " from your vocabulary .
Gifted with one of the most distinctive and powerful voices in all of rock music , Freddie Mercury was the lead singer of Queen and a driving force behind the band 's musical and visual style .
He composed many of Queen 's signature songs including " Bohemian Rhapsody " , " Somebody to Love " , and " We Are the Champions " .
Often described as " operatic " , his compositions include strong elements of harmony , layered vocal arrangements , and complex melodies .
Freddie Mercury delivered his music with a stunning voice - he had more power , range , and control than any of his contemporaries .
Believing strongly in the importance of style and fashion , his artistic direction shaped much of Queen 's early image .
He designed the initial Queen " Crest " logo - using the Zodiac signs for the four members of the band :
The crest consisted of two lions ( Leos for Roger and John Deacon ) , holding up a Q around a crown , a crab on top ( Cancer for Brian May ) , and two fairies ( Virgo for himself ) .
He applied this kind of creative sculpting to all aspects of his life .
As a live entertainer , Freddie Mercury was magnificent .
He would feed from the crowd 's energy , amplifying and projecting it back to them .
His 1985 performance at the massive multi-band " Live Aid " concert at Wembley Stadium is a perfect example of his stage prowess .
With a super - charged Freddie playing maestro to the audience , Queen drove the crowd of 72,000 into a frenzy with a tight set that stole the show .
Reputed to have led a flamboyent and hedonistic lifestyle , he was also known to be generous and kind to the same extreme .
His passing in 1991 was a great loss to the world of music , and in the next year the " Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert " was held in his honor .

If you ’re a follower of Saturday night light entertainment , you ’ll probably know that Bruce Forsyth had to pull out of hosting Strictly Come Dancing this weekend because he has flu .
The BBC announced this on Friday morning , saying that his co-host Tess Daly would take over his presenting duties .
If you do n’t watch Strictly , usually Bruce is out in the ballroom , reading the links , introducing the couples , and eliciting the judges ’ comments ;
Tess is backstage getting the dancers ’ reactions after they ’ve performed .
When I heard that Tess would be out front , I assumed that they ’d get a chap in to do the backstage bits , for balance , speculating about former champions Mark Ramprakash and Darren Gough , or pro dancer Matthew Cutler .
So I was delighted when the Beeb revealed later that day that Claudia Winkleman , presenter of the show ’s spin - off It Takes Two , would be taking on Tess ’s usual role .
Still with me ?
Good .
And then Strictly began on Saturday night , and Tess was joined on the dance floor by Ronnie Corbett .
RONNIE CORBETT .
Seriously .
A fine comedian , a great ambassador for British light entertainment , I ’m sure , but with no tangible links to Strictly or ballroom dancing .
Except , of course , for the fact that he ’s great mates with Brucie .
If Corbett was n’t exaggerating , Forsyth asked him to take over for the week .
This leads me to ask first why on earth Forsyth is sorting out his own temp cover when he ’s off sick , and second why on earth the BBC put up with it .
The effect of bringing on Corbett as a senior male figure , sitting on the sidelines to watch over Daly and Winkleman doing the hard work , is one of the BBC not trusting the girlies to be able to handle the show themselves , and Forsyth jealously guarding his territory .
The irony is that in my humble opinion Tess did Bruce ’s job much better than he does now , and Claudia did Tess ’s job much better than she does now .
When the time comes for a shake - up , I wonder if the BBC will consider an all - female presenting team ?
After all , there are no issues with all - male teams .
Or would two women on prime - time television be too much oestrogen for the television - viewing public to handle ?
The south polar region of Mars is covered every year by a layer of carbon dioxide ice .
In a region called the " cryptic terrain , " the ice is translucent and sunlight can penetrate through the ice to warm the surface below .
The ice layer sublimates ( evaporates ) from the bottom .
The dark fans of dust seen in this image come from the surface below the layer of ice , carried to the top by gas venting from below .
The translucent ice is " visible " by virtue of the effect it has on the tone of the surface below , which would otherwise have the same color and reflectivity as the fans .
Bright streaks in this image are fresh frost .

Those who like banks that are too big to fail will love the latest financial reform proposals circulating in the US Congress .
The bill put forward by Barney Frank , the chairman of the House finance committee , does little to change the current structure of the financial system .
The " too - big - to - fail " banks will be left in place , even bigger and less accountable than before .
There will be nothing done to separate commercial and investment banking , so giants like Goldman Sachs will be free to speculate with money guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .
The main difference is that the Federal Reserve Board will be granted even more power than it has now .
And , we will tell the Fed to be smarter in the future , so that it does n't make the same stupid mistakes that gave us the current crisis .
While we all want a smarter Fed , it is not clear that the bill before Congress will get us one , even though it will definitely give us a more powerful Fed .
The new Fed will be able to decide which financial firms need to be put through a bankruptcy - like resolution process , paid for with a virtually unlimited amount of taxpayer dollars .
While the bill proposes that the cost of cleaning up after a big bank failure is supposed to be paid by other big banks , in fact the mechanism laid out in the bill virtually guarantees the opposite .
Rather than raising a pool of money in advance from the big banks to cover the cost of a bailout , the bill proposes that large banks would be assessed a special fee only after a failure .
To see how strange this is , suppose Citigroup or some other major bank collapsed , requiring $ 100 bn to pay off creditors .
( We actually should not need a penny to pay off anyone other than insured depositors if we were serious about the banks not being too big to fail . )
Either the failed bank was acting as a rogue institution , engaging in behaviour that was far more reckless than its peer institutions , or it was doing the same thing as everyone else .
In the first case , would it make sense to tax the other large banks $ 100 bn because Citigroup acted recklessly ?
If the recklessness of one bank had led to its collapse in an environment where its competitors are sound , this would imply that there had been some serious failures of regulation .
Why would we tax other large banks because the Fed , the FDIC and / or other regulatory bodies had failed in their job ?
Alternatively , suppose Citigroup collapses because it was doing the same thing as other banks , but was just slightly more reckless or unlucky .
In this situation , which is similar to the one we faced last fall , all of the banks would be severely stressed .
It would be impossible to hit them with a special fee .
Could we have slapped a special fee on Citigroup and Bank of America last autumn to have them cover the cost of the failure of Lehman Brothers ?
At the time , imposing any significant fee would have almost certainly pushed several more banks to insolvency .
The bottom line is that this bill is almost certain to leave the taxpayers holding the bag for future bailouts .
Even worse , it does nothing about the moral hazard created by having institutions that are too big to fail .
There is nothing in the bill to lead creditors to believe that the government will not make good on their loans to Goldman , JP Morgan and the other banking behemoths .
There is a large and growing consensus across the political spectrum for breaking up banks that are too big to fail .
Advocates of this position include former Federal Reserve Board chairmen Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan ; Sheila Bair , the current head of the FDIC ; and Simon Johnson , the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund .
There is no reason that we need financial institutions that are so big that they cannot be safely unwound without large commitments of government money .
The only people who seem to stand outside this consensus are those who hold power and are steering the process of financial reform .
This is largely the crew whose regulatory failures gave us the current disaster .
If they cannot learn from their mistakes then someone else will have to drive the reform process .

Lyrics :
[ deGrasse Tyson ]
We are all connected ;
To each other , biologically
To the earth , chemically
To the rest of the universe atomically
[ Feynman ]
I think nature 's imagination
Is so much greater than man's
She 's never going to let us relax
[ Sagan ]
We live in an in - between universe
Where things change all right
But according to patterns , rules ,
Or as we call them , laws of nature
[ Nye ]
I 'm this guy standing on a planet
Really I 'm just a speck
Compared with a star , the planet is just another speck
To think about all of this
To think about the vast emptiness of space
There 's billions and billions of stars
Billions and billions of specks
[ Sagan ]
The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it
But the way those atoms are put together
The cosmos is also within us
We 're made of star stuff
We are a way for the cosmos to know itself
Across the sea of space
The stars are other suns
We have traveled this way before
And there is much to be learned
I find it elevating and exhilarating
To discover that we live in a universe
Which permits the evolution of molecular machines
As intricate and subtle as we
[ deGrasse Tyson ]
I know that the molecules in my body are traceable
To phenomena in the cosmos
That makes me want to grab people in the street
And say , have you heard this ??
( Richard Feynman on hand drums and chanting )
[ Feynman ]
There 's this tremendous mess
Of waves all over in space
Which is the light bouncing around the room
And going from one thing to the other
And it 's all really there
But you gotta stop and think about it
About the complexity to really get the pleasure
And it 's all really there
The inconceivable nature of nature

One night in August , the Taliban stormed a local police station in this once - peaceful province and shot dead the governor 's younger brother .
Since then , the governor has singled out a culprit :
The German military , which he says refused to send a helicopter to rescue his brother as he bled to death .

In 2008 , the world spent US $ 12 billion on humanitarian responses to disasters .
99 % of those killed by natural phenomena were in the Asia Pacific region , according to John Holmes , the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator .
Holmes said 10 % of what we spend on response or even on development should go into disaster risk reduction to limit the consequences of natural disasters , especially given the impact of climate change .

We luuurrrrved this show unreasonably much , esp. for people past 30 when it aired .
Are the original writers involved ?
Probably not . :(
Hope this prompts the whole series to come out on DVD .
The VHS tapes canna hold it much longer , cap'n .
Correction to article : Rainmaker is the current owner of ReBoot , but not the creators .
Mainframe Studios were the creators — when the suits went stupid and drove the company into the ground , Rainmaker picked it up for a song .
My exposure to denial or recission will end in May , 2011 , when I qualify for Medicare .
We early baby - boomers will strain that program , but we will have access to medical care , because we will be insured .
But what of those younger , who suffer from my - or any other - condition ?
Lack of early medical care can greatly increase downstream medical costs .
Particularly if lack of insurance also means lack of preventive medicine .
If insurance only covers when we are already sick , we are closer to the final year of any pre-existing condition .
Absent health insurance , many do not obtain basic medical and dental care .
Their lives are shortened .
Their productivity limited .
We lose the benefit of their work and of the taxes they would pay .
I cannot avoid my pre-existing condition .
If I have insurance to cover its effects , will not I live longer and contribute more ?
If covered early , might not I avoid the full impact of preventable or easily treatable diseases and conditions ?
That ’s the economic argument .
The moral argument is simpler .
Those to whom we deny complete health and dental coverage are treated as less fully human than ourselves .
That is a denial of the promise of this nation , which should be about more than a person ’s economic value .
My condition ?
Human life .
My death may come from a lingering disease I already have or to which I am genetically predisposed , in a car or plane crash , or as collateral damage in a driveby shooting or in a terrorist attack .
Does how I die matter ?
For those denied health care , will not their deaths be sooner ?
Does any " preexisting condition " justify our hastening their deaths ?
Man Marries Virtual Video Game Girlfriend
A living , breathing man brought his Nintendo DS in a church along with the Love Plus game cartridge to marry one of the game ’s virtual girlfriends Nene Anegasaki .
The “ couple ” hosted a “ reception ” afterwards .
The man , only known as SAL9000 can only find in Guam a priest who will officiate the ceremony .
He imposed however that the rites were not officially and legally binding .
What is more odd is that after his “ wedding ” about 3500 people petitioned online that marriage between human and two - dimensional figure be legalized .
SAL9000 and Nene ’s reception includes the man ’s family , friends and the media .
Love Plus was created by Konami , producers of famous series like Metal Gear , Castlevania , Silent Hill , Contra and Suikoden .
The game is an example of a “ dating simulation ” game where players meet potential dates and pursue them for potential relationships .
Once the player hit it off with the game girlfriends , they advance to the next level , which is the more “ physical ” level like touching , kissing and having sex .
The final stage is when they get married .
With a treasure trove of endemic species , the Galapagos Islands are renowned for natural wonders and unique wildlife .
Darwin's studies of the plants and animals there played a pivotal role in the development of his theory of natural selection .
Check out some of the unique animals that reside in this Pacific Ocean archipelago .
1 of 14 Galapagos Tortoises Ian Kennedy / Shutterstock
These giant tortoises are so iconic that the islands received their name after descriptions of the animals reached the Spanish court of King Charles V ( " galapago " means " tortoise " in Spanish ) .
They are the largest living species of tortoise and are among the longest - living vertebrates , with potential lifespans over 170 years .
In the absence of any significant predators , adult tortoises evolved a docile demeanor , which unfortunately made them easy to exploit by early human settlers .
An estimated population above 250,000 once existed on the islands as recently as 200 years ago , but there are about 20,000 - 25,000 alive today .
The good news is that intense conservation efforts have been successful for most of the subspecies , and the islands ' tortoise populations are , for the most part , on the rebound .
2 of 14 Marine Iguana Vince Smith / Flickr / CC BY 2.0
This incredibly unusual species of iguana found on all Galapagos islands is the only extant ( or still existing ) marine lizard on Earth .
The coloration , shape , and size of marine iguanas vary significantly between islands .
The ones found on Espanola are the most colorful and are nicknamed " Christmas Iguanas " because of their red and green coloration .
These iguanas likely evolved an aquatic lifestyle because of the sparsity of nutritious vegetation on land , opting instead for seaweed .
To get rid of the excess salt that it consumes , this iguana has specialized nasal glands that filter the salt and expel it from the nostrils .
When there is scarce food , the iguanas do n't just get thinner ; they become shorter .
These lizards are listed as vulnerable and undergoing population decreases by the IUCN Red List .
Factors that may lead to eventual extinction include marine plastics and climate change , the latter which decreases the available seaweed stocks on which they rely .
3 of 14 Flightless Cormorant robert cicchetti / Shutterstock
A candidate for the most unusual endemic species on the Galapagos , the flightless cormorant is the only cormorant in the world that has lost the ability to fly .
As a result , it has grown to become the heaviest cormorant species in the world .
Because this species does not fly , it is susceptible to predation from introduced predators such as dogs , cats , rats , and pigs .
Today , only around 2,080 of these unique birds exist .
4 of 14 Galapagos Finches Paul Krawczuk / Flickr / CC BY 2.0
Since they played such an important role in the development of Darwin 's theory of natural selection , the remarkable finches of the Galapagos are among the most famous animals on the islands .
There are 13 species of Darwin's Finch alive today in the Galapagos Islands , and they all evolved from a single ancestral species .
Each species is most easily distinguished by differences in beak size and shape .
The evolution of the finches of the Galapagos illustrates an ideal example of adaptive radiation , in which organisms rapidly diversify .
5 of 14 Galapagos Penguin Alfie Photography / Shutterstock
One of the smallest penguins in the world , the Galapagos penguin is also the only penguin with a range over the equator .
That makes it the most northerly breeding penguin .
Like many species of penguin , these creatures form monogamous pair bonds and typically mate for life .
These penguins are listed as endangered by the IUCN .
Major threats are oil spills and climate change , as the latter creates more severe La Nina and El Nino weather patterns .
6 of 14 Galapagos Fur Seal guenterguni / Getty Images
There are few endemic species of mammal in the Galapagos , but the Galapagos fur seal is one exception .
It is the smallest seal in the world .
These creatures are also one of the most land - loving seals , spending around 70 percent of their time out of the water .
Their raucous , charismatic barks are a familiar sound to anyone who has ever visited the islands .
7 of 14 Blue - Footed Boobies BlueOrage Studio / Shutterstock
Blue - footed boobies are not found exclusively on the Galapagos Islands , but about half of the world 's population breeds there .
The funny name almost matches these Galapagos creatures ' funny looks .
Blue - footed boobies are most easily recognized by their signature feet .
The birds ' mating ritual is also an entertaining affair , as males lift their feet up and down in a strutting display for the females .
The color of their feet is an indicator of their health , as the blue hue is caused by pigments obtained from a diet of fresh fish .
8 of 14 Galapagos Hawk A.Davey / Flickr / CC BY 2.0
As the only diurnal raptor to inhabit the islands , the Galapagos hawk is hard to miss .
Though it mostly preys on small animals such as locusts , centipedes , and lizards , this raptor is a top predator known to swoop down on iguanas and giant tortoise hatchlings .
Despite being a top predator , the hawks ' population is not exceptionally high , with an estimated 270 - 330 mature hawks in existence .
Human retaliation because of hawk predatory behavior toward farm animals and pets and competition for prey from invasive species has limited the population .
9 of 14 Lava Lizards Stacy Funderburke / Shutterstock
One of the most common animals found on the Galapagos Islands are small lizards , often affectionately referred to as " lava lizards . "
There are at least seven recognized species , each with unique traits .
Like with the Galapagos ' finches , the variety of species of lava lizards represents a remarkable example of adaptive radiation .
10 of 14 Magnificent Frigatebird Brian Gratwicke / Flickr / CC BY 2.0
There are few birds easier to recognize than the male magnificent frigatebirds of the Galapagos Islands .
They have a big red throat pouch , making for a bright , stunning display when it 's fully inflated .
It 's almost comical to see them puff up .
Of course , the brighter the pouch , the more attractive they appear to females .
Though magnificent frigatebirds are migratory birds found across the Atlantic Ocean and Central and South America , the colonies that inhabit the Galapagos Islands are genetically distinct , not having bred with mainland counterparts for more than half a million years .
11 of 14 Large Painted Locusts NH53 / Flickr / CC
By 2.0
The beautiful large painted locusts , endemic to the Galapagos Islands , typically grow to just over 3 inches .
The large painted locusts are an essential part of the food chain on the islands , serving as principal prey for lava lizards and the Galapagos hawk .
The locusts do n't make it easy for those who want to prey upon it , however ; they can leap almost 10 feet and are strong flyers as well .
12 of 14 Waved Albatross Clara / Shutterstock
The largest bird found on the Galapagos Islands is the waved albatross .
It 's also the only species of albatross found entirely in the tropics .
Though this species does glide over long distances , it breeds exclusively on the Galapagos Islands .
These beautiful birds mate for life and have one of nature 's more charming mating rituals .
They clack their beaks together in rapid circles , almost like a clumsy form of kissing .
Between " kisses , " they raise their bills skyward and let out a " whooo - ooo " call .
This species is critically endangered and has a decreasing population .
Major threats are climate change , plastic pollution , fishery bycatch , and avian illnesses .
13 of 14 Galapagos Mockingbird Henry Lien / Shutterstock
The Galapagos mockingbird may have been the first example of adaptive radiation that Darwin encountered on the islands even though the finches got the fame .
This common bird was the first one Darwin found that showed distinct adaptive differences from island to island .
Though they can fly , Galapagos mockingbirds are also known to hunt by running after prey , which occasionally draws comparisons to roadrunners .
Intel could launch Arrandale , its upcoming 32 - nanometer processor line , as soon as January of next year , according to a Digitimes report .
Citing sources from various " notebook players , " Digitimes claims that the chip giant will launch the Core i5 - 520 M , Core i5 - 430 M , Core i3 -350 M , and Core i3 -330 M in Early January 2010 .
These four processor models will be geared toward notebook use .
We first got a glimpse of the Arrandale chips in September at the Intel Developer Forum ( IDF ) .
Digitimes details that the entire range of the new chips will support 1066MHz DDR3 memory .
It also noted that the Core i5 - 430 M processor will have a single - core clock speed of 2.26GHz , with speeds of 2.53GHz being achievable thanks to Intel 's Turbo Boost .
The Core i3 -350 M model will also run at a single - core speed of 2.26GHz , but sadly cannot make use of the Turbo Boost technology .
The Core i3-330 M will run at a single - core clock speed of 2.13GHz , and also can not be boosted .
The Core i5 models will pack in a graphics clock running at a minimum speed of 500MHz , which can be pushed to speeds of 766M Hz .
Core i3 CPU 's will have the same minimum speed as the i5's , but can only be pushed to speeds of 667MHz .
The source claimed that Intel hopes that these new CPUs coupled with Microsoft 's Windows 7 will increase demand for notebooks in the new year .
They also detailed that Intel will release a further six CPU 's within the first half of 2010 .

The World Bank 's former Chief Economist 's accusations are eye - popping – including how the IMF and US Treasury fixed the Russian elections
“ It has condemned people to death , ” the former apparatchik told me .
This was like a scene out of Le Carre .
The brilliant old agent comes in from the cold , crosses to our side , and in hours of debriefing , empties his memory of horrors committed in the name of a political ideology he now realizes has gone rotten .
And here before me was a far bigger catch than some used Cold War spy .
Joseph Stiglitz was Chief Economist of the World Bank .
To a great extent , the new world economic order was his theory come to life .
I “ debriefed ” Stigltiz over several days , at Cambridge University , in a London hotel and finally in Washington in April 2001 during the big confab of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund .
But instead of chairing the meetings of ministers and central bankers , Stiglitz was kept exiled safely behind the blue police cordons , the same as the nuns carrying a large wooden cross , the Bolivian union leaders , the parents of AIDS victims and the other ‘ anti- globalization ' protesters .
The ultimate insider was now on the outside .
In 1999 the World Bank fired Stiglitz .
He was not allowed quiet retirement ; US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers , I 'm told , demanded a public excommunication for Stiglitz ' having expressed his first mild dissent from globalization World Bank style .
Here in Washington we completed the last of several hours of exclusive interviews for The Observer and BBC TV's Newsnight about the real , often hidden , workings of the IMF , World Bank , and the bank 's 51 % owner , the US Treasury .
And here , from sources unnamable ( not Stiglitz ) , we obtained a cache of documents marked , “ confidential , ” “ restricted , ” and “ not otherwise ( to be ) disclosed without World Bank authorization . ”
Stiglitz helped translate one from bureaucratise , a “ Country Assistance Strategy . ”
There 's an Assistance Strategy for every poorer nation , designed , says the World Bank , after careful in - country investigation .
But according to insider Stiglitz , the Bank 's staff ‘ investigation ' consists of close inspection of a nation 's 5 - star hotels .
It concludes with the Bank staff meeting some begging , busted finance minister who is handed a ‘ restructuring agreement ' pre-drafted for his ‘ voluntary ' signature ( I have a selection of these ) .
Each nation 's economy is individually analyzed , then , says Stiglitz , the Bank hands every minister the same exact four - step program .
Step One is Privatization – which Stiglitz said could more accurately be called , ‘ Briberization . '
Rather than object to the sell - offs of state industries , he said national leaders – using the World Bank 's demands to silence local critics – happily flogged their electricity and water companies .
“ You could see their eyes widen ” at the prospect of 10 % commissions paid to Swiss bank accounts for simply shaving a few billion off the sale price of national assets .
And the US government knew it , charges Stiglitz , at least in the case of the biggest ‘ briberization ' of all , the 1995 Russian sell - off .
“ The US Treasury view was this was great as we wanted Yeltsin re-elected .
We do n't care if it 's a corrupt election .
We want the money to go to Yeltzin ” via kick - backs for his campaign .
Stiglitz is no conspiracy nutter ranting about Black Helicopters .
The man was inside the game , a member of Bill Clinton 's cabinet as Chairman of the President 's council of economic advisors .
Most ill - making for Stiglitz is that the US - backed oligarchs stripped Russia 's industrial assets , with the effect that the corruption scheme cut national output nearly in half causing depression and starvation .
After briberization , Step Two of the IMF / World Bank one - size - fits - all rescue - your - economy plan is ‘ Capital Market Liberalization . '
In theory , capital market deregulation allows investment capital to flow in and out .
Unfortunately , as in Indonesia and Brazil , the money simply flowed out and out .
Stiglitz calls this the “ Hot Money ” cycle .
Cash comes in for speculation in real estate and currency , then flees at the first whiff of trouble .
A nation 's reserves can drain in days , hours .
And when that happens , to seduce speculators into returning a nation 's own capital funds , the IMF demands these nations raise interest rates to 30 % , 50 % and 80 % .
“ The result was predictable , ” said Stiglitz of the Hot Money tidal waves in Asia and Latin America .
Higher interest rates demolished property values , savaged industrial production and drained national treasuries .
At this point , the IMF drags the gasping nation to Step Three : Market - Based Pricing , a fancy term for raising prices on food , water and cooking gas .
This leads , predictably , to Step - Three - and - a- Half : what Stiglitz calls , “ The IMF riot . ”
The IMF riot is painfully predictable .
When a nation is , “ down and out , [ the IMF ] takes advantage and squeezes the last pound of blood out of them .
They turn up the heat until , finally , the whole cauldron blows up , ” as when the IMF eliminated food and fuel subsidies for the poor in Indonesia in 1998 .
Indonesia exploded into riots , but there are other examples – the Bolivian riots over water prices last year and this February , the riots in Ecuador over the rise in cooking gas prices imposed by the World Bank .
You 'd almost get the impression that the riot is written into the plan .
And it is .
What Stiglitz did not know is that , while in the States , BBC and The Observer obtained several documents from inside the World Bank , stamped over with those pesky warnings , “ confidential , ” “ restricted , ” “ not to be disclosed . ”
Let 's get back to one : the “ Interim Country Assistance Strategy ” for Ecuador , in it the Bank several times states – with cold accuracy – that they expected their plans to spark , “ social unrest , ” to use their bureaucratic term for a nation in flames .
That 's not surprising .
The secret report notes that the plan to make the US dollar Ecuador 's currency has pushed 51 % of the population below the poverty line .
The World Bank “ Assistance ” plan simply calls for facing down civil strife and suffering with , “ political resolve ” – and still higher prices .
The IMF riots ( and by riots I mean peaceful demonstrations dispersed by bullets , tanks and teargas ) cause new panicked flights of capital and government bankruptcies .
This economic arson has it's bright side – for foreign corporations , who can then pick off remaining assets , such as the odd mining concession or port , at fire sale prices .
Stiglitz notes that the IMF and World Bank are not heartless adherents to market economics .
At the same time the IMF stopped Indonesia ‘ subsidizing ' food purchases , “ when the banks need a bail - out , intervention ( in the market ) is welcome . ”
The IMF scrounged up tens of billions of dollars to save Indonesia 's financiers and , by extension , the US and European banks from which they had borrowed .
A pattern emerges .
There are lots of losers in this system but one clear winner : the Western banks and US Treasury , making the big bucks off this crazy new international capital churn .
Stiglitz told me about his unhappy meeting , early in his World Bank tenure , with Ethopia 's new president in the nation 's first democratic election .
The World Bank and IMF had ordered Ethiopia to divert aid money to its reserve account at the US Treasury , which pays a pitiful 4 % return , while the nation borrowed US dollars at 12 % to feed its population .
The new president begged Stiglitz to let him use the aid money to rebuild the nation .
But no , the loot went straight off to the US Treasury 's vault in Washington .
Now we arrive at Step Four of what the IMF and World Bank call their “ poverty reduction strategy ” : Free Trade .
This is free trade by the rules of the World Trade Organization and World Bank , Stiglitz the insider likens free trade WTO - style to the Opium Wars .
“ That too was about opening markets , ” he said .
As in the 19th century , Europeans and Americans today are kicking down the barriers to sales in Asia , Latin American and Africa , while barricading our own markets against Third World agriculture .
In the Opium Wars , the West used military blockades to force open markets for their unbalanced trade .
Today , the World Bank can order a financial blockade just as effective – and sometimes just as deadly .
Stiglitz is particularly emotional over the WTO 's intellectual property rights treaty ( it goes by the acronym TRIPS , more on that in the next chapters ) .
It is here , says the economist , that the new global order has “ condemned people to death ” by imposing impossible tariffs and tributes to pay to pharmaceutical companies for branded medicines .
“ They do n't care , ” said the professor of the corporations and bank loans he worked with , “ if people live or die . ”
By the way , do n't be confused by the mix in this discussion of the IMF , World Bank and WTO .
They are interchangeable masks of a single governance system .
They have locked themselves together by what are unpleasantly called , “ triggers . ”
Taking a World Bank loan for a school ‘ triggers ' a requirement to accept every ‘ conditionality ' – they average 111 per nation – laid down by both the World Bank and IMF .
In fact , said Stiglitz the IMF requires nations to accept trade policies more punitive than the official WTO rules .
Stiglitz greatest concern is that World Bank plans , devised in secrecy and driven by an absolutist ideology , are never open for discourse or dissent .
Despite the West 's push for elections throughout the developing world , the so - called Poverty Reduction Programs “ undermine democracy . ”
And they do n't work .
Black Africa 's productivity under the guiding hand of IMF structural “ assistance ” has gone to hell in a handbag .
Did any nation avoid this fate ?
Yes , said Stiglitz , identifying Botswana .
Their trick ?
“ They told the IMF to go packing . ”
So then I turned on Stiglitz .
OK , Mr Smart - Guy Professor , how would you help developing nations ?
Stiglitz proposed radical land reform , an attack at the heart of “ landlordism , ” on the usurious rents charged by the propertied oligarchies worldwide , typically 50 % of a tenant 's crops .
So I had to ask the professor : as you were top economist at the World Bank , why did n't the Bank follow your advice ?
“ If you challenge [ land ownership ] , that would be a change in the power of the elites .
That 's not high on their agenda . ”
Apparently not .
Ultimately , what drove him to put his job on the line was the failure of the banks and US Treasury to change course when confronted with the crises – failures and suffering perpetrated by their four - step monetarist mambo .
Every time their free market solutions failed , the IMF simply demanded more free market policies .
“ It 's a little like the Middle Ages , ” the insider told me , “ When the patient died they would say , “ well , he stopped the bloodletting too soon , he still had a little blood in him . ”
I took away from my talks with the professor that the solution to world poverty and crisis is simple : remove the bloodsuckers .

Vaclav Klaus had vehemently opposed the Lisbon Treaty The president of the Czech Republic , Vaclav Klaus , has signed the EU 's Lisbon Treaty , the final step in the charter 's ratification .
The treaty was drawn up to streamline decision - making in the EU , and is a watered - down version of a draft EU constitution rejected four years ago .
Among its measures , it creates a European Council president and alters the way member states vote .
The treaty could now come into force as early as December .
The Lisbon Treaty 's supporters say it will allow the EU to operate more efficiently and give it greater influence in world affairs .
Critics say it will cede too many national powers to Brussels .
LISBON TREATY
Creates new post of EU president ( President of European Council )
New post of high representative for foreign affairs
More decisions by majority vote rather than unanimity Only Irish Republic held referendum on it - twice ( ' Yes ' vote second time )
Took a decade of negotiations
Was intended to take effect in January 2009
Q&A : The Lisbon Treaty Gavin Hewitt : Bitter pill Timeline :
The road to Lisbon EU president frontrunners UK opposition rules out referendum Speaking in Washington ahead of an EU - US summit , European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso welcomed the removal of the " last hurdle " to the treaty 's passage .
" I think that the transformational potential that is there , the new external profile for the European Union , will be felt immediately , " he said .
In the UK , William Hague , the shadow foreign secretary for the opposition Conservatives , said it would no longer be possible to hold a referendum on the treaty if his party won a general election next year .
The party had previously argued that the treaty should be put to a popular vote .
Court ' bias ' British Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the ratification , and said it marked the end of years of debate .
" Today is a day when Europe looks forward , " he said .
ANALYSIS Oana Lungescu , BBC European affairs correspondent Diplomats say the treaty , meant to give the EU a stronger voice in the world , is likely to come into force on 1 December .
It will create a European diplomatic service and two powerful new jobs - EU leaders are expected to choose a permanent president of the EU Council and a foreign policy chief within days .
After intense speculation about former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair , the front - runner to become the first EU Council president is the low - key Belgian Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy , with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband tipped as favourite for the second top job .
The Czech Republic was the last of the EU 's 27 member states to ratify the treaty .
Mr Klaus signed it shortly after the Czech constitutional court rejected a complaint against it , ruling that it was in line with the Czech constitution .
Announcing in Prague that he had signed the treaty , the Czech leader accused the court of bias and said the Czech Republic would " cease to be a sovereign state " .
The Eurosceptic Mr Klaus had recently said he would no longer attempt to block the treaty , after receiving the promise of an opt - out from the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Mr Klaus said the opt - out was needed to avoid property claims from ethnic Germans expelled from Czechoslovakia after World War II .
The Lisbon Treaty replaced an earlier draft constitution that was rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands in 2005 .
I support the treaty but I am very afraid of what will happen to our sovereignty in the next 20 years
BBC reader Radek Novotny , Prague , Czech Republic
More readers ' views on treaty
The treaty was initially rejected in a referendum in Ireland , before being endorsed in a second Irish referendum last month .
It would create two major new posts : a new European Council president who would serve a term of two - and - a - half years , and a new foreign policy chief whose role would combine those of the existing foreign affairs representative and external affairs commissioner .
In addition , the treaty will alter voting procedures , with national vetoes to become the exception rather than the rule in most policy areas .
For the first time , it will also offer a way out to any member states that decide to leave the EU .

Summary of Findings
The Fox News Channel is viewed by Americans in more ideological terms than other television news networks .
And while the public is evenly divided in its view of hosts of cable news programs having strong political opinions , more Fox News viewers see this as a good thing than as a bad thing .
Nearly half of Americans ( 47 % ) say they think of Fox News as “ mostly conservative , ” 14 % say it is “ mostly liberal , ” and 24 % say it is “ neither in particular . ”
Opinion about the ideological orientation of other TV news outlets is more mixed : while many view CNN and the three broadcast networks as mostly liberal , about the same percentages say they are neither in particular .
However , somewhat more say MSNBC is mostly liberal than say it is neither in particular , by 36 % to 27 % .
The perceptions of those who regularly tune into these news networks are similar to those of the public .
Nearly half ( 48 % ) of regular
Fox viewers say the network is mostly conservative .
About four - in - ten ( 41 % ) regular viewers of CNN describe the network as mostly liberal and 36 % of regular MSNBC viewers say the same about that network .
The latest weekly News Interest Index survey , conducted October 23 - 26 among 1,001 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , also shows that Americans followed news about the spread of the swine flu and the availability of a vaccine more closely than any other major news story last week .
And the percentage of Americans saying they followed swine flu news very closely ( 43 % ) now matches the highest levels of interest reached during the previous flu outbreak in May .
The survey also finds the public is evenly split in its view of cable news hosts “ having strong opinions about politics . ”
About four - in - ten ( 42 % ) see this as a good thing while an identical percentage sees it as a bad thing .
By 51 % to 36 % , regular Fox News viewers view cable hosts with strong political opinions as a good thing ; regular viewers of other TV news outlets are more evenly divided over opinionated cable news hosts .
More Fox Viewers See Other Networks as Liberal
The perception of Fox News as mostly conservative is shared equally by regular Fox News viewers and regular viewers of other TV news networks .
Half of regular CNN viewers see the Fox News Channel as mostly conservative , as do 48 % its own viewers , 48 % of regular MSNBC viewers and 45 % of the regular viewers of national nightly network news on ABC , NBC and CBS .
By contrast , regular Fox News viewers are more likely than those who tune into other news networks to see those networks as mostly liberal .
For instance , 50 % of regular Fox News viewers say NBC News is mostly liberal , compared with only about third of regular viewers of CNN ( 35 % ) , MSNBC ( 31 % ) and the nightly network news ( 34 % ) .
There are comparable differences between how Fox News viewers and other news audiences see the ideologies of CBS News and ABC News .
Nearly half of Fox News viewers also say that CNN ( 49 % ) and MSNBC ( 47 % ) are mostly liberal .
However , nearly as many CNN viewers ( 41 % ) say that network is mostly liberal ; similarly , 43 % of regular MSNBC viewers say that network is mostly liberal .
Views of the networks ’ ideologies also differ greatly by personal ideology .
More than half of liberals ( 57 % ) say Fox News is mostly conservative , compared with 46 % of moderates and 44 % of conservatives .
By contrast , 48 % of conservatives say that MSNBC is mostly liberal , compared with 31 % of moderates and 29 % of liberals .
These are similar to views of CNN : 51 % of conservatives say the network is mostly liberal , while 33 % of moderates and 28 % of liberals agree .
There are comparable ideological differences in perceptions of the ideologies of NBC News , ABC News and CBS News .
Divided Over Opinionated Cable Hosts
The public is split over whether it is a good thing or bad thing for hosts of cable news shows to have strong opinions about politics ; 42 % see this as a good thing while as many see it as a bad thing .
In July 2003 , 47 % said it was a good thing for hosts to have strong political opinions , while 40 % saw it as a bad thing .
Just over half of regular Fox News viewers ( 51 % ) say it is a good thing , while 36 % say it is a bad thing .
Opinions are more evenly divided among regular viewers of the other cable news channels and network news , as well as regular newspaper readers and online news users .
Views of Obama Coverage
There has been a steady decline since early this year in the proportion saying the press has been fair in the way it has covered Barack Obama .
Currently , 37 % see coverage of Obama as fair , down from 43 % in August and 64 % in January , shortly after Obama ’s inauguration .
Over the same period , increasing percentages say Obama coverage is not critical enough and too critical .
Currently , 31 % say Obama coverage is not critical enough ( up from 18 % in late January ) and 26 % say it is too critical ( 12 % in late January ) .
Fully 60 % of Republicans say the press is not critical enough of Obama , while nearly as many Democrats see coverage of Obama as too critical ( 41 % ) as fair ( 44 % ) .
Among political independents , about as many say the coverage has been fair ( 38 % ) as not critical enough ( 35 % ) .
Among regular viewers of Fox News , 45 % say the press has not been critical enough of Obama , compared with 15 % of regular MSNBC viewers , 23 % of regular CNN viewers and 21 % of regular nightly network news viewers .
Most Continue to Expect Health Care Bill to Pass
More than half ( 53 % ) of Americans say they think a health care reform bill will pass over the next year , while 40 % say they do not think that will happen .
That is little changed from last week , when 57 % said they thought health care legislation would pass , while 38 % said they did not .
In a survey conducted Oct. 9 - 12 , 45 % said they thought a bill would pass over the next year ; 46 % thought it would not .
Meanwhile , 66 % say they have seen or heard advertisements about the health care debate , which is about the same as in early September ( 63 % ) .
While 23 % say they have heard a mostly negative message about health care reform , comparable percentages volunteer that they have heard a mix of positive and negative messages ( 23 % ) while 18 % say they have heard mostly positive messages about health care reform .
These assessments also have changed only modestly since early September .
Off - Course Flight Registers Widely
About three - quarters of the public heard either a lot ( 44 % ) or a little ( 30 % ) about a Northwest Airlines flight that flew 150 miles past its destination last week before turning around .
By comparison , 30 % say they heard a lot and 24 % say they heard a little about Obama administration officials saying that the Fox News Channel is not really a news organization .
Nearly half ( 46 % ) say they heard nothing at all about the dispute , even though coverage of this issue that accounted for 5 % of the newshole , according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism ( PEJ ) .
However , 46 % of regular Fox News viewers heard a lot about the Obama administration ’s criticisms of Fox News .
That compares with smaller proportions of regular MSNBC viewers ( 34 % ) , CNN viewers ( 32 % ) and network news viewers ( 26 % ) .
Just 19 % of the public heard a lot about the Justice Department announcing it will not pursue cases against people who use medical marijuana if state laws allow it , while 46 % heard a little about this .
Slightly more than a third ( 36 % ) say they heard nothing about this story .
The Week ’s Other News
For the first time this fall , news about swine flu and the vaccine ranked atop the public ’s news agenda .
About a third ( 32 % ) followed news about the swine flu more closely than any other story .
More than four - in - ten ( 43 % ) say they paid very close attention to the story , matching a high reached in early May 2009 .
For the week , interest was strong despite modest media coverage ; swine flu filled 5 % of the newshole and trailed coverage of other leading stories , including the economy , Afghanistan , and the debate over health care reform .
Second to the news about swine flu , the health care reform debate was the top story for 27 % of the public ; 40 % followed news about the debate very closely .
Coverage accounted for 10 % of the national newshole .
Reports about the condition of the U.S. economy was the top story for 15 % of the public , while 44 % say they followed economic news very closely .
News about the economy made up 10 % of the newshole .
Another 6 % of coverage was devoted to issues surrounding executive pay and attempts to regulate it .
Almost one third of Americans ( 32 % ) say they followed this story very closely ; it was the top story for 4 % .
News about the U.S. military effort in Afghanistan was the most closely followed story of the week for 9 % of the public .
Close to a third ( 32 % ) say they followed Afghanistan news very closely – one of the few times this year that very close interest has topped 30 % .
The media devoted 13 % of coverage to Afghanistan , according to PEJ .
Fewer tuned into news about political instability in Pakistan .
Just 1 % named this their top story , while 17 % say they followed news about Pakistan very closely .
Coverage made up 2 % of the newshole .
These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index , an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press .
The index , building on the Center ’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories , examines news interest as it relates to the news media ’s coverage .
The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s News Coverage Index , which monitors the news reported by major newspaper , television , radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis .
In the most recent week , data relating to news coverage were collected from October 19 - 12 , 2009 and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected October 23 - 26 , 2009 from a nationally representative sample of 1,001 adults .
About the News Interest Index
The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public ’s interest in and reaction to major news events .
This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s News Coverage Index , an ongoing content analysis of the news .
The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media : newspapers , network television , cable television , radio and the internet .
Each week ( from Monday through Sunday ) PEJ compiles this data to identify the top stories for the week .
The News Interest Index survey collects data from Friday through Monday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week .
Results for the weekly surveys are based on landline telephone interviews among a nationwide sample of approximately 1,000 adults , 18 years of age or older , conducted under the direction of ORC ( Opinion Research Corporation ) .
For results based on the total sample , one can say with 95 % confidence that the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls , and that results based on subgroups will have larger margins of error .

More than a million children regularly go to bed hungry in the US , according to a government report that shows a startling increase in the number of families struggling to put food on the table .
President Barack Obama , who pledged to eradicate childhood hunger , has described as " unsettling " the agriculture department survey , which says 50 million people in the US – one in six of the population – were unable to afford to buy sufficient food to stay healthy at some point last year , in large part because of escalating unemployment or poorly paid jobs .
That is a rise of more than one - third on the year before and the highest number since the survey began in 1995 .
The agriculture secretary , Tom Vilsack , said : " These numbers are a wake - up call … for us to get very serious about food security and hunger , about nutrition and food safety in this country . "
Vilsack said he expected the numbers to worsen when the survey for this year is released in 2010 .
The report said 6.7 million people were defined as having " very low food security " because they regularly lacked sufficient to eat .
Among them , 96 % reported that the food they bought did not last until they had money to buy more .
Nearly all said they could not afford to eat balanced meals .
Although few reported that this was a permanent situation throughout the year , 88 % said it had occurred in three or more months .
Nearly half reported losing weight because they did not have enough money to buy food .
The number of children living in households where there were shortages of food at times rose by nearly one - third to 17 million .
The report says that most parents who did not get enough to eat ensured their offspring received sufficient food but that more than 1 million children still suffered outright hunger .
The worst affected states are in the south with Mississippi having the largest proportion of its population enduring shortages of food followed by Texas and Arkansas .
More than half of those affected are minorities , principally black people and Hispanics .
Millions more Americans do not go hungry only because they are so poor they receive government food stamps or rely on handouts from food banks such as Feeding America .
In some states , such as West Virginia , one in six of the population is on food stamps .
Vicki Escarra , head of Feeding America which runs 200 food banks across the country feeding 25 million people , described the report as " alarming " and noted that the situation is continuing to deteriorate .
" Although these new numbers are staggering , it should be noted that these numbers reflect the state of the nation one year ago , in 2008 .
Since then the economy has significantly weakened , and there are likely many more people struggling with hunger than this report states , " she said .
Feeding America said there had been a " dramatic increase " in requests for emergency food assistance from food banks across the US .
It said that food banks in some parts of the country were requesting more than a 50 % increase in assistance than over a year ago .
" Our network food banks are calling us every day , telling us that demand for emergency food is higher than it has ever been in our history , " said Escarra .
The principal cause is unemployment , which has risen past 10 % , as well as increasing numbers of people who have had their hours cut back or been forced in to minimum wage jobs .
Even before the recent economic collapse many working people were struggling to meet rising living costs , such as those who drive long distances to their jobs in rural states who were hit by the rising cost of fuel .
Feeding America said 40 % of the people it helps live in families with at least one working adult .
Charities say that many of those who fall into financial difficulties take years to get back on their feet and so the problem is likely to persist for years .
The report comes as the United Nations holds a summit in Rome on food security .
The UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , told the summit that a child dies of hunger every five seconds somewhere in the world and that more than 1 billion live with hunger .

There ’s nothing that skeptics enjoy more than a good debunking .
Set up a big fat target and let the fun begin :
How could anyone believe that nonsense ?
Or pose an apparently insuperable challenge : prove that you have paranormal powers and we ’ll give you a million bucks .
Thus far , no takers .
Among those leading the skeptical charge ( my apology for omissions ) are James Randi , founder of the Randi Educational Foundation ; Michael Shermer , head of the Skeptics Society and author of Why People Believe Weird Things ; Joe Nickel and others at the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry , publishers of Skeptical Inquirer ; physicist and science - defender Lawrence Krauss ; Massimo Pigliucci , host of Rationally Speaking ; neurologist Steven Novella who heads the New England Skeptical Society and hosts Neurologica ; and of course America ’s favorite exploders of supernatural shibboleths and fashionable nonsense , Penn and Teller on their show Bullshit !.
None of these guys are to be trifled with if you have the least propensity for wishful thinking .
Their critical gaze has shredded every imaginable quackery , from Bigfoot to birthers , spoon - bending to séances , vaccine scare - mongering to visitations from the dead .
If there ’s no solid empirical evidence for it or if it ’s logically suspect , they ’re all over it , and then it ’s all over for the wishful thinker .
This of course fulfills an important function for the culture : keeping it intellectually honest , or at least less dishonest .
Given all this , it ’s striking that the skeptical community pays relatively little attention to one of the weirdest beliefs going : that human beings have contra-causal free will . [ 1 ]
Although the actual prevalence of this belief is just now being researched , it ’s probably safe to say that many folks suppose that our choices transcend natural causal laws in some respect , such that we are miniature first causes , like God .
Sitting inside each of us is an unmoved mover , an immaterial soul or mental agent , that gets to pick and choose among courses of action without itself being determined in its choices .
But of course there ’s no evidence for such a supernatural thing .
We are natural , physical beings through and through , and our choices , dependent as they are on the workings of our brains , cannot transcend the laws of cause and effect that hold elsewhere in nature .
This does n’t mean we are n’t rational and moral beings ( a good deal of the time anyway ) , but we are n’t contra-causal .
Nor is it logically possible to be self - caused in any ultimate respect , which is pretty much what contra-causal free will requires .
Most scientists and philosophers have long since given up on immaterial agents with contra-causal free will , also called libertarian free will or strong “ agent causation . ” [ 2 ]
Some in the philosophical community even describe themselves as free will skeptics .
Being academics , they of course disagree on many of the fine points ( huge , from their perspective ) of what ’s called action theory , but none put stock in uncaused causers .
But such skepticism has thus far not found a strong public voice in the wider community of skeptics and their leaders mentioned above .
Why not , one wonders ?
Before speculating about this , I should mention that a few skeptics have trained their sights specifically on libertarian free will , which is most encouraging .
The hosts of Reasonable Doubts – Jeremy Beahan , Luke Galen , and David Fletcher – aired a three part series on free will and determinism ( episodes 29 , 30 , 34 ) which did a good job of showing the logical and empirical difficulties of belief in uncaused causers .
( Note : I was interviewed during the second half of the second show , but my contribution mainly echoed what the hosts had already concluded in the first half of the series . )
Even better , they discussed the significance of the challenge to free will , of how giving up belief in human causal exceptionalism can affect beliefs about credit , blame , punishment , merit and inequality in ways that help promote a more compassionate and cause - cognizant ( and therefore smarter ) culture .
So why is n’t contra-causal free will being vigorously targeted by skeptics , given its manifest implausibilities , implausibilities at least equal to alien abduction ?
An unlikely possibility is that they are n’t aware of the issue .
Given the historical prominence of the free will question , plus the increasing pressure science is putting on the idea of our being first causes , most skeptics have likely thought about human freedom .
Michael Shermer , for one , discusses free will in his book The Mind of the Market ( pp. 235 - 8 ) in the context of defending compatibilist versions of it , those compatible with determinism .
Free will has also been discussed occasionally on some skeptic blogs ( see note 1 ) , so it is n’t invisible to the skeptical community .
Another possibility is that skeptics suppose there ’s little to be gained by broaching what ’s often called one of the great unsolved questions of philosophy .
Why rehash old debates about free will ?
But the debate about whether we have contra-causal free will is pretty much settled , at least in the academic and scientific communities : we do n’t .
The puzzle of free will now mainly consists in how we might rethink our notions of self , freedom and responsibility in light of the death of the soul , and what this implies for our responsibility practices , for instance in criminal justice .
These are momentous questions that skeptics can help bring to the fore by prying the public loose from their supernatural notions of self and freedom .
A third possibility is that skeptics are well aware of the weirdness of contra-causal free will , but reluctant to publicly challenge a belief so central to Western culture .
To do so would open a rather large can of worms :
If we ’re fully caused to do what we do , what happens to personal responsibility ?
Are we just puppets of fate ?
Do killers go free ?
Do billionaires deserve their riches ?
These are questions that skeptics might be reluctant to take on , even though challenging a free willer might prove entertaining .
Imagine Penn Gillette asking :
You believe what ?
Let me get this straight , you think you can just choose to lose weight / stop smoking / get rich ?
You think we have that kind of power ?
Prove it !
But , having had his fun , he ’d then have to reassure everyone that it ’s OK not to have free will .
To debunk free will responsibly requires that the skeptic articulate good reasons why we do n’t need to be exceptions from cause and effect , otherwise people might go away supposing that everything ’s permitted or that their choices do n’t make a difference .
Given the undeserved but widespread dislike of determinism as the nefarious subverter of human dignity ( see here ) , putting people at ease about it is not a trivial undertaking , and might give skeptics pause .
This points up the fact that many of the weird beliefs debunked by skeptics over the years have n’t been particularly central to our self - concept or our culture .
It is n’t a problem for most of us that we have n’t been visited by aliens , that the Loch Ness monster does n’t exist , that Reiki healing is just the placebo effect , and that we do n’t have paranormal powers .
What ’s more of a problem than any particular belief is the gullibility , illogicality , wishful thinking and confirmation bias that permits such nonsense to flourish .
As champions of rationality , empiricism and critical thinking , skeptics are , thankfully , fighting the good fight against the temptations of unreason and the supernatural .
May their ranks increase .
Should they turn their attention to beliefs in contra-causal freedom , they ’ll find the same cognitive failings in play , but as we ’ve seen , the stakes are considerably higher .
Free will skepticism is n’t to be undertaken lightly , which may explain why few leading skeptics are undertaking it in their magazines , lectures , blogs and podcasts .
Still , as the philosophically savvy crew at Reasonable Doubts demonstrates , if you ’ve considered what life would be like after free will , and understand its viability and indeed its virtues , then you ’ll be in a position to offer the necessary reassurances .
We can , it turns out , be responsibly skeptical of the widespread , weird belief at the core of the Western conception of self : that we somehow transcend the causal laws of the natural world that brought us into being . [ 3 ]
TWC , September 2009
Notes
[ 1 ] A web search turned up some online discussions related to free will by skeptics , including blogs at Skepchick ( Free will , Free will as illusion , Does free will exist ? , Train delays , horoscopes and free will ) , Neurologica ( Decision Making in the Brain ) and Skepticblog ( So many choices ) .
Also found were Implications of no free will at the Skeptic.com discussion board ( starting with a post on the virtues of realizing we do n’t have free will ) and Does free will exist ? , on a South African skeptic discussion board .
But I did n’t find any major articles debunking belief in contra-causal free will .
[ 2 ]
There is a small but resilient minority , including David Hodgson and Tibor Machan , that wo n’t give up on strong agent causation , partially because they suppose Western civilization depends on it .
[ 3 ]
Not having done an exhaustive search of the skeptical literature , there ’s undoubtedly more skepticism out there about free will than I ’m aware of .
So , be skeptical about my assessment in this article .
When Apple released the iPhone 3.0 OS , one of its best additions was Spotlight Search , which lets users quickly find not only contacts , but apps , songs , and emails through a universal search box .
It 's useful , it 's quick , and it's on every iPhone with 3.0 .
Now Google has its own version of Spotlight Search for its Android mobile platform , built by the same guy who created Quicksilver for Mac .
And it is way , way more functional than Apple 's offering .
The new addition to Android is called the Quick Search Box , or QSB .
It sits on the home screen of your phone , but it does so much more .
It auto - suggests keywords as you type and can search through your phone 's apps and content , but it also can do things Spotlight Search cannot .
Specifically , QSB is linked to a full range Google web search options .
When you start typing in the Android Quick Search Box , you 'll notice that it not only pulls up apps and contacts , but that it pulls web content .
It 's not just about searching Google , but searching Google Maps , weather reports , and stock quotes .
Being able to find nearby locations from the QSB via Google Maps is a very savvy addition all by itself , much less full web search .
QSB also includes the microphone icon , which links you to voice search .
You can search for contacts , pictures , and more .
Yes , it 's similar to the voice search feature on the iPhone 3GS .
Finally , this app tracks your habits .
If you are constantly searching for the same things and picking the same items , it will recognize that and bring them to the top of the suggestions list .
This update may seem small , but its implications are huge .
It adds a whole new layer of functionality to Android that completely obliterates the iPhone 's functionality .
And with Android launching on more carriers , this type of addition could help it win new customers , even ones with iPhones .
The secret :
It 's not the creepy chemical additive you thought .
A couple of weekends ago , I caught an episode of the public radio show " The Splendid Table " with soothingly voiced chef Lynne Rossetto Kasper .
The topic was BBQ and I was shocked ( Shocked ! ) to hear Lynne * and her guest recommend liquid smoke as the key to great crockpot pulled pork .
In fact , Lynne seemed pretty surprised to hear herself suggest it .
But the truth , my friends , is that sometimes there is a little truth in advertising .
And liquid smoke is one of those times .
* We 're on a first - name basis like that .
In my imagination .
You can be forgiven for wrongfully accusing liquid smoke of nefarious fakey toxic chemicalness .
Even chemists have been confused on this one .
Back in June , Slashfood interviewed NYU chemistry professor Kent Kirshenbaum , who–like you , me , Lynne Rossetto Kasper and everyone we know –had believed the worst about this cheap , sketchy sounding liquid .
Unlike the rest of us , however , Kirshenbaum actually went out and studied liquid smoke .
He found that , despite its synthetic 1950 's aura , the stuff is perfectly natural .
What is liquid smoke ?
Liquid smoke is very simply smoke in water .
Smoke usually comes as a vapor , but there are ways to condense it and turn it into liquid and that liquid can then be carried in water .
How is it different from regular smoke ?
Regular smoke is a vapor , and it is difficult to store .
Is one healthier than the other ?
It seems that the liquid smoke can be substantially healthier because there are carcinogenic compounds that can be removed .
A lot of the carcinogenic compounds [ found in direct smoke from charcoal or wood ] do not dissolve .
But by dissolving the compounds into water , they can be removed .
So , it 's like a water bong ?
Correct .
Knowing is half the battle .
The other half : Recipes .
Today , I made " The Splendid Table 's " Ultimate Cheater Crockpot Pulled Pork , using liquid smoke ( hickory smoke , to be precise ) .
It took exactly 15 minutes of my time and 5 hours in the crockpot .
And it 's freakin ' delicious .
If you eat meat , and you eat pork , you will hate yourself forever if you do n't make this asap .

Indira Gandhi remains very popular among many Indians
Indira Gandhi was gunned down by her bodyguards on this day 25 years ago .
Ramachandra Guha looks at the legacy of India 's most controversial and best - known politician .
In the summer of 1965 , Indira Gandhi was thinking of shifting base from Delhi to London .
She was then serving as a junior minister in the cabinet of Lal Bahadur Shastri , who had succeeded her father Jawaharlal Nehru as prime minister of India .
With her political prospects fairly bleak , she was attracted to England for personal reasons .
Her sons Rajiv and Sanjay were both studying in the United Kingdom ; besides , living in London would allow her to further her interest in culture and the arts .
In the end , Mrs Gandhi chose to remain in her homeland and would reap a wholly unexpected reward .
When Mr Shastri died of a heart attack in January 1966 , she was asked to replace him as prime minister .
The choice was made by the " Syndicate " , the group of crafty old men who ran the ruling Congress party .
Hesitant start
They calculated that the elevation of Nehru 's daughter would reassure a nation reeling from the deaths in quick succession of two prime ministers ; besides , as a novice in politics she could be easily manipulated .
After a hesitant start in office , Mrs Gandhi grew in confidence .

Sikh guards from her security detail ( Photo : Ashok Vahie )
In 1969 she cut herself loose from the " Syndicate " by portraying them as a bunch of reactionaries while she represented the progressive forces of history .
She nationalised banks , mines , and oil companies ; abolished the titles and privileges of the former maharajas ; and comprehensively won the general elections of 1971 on the stirring slogan of " Garibi Hatao " ( Remove Poverty ) .
The elections were held in January ; in the last month of the same year , Mrs Gandhi played a key role in India 's military victory over Pakistan , which led to the dismemberment of that country and the formation of an independent Bangladesh .
Among a certain section of the middle class , Mrs Gandhi remains very popular .
In polls conducted by English - language magazines she is usually chosen as " India 's best - ever prime minister " .
This endorsement is principally based on her performance during the 1971 war , invariably contrasted with her father 's disastrous leadership during India 's border war with China in 1962 .
Lukewarm
Others admire her for her identification with the whole of India ( although a northerner by birth and background she had a special affection for the south ) .
Socialists sympathise with her pro-poor rhetoric .
Mrs Gandhi's assassination was a traumatic moment in Indian history ( Photo : Ashok Vahie )
On the other hand , there remain many Indians who are lukewarm about Mrs Gandhi 's legacy .
They point to her authoritarian tendencies , which came to the fore after her annus mirabilis : 1971 .
At this point she asked for a " committed bureaucracy " and " committed judiciary " , seeking to make these previously autonomous institutions subject to the whims and fancies of politicians in power .
In 1974 , the respected Gandhian politician Jayaprakash Narayan launched a countrywide movement against corruption in government .
In June 1975 the Allahabad High Court found the prime minister guilty of electoral malpractices .
Mrs Gandhi's response to this twin challenge , political and judicial , was to declare a state of emergency , censor the press , and put hundreds of opposition politicians in jail .
The emergency lasted until January 1977 .
In elections held in March , the Congress were routed by the Janata Party , a coalition of four previously distinct entities .
However , the new government lasted less than three years , collapsing under the weight of its contradictions .
In 1980 Mrs Gandhi and the Congress were voted back to power on the plank of " stability " .
Stoking trouble
The first two years of her fourth term were uneventful , but then , almost at once , Mrs Gandhi was confronted with discontent in the state of Andhra Pradesh , secessionist stirrings in the north - east , and a fully - fledged insurgency in the Punjab .
Mrs Gandhi has been accused by critics of promoting dynastic politics
It was claimed at the time that the prime minister deliberately stoked the troubles in the Punjab , so that when elections were held in 1985 she could put herself forward as the one person standing between India and anarchy .
In June 1984 she ordered the army to storm the Golden Temple , where a band of Sikh extremists were holed up .
The " terrorists " were killed , but the action also led to the destruction of the second holiest building in the complex .
Five months later , two Sikh security guards gunned down Mrs Gandhi in an apparent act of revenge .
" I see that marble conceals a multitude of sins , " remarked Aldous Huxley on seeing the Taj Mahal .
In the same manner , the fact that she died a martyr 's death - and after contemptuously rejecting advice to purge her staff of Sikhs - has led to a posthumous evaluation of Indira Gandhi that exculpates or ignores her very many mistakes .
That she was a thoroughgoing patriot we may not doubt ; nor , indeed , that she led India nobly and well during the refugee crisis of 1971 ( when nine million East Pakistanis fled into India ) and the war that followed .
At the same time , the historian is obliged to record her failings .
Foremost among these was the perversion of public institutions .
In Nehru 's time , the bureaucracy and judiciary were insulated from political interference ; recruitment , postings , and promotions were decided on the basis of diligence and competence .
Damaging tradition Mrs Gandhi inaugurated an altogether different ( and deeply damaging ) tradition , whereby ministers , chief ministers and prime ministers decided the assignments of civil servants on the basis of kinship or loyalty .
Mrs Gandhi's decision to send the army into the Golden Temple alienated Sikhs Among the institutions damaged in this fashion was the Indian National Congress .
In Nehru 's time , the Congress was a genuinely decentralised and democratic party , with district and state committees chosen on the basis of inner-party elections .
A chief minister was elected by the legislators of the state .
Mrs Gandhi , on the other hand , worked unceasingly to make the Congress an extension of herself .
Inner - party elections were abolished .
Chief ministers were chosen by her alone .
That was not all .
Since Mrs Gandhi knew she was not immortal , and since she could not bring herself to wholly trust anyone who was not related to her , she brought her sons into politics .
Family politics From 1976 Sanjay Gandhi worked closely with her , on the understanding that he would succeed her when she retired or passed on .
When it was Sanjay who unexpectedly died in June 1980 , his elder brother Rajiv was drafted into politics , on the same understanding .
( The conversion of the Congress into a family firm has been emulated by other parties .
Had Mrs Gandhi not showed the way , it is impossible to conceive of the Akali Dal or the Dravidra Munnetra Kazhagam [ both state - based parties in India ] , for example , becoming , as they have now , captives of the interests of a single family . )
These criticisms are not merely retrospective .
Sanjay Gandhi was a very controversial politician
They were made at the time , as indeed were criticisms of her economic policies .
By the late 1960s , India had built industrial capacity and a technological base through promoting self - sufficient economic growth .
Leading economists such as Jagdish Bhagwati now urged a dismantling of the industrial licensing system and an encouragement of foreign trade .
However , instead of freeing the economy from government control , Mrs Gandhi instead further increased the stranglehold of the state , which caused ( as might have been expected ) gross inefficiency and corruption .
Although the economy was finally liberalised in 1991 , two decades had been lost to ideological dogma and personal expediency .
Great patriot , but deeply flawed democrat - that is how history should remember Indira Gandhi , prime minister of India from 1966 to 1977 and again from 1980 to 1984 .

Richmond police have arrested a second suspect in connection with the two - hour gang rape of a semiconscious 15 - year - old outside her homecoming dance at Richmond High , authorities said Monday night .
Police arrested and booked a 15 - year - old student from Richmond High for felony sexual assault and are continuing to actively search for other suspects — both juveniles and adults — through the night , Detective Ken Greco said .
The boy ’s name and grade level were not released .
The suspect was one of two students in custody for questioning early Monday evening , Greco said .
Authorities have already arrested 19 - year - old Manuel Ortega as he ran from the crime scene , police say .
Authorities said people took photos , laughed and some joined in as the girl was repeatedly assaulted .
The victim , a student , remained hospitalized Monday with injuries that were not life - threatening .
“ She was raped , beaten , robbed and dehumanized by several suspects who were obviously OK enough with it to behave that way in each other ’s presence , ” said Lt. Mark Gagan , a patrol supervisor in the city ’s Northern Policing District .
“ What makes it even more disturbing is the presence of others .
People came by , saw what was happening , and failed to report it . ”
Ortega remained at Contra Costa County Jail in Martinez on Monday , booked on suspicion of rape and robbery .
Detectives believe as many as six other men raped the girl as she lay semiconscious on a courtyard bench , also beating her , taking pictures and stealing her jewelry .
No one called police until word of the ongoing rape spread to a house party in the city ’s North and East neighborhood , where an appalled partygoer felt obligated to phone in the rumor .
“ That ’s just wrong , ” senior class President Gina Saechao , who helped organize the dance , said Monday .
“ What if it was your little sister ?
What if it was your mom ? ”
Officers broke it up , and found the victim semiconscious and obviously hurt .
Paramedics flew her to a regional trauma center in critical condition ; she stabilized overnight .
This newspaper does not name victims of sexual assault without their consent .
The girl attended the dance , held in the gym from 7 to 11 p.m. Saturday .
About 400 students attended , with three administrators and four police officers both inside and watching the surrounding parking lot and street .
“ Obviously we ’ve had some breakdowns .
Obviously , it was not safe because this happened , ” said Charles Ramsey , a West Contra Costa school district board member .
“ Should we have had higher awareness , should we have been more vigilant ?
Probably . ”
Police say the victim left alone about 9:30 p.m. and walked north on 23rd Street , expecting to catch a ride from her father .
Instead , a schoolmate caught her attention from behind a cyclone fence on the north end of campus .
He invited her to join a group drinking and hanging out in a secluded courtyard behind the fence , Gagan said , and escorted her down Emeric Avenue to a short gate from which they made their way back to the group .
The assault began after the girl quickly drank a large amount of hard alcohol and fell over , Gagan said .
Detectives spent the rest of the weekend trying to identify the various participants , some of whom arrived after the gang rape began .
The courtyard is pitch - black at night , making it difficult to see into it from 23rd .
“ ( Lighting ) is an ongoing issue for all our sites , ” school district spokesman Marin Trujillo said .
“ That particular section does have lighting .
Could it be better ?
That ’s something we ’re always reviewing . ”
The school district plans to install surveillance cameras by January at the campus , a project long in the works .
Plans for new fencing have been in the works since March .
“ It ’s unfortunate that we were n’t able to have this finalized a little bit sooner , ” Ramsey said .
“ But we ’ve been on top of this issue ( safety ) .
Our board is working very proactively to make sure we stay on top of the issue . ”

For years , the battle between the open source movement and Microsoft bordered on religious warfare .
The two sides fired increasingly aggressive shots at one another – from the software goliath 's boss , Steve Ballmer , calling open source " a cancer " , to the man behind Linux , Linus Torvalds , suggesting that he might " destroy Microsoft " without even trying .
It was a conflict that looked like it could continue for generations .
But now , according to one leading voice , the arguments are settled – and the opposition posed by Bill Gates , Ballmer and their followers is untenable .
" If I look at it with some perspective , I think that they are fighting a rearguard action , " says the investor , philanthropist and campaigner Mitch Kapor .
" The battle is over . "
He continues : " At the detailed level , there are a million issues to work out – but will open source kill software ?
Nobody 's saying that . "
That may come as news to some who have resisted the open source movement – as recently as last year , Gates claimed that the fundamentals of the open source philosophy meant that " nobody can ever improve the software " – but Kapor has more experience than most of those who have stepped into the fight .
Resistance is futile
At the time , Kapor helped to convince AOL that it should jettison the Netscape browser it had bought and turn Mozilla into a separate non-profit operation .
Indeed , he invested $ 300,000 of his own money in the push to create a viable , open alternative to Microsoft 's massively dominant ( and heavily criticised ) Internet Explorer browser .
Since it launched in 2004 , Firefox has chipped away at Internet Explorer 's market share and established itself as the world 's second most popular browser .
But while attacks on open source still make Kapor 's blood boil , he suggests that the bigger picture indicates that resistance is futile .
" What 's remarkable is that nobody remarks on it , because a few years ago people were virtually pulling out their guns to shoot at each other – and now it 's a settled matter , as I read it . "
While Firefox is widely regarded as a huge success , Kapor warns that it is not actually the best example of the victory of open source .
Instead , he suggests , the movement 's main achievement actually lies out of sight – amid the systems that underpin the web itself .
" I tell people that the history of Mozilla and Firefox is so one of a kind that it should not be used – ever – as an example of what 's possible , " he says .
" The accomplishment of open source is that it is the back end of the web , the invisible part , the part that you do n't see as a user . "
" All of the servers , pretty much , they run Linux as the operating system ; they run Apache as the basic web server on top of which everything else is built .
The main languages out of which web applications are built – whether it 's Perl or Python or PHP or any of the other languages – those are all open source languages .
So the infrastructure of the web is open source ... the web as we know it is completely dependent on open source . "
The reliance goes both ways , he suggests , meaning that the web and the open source community are interdependent .
While developers and dotcom companies have turned in large part towards open source technologies to build the future of communication , it is the web itself that has made such an approach possible .
The sort of large - scale , highly distributed teams that are the hallmark of such development – teams of coders spread out around disparate parts of the world – rely on websites to share code , discuss ideas and meet each other .
What started as a marriage of convenience has now turned into a symbiotic relationship .
" Without the internet and the web , no open source – without open source , no internet or web , " he says .
" So they co-create each other . "
The reasons for this shift from a fringe ideology that could spark warfare among programmers to an accepted , everyday part of hi-tech life are complex .
But Kapor puts at least part of it down to an important evolution in the underlying philosophies that emerged , appropriately enough , with Mozilla back in 1998 .
After Firefox 's predecessor , Netscape Navigator , was crushed by Microsoft , its owners decided to release the source code , which became the Mozilla browser .
Kapor gives credit to those who originated and then developed the concepts that led to such acts , including free software campaigner Richard Stallman and Torvalds .
Their influence and ideas helped build and then reshape the idea of free and open software development , taking it from its doctrinaire beginnings through to something that was more palatable for commercial companies .
" If the rules of the game that were established by Stallman about free software – which were commercially unfriendly – had not evolved , we would n't have Firefox and we would n't have the web , " Kapor says .
" But the culture evolved to be less restrictive and more permissive – the idea of open source licences that permit but do n't require new contributions , additions to be made available to everybody . "
Declining empires
While there is no guarantee that they will stick to those ideals in the long term , Kapor is now optimistic that the movement will have more staying power than whichever company happens to be the flavour of the month .
" I 've been around long enough to know that empires come and empires go , and I can't tell how long the Google empire is going to last – but I 'm pretty convinced that the answer is less than forever .
" Microsoft still has a big empire , but when Steve Ballmer thinks a new thought , the world does n't tremble the way it used to when Bill Gates had a new thought , " he says .
" That day is over , and it will be over for Google .
Facebook may be the next , or Twitter or somebody you have n't heard of , but empires come and empires go . "

President Uribe 's deal with the US has caused concern in the region
Colombian opposition groups have reacted angrily after details of a controversial military deal with the US were made public .
Under the 10 - year deal , the US military will not only have access to military bases , but also be able to use major international civilian airports .
US personnel and defence contractors will also enjoy diplomatic immunity .
President Alvaro Uribe says the agreement will help rid Colombia of drugs gangs and left - wing rebel groups .
But leading opposition senator Gustavo Petro , of the left - wing PDA party , said the deal amounted to a virtual US occupation of Colombia .
The accord was signed last Friday but full details were only made public on Tuesday .
They reveal that the US military will have access to seven Colombian army , navy and air force bases and also be able to use civilian airports under conditions that have still not been made clear .
Colombia 's military commander , Gen Freddy Padilla , was quoted by national media as saying that the benefits of the agreement will be felt throughout the country as the US conducts anti-drug and anti-terrorist missions .
The deal has led to a worsening of already strained ties between Colombia and Venezuela .
Venezuela has broken off diplomatic relations with Bogota and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has warned that Colombian military bases could be used by the US to attack his country .
Other countries in the region , including Brazil and Chile , have also expressed concern .
The BBC's Jeremy McDermott , in Colombia , says Colombia is increasingly isolated in the region , but does not seem to care , just so long as it has US support .

The fossilised skull of a colossal " sea monster " has been unearthed along the UK's Jurassic Coast .
The ferocious predator , which is called a pliosaur , terrorised the oceans 150 million years ago .
The skull is 2.4 m long , and experts say it could belong to one of the largest pliosaurs ever found : measuring up to 16 m in length .
The fossil , which was found by a local collector , has been purchased by Dorset County Council .
It was bought with money from the Heritage Lottery Fund , and it will now be scientifically analysed , prepared and then put on public display at Dorset County Museum .
Palaeontologist Richard Forrest told the BBC : " I had heard rumours that something big was turning up .
But seeing this thing in the flesh , so to speak , is just jaw dropping .
It is simply enormous . "
Pliosaurs were a form of plesiosaur , a group of giant aquatic reptiles that dominated the seas around the same time that dinosaurs roamed the Earth .
They had short necks and huge , crocodilian - like heads that contained immensely powerful jaws and a set of huge , razor - sharp teeth .
These creatures were monsters
Dr David Martill , University of Portsmouth
Using four paddle - like limbs to propel their bulky bodies through the water , they made easy work of passing prey such as dolphin - like ichthyosaurs and even other plesiosaurs .
David Martill , a palaeontologist from the University of Portsmouth , said : " These creatures were monsters .
" They had massive big muscles on their necks , and you would have imagined that they would bite into the animal and get a good grip , and then with these massive neck muscles they probably would have thrashed the animals around and torn chunks off .
" It would have been a bit of a blood bath . "
Big contender Experts think this latest discovery could represent one of the largest pliosaurs ever found .
Dr Martill said : " This thing is absolutely enormous .
When I saw it , it really just hit me how big it was . "
It could have taken a human in one gulp
Richard Forrest
The fossil comprises a lower jaw and upper skull .
And based on their length of 2.4 m ( 7.9 ft ) , it is estimated that the creature would have measured between 10 and 16 m ( 33 - 52 ft ) from tip to tail , and would have weighed in at a hefty 7 - 12 tonnes .
This means it could rival recent finds made in Svalbard , where beasts dubbed " The Monster " and " Predator X " were thought to have measured 15 m - long ( 49 ft ) , and in Mexico , where the " Monster of Aramberri " was discovered in 2002 , and is believed to have been of similar dimensions .
Dr Martill added : " We only have the head , so you can not be absolutely precise .
" But it may be vying with the ones found in Svalbard and Mexico for the title of the world 's largest . "
The specimen is still in its rocky , unprepared form , but it is clear that it has been remarkably well preserved .
Meet ' The Monster ' Richard Forrest , a plesiosaur expert , said : " Pliosaur skulls are very big , but not that robust , in general , and you tend to find them crushed flat - completely ' pancaked ' .
" What is fantastic about this new skull , not only is it absolutely enormous , but it is pretty much in 3D and not much distorted . "
He added : " You have this wonderful lower jaw - and you can just see from the depth and the thickness that this was immensely strong .
" It could have taken a human in one gulp ; in fact , something like a T .
Rex would have been breakfast for a beast like this . "
Geological treasure trove
The fossil was discovered by a local collector along the Jurassic Coast , a 150 km ( 95 mile ) stretch of coastline covering Dorset and East Devon that spans 185 million years of geological history .
The exact location of the find is not being revealed , as Dorset County Council does not want to encourage people to head to the spot .
The area is unstable and prone to rock falls and landslides .
Richard Edmonds , Dorset County Council 's earth science manager for the Jurassic Coast , said : " This part of the coastline is eroding really rapidly and that means the fossils that are trapped and buried are constantly tumbling out on to the beach .
FOSSIL HUNTING ADVICE
Safest place to hunt for fossils is the beach , not cliffs Cliffs are prone to rock falls and landslides
If you find something important , take it to a local museum " The collector was lucky enough to come along on the day a large piece fell out of the cliff , and that gave him the clue to keep on looking .
He spent the next four years coming back day after day , and as a result he has uncovered this absolutely incredible fossil .
" It was an amazing effort . "
Dr Edmonds believes that the rest of the giant may still be entombed in the rock , but it could take decades for it to emerge .
He said : " The ground is dipping very steeply , and as it is such a huge specimen it will be buried beneath layer - upon - layer of rock , so we will have to patiently wait for the next big landslide . "
Using Heritage Lottery Funds , Dorset County Council has now purchased the fossil for £ 20,000 .
David Tucker , the County 's museums advisor , said : " Our aim is to purchase fossils found along the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and to get them into local museums - we want to put really exceptional fossils in museums . "
The council is now meeting with experts to discuss how best to study and prepare the fossil .
Scientists say it will provide a fantastic opportunity , which could reveal a wealth of information about these giants of the seas , and the ancient world they once inhabited .

Washington attorney Kenneth Feinberg has been actively reviewing pay plans for the top 25 highest - paid employees at the seven biggest bailout firms as the Obama administration 's pay czar .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Obama administration will soon order the nation 's biggest bailed - out companies to drastically cut the pay packages of 175 top executives , a senior administration official confirmed to CNN Wednesday .
Kenneth Feinberg , who was named the White House 's pay czar in June , will demand that each of the seven largest bailout recipients lower the total compensation for their top 25 highest paid employees by 50 % , on average , the official told CNN .
For the past two months , Feinberg has been reviewing pay plans at Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , General Motors , Chrysler , GMAC and Chrysler Financial in an effort to put these firms in a position to pay back bailout money as soon as possible .
Under the plan , which is expected to be officially released by the Treasury Department next week , annual salaries for executives at those seven firms are expected to fall 90 % , on average , the official said .
Another source in the Treasury Department told CNN that Feinberg is " trying to strike the balance " between protecting taxpayers and allowing companies to have the ability to " grow their way out of TARP . "
Some compensation experts have worried that the firms that have received the most bailout funds could wind up losing top talent to companies that have already paid back the government and are not subject to Feinberg 's pay restrictions , such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs .
According to other reports , the plan will come down particularly harsh on embattled insurer AIG .
Within AIG 's controversial Financial Products division , the unit that led to the company 's near collapse , no employee is expected to receive more than $ 200,000 in total compensation , several reports indicated .
The Wall Street Journal also reported Feinberg is expected to demand a series of governance changes at the seven firms -- including splitting the role of chief executive officer and chairman .
The Treasury Department had no comment .
AIG , Bank of America , Chrysler Financial and GM also declined to comment .
Chrysler , Citigroup and GMAC were not immediately available for comment .
But the moves by Feinberg should not come as a major surprise .
Last week , outgoing Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis said he would not accept a salary or bonus for 2009 , and the bank said the decision came after Feinberg " suggested " it to Lewis .
Lewis ' decision followed an uproar over indications that he is poised to walk away with a minimum of $ 53 million in pension benefits after he retires .
Lewis ' cash salary has been $ 1.5 million annually since he took over as CEO in 2001 .
But he actually made $ 63 million in pay and perks over the past three years , according to filings -- including almost $ 10 million last year .
Other high - profile CEOs have also taken it upon themselves to act before the government did .
Citigroup chief Vikram Pandit , for example , declared earlier this year that he would accept pay of just $ 1 a year and no bonus until his firm returned to profitability .
Just a year ago , Pandit took home $ 10.8 million in salary , stock and options .

Dera Ismail Khan , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
They come trudging up a dirt path in single file , towards a white cricket stadium in the middle of this dusty provincial town .
Pakistanis forced to flee their homes after the mountainous border region of South Waziristan once again became the site of fierce fighting between the Pakistani military and the Taliban .
Some , like a spectacled teacher name Amanullah , spent four days traveling on foot with his family of seven .
He says they fled the daily bombardment of their village .
" Everything is damaged ... everything is lost , " he says , in broken English .
" Very large bombing .
We are running . "
The Pakistani army estimates more then 160,000 civilians have fled the region , more then half of the population of South Waziristan .
The army is running the aid operation here in the neighboring region of Dera Ismail Khan .
Workers distribute food , sleeping mats , tents , buckets and cash hand - outs equaling about $ 60 a month per family .
In a single day , they have doled out assistance to more then 1,300 families .
It is a heavily - guarded operation that is strictly controlled by the military , the same military whose offensive against the Taliban forced these people to flee their homes .
Soldiers with machine guns defend the walls of the stadium .
Confused and traumatized civilians clutching ration cards file past armed men in uniform .
International aid organizations and foreign journalists have been banned from operating anywhere near this conflict zone .
The only way outsiders can legally get a glimpse of what is happening here , is with a military escort .
" The problem of not getting the international community actively involved in this area is the security concern , " said Lt. Gen. Nadeem Ahmed , the commander in charge of the relief effort here .
" God forbid if something happens to an international [ aid worker ] .
It dents the image of the country .
It puts the entire relief operation on hold . "
The displaced people here offer outsiders a glimpse of life in the conflict zone .
" The government is bombing us with jet planes .
And the army fires its artillery .
And the shelling continues day and night .
The poor people are dying , " says Faizel Khaliq , a black - bearded man who fled the village of Makin with 25 family members .
" There was only one road to escape .
It was a dirt track . "
Some of the escapees said they had seen civilians killed after they were caught in the crossfire .
But no one was willing to talk about the militants and their foreign fighter allies who , by some accounts , had turned South Waziristan into a virtual Taliban mini-state .
When asked about the militants , men laughed , hid their heads in their hands , or simply refused to talk .
The teacher , Amanullah , says the civilians have been caught between two armed enemies , the army and the Taliban .
" People between two sides , " he says .
" Crushed . "
International aid organizations are calling for the Pakistani authorities to provide more outside access to the conflict zone .
" If we 're not allowed to get in there it means very little humanitarian aid can reach the population , " says Sebastian Brack , the spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Islamabad .
For many of the displaced people , this is the third time they have been forced to flee their homes in recent years .
The army launched previous offensives against the Taliban in South Waziristan in 2004 and 2007 .
Nadeem says this time , the operation is different .
He insists that after waves of deadly militant suicide bombings , the military now has the public support to finish the job .
And he says this time , the military is offering humanitarian assistance to the civilian population , even as its forces pound suspected militant hide - outs .
" By virtue of running an equally effective humanitarian operation , " Nadeem argues , " there is every possibility for you to win the hearts and minds of the people . "
The general predicts the citizens of South Waziristan probably wo n't be able to return home until at least March 2010 .
That is little consolation to the Pakistanis who leave the stadium , clutching donated plastic buckets and wheelbarrows full of food , who now face an uncertain future after being forced to abandon their homes .
Britain 's soaring population on course to hit 74million
Britain 's population may grow to 74 million over the next 20 years , according to official estimates .
The Office for National Statistics said that if immigration continues at high levels the population will swell by more than a fifth - some 12 million - in two decades .
And according to calculations of the highest likely scale of future population growth published yesterday , numbers will reach the 70 million mark in 2023 , six years earlier than otherwise expected .
The projection from the ONS follows a pledge by Gordon Brown last week that numbers in the country will not hit 70 million in the next 20 years .
Ministers say new immigration curbs will ensure the record migration levels of the last five years are cut back .
Last month the ONS said the most likely date for the 70 million level to be reached is 2029 .
Growth forecast :
The population will swell by more than 12 million - in two decades if immigration continues at the current rate
The 74 million estimate was based on what will happen if immigration continues at the highest levels seen in recent years , if birthrates among new migrants are maintained , and if the life expectancy of Britons keeps rising .
A spokesman for the ONS said the high - level population projection was calculated from ' alternative , but still plausible , assumptions ' .
It said numbers in the UK , currently thought to be just under 62 million , will rise at a rate of more than half a million every year , reaching 70 million in 2023 and 73.8 million in 2029 .
The high - end projections suggest the 100 million mark would be reached in 2071 - a level which would be double the 50 million population of 1950 .
At the other end of the scale of possible future immigration , the ONS low - end projections said the population may be under 67 million in 2029 .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's pledge reported in last Thursday 's Daily Mail
That estimate relies on net immigration into Britain - the number coming to live in this country minus the number of those leaving - levelling out at 120,000 a year .
By contrast , the ONS high - end estimates assume future net immigration will be 240,000 a year , approximately the level seen in 2004 and 2007 .
Sir Andrew Green of the Migrationwatch think - tank said : ' What this report shows is that it is most likely that the population will reach 70 million as early as 2029 , and the variants suggest that point could be reached much earlier .
' All the projections show that the population will climb far into the future unless very tough measures are taken to cut back the massive levels of immigration that Labour has permitted , even encouraged . '
Immigration minister Phil Woolas , who last year also pledged not to let the population exceed 70 million , said : ' The ONS have published projections , not forecasts , that clearly show that population growth is starting to slow down .
' This is proof that the radical reforms we have made to the immigration system over the last two years are working .
Last year saw a 44 per cent fall in net migration and we expect that fall to be sustained and reflected in future projections . '
Washington , DC , November 2 , 2009 - As Vice President Biden and other high - ranking U.S. officials contemplate a policy of compromise with the Taliban in order to induce them to turn against al - Qaeda , a new article published today on the Web site of Foreign Affairs magazine by the National Security Archive 's Barbara Elias outlines why this approach may be unrealistic .
Drawing on declassified documents and invoking lessons of recent history , Elias , who directs the National Security Archive 's project on Afghanistan , Pakistan and the Taliban , notes how " Secretary of Defense [ Robert ] McNamara warned us of the central importance of knowing the enemy . "
" We must not ascribe our own logic , mindsets or worldview to the Taliban , " Elias writes .
The problem the Obama administration faces , the article argues , is that " the Taliban and al - Qaeda are neither inextricably linked by ideology nor held together merely by fleeting correspondence of interests .
Their relationship is rooted in more complex issues of legitimacy and identity .
The Taliban cannot surrender bin Laden without also surrendering their existing identity as a vessel for an obdurate and uncompromising version of political Islam .
Their legitimacy rests not on their governing skills , popular support , or control over territory , but on their claim to represent what they perceive as Shari 'a rule .
This means upholding the image that they are guided entirely by Islamic principles ; as such , they cannot make concessions to , or negotiate with , secular states . "
In other words , according to Elias , " the Taliban is not a state , and we should not expect it to act like one . "
The Archive 's project on Afghanistan , Pakistan and the Taliban has filed hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests for documents on the region and historical U.S. government approaches toward it .
Many of these materials are posted on the Archive 's Web site at www.nsarchive.org.

Angstrom Magnesium is one of the most important minerals in maintaining health .
Magnesium supplements help the cell and seem to stabilize it .
Dietary Magnesium calms your body at a metabolic level .
There are four minerals that work in harmony with each other in the nerves and muscles and in the processes of regulating the blood pressure , bone building and more .
They are magnesium , calcium , sodium and potassium .
In order for the nerves and muscles to work properly , these four minerals must be present .
Without these four , you may experience bone loss .
If you do n't have proper magnesium when you exercise , your muscles will begin to cramp .
If you consume these minerals in proper levels , you may feel younger , lose weight , and see blood pressure fall .
Magnesium is necessary to transfer energy from protein to allow the muscle to contract .
Magnesium also helps keep blood pressure down .
Studies have shown that the over all population is experiencing a raise in blood pressure due to lack of magnesium .
In trying to get enough magnesium , it is so important to get the right magnesium .
It is important to distinguish between the element magnesium and the compound magnesia .
Magnesia causes diarrhea whereas magnesium helps in the maintenance of healthy bones , ligaments , and hormonal regulation .
Magnesium combats acids , toxins , gases and impurities .
Why is magnesium a " Moving Mineral " ?
Dietary Magnesium is a natural laxative and may help the bowels move . ( not a chunk off of your old magnesium tire rim )
When ever you take other minerals such as calcium which are constipating , you may want to add magnesium to balance the effects of calcium .
Taking chemical laxatives can actually harm the body and strip it of the natural flow of digestion .
Magnesium is mild , but used in excess can have a cleansing effect .
Magnesium has soothing properties that may help induce restful sleep .
In addition , it calms nerves , makes the body more flexible - especially in muscles , nerves , ligaments , tissues , joints and tendons .
Read What Dr Carolyn Dean MD ND , has to say about magnesium .
" ...... Magnesium is one of those super - safe minerals that you can take without fear of build up or side effects .
There are people who should n't take magnesium - those with bowel blockage , heart block , on dialysis , or myasthenia gravis .
Even so , I 've counseled clients on dialysis and with myasthenia gravis who 've taken angstrom magnesium with no ill effects ..... "
A little Piece of Truth !
Who 's in Charge ?
All the organs of the body were having a meeting , trying to decide who was the one in charge .
" I should be in charge , " said the brain , " Because I run all the body 's systems , so without me nothing would happen . "
" I should be in charge , " said the blood , " Because I circulate oxygen all over so without me you 'd all waste away . "
" I should be in charge , " said the stomach , " Because I process food and give all of you energy . "
" I should be in charge , " said the legs " Because I carry the body wherever it needs to go . "
" I should be in charge , " said the eyes , " Because I allow the body to see where it goes . "
" I should be in charge , " said the rectum , " Because I 'm responsible for waste removal . "
All the other body parts laughed at the rectum and insulted him , so in a huff , he shut down tight .
Within a few days , the brain had a terrible headache , the stomach was bloated , the legs got wobbly , the eyes got watery , and the blood was toxic .
They all decided that the rectum should be the boss .
IF YOUR BOWELS DO NOT MOVE DAILY ,
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM !
In 1997 , the National Academy of Sciences established a set of Dietary Reference Intakes ( DRIs ) for magnesium that included age and gender specific Recommended Dietary Allowances ( RDAs ) for magnesium .
Note that the recommendation for infants from 0 - 12 months of age is an Adequate Intake ( AI ) recommendation rather than an RDA .
The AIs and RDAs are as follows : 0 - 6 months : 30 mg 7 - 12 months : 75 mg 1 - 3 years : 80 mg 9- 13 years : 240 mg 14 - 18 years , female : 360 mg 14 - 18 years , male : 360 mg 19 - 30 years , female : 310 mg 19 - 30 years , male : 400 mg 31 + years , female : 320 mg 31 + years , male : 400 mg Pregnant women , 14 - 18 years : 400 mg Pregnant women , 19 - 30 years : 350 mg Pregnant women , 31 - 50 years : 360 mg Lactating women , 14 - 18 years : 360 mg Lactating women , 19 - 30 years : 310 mg Lactating women , 31 - 30 years : 320 mg
But in today ’s vicious news cycle , lies take on lives of their own on Web sites , blogs and e-mail chains and go viral in seconds .
Ms. McCaughey ’s claims were soon widely circulated in the thirst for ammunition against the Democrats ’ health care reform plan .
“ Mandatory counseling for all seniors at a minimum of every five years , more often if the seasoned citizen is sick or in a nursing home , ” was how Rush Limbaugh described the provision a week later .
“ We ca n’t have counseling for mothers who are thinking of terminating their pregnancy , but we can go in there and counsel people about to die , ” he added .
Two days later , the lie found its way into Republican politicians ’ statements .
“ This provision may start us down a treacherous path toward government - encouraged euthanasia if enacted into law , ” declared the House Republican leader , John Boehner of Ohio , and Thaddeus McCotter of Michigan .
I was shocked .
This really struck at the heart of what I was trying to do  to build consensus .
Still , nothing could prepare me for what came next .
As luck would have it , on July 28 I was presiding over the House of Representatives when my Republican colleagues decided to have a filibuster of one - minute speeches attacking the Democratic health care reform proposals , or rather , the proposals as seen through their skewed vision .
Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina made the singularly outrageous claim that the Republican version of health care reform “ is pro-life because it will not put seniors in a position of being put to death by their government . ”
More groups and politicians repeated and exaggerated the claims .
The most bizarre moment came on Aug. 7 when Sarah Palin used the term “ death panels ” on her Facebook page .
She wrote : “ The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama ’s ‘ death panel ’ so his bureaucrats can decide , based on a subjective judgment of their ‘ level of productivity in society , ’ whether they are worthy of health care .
Such a system is downright evil . ”
There is , of course , nothing even remotely like this in the bill , yet other politicians joined the death panel chorus .
On “ This Week With George Stephanopoulos , ” the former Republican House speaker , Newt Gingrich , refused an opportunity to set the record straight .
Instead , Mr. Gingrich noted “ the bill ’s 1,000 pages , ” as if the number of pages was an excuse for his misrepresentation , and then declared , “ You ’re asking us to trust turning power over to the government , when there clearly are people in America who believe in establishing euthanasia . ”
The Speaker Gingrich I served with a decade ago would have been appalled at the blatant and repeated falsehoods of the Newt Gingrich of 2009 .
Such behavior is a graphic example of how the issue of health care was hijacked .
Town hall meetings became dominated by people shouting down their opponents and yelling misinformation .
Some town hall participants even told politicians to keep government out of their Medicare  something that would be difficult to pull off since Medicare is a government program .
The molecular structures of pyrimidine and uracil .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- NASA scientists studying the origin of life have reproduced uracil , a key component of our hereditary material , in the laboratory .
NASA scientists studying the origin of life have reproduced uracil , a key component of our hereditary material , in the laboratory .
They discovered that an ice sample containing pyrimidine exposed to ultraviolet radiation under space - like conditions produces this essential ingredient of life .
Pyrimidine is a ring - shaped molecule made up of carbon and nitrogen and is the basic structure for uracil , part of a genetic code found in ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) .
RNA is central to protein synthesis , but has many other roles .
" We have demonstrated for the first time that we can make uracil , a component of RNA , non-biologically in a laboratory under conditions found in space , " said Michel Nuevo , research scientist at NASA 's Ames Research Center , Moffett Field , Calif .
" We are showing that these laboratory processes , which simulate occurrences in outer space , can make a fundamental building block used by living organisms on Earth . "
Nuevo is the lead author of a research paper titled “ Formation of Uracil from the Ultraviolet Photo - Irradiation of Pyrimidine in Pure Water Ices , ” Astrobiology vol. 9 no. 7 , published Oct. 1 , 2009 .
NASA
Ames scientists have been simulating the environments found in interstellar space and the outer solar system for years .
During this time , they have studied a class of carbon - rich compounds , called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , which have been identified in meteorites , and are the most common carbon - rich compound observed in the universe .
PAHs typically are six - carbon ringed structures that resemble fused hexagons , or a piece of chicken wire .
Pyrimidine also is found in meteorites , although scientists still do not know its origin .
It may be similar to the carbon - rich PAHs , in that it may be produced in the final outbursts of dying , giant red stars , or formed in dense clouds of interstellar gas and dust .
“ Molecules like pyrimidine have nitrogen atoms in their ring structures , which makes them somewhat whimpy .
As a less stable molecule , it is more susceptible to destruction by radiation , compared to its counterparts that do n’t have nitrogen , ” said Scott Sandford , a space science researcher at Ames .
“ We wanted to test whether pyrimidine can survive in space , and whether it can undergo reactions that turn it into more complicated organic species , such as the nucleobase uracil . ”

In theory , the researchers thought that if molecules of pyrimidine could survive long enough to migrate into interstellar dust clouds , they might be able to shield themselves from radiation destruction .
Once in the clouds , most molecules freeze onto dust grains ( much like moisture in your breath condenses on a cold window during winter ) .
These clouds are dense enough to screen out much of the surrounding outside radiation of space , thereby providing some protection to the molecules inside the clouds .
Scientists tested their hypotheses in the Ames Astrochemistry Laboratory .
During their experiment , they exposed the ice sample containing pyrimidine to ultraviolet radiation under space - like conditions , including a very high vacuum , extremely low temperatures ( approximately - 340 degrees Fahrenheit ) , and harsh radiation .
They found that when pyrimidine is frozen in water ice , it is much less vulnerable to destruction by radiation .
Instead of being destroyed , many of the molecules took on new forms , such as the RNA component uracil , which is found in the genetic make - up of all living organisms on Earth .
“ We are trying to address the mechanisms in space that are forming these molecules .
Considering what we produced in the laboratory , the chemistry of ice exposed to ultraviolet radiation may be an important linking step between what goes on in space and what fell to Earth early in its development , ” said Stefanie Milam , a researcher at NASA Ames and a co-author of the research paper .
“ Nobody really understands how life got started on Earth .
Our experiments demonstrate that once the Earth formed , many of the building blocks of life were likely present from the beginning .
Since we are simulating universal astrophysical conditions , the same is likely wherever planets are formed , ” explained Sandford .

In Mars exploration , of course , it 's the Red Planet itself that gets top billing .
But there are some good reasons to keep tabs on Phobos , the innermost and larger of Mars ' two diminutive moons , which the Russian space agency plans to study with a probe set for launch next month on board a Zenit rocket .
Called Phobos
Grunt , the three - year mission is to land a spacecraft on the distant moon , scoop up soil samples for analysis and launch one of them back to Earth for further inspection .
The probe 's name means " Phobos 's soil " in Russian .
If successful , Phobos Grunt would represent something of a coup for the Russian Federal Space Agency ( Roscosmos ) .
Russia has long struggled to reach Mars and has not carried out a successful interplanetary mission in decades .
The nation launched Mars 96 in 1996 to explore the Red Planet , but a rocket failure occurred in Earth orbit .
Phobos Grunt would also mark the first sample returned from a planetary surface since the U.S.S.R.'s Luna 24 in 1976 .
As moons go , Phobos is strange .
Shaped like a potato , it measures only 27 kilometers across at its widest point and orbits Mars at a distance of only about 6,000 kilometers .
Researchers think Phobos and its even smaller companion Deimos started out as asteroids that were gravitationally pulled into Mars 's orbit .
Space agencies would like to know whether the moons ' porous interiors harbor water that could be exploited by future visitors to Mars .
Russia attempted to reach Phobos before .
Computer glitches sidelined the Phobos 1 and 2 craft , both launched in July 1988 , before they could complete their missions .
Now , for the past several months , Phobos Grunt has been subject to rumors that Roscosmos would likely have to delay the launch until 2011 at the earliest , when the flight window opens again .
Such a delay could give researchers time to get their heads around a tantalizing add - on to the probe 's payload .
The Planetary Society , a California - based space exploration and advocacy group , working with the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences , has arranged for Phobos Grunt to carry with it the Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment ( LIFE ) , a group of samples of Earth life that will fly to Phobos and back in the Russian craft .
The goal , says Bruce Betts , the manager of the experiment for the Planetary Society , is to seek evidence for transpermia , the idea that life could have arisen on one body in the solar system and been transported via meteorites to seed life on another .
For example , he says , " Could life have evolved first on Mars , been ejected off Mars , and then come to Earth ? "
Although LIFE cannot test such a detailed scenario , Betts says the results will build on those of similar experiments flown on spacecraft .
Bacteria have survived in low Earth orbit for up to six years but have only rarely , and briefly , left the protection of Earth 's magnetosphere , which deflects the damaging cosmic rays that penetrate deep space .
( When Apollo 12 returned to Earth in 1969 with the camera from the unmanned Surveyor 3 lander , which had spent more than two years on the lunar surface , scientists found Streptococcus mitis , a possible stowaway from before the probe was launched .
But the bacterium 's provenance is unclear , and some suspect the camera was contaminated after its return to Earth . )
The LIFE organisms were chosen with this danger in mind .
Among the four bacteria to make the trip will be radiation - resistant Deinococcus radiodurans .
Tardigrades , microscopic , eight - limbed invertebrates also known as water bears , were selected for their ability to repair DNA damage .
Rounding out the group are three species of archaea — sometimes called " extremophiles " for their ability to thrive in conditions too harsh for other Earth life — along with yeast , plant seeds , and a soil sample collected from Israel 's Negev Desert .
Most of the samples will be freeze - dried and inert for the trip , to better resist the cold of space .
The LIFE menagerie will be packed in individual vials loaded into a titanium disc the width of a credit card .
Betts says the packaging has been tested for acceleration forces up to 4,000 g's , or 100 times the expected acceleration during sample return .
Still , some space scientists are scratching their heads why anyone would risk putting Earthly microorganisms anywhere near Mars in the first place , especially given the relatively modest scientific payoff .
" Meteorites are millions of years old — a three - year trip is really not relevant , " says Daniel Glavin , an astrobiologist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md .
Strange as it may sound , the experiment satisfies international prohibitions against contaminating Mars or other bodies that might support life , says Catharine Conley , NASA 's planetary protection officer .
Unlike its neighboring planet , airless Phobos is surely sterile , so as long as Roscosmos provides detailed flight information confirming that Phobos Grunt is expected to reach its target moon — a safe distance from Mars — the mission should be in the clear .
" It is an uncomfortable thing , " Conley says , " but we have policy .
We have good policy . "

PRAGUE 
As Pope Benedict XVI arrived in the Czech Republic on Saturday on a three - day pilgrimage aimed at battling against the forces of secularism , religious leaders warned that he faced a daunting challenge in a nation of mostly natural - born skeptics .
When the pope comes to town , a city usually pulls out all the stops .
Not so here in the Czech capital , where banners heralding the pope ’s visit and large crowds were conspicuously absent .
The local newspapers that highlighted the trip seemed more preoccupied with the pope ’s penchant for bright red loafers than with the substance of his religious mission .
“ If the pope wants to create a religious revival in Europe , there is no worse place he could come to than the Czech Republic , where no one believes in anything , ” said Jaroslav Plesl , a self - confessed lapsed Catholic who is deputy editor of Lidove Noviny , a leading daily newspaper here .
“ Add to that the fact that the pope is German and socially conservative and he might as well be an alien here . ”
Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Velvet Revolution that overthrew Communism in Czechoslovakia , the pope is visiting what many religious observers , unfairly or not , consider the ground zero of religious apathy in Europe .
Vatican officials said that he had chosen the Czech Republic for a mission central to his papacy : fomenting a continentwide spiritual revolt against what Benedict labeled Saturday as “ atheist ideology , ” “ hedonistic consumerism ” and “ a growing drift toward ethical and cultural relativism . ”

BBC Brasil , Para state
Logging and burning have left large areas of Para denuded Looking at the rolling fields and jungles of the Amazon , it is tempting to think that such a vast area has endless resources .
That is still the mindset for many who farm here .
But the average productivity of the land used for cattle farming in the Amazon is less than one head per hectare ( 2.5 acres ) .
Using already deforested land more efficiently and creating a sustainable forest economy are seen as key for the region , which faces the challenge of combining development and conservation .
" Have no doubt that the environment is a major concern of the farmers in the Amazon today , " says Diogo Naves , vice - president of the farming federation in the Brazilian state of Para .
" But to produce sustainably we need to be partners of the government and of society and not to be only the ones accused of destroying the jungle . "
Sandy soil Para was the main destination for migrants and investors who flocked to the Amazon on government settlement programmes , mostly from the 1960s to the 1980s .
It 's cheaper to open up the forest for fresh land than to recover pastures - this is the mindset that we need urgently to change

Land law debate heats up Indiscriminate logging and deforestation to make way for cattle made the south - eastern portion of this state the most devastated area of the Amazon .
The availability of cheap land in the Amazon meant farmers tended to abandon areas after a few years of production .
" It 's cheaper to open up the forest for fresh land than to recover pastures , " says Paulo Barreto , senior researcher at a non-governmental organisation , the Amazon Institute for Mankind and the Environment ( Imazon ) .
" This is the mindset that we need urgently to change . "
One major problem is that the Amazon soil is actually sandy and rather poor .
The vegetation is lush only because it feeds itself with all the organic matter provided by dead plants and animals .
Once this cycle is broken by agriculture , the soil turns to sand in a few years and farmers burn another bit of forest .
' Slow change '
This is the technique Indians used for centuries in the jungle , but not on the industrial scale of today .
" The change is slow , but it 's coming , " says farmer Mauro Lucio Costa .
Mauro Lucio Costa says more farmers are trying to practice sustainability Still an exception in the Amazon , his 4,500 hectare ( 11,000 acre ) farm boasts productivity some four times higher than the Amazon average , while retaining 80 % of the native forest on the land .
Mr Costa says that when he started to develop sustainable practices in his farm - such as reforesting and researching better varieties of pasture - other farmers said he was " crazy " for investing in technology in a sector dominated by intensive farming .
" But that was almost 10 years ago , " he says .
" Fortunately today I see more and more farmers adhering to these principles , but it will take some time for this to be felt in practical terms . "
Pepper loss Farmers say they desperately need credit if they are to modernise their production processes .
The situation is even more dramatic among the small landowners who usually do not have any capital for investment .
" Three years ago the banks said we should invest in producing black pepper because there was some problem with the plantations in Asia and there would be a huge increase in demand , " says Marusan Moreira .
" I took a loan and planted a lot of pepper but then the price dropped and the bank did not want to give me more money to hold on . "
Marusan Moreira tried planting pepper , but prices dropped Mr Moreira says he had to sell the few cattle he owned to stick with the pepper , trusting that the prices would go up again .
" But they did n't and now I have nothing .
I had to stop working because the more I produced , the more I lost , " he said .
Now Mr Moreira needs to register his land under a new government scheme to grant ownership rights to people who have occupied land in the Amazon to get access to credit facilities .
However , environmentalists fear that giving more money without the proper safeguards could lead to more destruction of the jungle .
Patricia Baiao , Amazon programme director for Conservation International , an NGO , says that the region needs " a customised model " of economic development .
" Sustainable extraction of wood and collection of forest goods for cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries are the kind of activities that could get incentives , " she says .
Recycling wood A group of carpenters in the city of Rondon do Para - listed by the Brazilian government among the 15 most deforested areas in the Amazon - have set such an example , using leftovers from the region 's saw mills for their furniture .
Usually wood buyers are very strict about what they want from the mills .
Any little imperfection in a piece of wood - a spot or a vein in another colour - is enough for it to be discarded for use as charcoal .
Gilberto Fernandes makes furniture from rejected cuts of wood " I found out that thousands of these little pieces of wood were discarded by a big company that buys this material to produce for cutlery handles , " says carpenter Gilberto Fernandes .
Now he uses them to produce furniture in his backyard carpentry but bureaucracy is a problem .
" I have not yet managed to properly register my company with the government to be able to send my furniture to other states .
This is what would allow me to really develop my business . "
Readjusting Quite a few farmers who have devastated the jungle for decades - be it for wood or for opening up new spaces - are now trying to come up with sustainable activities .
Please turn on JavaScript .

One is American John Weaver Davis Junior , who came with his missionary father from Texas in the early 1960s to establish a farm and agricultural mission in Brazil .
Mr Davis 's father , who was killed in a land dispute a few years after arriving in Brazil , sought out markets for Brazilian hardwood in Europe and the US .
After decades of wood extraction , less than half of the property - originally 100,000 hectares ( 250,000 acres ) is still covered by jungle .
" We do n't regret anything because that is what we had to do to sustain our family and it was a viable activity in its time , " says Mr Davis .
Now he says it is time to focus on the forest and is trying to get public financing to grow the fibre rich curaua plant .
" This is a traditional plant whose fibres the Indians have always used for hammocks , clothes and bow strings , " he says .
" Now we know it can replace fibreglass in many industrial applications .
And the most important thing is that this is a plant that asks for a forest because in the shade it grows much better . "

Former Clinton aide Paul Begala does n't think very highly of Joe Lieberman , or the Connecticut Independent 's announcement he 'd side with Republicans in filibustering a final health care cloture vote .
Begala , writing a Daily Beast column titled " Traitor Joe " :
It 's journalistic shorthand to note a politician 's party identification and state after his or her name .
For example : Jane Doe ( D - NY ) .
And so Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman is identified as ( I - CT ) .
But the “ I ” does not stand for " Independent . "
It stands for " Insurance Industry . "
Lieberman says he will join a Republican filibuster against President Obama 's health - insurance reforms .
You could see this coming from a mile away — actually from 15 years away .
In 1993 and 94 , Lieberman consistently opposed President Clinton 's reform bill — which did not have a public option .
In case you 're keeping score at home , Lieberman will filibuster the Obama plan , which has a public option , and he opposed the Clinton reform plan , which did not .
Anything that protects consumers , it seems , is a bridge too far for Sen. Lieberman ...
What he says today is that President Obama is " trying to do too much at once . "
Too much at once ?
Too much at once ?
Why did n't that occur to Sen .
Lieberman when we were fighting a war in Afghanistan , and he was cheerleading for an invasion of Iraq ?
Too much at once ?
How about 4,351 dead American heroes who gave their lives in a war that Joe Lieberman did n't think was doing too much ?
Fort Hood , Texas ( CNN ) --
The suspect in last week 's deadly shooting spree at Fort Hood urged in 2007 that Muslims in the U.S.
Army be allowed to claim conscientious objector status when it comes to fighting other Muslims in war , a defense official said Tuesday .
Maj .
Nidal Malik Hasan also discussed religious aspects of Islam during a presentation at Walter Reed Army Medical Center as part of a final project for his residency tenure , said the official , who has knowledge of the investigation into Hasan .
" It 's getting harder and harder for Muslims in the service to morally justify being in a military that seems constantly engaged against fellow Muslims , " Hasan said , according to a slide show that The Washington Post said Hasan used in the June 2007 presentation .
" Muslims [ sic ] soldiers should not serve in any capacity that renders them at risk to hurting / killing believers unjustly , " a Hasan slide said , though he added that individual feelings " will vary ! "
Hasan is the only suspect in the shooting at the Fort Hood Army post in Texas on Thursday that left 13 people dead and 42 wounded .
Twelve of the dead were soldiers .
Hasan remains in intensive care at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio , Texas , after having been shot by a police officer .
Dr. Val Finnell , a former medical school classmate of Hasan's , described him as " a very outspoken opponent of the war " in the classroom and in public settings .
" He equated the war against terror with a war against Islam , " Finnell said .
He added that he was shocked by Thursday 's shooting .
" However , that said , given the things that Maj .
Hasan has said to me in the past and to other people , I am not surprised . "
Hasan 's comments came in what was supposed to be a medical seminar , The Washington Post reported , but instead he spoke to senior Army doctors about Islam .
Hasan , a psychiatrist , aimed to describe " religious conflicts that Muslims may have with the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , " according to the newspaper 's report .
The report is based on a slideshow that The Washington Post said Hasan used in the June 2007 presentation .
See the presentation and the Post 's report
In a statement issued Monday night , the FBI said its investigation " indicates that the alleged gunman acted alone and was not part of a broader terrorist plot . "
Hasan came under investigation for a time last year when his communications with radical cleric Anwar al - Awlaki were intercepted by terrorism investigators monitoring the cleric 's communications , a federal law enforcement official said .
An employee of the Defense Department 's Criminal Investigative Services , assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force , ultimately made the decision to drop the investigation after reviewing the intercepted communications and Hasan 's personnel files .
However , a senior defense department official said late Tuesday that the agency was not aware of any such communication .
" Contrary to reports we have seen in some news outlets , based on what we know now , neither the United States Army nor any other organization within the Department of Defense knew of Major Hasan 's contacts with any Muslim extremists , " the official said .
" Not until after the tragic shooting at Fort Hood last week were Major Hasan 's e-mail communications first brought to our attention by federal investigators . "
President Obama traveled to Fort Hood for a memorial service on Tuesday for the victims of the shooting .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Texas Gov. Rick Perry and other dignitaries also attended the service .
Read profiles of the shooting victims
Hasan , 39 , was wounded several times during the attack .
His ventilator was removed over the weekend , and he began talking afterward , hospital spokesman Dewey Mitchell said .
Federal agents attempted to interview Hasan on Sunday , but he refused to cooperate and asked for an attorney , according to senior investigative officials , who insisted they not be identified by name because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing federal investigation .
Hasan has retained a lawyer , ex-military judge and retired Army Col.
John Galligan , the attorney told CNN affiliate KXXV - TV .
" Like anybody that 's facing criminal charges in the military arena , he 's entitled to a defense counsel , " Galligan told the station .
Galligan said he had a 25 - minute conversation with Hasan , and the two did not talk much about the Fort Hood shooting .
" There 's still a lot to be done on the medical side , " Galligan said .
Hasan , a U.S. - born citizen of Palestinian descent , was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the Army in 1997 .
He was promoted to major in May and was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan sometime soon but had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military .
Hasan , a Muslim , also told his family that he had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of September 11 .
In August , he reported to police that his car was keyed and a bumper sticker that read " Allah is Love " was torn off .
A neighbor was charged with criminal mischief after that complaint .
Gabriel García Márquez 's seminal novel One Hundred Years of Solitude is the piece of writing that has most shaped world literature over the past 25 years , according to a survey of international writers .
Barack Obama 's memoir , Dreams from My Father , also makes an appearance on the list of favourite works chosen by fellow writers .
Indra Sinha , Blake Morrison , Amit Chaudhuri and 22 other authors were asked to pick the title that they felt had most influenced world writing over the past quarter - century .
The survey was conducted by the international literary magazine Wasafiri – meaning " cultural traveller " in Swahili – which celebrates its 25th anniversary today .
Márquez 's novel was the only book to be selected more than once .
It was chosen by three authors : Chika Unigwe , Sujata Bhatt and the Ghanaian writer Nii Ayikwei Parkes .
Parkes said : " [ It ] taught the west how to read a reality alternative to their own , which in turn opened the gates for other non-western writers like myself and other writers from Africa and Asia .
" Apart from the fact that it 's an amazing book , it taught western readers tolerance for other perspectives . "
Sinha picked Vladimir Nabokov 's Lolita " for Nabokov 's astonishing virtuoso performance , which has never been excelled " , and Morrison plumped for The Stories of Raymond Carver .
" No creative writing course would be complete without it , " he said .
" Thousands of young writers have been taught to pare their work to the bone , just as Carver was by his editor Gordon Lish – though nobody can match Carver 's genius for rhythm and nuance . "
Poetry made a strong showing on the list of 25 titles : Chaudhuri selected Elizabeth Bishop 's Collected Poems , which he first chanced upon in a Bombay library in the late 1970s .
" [ It ] has had an enormous , if subtle , impact on how we think of poetry and language today , " he said , calling it " a reminder that travel , exile , cosmopolitan irony , as well as a certain narrative of the self can be addressed just as well – if not better – through the means poetry has at hand ( economy , form , the image , and a kind of grace ) as they can by the novel or the essay . "
Daljit Nagra picked Seamus Heaney 's North " for its intensely lyrical and idiosyncratic focus on aesthetic resolutions to conflict " , while Elaine Feinstein selected Ted Hughes 's Birthday Letters , for creating " a new form of intimate poetry , quite different from Robert Lowell 's confessional verse " .
Salman Rushdie made the list twice , for The Satanic Verses and Midnight 's Children , while VS Naipaul was nominated for A House for Mr Biswas , Ben Okri for The Famished Road and JM Coetzee for Disgrace .
The Obama memoir , Dreams from My Father , was picked by Marina Warner for being " definitely the most influential book historically , but … also a work of literature too , beautifully written , and the product of deep , open - hearted reflection " .
Wasafiri 's editor , Susheila Nasta , said that in 1984 , when the magazine was launched , even the Nobel prize for literature had no African , Chinese or Caribbean writers on its list .
" Recently we 've had Nadine Gordimer , Wole Soyinka and so on .
There has been a big sea change , but there is still further to go , " she said .
The Wasafiri list :
1 Aminatta Forna : The Famished Road by Ben Okri
2 Amit Chaudhuri : Collected Poems by Elizabeth Bishop
3 Bernardine Evaristo : Staying Power : The History of Black People in Britain by Peter Fryer
4 Beverley Naidoo : Roll of Thunder , Hear My Cry by Mildred D Taylor

“ By measurement to knowledge ”
So , in part 1 we saw a few examples of the output from the Profiler window in Unity Pro .
If you have Pro , this built - in profiler can be incredibly useful in determining whether your code is taking up a significant amount of time , and if so , which scripts and functions in particular are responsible .
There are also other professional code profilers available for other development environments , such as Red Gate ’s “ ANTS ” which will literally give you a speed recording for every line of code in your project .
These types of tools are invaluable if you have the budget for them , but many do n’t have access to such tools , particularly beginners and budding indie developers .
However , all is not lost – it ’s actually possible to measure the speed of your own code within the code itself .
In a nutshell , you can achieve this by simply recording the time before and after the code is executed .
In practice there are a few more hurdles involved in getting sensible and useful recordings which I will talk through over the course of this post , however this is the fundamental concept – so the first thing you need to know is how to record time .
I ’m aware that my previous post attracted the attention of some non-Unity readers , I will try to make as much of this post relevant to all languages as possible , however it will remain largely Unity - centric !
Unity provides you with the Time class for dealing with time , and pretty much all languages have the equivalent of a “ current time ” system property .
In regular C# ( in or outside of Unity ) you can use DateTime .
Now .
Ticks , and in Flash ’s Actionscript , there ’s getTimer ( ) .
The concepts from here on are fairly simple so you should be able to adapt them to any language of your choice .
Before we get started though , it ’s important to know one thing about your time variable before you use it – whether it can return a changing value when called multiple times during the execution of a function .
In Unity , the most commonly used time properties , “ Time.deltaTime ” and “ Time.time ” do not update over the duration of a function .
Instead , they only get a new value each frame , and they keep that value until the entire frame has completed .
Because of this , they are useless for profiling code within a function !
For example , if we wanted to measure the contents of our Player ’s “ Update ( ) ” function , we might try something like this , where we record the time before and after the contents of the Update ( ) function , and compare the difference :
void Update ( ) { float startTime = Time.time ; // ( Some code here which you want to measure ) float endTime = Time.time ; float timeElapsed = ( endTime - startTime ) ; }
With the above example , startTime and endTime will always have the same value , because Unity ’s Time .
time does not change while the function is being executed – which is obviously no use at all because the measured time difference would always equal zero !
Instead however , you can use the lesser - known property on the same class : Time.realtimeSinceStartup .
This is very useful because not only does it update during the course of a function running , but it is also not affected by your current timescale setting , so it wo n’t be affected if you ’re using slow - motion or other time - stretching effects in your game .
If you ’re working in something other than Unity 3D , make sure your time function has this important feature !
So to make a measurement , we record the realtimeSinceStartup value before and after the code , and simply subtract the latter from the former like this :
void Update ( ) { float startTime = Time.realtimeSinceStartup ; // ( Some code here which you want to measure ) float endTime = Time.realtimeSinceStartup ; float timeElapsed = ( endTime - startTime ) ; }
Now any single timing of the same code is likely to fluctuate a certain amount , and the smaller the timescale that you ’re trying to measure , the larger the fluctuations will be in comparison .
Depending on what you ’re measuring , this amount of time elapsed may be very very small – even down to hundredths of a millisecond or less – so to get a sensible reading it ’s best to record the same action lots of times and average the result .
One way to do this would be to simply use a tight “ for ” or “ while ” loop which repeats the enclosed code a few thousand times .
This is fine if you want to quickly test a certain section of code in isolation but it ’s not so useful when trying to profile your game while it ’s being played in a normal way ( eg , baddies moving , bullets flying around , etc ) .
So , to expand on the example that I ’ve started building above , to accumulate and average the recordings of our Update function over a larger time period , we could do something like this , which records the time taken to perform the function 500 times ( once per frame ) , and then outputs the result to Unity ’s console window :
int numRecordings = 500 ; // number of recordings to make float timeRecorded = 0 ; // total accumulated time int recordingNum = 0 ; // current recording number void Update ( ) { float startTime = Time.realtimeSinceStartup ; // ( the code here that you want to measure ) float endTime = Time.realtimeSinceStartup ; // this section now accumulates the time , and // computes the average once we hit the required // number of recordings : float timeElapsed = ( endTime - startTime ) ; recordingNum ++ ; timeRecorded += timeElapsed ; if ( recordingNum == numRecordings ) { // calculate and display the average time float averageTime = timeRecorded / numRecordings ; Debug.Log ( " Avg Time : " +averageTime + " seconds " ) ; // and finally , reset & repeat : recordingNum = 0 ; timeRecording = 0 ; } }
Now we ’re getting somewhere .
With this in place , we can get a good idea of the time taken to execute any block of code that we might care about .
Note that it does n’t have to be your Update function that is measured .
You might be interested in , for example , how long it ’s taking a particular single line your Instantiate function to execute .
In this case , you could put the “ startTime ” and “ endTime ” recordings either side of this single line , like this :
float startTime = Time.realtimeSinceStartup ; Instantiate ( enemy Prefab , pos , rot ) ; float endTime = Time.realtimeSinceStartup ;
The main problem with the method above is that while it works , it would be impractical , messy and confusing to duplicate all this code to each and every Update function , and to every other part of your program that you want to measure in your project .
Are n’t you thinking it would be so much better if we could encapsulate the system used here into a simple friendly portable class ?
So am I !
The next example does just this .
It ’s a class I have written called “ CodeProfiler ” which is designed to be placed on an empty GameObject in your scene .
For those working in a different engine and unfamiliar with Unity ’s conventions , this basically means that the class will be automatically instantiated , and it receives Start ( ) and Update ( ) events automatically from the Unity engine while playing .
The reason it requires these events is so that it can accumulate and average the overall frame rate which is then used as a comparison with your own chosen measurements .
It has two public functions , “ Begin ” and “ End ” which you can call at the beginning and end of any particular code you want to profile .
These functions are static , which means you can call them directly just by using the class name as a prefix – so there is no need to find references to the profiler GameObject or script instance .
The full code for the CodeProfiler class is included at the bottom of this post , but first I ’m going to explain how to use it and how it works .
The script is written in C# , but you can call it from both C# scripts and scripts written in Unity ’s Javascript if you place it the appropriate folder .
In order to differentiate between the various parts of code that you want to measure , you pass an ID to these Begin and End functions – which is nothing more complex than a name , as a string parameter .
You are essentially just picking a label to name each different reading that is taking place in your code .
For example , if – in your game – you wanted to measure the speed of each your Player ’s , Enemy ’s and Bullet ’s update functions , you could add the Begin and End functions in your code like this :
// Player Script : void Update ( ) { CodeProfiler .
Begin( " Player : Update " ) ; //
( The rest of your Player update code here ) CodeProfiler .
End ( " Player : Update " ) ; }
// Enemy Script : void Update ( ) { CodeProfiler .
Begin( " Enemy : Update " ) ; //
( The rest of your Enemy update code here ) CodeProfiler .
End ( " Enemy : Update " ) ; }
// Bullet Script : void Update ( ) { CodeProfiler .
Begin( " Bullet : Update " ) ; //
( The rest of your Bullet update code here ) CodeProfiler .
End ( " Bullet : Update " ) ; }
So you can see in the above examples , I ’ve picked the labels “ Player : Update ” , “ Enemy : Update ” , and “ Bullet : Update ” for my 3 entries in the code profiler .
I ’ve chosen a convention of “ ClassName : FunctionName ” but you could use whatever you like as long as each entry is unique .
Now all that remains to do is to make sure that my CodeProfiler script is actually placed on an empty gameobject in the scene , and hit Play in the Unity editor .
The CodeProfiler updates its results every 5 seconds ( the results are the average of the readings over those five seconds ) , and they look like this :
Avg frame time : 19.6ms , 51 fps Total MS / frame Calls / frame MS / call Label 0.467 % 0.092ms 1.000 0.0933 ms Player : Update 6.429 % 1.260ms 6.000 0.2101 ms Enemy : Update 4.036 % 0.791ms 16.480 0.0480ms Bullet : Update
The first line gives you the average time elapsed per frame , and the corresponding “ frames per second ” that this results in .
This includes everything – rendering , physics , scripts , etc .
Underneath are your individual readings for each “ ID ” that you used when measuring your code .
In this example , the three IDs I mentioned earlier are present .
Each entry has the following figures :
“ Total ” shows the percentage time taken of the whole frame time .
“ MS / Frame ” shows the amount of milliseconds spent on this task per frame .
This is the sum if there were multiple calls ( for example if multiple enemies all recorded their Update times under the same ID ) .
“ Calls / Frame ” tells you the average number of times this reading was measured per frame .
In my example , for the player it ’s 1 .
For the Enemy , it ’s 6 , because there were 6 enemies present during the test all recording their time against the same ID .
For the Bullets it ’s the same situation , but this time it ’s not a whole number , because the number of bullets present varied over the duration of the 5 seconds measured , but it averaged about 16 .
And finally , “ MS / call ” tells you how long each individual call took , on average .
This is basically MS / Frame divided by Calls / frame .
These statistics give you some means to assess what impact your scripts are having in terms of your game ’s overall performance .
A game that is having performance trouble might come out looking something like this :
Avg frame time : 110.1 ms , 9.1 fps Total MS / frame Calls / fra MS / call Label 0.285 % 0.314ms 5.500 0.0570 ms Player : FixedUpdate 79.270 % 87.275ms 107.022 0.8155ms Bullet : Update 0.004 % 0.004ms 1.000 0.0045 ms Level : Update 5.604 % 6.170ms 56.283 0.1096 ms Enemy : FixedUpdate 0.900 % 0.991ms 2.413 0.4107ms Enemy : FireBullet
Uh -oh – there are serious problems here : the game is running at around nine frames per second .
My CodeProfiler does n’t measure the time taken for physics and rendering , but it does measure the total frame time , and we can see from the results that the bullet ’s Update function is by far dominating the total time taken per frame .
The bullet ’s update function is also being called many times – an average of 107 bullets per frame , each having its Update function called every frame , for this particular 5 second time - slice .
This would n’t be so bad if their individual execution time was very fast ( which it should be , for a bullet ! ) , however an average of 0.8155 ms per call is a long time , so there is clearly something wrong within that function which – when multiplied by every active bullet – causes a huge slowdown .
You might also notice at the bottom of the list that I added an entry for “ Enemy : FireBullet ” , which is a sub-section of the enemy ’s code which is responsible for instantiating and calculating the trajectory for each individual bullet , to see whether that was the problem .
I did that by simply adding another call to CodeProfiler .
Begin ( ) and CodeProfiler .
End ( ) around just that section of code , and choosing the label “ Enemy : FireBullet ” .
The results show that approximately 2.4 bullets were fired per frame , but the code for this only totalled 0.9 % of the frame time , so this clearly is n’t the cause of the poor framerate .
So from this example we can clearly see the problem lies within the bullet ’s Update function , and it ’s not the instantiation of the bullet .
If this was your project , you could narrow it down further by adding Begin ( ) and End ( ) calls around smaller parts within the offending code until you can identify what exactly is the major time - consumer in there .
It ’s very common for for the most time to be taken up by very few or even a single element of your code .
If all your code readings add up to a small portion of the total frame time , but your game is still running slowly , you know the major costs are elsewhere – i.e. graphics and / or physics .
How does the CodeProfiler work ?
Basically it uses a type of collection called a “ Dictionary ” to store multiple recordings .
A dictionary is a bit like an array , however it stores key / value pairs rather than a simple list of values .
( Read more about Dictionaries and other types of arrays and collections in Unity here ) .
The “ key ” is the string ID that you choose , and the “ value ” is an instance of the accompanying class “ ProfileRecording ” .
This ProfileRecording class contains just a few variables and functions which allow it to act as a simple stopwatch .
The CodeProfiler class creates a new ProfileRecording instance each time it encounters an ID which is n’t yet present in the dictionary , and adds the instance to the dictionary under the given ID .
The CodeProfiler uses Unity ’s OnGUI functions to display the text on - screen each frame , and each time the “ nextOutputTime ” is reached , the results are calculated and the text displayed is updated .
When you call the Begin and End function function with an ID , the CodeProfiler looks up the ProfileRecording associated with that ID in the dictionary , and calls the corresponding Start or Stop function on it .
Each individial ProfileRecording instance in the dictionary keeps track of how much time it has accumulated .
The ProfileRecording class has a Reset function to allow it to begin a fresh recording when required , and also generates an error if the Start and Stop functions are called out - of - order .
( I ’m aware that .
Net actually provides a “ Stopwatch ” class with much of the same functionality , however I included this simple custom class instead for the sake of learning and clarity so you can see exactly how this is being achieved , and how the concepts progress onwards from the simpler examples above .
Out of curiosity I tested the script using .
Net ’s Stopwatch class in place of my own , and happily it came out with near - identical results ! )
Without further ado , here ’s the CodeProfiler class :
using UnityEngine ; using System .
Collections .
Generic ; //
Simple code profiler class for Unity projects // @robotduck 2011 // // usage : place on an empty gameobject in your scene // then insert calls to CodeProfiler .
Begin( id ) and // CodeProfiler .
End( id ) around the section you want to profile // // " id " should be string , unique to each code portion that you 're timing // for example , in your enemy update function , you might have : // // function Update { // CodeProfiler .Begin( " Enemy : Update " ) ; // < the rest of your enemy update code here > // CodeProfiler .
End ( " Enemy : Update " ) ; // } // // the Begin id and the End id must match exactly .
public class CodeProfiler : MonoBehaviour { float startTime = 0 ; float nextOutputTime = 5 ; int numFrames = 0 ; static Dictionary < string , ProfilerRecording > recordings = new Dictionary < string , ProfilerRecording >( ) ; string displayText ; Rect displayRect = new Rect ( 10,10,460,300 ) ; void Awake ( ) { startTime = Time.time ; displayText = "

Box( displayRect , " Code Profiler " ) ; GUI .
Label ( displayRect , displayText ) ; } public static void Begin ( string id ) { // create a new recording if not present in the list if ( !recordings . ContainsKey( id ) ) { recordings [ id ] = new ProfilerRecording ( id ) ; } recordings [ id ] .
Start ( ) ; } public static void End( string id ) { recordings [ id ] .
Stop ( ) ; } void Update ( ) { numFrames ++ ; if ( Time.time > nextOutputTime ) { // time to display the results // column width for text display int colWidth = 10 ; // the overall frame time and frames per second : displayText = "

" Avg frame time : " ; displayText += avg MS.ToString ( " 0 . # " ) +" ms , " ; displayText += fps. ToString ( " 0 . # " ) + "

" ; // the column titles for the individual recordings : displayText += " Total " . PadRight( colWidth ) ; displayText += " MS / frame " . PadRight( colWidth ) ; displayText += " Calls / fra " .PadRight( colWidth ) ; displayText += " MS / call " . PadRight( colWidth ) ; displayText += " Label " ; displayText += "

Each " entry " is a key - value pair where the string ID // is the key , and the recording instance is the value : ProfilerRecording recording = entry .
Value ; // calculate the statistics for this recording : float recordedMS = ( recording .
Seconds * 1000 ) ; float percent = ( recordedMS * 100 ) / totalMS ; float msPerFrame = recordedMS / numFrames ; float msPerCall = recordedMS / recording .
Count ; float timesPerFrame = recording .
Count / ( float ) numFrames ; // add the stats to the display text displayText += ( percent . ToString ( " 0.000 " ) + " % " ) .
PadRight( colWidth ) ; displayText += ( msPerFrame.ToString ( " 0.000 " ) +" ms " ) .
PadRight( colWidth ) ; displayText += ( timesPerFrame.ToString ( " 0.000 " ) ) . PadRight( colWidth ) ; displayText += ( msPerCall.ToString ( " 0.0000 " ) +" ms " ) .
PadRight( colWidth ) ; displayText += ( recording.id ) ; displayText += "

Reset ( ) ; } Debug.Log(displayText ) ; // reset & schedule the next time to display results : numFrames = 0 ; startTime = Time.time ; nextOutputTime = Time.time + 5 ; } } } // this is the ProfileRecording class which is simply included // directly after the CodeProfiler class in the same file .
//
The ProfileRecording class is basically for " internal use // only " - you do n't need to place it on a gameobject or interact // with it in any way yourself , it 's purely used by the // CodeProfiler to do its job .
class ProfilerRecording { // this class accumulates time for a single recording int count = 0 ; float startTime = 0 ; float accumulatedTime = 0 ; bool started = false ; public string id ; public ProfilerRecording ( string id ) { this .id = id ; } public void Start ( ) { if ( started ) { BalanceError( ) ; } count ++ ; started = true ; startTime = Time.realtimeSinceStartup ; // done last } public void Stop ( ) { float endTime = Time.realtimeSinceStartup ; // done first if ( ! started ) { BalanceError( ) ; } started = false ; float elapsedTime = ( endTime - startTime ) ; accumulated Time += elapsedTime ; } public void Reset ( ) { accumulated Time = 0 ; count = 0 ; started = false ; } void BalanceError ( ) { // this lets you know if you 've accidentally // used the begin / end functions out of order Debug.
LogError ( " ProfilerRecording start / stops not balanced for ' " +id + " ' " ) ; } public float Seconds { get { return accumulated Time ; } } public int Count { get { return count ; } } }
Of course this is a simple script and could be vastly improved on .
It has significant shortcomings , and does not do a number of things which perhaps it should , such as :
– Sort the results into any particular order
– Deduct the average time taken for an “ empty reading ”
– Give similar results to Unity Pro ’s profiler *
– Graph the results .
– Make you a much - needed cup of tea .
I ’ll leave these as an excercise for the reader .
May I recommend starting with the last item first .
* Unity ’s profiler seems to assign larger times to function calls than those recorded by simply checking the time at the beginning and end of a function – I ’m guessing this is because it includes other things such as the time taken for the Unity engine to actually invoke the function ( which is done via Reflection for MonoBehaviour events like Update ) .
In part 3 of this series , I ’ll be examining the performance of various common code structures and techniques in Unity and shedding light on some faster alternatives , as well as exposing the “ voodoo ” optimisation techniques that some of us use just - in - case , but which actually provide little or no benefit !
With Enemies Like This , Who Needs Friends ?
An interviewer recently interrupted Rupert Murdoch ’s bellyaching about all the traffic and free advertising Google was sending News Corp ’s way ( I believe “ steal our stories ” is the expression he actually used ) to ask him a seemingly obvious question : if he was so bothered by Google ’s links to his content , why did n’t he just use the robots .
txt protocol to block indexing from Google ?
His response : “ I think we will . ”
That ’s the first time he ’s explicitly made that threat .
All the jubilation and cheering you hear is from Pirate Parties , anti-copyright activists and penguinheads all around the world .
Punishing people for directing traffic to your site seems , to put it mildly , a bit counterintuitive as a business strategy .
But then Murdoch ’s always been an outside the box thinker .
Well , actually he just seems plain old befuddled .
Not only did he specifically cite the Wall Street Journal as a good example of the paid content business model ; he also pointed out that the WSJ provides the first paragraph for free along with the subscription form to read more .
So he obviously does n’t object in principle to giving readers a sample of what ’s behind the pay wall .
What , then , is the point of preventing Google from indexing his online content ?
As Stan Schroeder points out , it ’s hard to figure out just what Murdoch ’s thinking :
“ If he plans to charge for websites , why hide them from the search engines ?
If you ca n’t actually read the content without paying , then making the content at least partly accessible to Google and other search engines can’t hurt ?
In fact , the WSJ that he mentions as an example is n’t hidden from Google ’s indexes , you can easily find Wall Street Journal articles via Google . ”
Google ’s response , as you might expect , was a perplexed shrug and “ OK , whatever ” : “ Publishers put their content on the Web because they want it to be found . ”
It ’s probably a safe guess that Monty Burns —er , Rupert Murdoch — is n’t real clear on the difference between email and a search engine , and doing web searches on The Internets is a task he delegates to his secretary or grandkids .
“ I ’m really enjoying this so - called … ‘ iced cream . ’ ”
Blocking Google ’s web crawlers , at first glance , seems like a clueless ( not to say ass - brained ) business model .
But what do I know ?
Murdoch ’s a big media mogul .
Maybe he ’s a frigging genius , and I ’m just too stupid to comprehend the loftiness of his vision .
Maybe he ’s figured out a way your business can attract paying customers when nobody knows who the hell you are .
Sure .
And next week , maybe the grocer will come up with a winning new idea for making money by suing you for telling people where the store is .
By the way , has Murdoch started saving his own urine and wearing Kleenex boxes on his feet yet ?
Maybe Google should give Murdoch a taste of his own medicine and block News Corp from all results pages for a day or two , all on its own .
Murdoch also reached into his , um , hat and pulled out this little gem : “ There ’s a doctrine called fair use , which we believe to be challenged in the courts and would bar it altogether … but we ’ll take that slowly . ”
He must have been talking to the people who came up with the anti-” songlifting ” curricula the RIAA has been generously distributing in the publik skools .
With enemies like this , who needs friends ?
We do n’t need to destroy the proprietary content industries .
They ’re hanging themselves with their own rope .

Tout le monde s’accorde sur ce fait : notre économie est mal en point .
Les symptômes inévitables comprennent un déclin des dépenses et de la confiance des consommateurs , ainsi qu’un repli des échanges commerciaux mondiaux et du crédit disponible .
Ajoutez à cela un effondrement des valeurs immobilières , un carnage dans les industries automobiles et le transport aérien , et vous obtenez effectivement un tableau très sombre .
Mais pourquoi l’économie états - unienne et , dans une perspective plus large , l’économie mondiale flanchent - elles toutes les deux ?
Du côté des médias dominants , des dirigeants mondiaux et des économistes en chef états - uniens ( Timothy Franz Geithner , le secrétaire au Trésor et Ben Shalom Bernanke , le directeur de la Réserve Fédérale ) on observe une quasi-unanimité d’opinion : ces récents troubles s’expliqueraient principalement par la combinaison de mauvais prêts immobiliers et d’une règlementation insuffisante des produits dérivés de la finance .
Voilà pour le diagnostic conventionnel .
S’il est correct , alors le traitement de notre maladie économique devrait logiquement inclure , d’une part , d’importantes sommes consacrées au renflouement des institutions financières , des banques de prêt immobilier et des constructeurs automobiles en déroute ; d’autre part , une meilleure règlementation des produits dérivés financiers et des marchés à terme ; et enfin des programmes de relance destinés à revigorer les dépenses de consommation .
Mais si ce diagnostic était erroné ?
La métaphore ne nécessite guère d’explications : nous savons tous quelles tragédies peuvent résulter d’une erreur d’appréciation des symptômes de la part d’un médecin et de la confusion par celui- ci de plusieurs maladies .
Un phénomène semblable s’observe dans le cas de notre affection économique nationale et mondiale .
Si nous ne comprenons pas pourquoi le métabolisme industriel et financier du monde souffre , il est peu probable que nous puissions appliquer le bon remède et nous risquons , au bout du compte , d’aggraver la situation bien au - delà de ce qu’il en serait autrement .
N’en doutons pas : le diagnostic conventionnel est certainement en partie pertinent .
La relation causale entre les prêts à risque et les crises de Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac et Lehman Brothers a été largement examinée et ne fait plus guère de mystère .
Clairement , au cours des quelques années passées , les bulles spéculatives dans les secteurs immobilier et financier furent gonflées à une échelle colossale , de sorte que leur éclatement était inévitable .
Il semble difficile de contredire le point de vue du Premier ministre australien Kevin Rudd , dans sa tribune publiée par le Sydney Morning Herald : «
Les racines de la crise s’enfoncent dans la décennie d’excès l’ayant précédée .
Au cours de celle - ci , le monde a connu un boom extraordinaire [ ...]
Cependant , comme nous l’apprîmes ultérieurement , le boom global reposait en grande partie [ ...] sur un château de cartes .
Premièrement , dans de nombreux pays occidentaux le boom a été érigé sur une montagne de dette entre les mains des consommateurs , des entreprises et de certains gouvernements .
Comme l’explique le magnat de la finance George Soros : “ Pendant 25 ans [ l’occident ] a consommé davantage qu’il n’a produit … nous avons vécu au - dessus de nos moyens . ” » [ 1 ] .
Néanmoins , afin de saisir pleinement les origines de l’effondrement économique mondial en cours , notre regard doit - il s’arrêter là ?
On peut arguer que les tragiques événements liés à l’immobilier , aux marchés de produits dérivés financiers , à l’industrie automobile et au transport aérien ne sont simplement eux - mêmes que des symptômes d’un dysfonctionnement systémique encore plus profond signifiant la fin de la croissance économique telle que nous l’avons connue .
En bref , je propose là un diagnostic alternatif .
Cette explication de la crise économique est déconseillée aux âmes sensibles car , si celle - ci est avérée , elle implique que le patient est beaucoup plus gravement atteint que ne l’affirment même les économistes les plus pessimistes .
Mais si elle est correcte , alors l ’ignorer nous fait encourir des périls bien plus importants .
Croissance économique , crise financière et pic pétrolier
Depuis plusieurs années , un mouvement de commentateurs ( dont je fais partie ) pronostiquait un crash financier en se basant sur la constatation d’un plafonnement imminent de la production pétrolière mondiale . [ 2 ]
Notre raisonnement s’articulait comme ceci :
L’accroissement continu de la population et de la consommation ne peut se poursuivre indéfiniment sur une planète limitée .
Il s’agit là d’une observation axiomatique sur laquelle tous ceux familiarisés avec les mathématiques de la croissance exponentielle ne peuvent que tomber d’accord , quand bien même ils délimiteraient leur acquiescement en usant de vagues références à la « substitutionnabilité » et autres « transitions démographiques » . [ 3 ]
Ces limites axiomatiques de la croissance impliquent que la rapide augmentation tant de la population que de la consommation par individu , dont nous avons été témoins au cours des deux siècles passés , doit nécessairement prendre fin à un moment donné .
Mais quand est-il probable que cela se produise ?
L’étude injustement décriée et intitulée Les Limites de la croissance , publiée à l’origine en 1972 et régulièrement actualisée depuis , a tenté d’apporter une réponse à cette question en s’appuyant sur une analyse des ressources disponibles et de leur déplétion , ainsi que plusieurs scénarios de croissance démographique future et de rythmes de consommation .
Le plus pessimiste des scénarios de 1972 suggérait une fin de la croissance économique mondiale pour les environs de 2015 . [ 4 ]
Or il existe peut - être un moyen plus simple de pronostiquer le crépuscule de la croissance .
L’énergie est le précurseur incontournable de la croissance ( encore une fois , cette affirmation est axiomatique : tant la physique que la biologie nous enseignent que sans énergie , rien ne se produit . ) .
L’expansion industrielle des deux derniers siècles s’est systématiquement basée sur un accroissement de la consommation d’énergie . [ 5 ]
Plus spécifiquement , l ’industrialisme a toujours été inextricablement lié à l’accessibilité et à la consommation d’énergie bon marché , du charbon au pétrole ( et plus récemment , le gaz naturel ) .
Cependant , les combustibles fossiles sont par nature des ressources sujettes à déplétion et non renouvelables .
Ainsi ( et selon la thèse du pic pétrolier ) , l’impossibilité à terme de maintenir un approvisionnement croissant en énergie fossile abordable conduira vraisemblablement à l’arrêt de la croissance économique en général , à moins que les sources d’énergie alternatives et l’efficacité de l’usage d’énergie puissent être accrues rapidement et dans des proportions suffisantes . [ 6 ]
Parmi les trois combustibles fossiles conventionnels , le pétrole est sans aucun doute le plus vital économiquement , car il fournit 95 % de toute l’énergie utilisée dans les transports .
De plus , le pétrole est le combustible qui nous posera probablement des problèmes d’approvisionnement le plus rapidement , car les découvertes à l’échelle mondiale déclinent depuis des décennies et la plupart des pays producteurs de pétrole connaissent déjà une baisse de production . [ 7 ]
Ainsi , selon cette logique , la fin de la croissance économique ( telle que définie conventionnellement ) est inévitable et le pic pétrolier en est le probable facteur déclencheur .
Pourquoi le pic pétrolier conduirait - il non seulement à des problèmes dans le secteur des transports , mais aussi à une crise économique et financière générale ?
Au cours du siècle dernier , la croissance s’est institutionnalisée au cœur même de notre système économique .
Toutes les villes et entreprises veulent croître .
Ce fait est compréhensible ne serait -ce qu’en raison de la nature humaine : pratiquement tout le monde cherche un avantage compétitif par rapport à quelqu ’un d’autre , et la croissance fournit l’occasion d’y parvenir .
Mais un mobile lié à la survie financière est également à l’œuvre : sans croissance , les entreprises et les gouvernements sont dans l’impossibilité d’honorer leur dette .
En outre la dette est devenue partie intégrante du système industriel .
Durant les deux décennies écoulées , le secteur des services financiers s’est développé plus rapidement que tout autre secteur de l’économie , dépassant même l’augmentation des dépenses de santé et représentant un tiers de toute la croissance enregistrée par l’économie états - unienne .
De 1990 à aujourd ’hui , le rapport dette / PIB est passé de 165 % à plus de 350 % .
La santé de l’économie repose essentiellement sur la dette , et le corollaire de celle - ci est le pari selon lequel les niveaux de production et de consommation de l’année suivante seront plus élevés que ceux de l’année en cours .
Sachant que la croissance ne peut perdurer sur une planète limitée , ce pari et son incarnation par les institutions financières peuvent être qualifiés de plus grand « jeu de Ponzi » de l’histoire .
Nous justifions l’emprunt actuel par la croyance irrationnelle selon laquelle la croissance perpétuelle est possible , nécessaire et inévitable .
En fait , nous avons emprunté aux générations futures de manière à pouvoir dilapider aujourd ’hui leur capital .
Jusqu’à une période récente , l’argument du pic pétrolier s’articulait autour d’une prévision : le déclin inéluctable de la production pétrolière mondiale , lorsqu’il surviendrait , anéantirait la croissance .
Mais voici qu’alors la prévision devient diagnostic : dans la période s’étalant entre 2005 et 2008 , l’énergie a cessé de croître et le prix du pétrole a grimpé jusqu’à des niveaux records .
Au mois de juillet 2008 , le cours du baril de pétrole frôlait les 150 dollars – après ajustement en fonction de l’inflation , la moitié du record précédent – et l’économie commença à vaciller .
Les secteurs de l’automobile et du transport aérien tremblaient ; le consommateur ordinaire parvenait difficilement à faire le plein pour se rendre au travail tout en payant les traites de son logement .
Les dépenses de consommation commencèrent à baisser .
Au mois de septembre , la crise économique devint aussi une crise financière lorsque les banques se mirent à trembler et imploser . [ 8 ]
Compte tenu de l’enjeu , il est important de peser les deux diagnostics en se basant sur les faits et non pas des idées préconçues .
Il n’est pas nécessaire d’examiner les éléments appuyant ou réfutant le diagnostic conventionnel , car sa validité n’est pas mise en doute en tant qu’interprétation partielle des événements observés .
La question est plutôt de savoir s’il constitue une explication suffisante , et donc une base adéquate afin de formuler une réponse efficace .
Quels sont les éléments pesant en faveur de l’alternative ?
Il me paraît pertinent de commencer par un article récent de l’économiste James Hamilton de l’Université de Californie , à San Diego , intitulé Causes and Consequences of the Oil Shock of 2007 - 2008 ( « Causes et conséquences du choc pétrolier de 2007 - 2008 » ) , qui traite des cours pétroliers et de leur impact économique avec clarté , logique et chiffres à l’appui , expliquant pourquoi et comment le crash économique est lié au choc pétrolier de 2008 . [ 9 ]
Hamilton commence par citer des études précédentes montrant une nette corrélation entre les sommets atteints par les cours pétroliers et les récessions .
Sur la base de cette corrélation , chaque économiste attentif aurait dû pronostiquer une sévère récession pour 2008 .
« En effet , » écrit Hamilton , « cette relation pourrait expliquer la totalité de la chute de 2007 - 2008 [...]
Si quelqu ’un avait pu savoir à l’avance comment les cours pétroliers évolueraient en 2007 - 2008 , en utilisant la relation estimée historiquement [ entre la hausse du cours et son impact économique ] [...] il aurait alors pu prédire le niveau de PIB réel tant pour le troisième trimestre 2008 que le quatrième de façon assez précise . »
Encore une fois , il ne s’agit pas d’ignorer le rôle joué par les secteurs financier et immobilier dans le malaise économique global .
Mais selon le diagnostic alternatif , l’effondrement des marchés du logement et des produits dérivés financiers est perçu comme ayant amplifié un signal émanant à l’origine de l’échec à accroître l’afflux de ressources en voie d’épuisement .
Hamilton poursuit : «
Il est tout du moins clair que quelque chose d’autre que l’immobilier s’est détérioré pour aboutir à la transformation d’une croissance lente en récession .
Selon moi , cela comprend la chute des ventes d’automobiles , un ralentissement des dépenses générales de consommation et la détérioration de la confiance des consommateurs , à quoi le choc pétrolier est un facteur ayant indéniablement contribué . »
De plus , Hamilton souligne l’existence d’un « effet d’interaction entre le choc pétrolier et les problèmes dans l’immobilier .
» C’est - à - dire que , dans beaucoup de zones urbaines , les prix des logements en 2007 poursuivaient leur hausse dans les agglomérations les plus proches des centres urbains , mais chutaient déjà rapidement dans les agglomérations nécessitant de longs trajets . [ 10 ]
Pourquoi les cours pétroliers ont - ils atteint des sommets ?
Ceux qui adhèrent au diagnostic conventionnel concernant l’effondrement économique en cours seraient peut - être d’accord sur le fait qu’il y ait eu , dans une certaine mesure , un lien causal entre l’ascension des cours pétroliers et la récession , mais ils réfuteraient le fait que la hausse du baril soit liée d’une façon ou d’une autre aux limites en termes de ressources , car — affirment - ils — elle était surtout imputable à la spéculation sur les marchés pétroliers à terme , et n’avait pas grand chose à voir avec les fondamentaux de l’offre et de la demande .
À cet égard , le diagnostic conventionnel est , une fois de plus , en partie fondé .
La spéculation sur les marchés pétroliers à terme durant la période en question a presque certainement contribué à tirer les cours plus haut que les fondamentaux ne le justifiaient .
Mais pourquoi les investisseurs misaient - ils sur le pétrole ?
L’engouement pour les contrats pétroliers n’était - il qu’une autre bulle , comme la frénésie boursière de l ’Internet à la fin des années 1990 ou le boom de l’immobilier entre 2003 et 2006 ?
Au cours de la période s’étalant de 2005 à la mi-2008 , la demande en pétrole s’amplifiait , particulièrement en Chine ( qui passa d’une situation d’autosuffisance en 1995 au rang de second pays importateur au monde après les États - Unis en 2006 ) .
Or l’approvisionnement mondial en pétrole restait plus ou moins stable : les données mensuelles de la production de brut oscillaient dans une fourchette relativement étroite , entre 72 et 75 millions de barils par jour .
Tandis que les cours étaient à la hausse , les volumes produits décollaient à peine .
Tout indiquait alors que l’ensemble des producteurs pompaient à un débit maximum : même les saoudiens semblaient se précipiter pour tirer bénéfice de la manne occasionnée par les prix .
Il serait ainsi judicieux de noter que la spéculation sur les marchés pétroliers à terme ne faisait qu’amplifier une tendance des cours inévitable au regard des fondamentaux de l’offre et de la demande .
James Hamilton ( dans la publication mentionnée plus haut ) le formulait comme ceci : «
Avec le recul , il paraît difficile de nier le fait que les cours sont montés trop haut en juillet 2008 , et que ce mauvais calcul était en partie influencé par l’afflux d’investissements dans les contrats d’approvisionnement à terme .
Il serait toutefois important de souligner que les deux ingrédients nécessaires pour rendre cohérente une telle vision , à savoir une faible élasticité de la demande en termes de prix et l’impossibilité d’accroissement de la production physique , sont les mêmes composantes essentielles d’une explication du même phénomène basée sur les fondamentaux .
Aussi conclurai - je que ces deux facteurs , plutôt que la spéculation en elle - même , devraient être désignés comme la cause principale du choc pétrolier de 2007 - 2008 . »
Conséquences du pic
À quel point les tourments du secteur automobile , des transports routiers et aériens seraient - ils imputables à l’escalade des prix , ou au crash de l’économie , cela fait également l’objet d’une controverse .
Bien entendu , dans l’hypothèse que le diagnostic alternatif soit correct , ces deux derniers événements sont de toute façon liés causalement .
Il pourrait néanmoins être utile d’examiner la situation de plus près .
Personne n’ignore que General Motors et Chrysler ont cette année fait faillite en raison de la chute dramatique des ventes d’automobiles .
La prévision actuelle table sur des ventes d’environ 10,3 millions de véhicules aux États - Unis en 2009 , en baisse par rapport aux 13,2 millions de l’année passée et 16,1 millions pour 2007 .
Les ventes d’autos états - uniennes n’ont jamais atteint un aussi bas niveau depuis les années 1970 .
Les ventes de camionnettes , celles qui génèrent le plus de profits , ont le plus accusé le coup en 2008 , alors que le prix des carburants grimpait et que les acheteurs évitaient les véhicules consommant beaucoup .
C’est à ce moment - là que les constructeurs automobiles ont réellement commencé à souffrir .
Les maux affectant le secteur du transport aérien sont résumés par une récente publication du GAO [ 11 ] :«
Après 2 ans de profits , le secteur du transport aérien commercial a accusé une perte de 4,3 milliards de dollars au cours des trois premiers trimestres de l’année 2008 [ à mesure que le prix du kérosène augmentait ] .
Collectivement , les compagnies aériennes états - uniennes ont réduit leur capacité sur le plan domestique , comme en atteste le nombre de places mises en service , dans une proportion de 9 % entre le quatrième trimestre de l’année 2007 et la même période en 2008 [...]
Pour réduire leur capacité , elles ont par ailleurs diminué le nombre d’appareils en service de 18 % [...]
Les compagnies ont en outre dans l’ensemble réduit leur personnel d’environ 28 000 postes , soit près de 7 % , entre fin 2007 et fin 2008 [...]
Le repli du secteur aérien en 2008 a fait chuter les revenus des aéroports , l’accès des passagers au réseau aérien national , et les revenus des caisses de prévoyance .
» [ 12 ]
Concernant le transport routier , les dépenses en carburant représentent près de 40 % des coûts généraux de fonctionnement .
En 2007 , tandis que le prix du diesel grimpait , les transporteurs commencèrent à essuyer des pertes financières et apposèrent des surcharges de carburant ; simultanément les volumes transportés commencèrent à chuter .
Après le mois de juillet 2008 , lorsque les cours pétroliers chutèrent , le tonnage poursuivit son déclin .
Globalement , la baisse cumulée des charges embarquées sur semi-remorques , camions - citernes et fourgons atteignait 15 à 20 % pour la seule période allant de juin à décembre 2008 . [ 13 ]
Cette dernière série de chiffres soulève quelques questions cruciales en vue de la compréhension du diagnostic alternatif : pourquoi , si la production pétrolière mondiale venait de plafonner , les cours du brut chutèrent - ils pendant les cinq derniers mois de l’année 2008 ?
Par ailleurs , si le prix du pétrole représente un facteur essentiel dans la crise économique , alors pourquoi l’économie n’a -t - elle pas entamé un virage après le radoucissement des cours du brut ?
Pourquoi le prix du pétrole a -t - il chuté ?
Et pourquoi un cours plus bas n’a -t - il par entraîné une reprise rapide ?
La thèse du pic pétrolier prévoit , tandis que la production pétrolière mondiale atteint son niveau maximum puis commence à décliner , une augmentation dramatique des cours du brut .
Mais elle envisage en outre un sévère accroissement de la volatilité des prix .
Voici comment s’articule sa logique : à mesure que s’épuisera le pétrole , son prix augmentera jusqu’à ce qu’il commence à saper les bases de l’économie en général .
Le repli économique engendrera à son tour une baisse substantielle de la demande en pétrole , qui elle - même provoquera une baisse temporaire du prix du brut .
Alors l’un des deux scénarios suivants se déroulera : soit ( a ) l’économie entamera une reprise , attisant un renouveau de la demande en pétrole , celui-ci conduisant derechef à des cours élevés qui de nouveau mineront l’activité économique ; ou ( b ) , si l’économie ne s’en remet pas rapidement , la production pétrolière chutera progressivement en raison de la baisse de la demande jusqu’à ce que la capacité de production supplémentaire ( engendrée par la demande plus faible ) soit effacée par l’épuisement des gisements , ce qui conduira de nouveau à des prix élevés et encore davantage de contraction économique .
Dans les deux cas , les cours pétroliers demeurent volatiles et l’économie connaît un repli .
Ce scénario correspond très précisément à la réalité qui se déroule devant nos yeux , bien qu’il reste à voir si la situation ( a ) ou ( b ) lui succède .
Durant les trois dernières années , les cours du brut ont augmenté et chuté plus brutalement que cela n’aurait été le cas sans un phénomène de spéculation généralisée sur les marchés pétroliers à terme .
Toutefois la direction générale des prix , à savoir très haut , puis très bas , puis en partie de nouveau vers le haut , s’inscrit parfaitement dans le cadre de la thèse du pic pétrolier et du diagnostic alternatif .
Pourquoi l’économie n’a -t - elle pas connu de reprise rapide , sachant que les cours du brut se situent dorénavant à la moitié de leur niveau de juillet 2008 ?
Encore une fois , le pic pétrolier n’est pas la cause unique de la crise économique actuelle .
D’énormes bulles dans les secteurs de l’immobilier et de la finance constituaient autant d’accidents prêts à survenir , et l’implosion de ces bulles a engendré une sévère crise du crédit bancaire ( ainsi qu’une crise de la solvabilité et une autre , émergente , de la monnaie ) qui nécessitera probablement plusieurs années avant de se résorber même si l’approvisionnement énergétique ne pose pas problème .
Mais dorénavant le potentiel pour un retour d’un niveau de prix du brut élevé agit comme un plafond vis -à - vis de la reprise économique .
Ainsi , lorsque l’économie semble effectivement montrer des signes de reprise ( comme nous l’avons vu entre mai et juillet de cette année , avec des marchés boursiers en hausse et le rythme général de la contraction économique ralentissant quelque peu ) , le prix du brut décolle de nouveau tandis que les spéculateurs pétroliers anticipent un rétablissement de la demande .
En effet , les cours du pétrole ont rebondi de 30 dollars en janvier à près de 70 dollars actuellement , provoquant une inquiétude générale quant à la possibilité qu’un niveau de prix de l’énergie élevé tue la reprise dans l’œuf . [ 14 ]
Maintenant que tous les gisements les plus faciles d’accès sont en exploitation , un baril de pétrole en provenance de sources récemment développées coûte approximativement 60 dollars à produire : aujourd ’hui , découvrir de nouveaux champs pétrolifères implique généralement de forer à des profondeurs de plusieurs kilomètres sous la surface des mers , ou dans des pays politiquement instables sur le sol desquels l’équipement et le personnel encourent des risques importants . [ 15 ]
Ainsi , dès que la demande des consommateurs en pétrole reprendra de la vigueur , les cours devront se maintenir significativement au - dessus de ce seuil afin d’encourager les exploitants à forer .
La volatilité des cours inflige des dégâts en amont , mais aussi en aval .
La chute du prix du brut d’août à décembre 2008 , combinée à une aggravation de la crise du crédit , a provoqué un repli dramatique des investissements dans le secteur pétrolier , ce qui a conduit au gel de nouveaux projets d’exploitation représentant une somme d’environ 150 milliards de dollars en investissements , alors que la capacité de production potentielle de ces nouveaux projets est nécessaire pour compenser le déclin de production des champs déjà en exploitation et maintenir ainsi un niveau de production mondiale stable . [ 16 ]
Cela signifie que même si la demande se maintient à un niveau faible , la capacité de production diminuera presque certainement afin de s’aligner sur ce niveau de demande , engendrant une nouvelle hausse des cours en termes réels à un moment ou l’autre , peut - être d’ici à deux ou trois ans .
Des cours pétroliers volatiles nuisent en outre au développement des énergies alternatives , comme nous l’avons vu ces derniers mois lorsque la baisse du prix du brut a porté atteinte à la santé financière des producteurs d’éthanol . [ 17 ]
D’une façon ou d’une autre , la croissance sera hautement problématique , si elle n’est pas tout simplement inatteignable .
Diagnostic général : en suivant la piste de la logique
À ce stade de la discussion , de nombreux lecteurs se demanderont pourquoi les sources d’énergie alternatives , et les mesures visant à améliorer l’efficacité énergétique , ne peuvent être mises en œuvre afin d’apporter une solution à la crise du pic pétrolier .
Après tout , à mesure que le pétrole deviendra plus onéreux l’éthanol , le biodiesel et les voitures électriques seront susceptibles de devenir plus attrayants tant pour les producteurs que pour les consommateurs .
La magie du marché n’interviendra - t - elle pas afin d’enrayer l’impact des pénuries de pétrole sur la croissance future ?
Il ne m’est pas possible , dans le cadre de cette discussion , d’expliquer de manière détaillée pourquoi le marché n’est probablement pas en mesure de résoudre le problème du pic pétrolier .
Une telle explication nécessite de traiter la question des critères de bilan énergétique , ainsi que l’examen de nombreuses alternatives énergétiques individuelles à la lumière de ces critères .
J’ai proposé de brefs aperçus à ce sujet auparavant , et une étude beaucoup plus poussée est en cours d’impression . [ 18 ]
Le résumé de mes conclusions à cet égard est le suivant .
Environ 85 % de notre énergie actuelle provient de trois sources primaires , à savoir le pétrole , le gaz naturel et le charbon , qui sont non renouvelables , dont le prix aura vraisemblablement tendance à augmenter radicalement au cours des prochaines années et décennies , engendrant de sévères pénuries , et enfin dont l’impact environnemental est inacceptable .
Si ces sources ont historiquement été pourvues d’une valeur économique importante , nous ne pourrons pas en dépendre à l’avenir ; en effet plus nous retarderons la transition vers les sources d’énergie alternatives , plus cette transition sera éprouvante , à moins qu’un éventail pratique de systèmes énergétiques alternatifs et revêtant des caractéristiques économiques et environnementales supérieures , soit identifié .
Néanmoins , déterminer un tel éventail est plus difficile qu’on pourrait le penser a priori .
Chaque source d’énergie présente des caractéristiques hautement spécifiques .
De fait , ce sont les caractéristiques de nos sources d’énergie actuelles ( principalement le pétrole , le charbon et le gaz naturel ) qui nous ont permis de développer une société à grande mobilité , large population et taux de croissance élevés .
L’examen des sources d’énergie alternatives disponibles selon des critères de densité énergétique , impacts environnementaux , dépendance vis-à - vis de matières premières en voie d’épuisement , intermittence ou constance de l’approvisionnement et pourcentage d’énergie produite en fonction de l’énergie investie , nous indique qu’aucune ne semble en mesure de perpétuer ce genre de société .
De plus , les infrastructures nationales de production d’énergie sont onéreuses et lentes à développer .
La performance énergétique , de la même façon , nécessite des investissements qui , incrémentés dans le temps , présentent généralement des retours en diminution , car il est impossible de réaliser du travail sans aucune énergie au départ .
Où sont la volonté et la capacité à rassembler suffisamment de capital en vue du déploiement de sources d’énergie alternatives et de la mise en œuvre de mesures d’économie à l’échelle requise ?
S’il existe de nombreuses installations productrices d’énergie alternative fonctionnelles dans le monde ( allant des petits systèmes photovoltaïques individuels aux grandes « fermes » de turbines éoliennes de trois mégawatts ) , il y a en revanche peu de nations modernes et industrielles capables d’obtenir actuellement l’essentiel de leur énergie par des sources autres que le pétrole , le charbon et le gaz naturel .
La Suède représente à cet égard un bon exemple , car elle tire une grande partie de son énergie du nucléaire et de l’hydroélectrique .
Un autre exemple est l’Islande , qui bénéficie de ressources géothermiques exceptionnellement importantes et inexistantes dans la plupart des autres pays .
Même pour ces deux nations , la situation est complexe : la construction de l’infrastructure de leurs centrales s’est essentiellement appuyée sur les combustibles fossiles pour ce qui est de l’extraction des minerais et matières premières , pour la transformation des matériaux , pour les transports , pour la fabrication de leurs éléments , pour l’énergie nécessaire à leur construction , etc .
Dès lors toute transition réelle hors des combustibles fossiles ne reste que théorie et optimisme inconscient , certainement pas réalité .
Ainsi la conclusion que j’ai tirée d’un examen attentif des énergies alternatives , c’est qu’il est peu probable que les combustibles fossiles conventionnels comme les sources d’énergie alternatives puissent fournir la quantité et la qualité d’énergie nécessaires au maintien de la croissance économique , ni même les niveaux actuels d’activité économique , pour le reste du siècle en cours . [ 19 ]
Or , le problème s’étend bien au - delà du pétrole et des autres combustibles fossiles : les ressources mondiales en eau sont mises à contribution au point que des milliards d’êtres humains risquent de bientôt se retrouver avec seulement un accès précaire à l’eau potable et pour l’irrigation .
La biodiversité décline rapidement .
À cause de l’érosion , nous perdons 24 milliards de tonnes de terre cultivable chaque année .
Par ailleurs , de nombreux minerais économiquement significatifs , de l’antimoine au zinc , sont en voie d’épuisement rapide , nécessitant l’extraction de minerais de qualité moindre dans des zones toujours plus reculées .
Aussi la crise du pic pétrolier n’est - elle que le côté tranchant d’un dilemme de pic général plus large .
De manière générale , l’humanité est confrontée à un péril entièrement prévisible : notre population s’est prodigieusement accrue au cours des 200 dernières années ( passant de moins d’un milliard d’individus à près de sept milliards ) , tandis que notre consommation de ressources par individu a également augmenté .
Pour de nombreuses espèces , c’est pratiquement la définition du succès biologique .
Pourtant , tout cela s’est déroulé dans le contexte d’une planète limitée et dotée d’une quantité déterminée de ressources non renouvelables ( combustibles fossiles et minerais ) , d’une capacité limitée à générer des ressources renouvelables et à absorber les déchets industriels ( dont le dioxyde de carbone ) .
Si nous prenons un peu de recul et observons la période industrielle dans une perspective historique large et en ayant conscience des limites écologiques , il est difficile de passer outre la conclusion que nous vivons aujourd ’hui la fin d’une parenthèse relativement brève : une phase d’expansion rapide de 200 ans rendue possible par une manne énergétique temporaire ( sous forme de combustibles fossiles très bon marché ) et qui sera inéluctablement suivie d’un repli encore plus rapide et dramatique avec l’épuisement de ces combustibles .
La survenue de cet élan croissance - contraction ne signifie pas nécessairement la fin du monde , mais cela implique effectivement la fin d’une certaine forme d’économie .
D’une façon ou d’une autre , l’humanité doit revenir à un mode plus normal d’existence se caractérisant par son appui sur l’afflux solaire immédiat ( par les cultures , le vent ou la conversion directe du rayonnement solaire en électricité ) plutôt que sur une ancienne énergie solaire stockée .
Il ne s’agit pas d’affirmer que le reste du XXIe siècle doive consister en un effondrement de l’industrie , une disparition de l’essentiel de la population humaine et un retour des survivants à un mode de vie pratiquement identique à celui des paysans du XVIe siècle ou des chasseurs - cueilleurs primitifs .
Il est possible en revanche d’imaginer des façons acceptables et même attirantes pour l’humanité de s’adapter aux limites écologiques tout en développant plus encore sa richesse culturelle , sa compréhension scientifique et sa qualité de vie ( voir ci-dessous ) .
Mais peu importe comment elle est amenée , la transition sera synonyme de fin de la croissance économique au sens conventionnel .
Et il semble que cette transition ait démarré .
Comment savoir quel diagnostic est le bon ?
Si le patient est un être individuel et que la cause du trouble est incertaine , de nouveaux examens de diagnostic peuvent être prescrits .
Mais à quelles sortes de tests sanguins , rayons X et scanner pouvons - nous soumettre l’économie nationale ou mondiale ?
D’une certaine façon , ces examens ont déjà été menés .
Durant les quelques décennies passées , des milliers d’enquêtes scientifiques ayant pour objet les ressources naturelles , la biodiversité et les écosystèmes ont montré des taux d’épuisement et de déclin croissants . [ 20 ]
L’augmentation continue de la population , de la pollution et de la consommation est également bien documentée .
Cette somme d’informations constituait la base de l’étude Les Limites de la croissance mentionnée plus haut , qui a recours à un modèle informatique pour montrer comment les tendances actuelles se préciseront probablement , et la plupart des scénarios obtenus indiquent qu’elles conduiront à la fin de la croissance économique et à un effondrement de la production industrielle , à un moment ou à un autre , au cours du début du XXIe siècle .
Pourquoi les résultats de ces tests de diagnostic ne sont - ils pas universellement acceptés comme remettant en question le principe de croissance continue ?
Premièrement parce que leurs conclusions vont à l’encontre des croyances et affirmations de la plupart des économistes , qui maintiennent qu’il n’existe pas de limites pratiques à la croissance .
Ils récusent le fait que les contraintes en termes de ressources constituent au bout du compte un plafond à la production et à la consommation .
Aussi leurs efforts diagnostics tendent - ils à ignorer les facteurs environnementaux en faveur des aspects internes et facilement mesurables de l’économie humaine comme la circulation de l’argent , la confiance des consommateurs , les taux d’intérêt et les indices de prix .
L’écologiste Charles
Hall , parmi d’autres , a argumenté que la discipline de l’économie , telle qu’elle est aujourd ’hui pratiquée , ne constitue pas une science car elle fonctionne principalement sur la base de la logique corrélative , plutôt que par l’élaboration de la connaissance au moyen d’un procédé continu et rigoureux de proposition et de test d’hypothèses . [ 21 ]
Si l’économie a recours à une terminologie et à des mathématiques complexes , comme le fait la science , ses affirmations basiques quant au monde , telles que le principe de la substitutionnabilité infinie , qui considère que pour toute ressource se faisant rare , le marché trouvera un substitut , ne font en revanche pas l’objet d’un examen expérimental rigoureux .
( Il est intéressant de noter à ce propos que Hall et ses associés ont fait l’effort de poser les fondations conceptuelles d’une nouvelle discipline économique basée sur les méthodes et principes scientifiques , qu’ils prénomment « économie biophysique » . [ 22 ]
De surcroît , les économistes classiques ont globalement échoué à prévoir le crash actuel .
Nous n’avons pas vu d’effort consistant ou concerté de la part du secrétaire au Trésor , des directeurs de la Réserve Fédérale ou des économistes titulaires du prix « Nobel » pour avertir les milieux décisionnaires ou le grand public que , à un moment donné au début du XXIe siècle , l’économie mondiale commencerait à vaciller . [ 23 ]
On serait tenté de penser que cet échec de pronostic , à savoir l’incapacité à entrevoir un événement aussi significatif historiquement que le repli rapide de presque toute l’économie mondiale et impliquant la déroute de banques et d’industries parmi les plus importants au monde , les aurait incités à s’arrêter un moment et remettre en question leurs hypothèses de base .
Pourtant peu de choses donnent à penser que cela est le cas .
Au risque de me répéter , j’insisterai sur ce point : les scientifiques concrets dans différentes disciplines ont effectivement prévu la fin de la croissance économique pour le début du XXIe siècle , et ont averti les preneurs de décisions ainsi que le grand public en de nombreuses occasions .
Qui devrions - nous croire ?
Dans le détail , le diagnostic alternatif est modulable .
Si l’activité économique rebondissait au - delà de son niveau de 2007 , ou si la production de pétrole s’élevait au - dessus de son plafond de juillet 2008 , alors l’explication de la crise économique actuelle par les limites de la croissance liées aux ressources pourrait être considérée comme en partie infirmée .
Néanmoins , même si cela devait se produire , le raisonnement sous - jacent au diagnostic alternatif tiendrait peut - être toujours debout .
Si le pic de production mondial était retardé jusqu ’en , disons , 2015 ou 2020 , et si un autre crash économique , cette fois sans fond , s’en suivait , alors le résultat final serait essentiellement identique .
En revanche si pendant ce temps le diagnostic alternatif était pris au sérieux et mis en application , les conséquences en seraient bénéfiques : une décennie aura été consacrée à la préparation à cet événement .
Le diagnostic alternatif pourrait - il être erroné dans son ensemble ?
C’est - à- dire , le jugement des économistes conventionnels serait - il fondé lorsqu’ils estiment que la croissance peut se poursuivre indéfiniment ?
On répète souvent que tout est possible , or certaines choses sont davantage possibles que d’autres .
La croissance perpétuelle de la population humaine et de la consommation dans le cadre d’une planète limitée semble en effet être une idée assez exagérée , en particulier du fait que les signes d’avertissement sont partout et nous montrent clairement que nous atteignons déjà , et outrepassons même , les limites écologiques . [ 24 ]
Ce qu’il ne faut pas faire : prescrire des placebos au coût pernicieusement prohibitif
Si les scientifiques du concret avertissant des limites de la croissance ont raison , alors faire face au déclin économique global implique bien plus que simplement remettre sur pied les banques et organismes de prêt immobilier .
En effet , dans ce cas nous sommes confrontés à un changement fondamental de notre économie aussi significatif que l’avènement de la révolution industrielle .
Nous sommes à un point d’inflexion historique , à savoir la fin de dizaines d’années d’expansion et le début d’une période de contraction inévitable qui se prolongera jusqu’à ce que l’humanité vive de nouveau dans le respect des limites des systèmes régénératifs de la Terre .
Mais nous ne voyons guère de signes indiquant que les preneurs de décisions y comprennent quoi que ce soit .
Leur raisonnement semble principalement calqué sur les certitudes des économistes dans le vent , selon lesquelles la croissance peut et doit continuer dans un avenir indéterminé , et que le repli économique dont souffre actuellement le monde n’est que temporaire : un problème qui peut et doit être résolu .
Ceci étant dit , il ne s’agit pas d’un problème mineur aux yeux des économistes et dirigeants .
En témoigne l’ampleur considérable des plans de sauvetage du Trésor et de la Réserve Fédérale ayant été mis en œuvre dans une tentative possiblement futile de mettre fin à la contraction et relancer la croissance .
Selon le commissaire général spécial du gouvernement états - unien en charge du Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP , plan de soutien du gouvernement américain au secteur financier ) , dans ses remarques soumises au Comité parlementaire pour la supervision et la réforme gouvernementale le 21 juillet , 23,7 trillions de dollars ( NDT. 23 700 milliards de dollars ) ont été déboursés dans le cadre du « soutien potentiel total du gouvernement fédéral » .
Il s’agit effectivement bien d’un remède onéreux .
Ne serait - ce que commencer à saisir l’énormité de ce chiffre nécessite déjà un moment de réflexion .
Cela représente environ la moitié du PIB mondial annuel , et plus de trois fois la somme déboursée par le gouvernement états - unien , en dollars ajustés à l’inflation , pour l’ensemble des guerres de 1776 à aujourd ’hui .
C’est presque 50 fois le coût du New Deal .
D’autres nations , dont le Royaume - Uni , la Chine et l’Allemagne se sont engagées à financer des plans de soutien et de sauvetage qui , bien que nettement moins importants en termes absolus , représentent une part impressionnante ( devrions - nous dire effrayante ? ) du PIB national .
Si le diagnostic alternatif est valable , rien de tout cela ne fonctionnera au bout du compte , car les institutions financières existantes , avec leur socle de dette et intérêts et leur besoin d’expansion permanente , ne peuvent être rendues opérationnelles dans un contexte de plafond effectif imposé par les contraintes d’énergie et de ressources à la production industrielle et au transport .
Les plans de sauvetage et de soutien fonctionnent - ils ?
Beaucoup d’éléments suggèrent que ce n’est pas le cas , sauf dans des proportions limitées .
Aux États - Unis , le chômage continue de croître , tandis que la chute des valeurs immobilières se poursuit .
Et la plupart des « nouveaux bourgeons » repérés dans l’économie jusqu’à présent ne représentent qu’une baisse contestable du rythme de contraction .
Par exemple , l ’index des prix de l’immobilier publié le 28 juillet de cette année montrait qu’en mai les prix ajustés à la saison ont chuté de seulement 0,16 % par rapport au mois précédent .
Cela équivaut à un taux de déclin annuel d’un peu moins de 2 % , représentant une amélioration significative au regard du taux annuel de plus de 20 % qui prévalait de septembre 2008 à mars 2009 .
De nombreux observateurs se sont emparés de cette nouvelle pour annoncer un rebondissement imminent .
Pourtant les ventes de nouveaux logements sont en baisse : de 1,4 million par an en 2005 à 350 000 par an aujourd ’hui , et le prix des logements est 50 % au - dessous de leur niveau observé au plus haut de la bulle , cette baisse se poursuivant dans la plupart des zones .
De plus , la production industrielle chute toujours , les petites entreprises souffrent et des signes de danger sont toujours visibles à l’horizon , parmi eux une nouvelle vague d’hypothèques , une plongée probable des valeurs immobilières et la réalité émergente que nous devons toujours nous occuper des titres financiers pourris qui sont au centre de la crise bancaire . [ 25 ]
Le président Obama a avancé l’argument selon lequel les renflouements sont justifiés afin de stabiliser le système assez longtemps pour que les dirigeants opèrent des changements fondamentaux dans les institutions et les règlementations , permettant à l’économie de repartir de l’avant plus saine et immune à de futures crises similaires .
Mais pas grand - chose ne suggère que le genre de transformations systémiques véritablement nécessaires ( celles qui seraient capables de faire fonctionner l’économie durant une période de repli prolongée ) est en préparation ni même envisagé .
Parallèlement , tandis que les institutions dépendantes de la croissance sont temporairement regonflées , l’ampleur finale des dégâts risque bien de ne faire que s’étendre : lorsque l’effondrement inévitable de ces institutions se produira effectivement , les conséquences seront vraisemblablement pires , tant la somme de capitaux dilapidée afin de tenter de les sauver aura été importante .
En épuisant les ressources non renouvelables comme les métaux , les minerais et les combustibles fossiles , nous avons volé le bien des générations futures .
En réalité , désormais nous volons à ces générations les moyens financiers qui auraient pu être déployés afin d’ériger un pont vers une économie soutenable .
La construction d’une infrastructure de production d’énergie renouvelable ( non seulement une capacité de génération , mais également de distribution et de stockage , ainsi que des solutions agricoles et de transport pour l’après pétrole ) nécessitera des investissements énormes et des décennies de labeur .
D’où proviendra le capital à investir si les gouvernements sont déjà noyés dans les dettes ?
Si nous avons dépensé près de 24 000 milliards de dollars pour remettre sur pieds une vieille économie dépourvue de perspectives de survie , que nous reste - t - il pour financer la nouvelle ?
Si la prescription actuelle destinée à soigner notre maladie économique se fourvoie , il en va de même pour beaucoup de remèdes proposés en vue de régler nos problèmes d’énergie .
Selon le diagnostic conventionnel , le niveau élevé du prix actuel du brut est à mettre au compte de la spéculation ; la solution devrait donc consister en une règlementation plus stricte des marchés pétroliers à terme ( ce qui est peut - être une bonne idée , même si cela ne touche pas le cœur du problème ) , tout en permettant davantage aux compagnies pétrolières de prospecter le pétrole domestique ( bien que les taux probables de production des champs pour le moment interdits d’accès soient relativement maigres , et auraient un effet négligeable sur les cours du pétrole ) .
Pourtant , en réalité les investissements supplémentaires dans des systèmes de production de combustibles fossiles ( dont la technologie du « charbon propre ») engendreront des retours déclinants , sachant que les ressources de meilleure qualité ont déjà été exploitées ; et simultanément cela détourne des capitaux qui pourraient autrement être investis dans l’énergie renouvelable sur laquelle nous devrons nous appuyer de manière croissante à mesure que les combustibles fossiles déclineront . [ 26 ]
Ce qui est nécessaire , mais pour le moment totalement inexistant , c’est une reconnaissance fondamentale du fait que les circonstances ont changé : ce qui fonctionnait durant les décennies passées ne saurait s’appliquer à l’avenir .
Ce qu’il faut faire : s’adapter à la nouvelle réalité
Si le diagnostic alternatif est correct , il n’y aura pas de solution simple à l’effondrement économique actuel .
Certaines maladies ne sont pas guérissables et nécessitent simplement que nous nous y adaptions et que nous tirions le meilleur de notre nouvelle situation .
Si l’humanité s’est effectivement embarquée dans la phase de contraction du mouvement industriel , nous devrions accepter le fait de trouver devant nous des niveaux de revenus bien moindres ( pour pratiquement tout le monde dans les pays riches , et pour les hauts salaires des pays plus pauvres ) , des possibilités de carrière différentes ( moins d’emploi dans la vente , le marketing et la finance ; davantage dans la production basique ) , une énergie , des transports et de la nourriture plus chers .
De plus , nous devrions accepter le fait que les aspects clés de notre système économique inextricablement liés à un besoin de croissance future cesseront d’être fonctionnels dans ce nouveau contexte .
Plutôt que de tenter de renflouer les banques et compagnies d’assurances à coup de trillions de dollars , il serait peut - être mieux de les laisser simplement couler , peu importe les conséquences néfastes à court terme , car elles couleront de toute façon à un moment ou à un autre .
Plus tôt elles seront remplacées par des institutions remplissant des fonctions essentielles dans une économie en repli , mieux tout le monde se portera .
Pendant ce temps les leaders d’opinion dans la société , et en particulier le président , doivent commencer à faire circuler l’information , de façon compréhensible et mesurée , selon laquelle la croissance ne reviendra pas et le monde est entré dans une phase économique nouvelle et sans précédent , mais que nous pouvons tous survivre et prospérer dans cette période transitoire pleine de défis si nous nous y appliquons et travaillons ensemble .
Au cœur de cette rééducation générale doit figurer la reconnaissance publique et institutionnelle de trois règles fondamentales de la soutenabilité : la croissance démographique n’est pas soutenable ; l’extraction actuelle des ressources non renouvelables ne l’est pas davantage et l’utilisation des ressources renouvelables ne le sera que si elle est faite à un rythme inférieur à celui de leur régénération naturelle .
Sans énergie bon marché , les échanges commerciaux mondiaux ne peuvent s’accroître .
Cela ne signifie pas la fin du commerce , mais seulement que les avantages économiques se déplaceront , à mesure que le coût des transports augmentera , vers la production et la consommation locales .
Or c’est peut - être là une manière trop enjolivée de présenter les choses : si et quand les pénuries de combustible surviennent , les systèmes d’approvisionnement fragiles et étirés de par le globe pourraient s’interrompre , entraînant de graves conséquences pour les consommateurs se retrouvant coupés de sources de biens essentiels .
Aussi devrait - on accorder une nette priorité à l’organisation de la résilience collective en privilégiant les sources d’approvisionnement locales et l’entretien de stocks régionaux plus importants , particulièrement en nourriture et combustibles . [ 27 ]
Il faut actuellement en moyenne 8,5 calories d’énergie provenant du pétrole et du gaz pour produire chaque calorie alimentaire .
Sans combustibles bon marché pour l’agriculture , la production alimentaire plongera et les agriculteurs feront faillite , à moins que des efforts proactifs soient entrepris afin de réformer le système et réduire sa dépendance vis -à - vis des combustibles fossiles . [ 28 ]
Manifestement , les sources d’énergie alternatives et les stratégies améliorant l’efficacité doivent être au centre des priorités , et doivent faire l’objet de recherches intensives à l’aide d’une panoplie de critères soigneusement sélectionnés .
Les meilleurs candidats devront être solidement financés , et même pendant que les combustibles fossiles sont toujours relativement peu onéreux : le temps de déploiement des infrastructures de production d’énergie renouvelable se mesurera inévitablement en décennies et nous devons donc lancer le processus dès maintenant , plutôt que d’attendre que le marché montre la voie .
Face aux crises du crédit et ( potentiellement ) de la monnaie , de nouveaux modes de financement de tels projets seront exigés .
Sachant que nos systèmes monétaire et financier actuels sont basés sur un besoin de croissance , il nous faudra inventer de nouveaux moyens de créer et prêter de l’argent .
D’importants efforts de réflexion visant à trouver des solutions en ce sens sont mis en œuvre , et certaines collectivités expérimentent déjà des coopératives à capital local , des monnaies alternatives et des banques sans intérêt . [ 29 ]
Le pétrole devenant de plus en plus cher en termes réels , nous devrons imaginer des moyens plus efficaces pour transporter les personnes et les biens .
Notre première priorité à cet égard doit être de réduire le besoin en transports par une meilleure urbanisation et des systèmes de production relocalisés .
Mais là où le transport est nécessaire , le rail lourd et léger sera probablement préférable aux automobiles et camions . [ 30 ]
Nous aurons également besoin d’une révolution dans les constructions pour minimiser le besoin en chauffage , en climatisation et en éclairage artificiel dans toutes nos habitations et bâtiments publics .
Cette révolution est déjà lancée , mais progresse actuellement beaucoup trop lentement en raison de l ’inertie des intérêts établis dans le secteur du bâtiment . [ 31 ] .
Ces projets nécessiteront davantage que des crédits locaux et des fonds ; ils feront en outre appel à des travailleurs qualifiés .
Cela fera non seulement naître une demande en installateurs de panneaux solaires et d’isolation de bâtiments , mais des millions de nouveaux producteurs agricoles et bâtisseurs d’infrastructures à faible coût énergétique seront également mis à contribution .
Toute une gamme de nouvelles carrières pourraient émerger et remplacer les emplois du marketing et de la finance en voie de disparition , pour peu que des formations abordables soient proposées dans les établissements d’enseignement locaux .
Il est intéressant de noter que les 23,7 trillions de dollars récemment consacrés aux sauvetages et garanties de remboursement aux États - Unis représentent presque 80 000 dollars pour chaque homme , femme et enfant du pays .
Un niveau d’investissement s’élevant à ne serait -ce qu’une fraction conséquente de cela pourrait financer toutes les formations nécessaires , tout en assurant un approvisionnement universel en biens de consommation essentiels durant la transition .
Qu’obtiendrions - nous pour notre argent ?
Une notion collective que , en temps de crise , personne n’est laissé au bord de la route .
Sans le sentiment d’engagement coopératif qu’un tel filet de sécurité aiderait à susciter , un peu comme ce qui fut réalisé avec le New Deal mais à une échelle plus vaste , la contraction économique pourrait se muer en une horrible bataille pour les miettes de la période industrielle agonisante .
Aussi controversée qu’elle puisse être , la question de la démographie doit être prise en considération .
Tous les problèmes liés aux ressources sont plus difficiles à résoudre lorsqu’il y a davantage d’individus nécessitant ces ressources .
Les États - Unis doivent encourager les familles plus petites et mettre en place une politique d’immigration cohérente en vue d’une croissance démographique zéro .
Ce qui n’est pas sans implications en termes de politique étrangère : nous devons aider les autres nations à réaliser leur propre transition économique de façon à ce que leurs citoyens n’aient pas besoin d’émigrer pour survivre . [ 32 ]
Si la croissance économique cesse d’être un objectif réalisable , la société devra trouver de meilleures façons de mesurer le succès .
Les économistes doivent arrêter de mesurer le bien - être à l’aide de l’outil contondant qu’est le PIB , et commencer à s’intéresser davantage aux indices de capital humain et social dans des domaines comme l’éducation , la santé et la culture .
Cette redéfinition de la croissance et du progrès s’est déjà amorcée dans certains secteurs , mais pour l’essentiel elle demande toujours à être mise en œuvre par les gouvernements . [ 33 ]
On peut d’ailleurs avancer l’argument selon lequel , quand tout cela aura été mis en place , il en résultera un mode de vie plus gratifiant pour la majorité des citoyens : un sens collectif plus accru , une meilleure connexion avec le monde naturel , un travail plus satisfaisant et un environnement plus sain .
Des études ont montré à plusieurs reprises que des niveaux de consommation plus importants ne se traduisent pas nécessairement en niveaux de bien - être vital plus élevés [ 34 ] .
Cela signifie que si l’on peut envisager le « progrès » en termes de bonheur et bien - être , plutôt que comme un processus toujours plus rapide d’extraction de matières premières , leur transformation en produits qui eux- mêmes deviennent rapidement des déchets , alors le progrès peut certainement perdurer .
Dans tous les cas , « vendre » ce projet ambitieux et inédit au grand public implique d’en souligner les bénéfices .
Plusieurs organisations explorent d’ores et déjà les possibilités de message et de communication autour de la transition . [ 35 ]
Mais les décideurs doivent comprendre que regarder le bon aspect des choses ne signifie pas promettre ce qui ne peut être réalisé , comme le retour à une époque de croissance prolongée et de consommation écervelée .
Le pouvons - nous ?
Le ferons - nous ?
Il est important de préciser les implications de tout cela aussi clairement que possible .
Si le diagnostic alternatif est correct , il n’y aura pas de « reprise » économique complète , pas cette année , la prochaine , ni dans cinq ou dix ans .
On pourrait assister à des rebonds temporaires nous ramenant à une fraction du pic d’activité économique , mais il ne s’agira que de brefs moments de répit .
Nous sommes entrés dans une nouvelle ère économique au cours de laquelle les anciennes règles ne s’appliquent plus .
Les taux d’intérêts bas et les dépenses gouvernementales ne se traduisent plus en stimulation de l’emprunt et créations d’emplois .
L’énergie bon marché n’apparaîtra pas simplement parce qu’il existe une demande .
Dans la plupart des cas , nous ne trouverons tout simplement pas de substituts aux ressources essentielles .
Globalement , l’économie continuera de se rétracter dans des crises et tressaillements jusqu’à ce qu’elle puisse être maintenue à niveau par l’énergie et les ressources matérielles que la Terre peut fournir de façon continue .
Bien entendu tout cela constitue une nouvelle très pénible à entendre .
On peut le comparer à votre médecin vous annonçant que vous avez contracté une maladie systémique et potentiellement fatale ne pouvant être guérie , mais seulement traitée par un remède d’appoint ; ce remède consistant à opérer des changements profonds dans votre mode de vie .
Certains lecteurs ne manqueront pas de faire remarquer que le changement climatique n’occupe pas une place proéminente dans cette discussion .
Il s’agit , après tout , de la plus grave catastrophe environnementale de l’histoire de l’humanité .
En effet , ses conséquences pourraient être bien plus sérieuses que la simple destruction des économies nationales : des centaines de millions d’êtres humains et des millions d’autres espèces pourraient être mis en péril .
La raison pour laquelle j’ai choisi de limiter ici mon évocation du changement climatique est ( en considérant que le diagnostic alternatif soit correct ) que ce n’est pas ce phénomène qui s’est avéré être l’obstacle le plus immédiat à la croissance économique , mais bien l’épuisement des ressources .
Néanmoins , si ce point ne fait pas encore l’unanimité , le changement climatique en lui- même et les mesures requises pour le minimiser représentent dans l’ensemble des limites pour la croissance , tout comme l’épuisement des ressources .
De plus , si nous échouons à encadrer efficacement le repli économique qui caractérisera les décennies à venir , il ne subsistera pas d’espoir de mise en place d’une réponse organisée et cohérente au changement climatique , une réponse se matérialisant par des efforts tant pour réduire l’impact du climat que pour s’y adapter .
Il est important de souligner , cependant , que les mesures défendues ici ( dont le développement de sources d’énergie renouvelables et d’une meilleure efficacité énergétique , une diminution rapide de la dépendance vis-à - vis des combustibles fossiles dans les transports et l’agriculture , et la stabilisation des niveaux démographiques ) figurent parmi les mesures susceptibles de contribuer à la réduction des émissions de carbone .
Est-il possible que cet essai influence la réflexion et les actions des dirigeants ?
Malheureusement , c’est peu probable .
Leur croyance en la possibilité et la nécessité d’une croissance continue est pernicieuse , et la notion selon laquelle la croissance n’est peut - être plus possible est à leurs yeux impensable .
Mais le diagnostic alternatif doit figurer dans les registres .
Cet essai , rédigé par un simple journaliste , représente à bien des égards la réflexion de milliers de scientifiques concrets ayant travaillé depuis des décennies sur des problèmes liés à la démographie , aux ressources , à la pollution et à la biodiversité .
Ignorer le diagnostic en lui-même , tel qu’articulé ici ou développé dans des dizaines de milliers d’articles scientifiques , pourrait nous faire passer à côté de notre dernière chance d’éviter un effondrement total , non seulement de l’économie , mais également de la civilité et de l’existence humaine organisée .
Cela pourrait nous exposer à un risque de discontinuité historique trouvant ses antécédents qualitatifs dans l’effondrement des civilisations romaine et maya . [ 36 ]
Or il n’existe pas de véritable précédent pour ce qui vraisemblablement nous attend , car ces exemples anciens d’effondrement affectaient des sociétés géographiquement délimitées dont l’influence sur leur environnement était tout aussi limitée .
La civilisation actuelle est globale , et son destin , celui de la Terre et de l’humanité , sont inextricablement liés .
Cependant même si les dirigeants continuent d’ignorer de tels avertissements , les individus et collectivités peuvent en tirer des leçons et entamer le processus d’élaboration de résilience , de détachement de la dépendance vis-à - vis des combustibles fossiles et des institutions enchaînées à la machine de croissance perpétuelle .
Nous ne pouvons nous permettre de rester spectateurs alors que les dirigeants mondiaux gâchent les occasions nous permettant de prendre conscience et de nous adapter aux limites de la croissance .
Nous pouvons initier des changements dans nos vies , et nous pouvons nous serrer les coudes avec nos voisins .
Et nous pouvons faire comprendre à nos milieux décisionnaires que nous désapprouvons leur allégeance au statu quo , mais qu’en revanche il existe d’autres options .
Est-il trop tard pour entamer une transition contrôlée vers une société post - énergies fossiles ?
Peut - être .
Mais nous ne le saurons pas si nous n’essayons pas .
Et si nous sommes amenés à fournir cet effort , nous devons commencer par admettre une réalité simple et crue : la croissance telle que nous l’avons connue ne peut plus faire partie de nos objectifs .

Notre système financier actuel fut élaboré durant une période de hausse soutenue de la quantité d’énergie disponible , ses concepteurs étant persuadés du fait qu’une croissance économique durable était à la fois inévitable et souhaitable .
Cette idéologie de la croissance s’est incarnée dans des structures financières systémiques pour la survie desquelles la croissance est nécessaire .[...]
Jusqu’à présent ce lien indirect , entre un système financier reposant sur la hausse perpétuelle de l’afflux de liquidités d’une part , et d’autre part une économie se développant année après année grâce à l’augmentation de l’énergie et des autres ressources disponibles , s’est relativement bien maintenu à l’exception de quelques exemples notoires comme la Grande Dépression .[...]

High court orders publication of US report , saying British foreign secretary 's actions were harmful to the rule of law
David Miliband , the foreign secretary , acted in a way that was harmful to the rule of law by suppressing evidence about what the government knew of the illegal treatment of Binyam Mohamed , a British resident who was held in a secret prison in Pakistan , the high court has ruled .
In a devastating judgment , two senior judges roundly dismissed the foreign secretary 's claims that disclosing the evidence would harm national security and threaten the UK's vital intelligence - sharing arrangements with the US .
In what they described as an " unprecedented " and " exceptional " case , to which the Guardian is a party , they ordered the release of a seven - paragraph summary of what the CIA told British officials – and maybe ministers – about Ethiopian - born Mohamed before he was secretly interrogated by an MI5 officer in 2002 .
" The suppression of reports of wrongdoing by officials in circumstances which cannot in any way affect national security is inimical to the rule of law , " Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones ruled .
" Championing the rule of law , not subordinating it , is the cornerstone of democracy . "
The summary is a CIA account given to British intelligence " whilst [ Mohamed ] was held in Pakistan ... prior to his interview by an officer of the Security Service " , the judges said .
The officer , known only as Witness B , is being investigated by the Metropolitan police for " possible criminal wrongdoing " .
The seven - page document will not be released until the result of an appeal is known .
However , the judges made clear their anger at the position adopted by Miliband , MI5 , and MI6 in their hard - hitting judgment .
An explanation was needed , they said , about " what the United Kingdom government actually knew about what was alleged to be cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or torture , in particular what Witness B knew before he interviewed [ Mohamed ] ... in Pakistan " .
The judges added that it was important to explain what MI5 " and others knew when they provided further information to the United States to be used in the interrogation " .
There was a " compelling public interest " to disclose what Miliband wanted to suppress , they said ; there was nothing in the seven - paragraph summary that had anything remotely to do with " secret intelligence " .
" In our view , as a court in the United Kingdom , a vital public interest requires , for reasons of democratic accountability and the rule of law in the United Kingdom , that a summary of the most important evidence relating to the involvement of the British security services in wrongdoing be placed in the public domain in the United Kingdom . "
The judges sharply criticised the way Miliband and his lawyers tried to persuade the Obama administration to back the suppression of the CIA material .
Lawyers acting for Mohamed , the Guardian and other media organisations pointed out that Obama had himself set up an inquiry into CIA practices and published details of their interrogation techniques .
In the end , Miliband had to rely for help on a CIA letter to MI6 claiming that disclosure of the document would harm the security of the US and UK .
The judges made it clear they did not believe the claim was credible .
" The public interest in making the paragraphs public is overwhelming , " they said .
The document would show what Witness B – an MI5 officer who interrogated Mohamed in Pakistan in 2002 – knew about Mohamed 's condition before he questioned him incognito in a Pakistani jail , the judges said .
The CIA secretly flew Mohamed to Morocco , Afghanistan and then Guantánamo Bay , the court has heard .
The judges criticised MI5 and MI6 for the belated disclosure of documents that revealed an MI5 officer was in Morocco when Mohamed was held there in a secret jail .
Miliband 's lawyers continued to argue that a number of passages in the judges ' ruling must be redacted as well as the seven - paragraph CIA document .
Jonathan Evans , the head of MI5 , admitted in a speech at Bristol University on Thursday that the Security Service had been " slow to detect the emerging pattern of US practice in the period after 9/11 " .
" But it is important to recognise that we do not control what other countries do , that operational decisions have to be taken with the knowledge available , even if it is incomplete , and that when the emerging pattern of US policy was detected , necessary improvements were made . "
He repeated the mantra that MI5 " does not torture people , nor do we collude in torture or solicit others to torture people on our behalf " .
However , he said the situation posed a dilemma .
" Given the pressing need to understand and uncover al - Qaida 's plans , were we to deal , however circumspectly , with those security services who had experience of working against al - Qaida on their own territory , or were we to refuse to deal with them , accepting that in so doing we would be cutting off a potentially vital source of information that would prevent attacks in the west ?
" In my view we would have been derelict in our duty if we had not worked , circumspectly , with overseas liaisons who were in a position to provide intelligence that could safeguard this country from attack .
I have every confidence in the behaviour of my officers in what were difficult and , at times , dangerous circumstances " .
When I was a grad student , I always felt weird about Keynes . �
I grew up in a home that was not explicitly “ free market ” but was implicitly so .�
My Dad was a small businessman and my Mom was a retail investor ( as well as home manager ) . �
My Dad ’s business did well , but it had its share of hard times , including the depression of 1979 - 1982 in the Rust Belt , where many of his competitors did not survive .�
He had to be a member of the local union and run a closed shop , but as an owner , he had no vote in union matters .
I worked for my Dad for two summers .�
During one of them , when we went to get parts , the parts dealer said to me , ” I ’ve heard good things about you . �
Even the union steward has heard about you . ” �
My face and my Dad ’s face went white .
I was not in the union .
After an uncomfortable pause , he said , “ Eeeaaah !
Got you ! ” and he laughed .�
Dad and I looked at each other , embarrassed but relieved .
My Mom , like Keynes , and like me , has beaten the stock market for most of her life . �
There are excess profits available for wise investors , some of which stem from the foolishness of other investors .
Keynes was a fascinating man who understood asset markets well , but when trying to consider the economy in general , looked to what would work in the short run . �
The author of Where Keynes Went Wrong points out repeatedly from Keynes ’ writings his view that interest rates are almost always too high , and that interest rates should only rise when inflation is rising quickly . �
Can lowering short term rates juice the economy .�
Yes , in the short run , but in the longer run it fuels inflation and bubbles .
The strength of Where Keynes Went Wrong is that it spends a lot of time on what Keynes actually said , rather than the way Keynesianism developed into a branch of Macroeconomics , eventually becoming part of the dominant macroeconomic paradigm — the Neoclassical Synthesis . �
I admit to being surrprised by many of the statements Keynes made — granted , the author is trying to prove Keynes wrong so he goes after what is least defensible .
The author dissects the errors of Keynes into a few main headings :
Lower interest rates are almost always better .
Growth comes through promoting consumption .
You ca n’t trust businessmen to do the right thing when it comes to capital allocation .
Government planning is superior to decentralized planning , because experts in government can allocate capital better than businessmen .
Crashes require government intervention .�
Using the balance sheet of the government will have no long run negative impacts .
Markets do not self - correct .
Globalization is good , and the nations of the world can cooperate on creating a standard of value independent of gold .
For the most part , those are my words summarizing the author . �
After going through what Keynes said , he then takes it apart point - by - point . �
The author generally follows the Austrian school of economics , citing Mises , von Hayek , and Hazlitt .
After that , the book continues by taking on the rhetoric of Keynes , both oral and written . �
He was one sharp man in being able to express himself — orally , there were few that could match him in debate . �
In writing , where time is not so much of the esssence , there is more time for readers to take apart his arguments , and point out the fallacies . �
The author points out much of the fallacies in how Keynes would argue his points .
The book finishes by pointing out the paradoxes involved in Keynesianism , e.g. , in order to reflate a debt - ridden system , the government must lower rates and borrow yet more .�
Also shows how beginning with manipulating the money supply leads to greater intervention in credit , banking , currency , and other economic policies over time , and why the politicians love the increase in power , even if they realize that the policies do n’t work .
One surprise for me was how many ways Keynes suggested to intervene in a slump , and how many of them are being used today .
Rates down to zero .
Direct lending by the Fed .
Directing banks to make certain loans .
Bailouts .
Nationalizing critical companies .
Inflating the currency .
The idea of letting the economy contract in any way was foreign to Keynes . �
He felt that a seemingly endless prosperity could be achieved through low interest rates .�
Well , now we have low rates , and a mountain of debt — public and private , individual and corporate . �
Welcome to the liquidity trap created by Keynesian meddling , together with the way our tax code encourages debt rather than equity finance .
I recommend the book ; it is an eye - opener . �
It makes me want to get some of Hazlitt ’s books , and , read the whole of Keynes General Theory for myself . �
The book that my professors once praised as a tour de force has holes in it , but better to read it all in context .
Quibbles
The book could have used a better editor .�
Too many things get repeated too often .�
The book also has two sets of endnotes , one for reference purposes , and one for expanded discussions . �
The endnotes that were expanded discussions probably belonged in small type at the bottom of the page rather than as endnotes .�
Many of the endnotes are quite good , and it is inconvenient to have to flip to the back to see them .
Also , on page 274 , the author errs . �
The risk to a business owner is higher after he borrows money .�
The total risk of the business is not higher , but the risk to the equity owner is higher . �
Whether that risk is double or not is another question .
There ’s another error on page 328 . �
When I buy stock in the secondary market , I am putting my capital to work , but someone else is withdrawing capital from the market .�
There is no net investment .�
When I buy an IPO , not only do I put my money to work , but there is more investment in the economy ( leaving aside the venture capitalists that are cashing out ) .�
It is hard to say when investment in the economy is increased on net .
The table on page 330 is confusing .�
The first row should have been set apart to show that GDP is not a government obligation .
Finally , I do n’t think that Say ’s Law ( “ Supply creates its own Demand . ”
Or in the modern parlance , “ If you build it , they will come . ” ) is true , but neither is its converse ( “ Demand creates its own Supply ” ) . �
The two are interconnected , and either one can cause the other . �
Markets are complex chaotic systems , and entrepreneurs sometimes produce goods that no one wants . �
Similarly , when consumers discover a new product or service , that demand can help create a whole new industry . �
Supply and demand go back and forth — the causality does n’t go only one way .
Who would benefit from this book : Send it to your Congressman , send it to your Senator . �
Make sure every member of the Fed gets one , and the fine folks at the Treasury as well .�
Beyond that , think of your liberal friends who think of Keynes as a hero , and give them one . �
After reading this , I want to add Keynes ’ General Theory to the list of books the everyone cites , and no one reads . �
( That list : The Bible , Origin of the Species , The Communist Manifesto )
If you want to buy it you can get it here : Where Keynes Went Wrong : And Why World Governments Keep Creating Inflation , Bubbles , and Busts .
Full disclosure : I review books because I love reading books , and want to introduce others to the good books that I read , and steer them away from bad or marginal books . �
Those that want to support me can enter Amazon through my site and buy stuff there .�
Don�t buy what you don�t need for my sake .�
I am doing fine .�
But if you have a need , and Amazon meets that need , your costs are not increased if you enter Amazon through my site , and I get a commission . �
Win-win .

Washington , September 12 : Actress Rebecca Romijn has revealed she has no plans of having more children in fear of '' ' ' overpopulating the world ' '' ' .
The ‘ X - Men ’ star , who looks after her eight - month - old twins with husband Jerry O'' Connell , said she was happy to have a four - member family .
" I ''m pretty sure that this is it .
We feel like the world was made for pairs .
Four feels like the perfect number , ” Contactmusic quoted her as saying to E !.
" Also , we ' 're not interested in overpopulating this world .
So we feel like we do n''t want to leave more than we are when we leave this planet , " she added .
The former model also spoke about the heartache about staying away from the kids due to work .
She added : " Mother ' 's guilt is no joke .
I feel like any stretch of time I spend away from them , I ''m worried that I ''m missing out on just these little miracles .
“ Like you watch them stare at their hand for an hour and they go take a three - hour nap and they wake up and they can do something that they did n''t do before - like wave ! " ( ANI )
( NEW YORK ) Fortune -- Dear Annie : I graduated from college with a civil engineering degree last spring , and I 'm planning to go to architecture school .
I want to focus my training on learning how to retrofit existing buildings and power plants to be more energy - efficient .
I 'm looking at schools in different parts of the U.S. ( I really could move anywhere at this point ) and wondering :
Where would be my best bet for finding a job when I graduate ?
Is California the best state for green jobs ?
What about Michigan ( where I live now ) ?
Also , I will have student loans to pay off , so do you know where I could get information about what kind of starting salary might be reasonable to expect ?
- Maria in Motown
Dear Maria : Your timing is terrific .
Many experts believe that , in the words of a new study by green - industry research firm Clean Edge , " we are just at the beginning of the ' clean tech ' job creation era " and that renewable energy , environmentally - friendly building and manufacturing , and all aspects of energy efficiency will offer " the greatest opportunity for wealth and job creation since the advent of computers and the Internet . "
Already , the economy is generating about 1.3 million new " green collar " jobs per year , says outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas .
By 2030 , the number of U.S. jobs directly or indirectly related to energy efficiency and conservation will reach 40 million , according to the nonprofit American Solar Energy Society .
Incidentally , their site , www.ases.org, includes a clean - tech job board you might want to check out .
And consider this :
The Pew Charitable Trusts estimated in June that green jobs right now account for about 770,000 jobs in the U.S. - comparable to employment in mature industries like telecommunications ( 989,000 jobs ) and far more than such established businesses as biotech ( 200,000 ) .
And while most observers expect a boom , clean energy employment already rose by 9.1 % between 1998 and 2007 , the Pew report found , versus 3.7 % growth for all jobs during the same period .
So where are all these green jobs ?
The Clean Edge study lists 15 metropolitan areas that are " current hotbeds of clean - tech job activity , " based on the number of existing green jobs , the amount of green investing going on , and clean - tech employers ' growth projections .
( You 'll notice that your hometown is No. 14 on the list , so you may choose not to move at all . )
The top 15 right now :
1. San Francisco -- Oakland -- San Jose , CA
2. Los Angeles -- Riverside -- Orange County , CA
3. New York -- Northern New Jersey -- Long Island , NY , NJ , CT , PA
4. Boston -- Worcester -- Lawrence -- Lowell -- Brockton , MA , NH
5. Washington -- Baltimore , DC , MD , VA , WV
6. Denver - Boulder - Greeley , CO
7. Seattle -- Tacoma -- Bremerton , WA
8. Portland -- Salem , OR
9. Chicago -- Gary -- Kenosha , Il , IN , WI
10 . Sacramento -- Yolo County , CA
11 . San Diego , CA
12 . Austin -- San Marcos , TX
13 . Phoenix , AZ
14 . Detroit -- Ann Arbor , MI
15 . Houston -- Galveston -- Brazoria , TX
Still , clean - tech jobs are n't expected to be concentrated in one particular area .
The researchers note that " the clean - tech revolution is a highly dispersed phenomenon , unlike the earlier high - tech revolution with its epicenter of Silicon Valley .
No one place or region will control any one clean - tech sector . "
As for what kind of starting salary to expect , the study - " Clean Tech Job Trends 2009 " and downloadable for free - lists a sampling of current green - collar jobs and what they pay .
A LEEDS - certified architect , such as you aspire to be , earns an average salary of $ 58,700 .
( LEEDS , as you probably know , stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design , a designation developed in 1993 by the nonprofit U.S. Green Building Council . )
Good luck !

Update : Word reaches
TheStory that these documents were dumped solely because they were released to The Sunday Tribune earlier today via FOI at the cost of €600 .
The Tribune were charged for the documents ( €600 is a massive fee for an FOI ) then they were put in the Dáil library almost immediately .
This is the most incredible behaviour from John O’Donoghue in attempting to get one over The Sunday Tribune who have consistently been a thorn in the side of expense - account - abusing public representatives for the last number of months .
John O’Donoghue clearly realises he can only hide for so long .

I have tabulated the foreign travel into a spreadsheet .
Total cost for foreign travel , 2007 – 2009 : €89,277.74

Ultra-Orthodox Jews have recently held a series of protests in Israel
US company Intel will stop employing Jewish workers at its Jerusalem plant on Saturdays , following a large protest rally by Orthodox Jews , reports say .
Under a compromise deal , Intel will only employ 60 non-Jewish staff on Sabbath - the Jewish day of rest , the reports in Israeli media suggest .
The deal was reportedly agreed at talks led by Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin .
Intel has so far made no comments .
Last week , about 1,000 Orthodox Jews protested at Intel 's Jerusalem office .
Intel , the world 's biggest maker of computer chips , ringed its offices with barbed wire before Saturday 's rally .
There were no reports of violence .
Mr Rivlin has presented the compromise proposal to United Torah Judaism leader Uri Makelev , following talks that also involved Intel Israel officials , Israeli media say .
Mr Makelev is expected to deliver a response by the ultra-Orthodox rabbis shortly .
Israel 's ultra-Orthodox Jews have become increasingly militant in recent months in their attempts to enforce a Saturday work ban .
They have held regular protests against the opening of a Jerusalem car park on the Jewish Sabbath .

A decision to enlist a Queens imam in an effort to develop information about the man at the center of a long - running cross-country terrorism investigation backfired earlier this month .
In fact , federal prosecutors have now charged the imam , a onetime source of information for the New York Police Department , contending that he betrayed the police by warning the suspect and then lied about it , and maybe even coached him on what to say if he was questioned .
Several law enforcement officials have said the imam ’s disclosures went a long way toward forcing their hand in an extremely sensitive investigation of a possible Qaeda plot .
The situation left them scrambling to conduct raids and arrest the suspect sooner than they might have otherwise , a development that they said could make it harder to identify others involved and develop evidence against them .
Several officials  all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because much of the investigation is classified  have said that the inquiry , which had been under way for months , could well have continued , tracking the communications , meetings , plans and associates of the suspect , Najibullah Zazi , 24 .
Mr Bout has allegedly sold arms to warlords in Africa and Afghanistan
A Thai court has rejected a US request for the extradition of Viktor Bout , an alleged Russian arms dealer dubbed the " Merchant of Death " .
The United States wants to put Mr Bout on trial on charges of supplying weapons to Colombian Farc rebels .
" The US charges are not applicable under Thai law , " said a Thai judge , who described the US case against Mr Bout as political , not criminal .
Mr Bout was arrested in a Thai - US sting operation in March 2008 .
" This is a political case .
The Farc is fighting for a political cause and is not a criminal gang .
Thailand does not recognise the Farc as a terrorist group , " said the judge delivering the verdict at Bangkok 's Criminal Court .
The Unites States has 72 hours in which to appeal against the ruling , during which time Mr Bout , 42 , will remain in detention .
A decision in the extradition hearing has been repeatedly delayed by a high turnover of defence lawyers .
United Nations agencies and several Western governments have reported that Mr Bout has delivered arms to dictators and warlords in Africa and Afghanistan , allegedly breaking several UN arms embargoes in the process .
He faces US charges of conspiring to kill Americans , conspiring to provide material support to terrorists and conspiring to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile .
He could face a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted in the US .
His lawyer argues that Mr Bout would not receive a fair trial in the US , where officials say he supplied arms to dictators , al - Qaeda and the Taleban .
He is being held in a maximum security prison outside Bangkok .
Data Analysis Reveals Consumers Are Paying Down , While the Federal Government Is Piling Up , Unprecedented Rates of Debt ; Massive Tax Increases Loom
by Bill Sardi
Recently by Bill Sardi : The Flu Vaccine Horror Story You Never HeardAbout
Data gleaned from governmental agencies reveals consumers are beginning to reduce their personal debts while the rate of debt growth by the federal government in the past two years is 3 — 7 times greater than in prior years in this decade .
While the annual rate of debt growth for consumer debt rose by around 10 — 11 % at the beginning of the decade , it came to a halt in 2008 and declined in 2009 .
Meanwhile , the rate of debt growth by the federal government , which ranged from 3.9 to 10.9 percent per year from 2002 to 2007 , rose to 24.2 % in 2008 and 28.2 % in 2009 .
A data review also reveals that :
For the first time since 1930 the rate of growth of the gross domestic product , everything produced by all the people and all the companies in the U.S. , has almost come to a complete stop in 2009 .
The federal government provides a rosier picture of the current economic meltdown , choosing to portray it as a brief recession rather than the complete and prolonged collapse of modern banking and currency systems that it is .
There is no technological breakthrough that would give reason for high rates of unemployment to drop , nor is there any meaningful reform of financial systems and institutions to prevent a repeat of the recent economic bubble that created false prosperity throughout the nation .
Any stimulus programs appear to be fleeting attempts to temporarily cover for major economic problems that demand true reform .
The growth in federal debt will peak in 2009 and begin to be reduced thereafter , according to projections by the Office of Management & Budget ( OMB ) , but this debt reduction reflects higher tax revenues rather than any cutbacks in government spending .
While the OMB predicts a $ 192 billion decline in individual federal income tax revenues between 2008 and 2009 , it inexplicably projects individual tax revenues will rise from less than $ 1 trillion in 2009 to $ 1.6 trillion in 2014 , which foretells huge increases in federal income tax rates rather than any rise in employment , wages or increases in exports or consumer spending .
While total federal debt increases over the next half - decade , it falsely appears to drop by nearly $ 400 billion in 2010 , as federal spending declines in the aftermath of the bank bailout / Fannie Mae-FreddieMac / troubled asset relief program .
Federal debt still is at unprecedented levels in upcoming years .
Furthermore , the OMB figures do n’t add up correctly .
The OMB estimates the gap between Federal revenues and federal government spending will be $ 535 billion in 2014 .
( See chart below . )
But using OMBs own figures , by 2014 there is a huge gap between individual income taxes collected ( $ 1.612 trillion ) and federal outlays ( $ 4.016 trillion ) .
Taxes on corporations will make up for some of that gap ( $ 420 billion ) , but that leaves a spending / tax revenue gap of $ 1.984 trillion in 2014 !
Taxes would need to be nearly doubled to eliminate debt financing of federal spending in 2014 .
The federal government gets into onerous debt when it passes legislation that requires funding without any source of revenue .
The gap between revenues and spending is then closed by obtaining loans , which becomes the national ( collective ) debt .
The President recently urged Congress to refrain from passing any future legislation that requires spending that is n’t offset by cuts in federal spending .
The week following the President ’s appeal for budget - neutral legislation , the Executive Branch proposed a massive health insurance reform plan that widened the gap between federal revenues versus spending by more than $ 1 trillion .
This gap was to be reduced by taxing health benefits provided by employers and by increased taxes upon wealthy Americans .

* 2nd Quarter 2009 data
The reaction of the federal government to a downturn in the economy has been to spend wildly almost as if there were no consequences .
Interest on the National Debt will rise from $ 142 billion 2009 to $ 460 billion in 2014 .
An article in the New York Times reveals interest payments on the current $ 12 trillion of accumulated national debt will exceed $ 700 billion a year in 2019 , up from $ 202 billion in 2009 .
As the New York Times article points out , an additional $ 500 billion a year in interest expense would total more than the combined 2009 federal budgets for education , energy , homeland security and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Such massive debt causes false employment and a false economy .
The current downturn in the economy , as the aftermath of the economic bubble brought on by cheap money policies at the Federal Reserve Bank and by relaxation of requirements to qualify for a home loan , now challenges every level of American society as to how to pay interest on its crushing debt .
The federal government is adding to the collective debt of Americans at a time when incomes are plunging and unemployment is rising .
It is unlikely the principal on the national debt will ever be paid down given derelict spending now underway .
The US Debt Clock tells all , in real time .
The Debt Clock shows that the US , with 108 million taxpayers out of a population of 307 million , with 43 million workers who pay zero income tax , and with 21 million US workers being on the public dole as federal , state or local employees , and nearly 16 million unemployed chasing about 2 million available job openings , this leaves less than 100 million taxpayers to shoulder the nation ’s bills .
The National Debt now adds up to $ 39,000 per taxpayer and other unfunded liabilities ( Social Security , Medicare and a prescription drug program ) amount to an additional $ 345,000 of debt per citizen .
Despite denials by politicians , according to a pie chart issued by the OMB ( see below ) , more federal revenues will be derived from huge increases in federal income taxes , while borrowing to make up for the federal deficit will subside .
This is because foreign lenders ( mainly China and Japan ) are reticent to lend America any more money , fearing the US will default on its loans either by devaluing the US dollar or by non-payment .
In 2009 the gap between spending and revenues was closed by printing more money , which threatens to cause inflation .
Fortunately , the newly printed money was parked at US banks and did not enter the economy to fan the flames of inflation .
The US Treasury says it will not print money to make up for spending gaps next year , which again suggests massive tax increases are inevitable .
Burden the wealthy
The United States has chosen to lay the burden for this economic mess upon upper - income groups .
According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation in Washington DC , the tax burden upon the top 1 % of tax payers now exceeds that paid by the bottom 95 % of taxpayers .
( See chart below . )
However , the Washington DC - based Tax Foundation reports that even the most onerous tax upon wealthy Americans cannot possibly close the anticipated deficit for 2010 .
According to Bill Ahern , director of policy and communications at the Tax Foundation , a 90 % federal tax rate on wealthy Americans plus state and local income taxes and other taxes would well exceed the entire income for many upper - income households .
There is no possible way the wealthy can shoulder this debt burden .
It will have to be spread across the income spectrum , raising taxes of joint filers from 10 — 35 percent to 27— 95 percent .
This essentially represents a tripling of the federal income tax .
For example , to balance the 2010 federal budget , a taxpayer paying $ 7,055 dollars would have to pay $ 20,515 , and a wealthy American who pays $ 800,000 in federal taxes would have to pay almost $ 2 million .
The Tax Foundation reports that even in 2012 , when the President ’s Budget projects a lower deficit , tax rates would still be need to be prohibitively high in order to balance the budget : nearly double , with rates ranging from 18.7 percent to 74.1 percent .

The Snake Oil Merchants
Who Sold Us A War !!
TvNews LIES
Looks at
The White House Iraq Group ( WHIG ) - Nov , 2005
Nothing will end war unless the people themselves refuse to go to war .
Albert Einstein THE PLOY
Talk about putting one over on the American people .
This one takes the cake , it really does .
Did you hear anyone even mention the White House Iraq Group until recently ?
Did you have a clue about who they were or what they were about ?
Luckily , Scooter Libby screwed up somehow and got himself indicted , and now we know .
Talk about a con job .
It seems that the White House Iraq Group was quite an impressive bunch with an even more impressive job .
They had to sell the entire population of the United States a really big dose of snake oil in a very short time .
I kid you not .
That really was their assignment , and boy did they ever carry it out in style !
The WHIG group met secretly , as is so characteristic of the Bush White House , and that might explain why so little was known about them .
They worked with the diligence and dedication of any fawning Bush task force and they ultimately succeeded beyond their wildest dreams .
Despite its reputation , WHIG snake oil was not as difficult a sell to Americans as one might imagine , especially after 9/11 .
Good salespeople know their market .
The group was organized in the summer of 2002 , when the nation was still reeling from the events of 9/11 and was largely distracted by the war against the Taliban .
In charge of the set - up was Andrew Card , the WH Chief of Staff .
Chairman of the committee was Karl Rove , then Senior Advisor to President George W. Bush .
Together , these two opportunistic charlatans gathered the very best and most successful spin doctors ever assembled in one place , and the plan was set in motion .
The goal was to market a new brand of snake oil developed by the neocons who had come into power in 2000 .
With practiced confidence , they came together to sell the American people something they really didnt want .
They plotted to sell them a war .
Let me run that by you one more time :
In August of 2002 , six men and three women got together in Washington , D.C. to devise a plan that would sell the invasion of Iraq to the people of this country .
It s totally mind - boggling , but that is exactly what they did .
But this is not a TvNews LIES scoop .
The story is not new .
The WHIG group was first identified in a Washington Post article in 2003 .
So why were people not screaming in the streets ?
But , we digress THE PLOTTERS
The nine merchants of death were chosen with care .
Some had high visibility while others worked in the background , but all were insiders with keys to the White House kingdom .
Not unlike the cast of Mission Impossible , each brought a singular skill to the table .
But unlike the high - minded characters in the series , the WHIGs were engaged in a nefarious and despicable scheme to delude a nation .
Here , then , is a list of the men and women who teamed up to sell us a war : Karl Rove : then Senior Advisor to the President ; now Deputy White House Chief of Staff in charge of policy .
Andrew Card : White House Chief of Staff
Condoleezza Rice : then National Security Advisor ; now Secretary of State
Mary Matalin : political strategist and consultant ; formerly an advisor to the President
Karen Hughes : then counselor to the President ; now Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy
Stephen Hadley : then Deputy National Security Advisor ; now National Security Advisor
Lewis ( Scooter ) Libby : then Chief of Staff and assistant for National Security Affairs to Dick Cheney ; now resigned ; founding member of Project for a New American Century
James R. Wilkinson : Deputy National Security Advisor for Communication
Nicholas E. Calio : Senior Vice - President for Global Government Affairs at Citigroup
This infamous array of accomplished Americans did their dirty work in the House of the People .
They sat in OUR White House trying to devise a way to betray us all .
That s probably the most insulting aspect of it all .
Understand that this unearthly cabal was formed to use its cunning and its expertise to draw the United States into an illegal , immoral , and ultimately failed war against Iraq .
And keep in mind as well that it worked like a charm .
THE PITCH
The WHIG group met to formulate a plan that would convince an unsuspecting public that invading Iraq was vital to their own security .
They were plotting their strategy even as George Bush was assuring the nation that military action was a last resort in his foreign policy .
They were coordinating their sales pitch months before George Bush so brazenly sold Congress their impeachable lies .
The WHIGs knew that planning ahead was an effective sales policy .
Duping Congress was easy ; selling the war to the majority of Americans was a bit more challenging .
In order to break down any resistance to an invasion that was already a done deal , the WHIG pros knew exactly what they had to do .
The primary strategy in their plan was to escalate the rhetoric about the danger that Iraq posed to the US .
They would saturate the news networks with their fabricated tales of nuclear stockpiles and chemical weapons .
They would sell their ominous warnings of mushroom clouds and weapons of mass destruction with a vengeance .
They would provide the fodder for propaganda speeches that the President would read to the nation , and that the Secretary of State would deliver to the United Nations .
And of course , they would cleverly establish a damning link between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda , and more deviously  between Saddam Hussein and 9/11 .
The case for war was being professionally packaged , hyped and sold .
The perfect forum for publicizing the WHIG wares was theirs for the asking .
News networks opened their arms to the war mongers and shamefully competed for their participation .
Not a single voice of dissent was permitted by the corporate media , as the WHIG promotion for war was broadcast to every home in the nation for months on end .
Fast forward now to March of 2003 .
The time between had been filled with WHIG members and their spokesmen - Cheney , Rumsfeld , Powell , Wolfowitz , Chalabi , Kristol and other cohorts  spewing WHIG mantras day after day .
The snake oil sales people were anywhere and everywhere , pushing the war and selling it well .
They did such a good job that after only seven months of snake oil sales the Bush regime was able to launch Shock and Awe .
The bombardment of Baghdad was hailed as the first step in a War against Terror .
The snake oil had taken effect .
The WHIGs had suckered most of the nation into cheering the onset of Operation Iraqi Freedom .
They had conned the American people into asking their God to bless the country that was raining daisy cutters and 500 pound bombs on other human beings .
They truly believed that by going to war with Iraq , George Bush was going to save them from imminent annihilation .
Snake oil , in the right hands , can be smooth , sedating and seductive .
And so , without a single headline to expose their crimes , the White House Iraq Group sold the nation a war .
Without a single investigative report about the lies and deceptions of their sales techniques , the WHIGs accomplished their mission .
Without a single newscaster to question the hoax that had been perpetrated on the nation , the WHIG members could congratulate themselves for a job well done .
And the rest , as they say , is history .
THE PAYOFF
This group should have made headlines across the nation .
It did not .
It was given far less coverage than any high profile wife slaying of the day .
The work of the White House Iraq Group should have been exposed by every news network in the nation before the 2004 election .
It was not .
The people of the United States had the right to know .
They did not .
Even now , with the WHIG group uncovered as a result of Plamegate , there is no discernable outrage over their mission .
The lies that led us to war do not appear to disturb the nation as a whole .
A secret plot to frighten the American people into supporting a war seems almost commonplace .
So they lied .
Not a big deal .
If that is how it is , the nation is lost .
If cynicism and apathy rule the day , there is no more America is we knew it .
If the WHIG group passes into history as an acceptable agency of government , there is nothing at all left for us to hope for Not surprisingly , the corporate media have remained compliantly unresponsive .
They have not made this hoax an issue for discussion or exposure .
The pundits and reporters refer to the WHIGs with no special concern or curiosity .
They existed , they did their job , and we went to war .
End of story .
But it is not the end of the story .
This administration has three more years to go .
The war shows no signs of abating .
At this moment , the chaos and the deaths in Iraq are rarely newsworthy , and the policy set in motion by the WHIG machinery moves ever forward .
WHIG efforts have paid off handsomely .
The full payoff , however , is yet to come .
Condoleezza
Rice recently said she would not rule out the possibility of a US military presence in Iraq for another ten years .
The media made very little of that remark .
War is hell  deal with it .
Thousands more will die in the war that the White House Iraq Group was hired to promote .
It seems fairly certain that no members of the group will be held accountable for their despicable deeds .
They were hired guns who have a great deal of blood on their hands , but they know that blood washes off .
Snake oil does not .
So be it .
Weve put the story out again .
Share it if you wish .
Make others aware of the wool that was so expertly pulled over their eyes .
One has to wonder why there is so much indifference and complacency in light of such subterfuge .
Maybe its the snake oil .
' Wash Post ' Hires Key White House SpeechwriterAide - Gerson , a member of the White House Iraq Group , has been credited with several memorable Bush phrases , including " axis of evil . "
He has been active in the religious community , and in its February 1 , 2005 issue , Time Magazine called him the nation 's 9th most influential evangelical , labeling him " The President 's Spiritual Scribe . "
It said , " The former journalist shares Bush 's devout Christian faith and his view that the role of Providence in human affairs should be reaffirmed in the public square . "
A South Korean warship has exchanged fire with a North Korean naval vessel , reports from both countries say .
Officials in Seoul say the South Korean vessel opened fire when the Northern ship crossed a disputed sea border .
The North Korean vessel then fired back .
North Korea insists its ship did not cross the border , and has demanded an apology , according to news agency KCNA .
The White House warned North Korea against any further action that could be seen as an " escalation " .
The two navies have engaged in deadly exchanges twice along their western sea border in the past decade .
The incident comes days before US President Barack Obama visits Asia , with North Korea seeking direct talks on its nuclear programme .
Northern limit
In the North 's version of events , a patrol boat was on a mission to confirm " an unidentified object " on the North 's side of the border , and while it was sailing back , South Korean ships chased it and opened fire in a " grave armed provocation " .
ANALYSIS John Sudworth , BBC News , Seoul
Any military clash between North and South Korea will be regarded by governments in this region as extremely serious .
There are however a number of precedents , exchanges of fire between the two navies that have led to casualties on both sides but no further military escalation .
The South , though , has accused the North of deliberately provoking these kinds of naval clashes to raise tension and increase its leverage in negotiations .
Multilateral disarmament talks have broken down , and the North is seeking bilateral talks with the United States , a forum analysts say it sees as more likely to win it the concessions it seeks .
The North Korean vessel " lost no time to deal a prompt retaliatory blow at the provokers " , KCNA said .
" Much flurried by this , the group of warships of the South Korean forces hastily took to flight to the waters of their side . "
Seoul 's military has also demanded an apology for the incident .
South Korean officials said none of their troops had been hurt , while the North 's boat had been set ablaze before it sailed away .
In October , North Korea 's navy accused South Korea of sending warships across their maritime border to stir tensions , and warned that further incursions could spark retaliations .
The communist state 's navy said that on one day alone , ships had crossed the boundary 10 times .
South Korea recognises the Northern Limit Line , drawn unilaterally by the US - led United Nations Command at the end of the 1950 - 53 Korean War , which has never been accepted by North Korea .
The last two major deadly clashes in the disputed waters took place in 1999 and 2002 during battles that lasted less than 30 - minutes .
PREVIOUS CLASHES 1996 : A North Korean submarine runs aground in South Korean waters 1998 : South Korea captures a North Korean mini-submarine in its waters 1999 :
At least 17 North Korean sailors believed killed in naval fire fight 2002 : Four South Korean sailors and an estimated 30 North Koreans killed in a naval battle Both Koreas are part of the Six Party Talks process designed to end North Korea 's nuclear weapons programme .
Relations between the two thawed slightly in the 1970s , and then in 1991 after both signed a basic agreement with a goal of reunification .
In October 2007 the countries ' leaders pledged to seek talks to formally end the Korean War , but this year the tension heightened again and the deal stalled .
North Korea has said South Korea 's decision in May to join a US - led initiative to search ships for nuclear weapons caused it to abandon the 1953 truce that had ended the war .

Physician recruiting is not all about getting a suitable candidate to sign a contract .
It includes all the aspects of the candidate ’s experience , during and after the interview .
The hiring entity is expected to support the candidates for the first two years to prevent high staff turnover .
When physician recruiting is hurriedly done , it turns out to be expensive in the long run .
The physician recruiting process can be challenging but fulfilling if done well .
The process is often daunting and fraught with hurdles .
To help you streamline physician recruitment exercise , use this guide .
Spread your search wide
One of the most convenient ways to advertise the vacant position is the internet .
It would be best if you did targeted advertisements .
An inquiry from others in the health sector would help you know which job boards worked for them .
Get an expert to build you a go - to site portfolio .
Do not overlook virtual and in - person career fairs because you can find the best - suited fit for your search .
The best talent to fill the vacancy is probably perusing the pages of trade publications and journals .
Have you posted your needs in these articles ?
And when you do so , ensure to place classifieds in each to increase your visibility .
What about Linkedln , Doximity on the social media platforms ?
These resources are rich with resumes for physicians who are seeking employment and new career opportunities .
Go global
Projections reveal that by 2030 medical professionals will be in acute shortage .
The scarcity of medical professionals will be specialty and primary care physicians .
To attract , hire , and retain the best - talented physicians for your organization .
There ’s a need to search beyond your locality when you expand your search .
This way , you increase your chances of recruiting suitable candidates .
Consider graduates from foreign origin who might have completed fellowship programs .
Or , if you can afford to sponsor work visas , take the plunge and have the best medical professional join your team .
Be patient
The medical sector is a highly competitive field .
Every medical organization is seeking to fill their post with qualified , top - notch physicians .
If you give yourself strict deadlines , you ’ll burn out and get frustrated .
The chances of not hiring the right candidate are also high .
Allow sufficient time to fill the vacancy with a skilled and experienced candidate .
Remember , the candidate will work with you for long if their temperament is right and fits into its culture , traditions , and practice .
Hurriedly hiring a candidate you ’re not sure about can lead to turnover after a short while .
Save yourself the trouble and be patient .
Settle for a flexible , internal compensation plan
Are you offering anything above the basic salary ?
Highlight additional benefits and draw a structured compensation plan that balances employee and organization fairness .
What are your incentives for a top- performance ?
Do you recognize and reward improvement in productivity ?
It ’s imperative to note that the physician incentive compensation plan ’s design significantly alters a physician ’s perception .
It also informs how well they ’ll provide care to their clients .
A poorly designed compensation plan reflects the organization ’s overall quality of patient satisfaction , cost , and maintenance .
On the other hand , a well - designed program improves clients ’ satisfaction and enhance quality care .
Most organizations give a bonus of at least 5 % of the fixed salary .
The incentive is paid quarterly to keep the employee on top gear .
Incentives can also be non-monetary .
It ’s essential to draw a formal orientation and mentoring program to help new employees fit with minimal challenges .
Doing so allows them to appreciate the organization ’s potential benefit to their growing career .
Win over the candidates from the beginning
There ’s never a second chance to make the first impression .
The trust you build during the physician ’s recruitment process will significantly determine their retention decision .
Be keen on how you present the written description .
Ensure to be consistently professional , transparent , and truthful to the job description .
When you interview on the phone , email , or virtual status , commit to answering all candidates ’ questions .
Do n’t make promises you do n’t intend to keep .
Build on the organization ’s strength to avoid glossing over the negatives raised .
Above all , be a good listener , respond thoughtfully , and concisely .
Effective communication is crucial .
Use the entire workforce for orientation
The new staff needs a welcoming , accommodating team for them to blend .
Involve the members of your team in their orientation .
Doing so gives them first - hand experience of the team ’s culture , core values , and mission .
Let your public relations assistant provide them with a tour of the hospital .
It would be courteous to follow the visit with an email or phone call .
These little , kind gestures will help the candidate form an excellent working relationship with the entire team .
Highlight your geographical dynamics
The candidate seeking to fill the position is seeking to lead a good life .
Showcase the highlights of your immediate locality .
What features does your region take pride in ?
Are its cultural wealth , historical sites , and attractions ?
Or is it social - cultural activities that are predominantly found in the area ?
Do n’t forget to gloat over other benefits the candidate will tap — for instance , proximity to recreational facilities such as schools , sports fields , and courts .
These factors apply whether you ’re hiring in a rural , urban , or suburban set up .
You are the most informed ambassador for your locality .
How you showcase your region can help you attract and retain the best of physicians .
Focus on your market strength
Health workers appreciate the professionalism and positive work experience .
These two factors are essential to retaining your newly recruited physician .
The same factors that influence the successful candidate during the physician recruitment process are the same that will impact their retention .
They ’ll be keen to validate the claims made during the interview .
Some of the critical factors when an organization seeks to retain members of staff are :
A hospital management system that includes registration , patient check out , report generation , and database .
A non-functional management system which are processes such as performance , security , maintainability , and reliability .
Access to social - cultural and career networking opportunities that offers a platform for professionals to interact and build their practice .
Community safety against external aggression .
Accessibility to social - economic amenities .

I confess , I 'm a little surprised to see someone defending rent control in this day and age .
There is almost no economist consensus so complete -- left to right -- as that rent control is " the best way to destroy a city 's housing stock short of aerial bombardment " .
But commenter Muzzybelly takes the contrarian position :
Most Babies Born Today May Live Past 100
An increase in life spans may lead to major changes in society .
Oct. 1 , 2009  --
Living to 100 may be seen as a long life now , but according to a new review , it may be the norm for babies born today .
The article , appearing in the medical journal The Lancet , shows that based on current trajectories , more than half of all babies born in industrialized nations since the year 2000 can expect to live into the triple digits .
The trends included in the article show that many Western nations will have most people living past 100 , with half of all babies born in 2007 in the U.S. likely to live to age 104 .
" I guess it 's good news for individuals and a challenge for societies , " said Dr. Kaare Christensen , an epidemiologist with the Danish Aging Research Center at the University of Southern Denmark , the study 's lead author .
" If this trajectory continues , half the babies will be 100 and I think that gives us a new perspective for how to plan your life , basically , " he said .
" If you 're going to retire when you are 60 or 65 , it looks quite different when your life expectancy is 75 or 80 than when it 's 100 . "
Christensen said that while the progress in life span during the first part of the 20th century came by reducing infant mortality , increases in longevity since then have come from improving life at older ages , and that will need to persist for the projection to hold up .
" If we want to have a continuing increase in life expectancy , the progress has to occur at older ages , " he said .
" I do n't hear any concerns among the elderly that they are living too long . "
Christensen said that the aging population will also likely be a more vibrant population , with a higher quality of life than people of that age now .
" The good news is people will generally be functioning well -- it 's more like they 're postponing their aging process , " he said .
Some researchers backed the new report 's hypothesis .
" Based upon the best possible approximations , I believe they are correct in their assessment of age projections , " said Dr. Stephen Helfand , a professor in the division of biology and medicine at Brown University in an e-mail .
" Their evidence appears overwhelming in favor of their hypothesis .
At the same time , some question whether the full prediction -- that most babies born today will live past 100 -- is fully accurate .
" I think that 's a very optimistic scenario ; however , there may be chronic health problems that may not allow us to follow that best - case scenario , not yet , " said Hector Gonzalez , an assistant professor of medicine and public health at Wayne State University .
" There 's no reason to think more than half the population living today can't live until 100 , " said Dr. Harrison Bloom , senior associate at the International Longevity Center of New York .
" But that would assume better eating habits , a healthier lifestyle and continuing improvements in the environment .
That lifestyle would definitely mean less obesity .
The diabetes and obesity epidemic today is very real .
A lot of people are going to die earlier than their projected life span would have been . "
Changes for an Aging Population
Regardless of age , researchers agreed that we are seeing a change in population demographics that will alter how society functions .
" There are many significant consequences to an increase in longevity , which are obvious to most people , " said Helfand .
" People living longer will change the entire demographics and , perhaps , needs of a nation . "
" More older persons living longer and living better -- there will also be an absolute increase in persons with disability and requiring care , " said Dr. Eric B. Larson , executive director of the Group Health Research Institute in Seattle .
" This will cause us to need to rethink health care for all ages , but especially for seniors -- most likely this would mean a focus more on rehabilitation and pre-habilitation , health and functional maintenance and less focus on individual sickness and acute care . "
Some worry that changes that come may not be positive .
" Unfortunately , I think what we 're seeing , especially with the obesity epidemic , is people are living longer , but they 're not necessarily healthier , and that 's where we really need to focus , " said Gonzalez .
" That 's a huge economic burden , to take care of a lot of sick people .
" I'm a little troubled , actually , that society is aging , and a large proportion of the older population will be made up of a lot of skilled workers .
My chief concern is that right now we have gutted a lot of our educational opportunities and that we may not have the skilled work force necessary to support an older population . "
Gonzalez said part of the problem is reflected in ethnic disparities , where minorities -- who will make up an increasing percent of the population -- have more health problems and less education .
Others noted that while disparities are present , there is also an increasing , vital group of older people that is likely to continue growing , even if it will not be a majority of the country in a century .
" A large percent of the older population is still very active physically and cognitively .
It 's definitely true that there will be a lot more people over 100 , " said Bloom .
Older But Wiser ?
Changing demographics may mean some unprecedented changes in the work force as well , particularly since many are likely to keep working longer .
" That will be one of the major challenges , to keep the elderly in the workforce , and at the same time to make work for the younger generations , " said Christensen .
" That 's for sure going to be something that requires a lot of new thinking .
That will be a new situation . "
But an increasingly older population may have some benefits over the present demographics .
" One commodity that may emerge is an increase in wisdom , " said Helfand .
" It appears that wisdom , or an ability to compromise , does come with age , " he said .
" Having more people with experience -- not just technical , but also emotional and psychological experience -- should be beneficial .
( For example , it often takes older statesmen to make compromises that will benefit their country 's longer term benefit , than younger less compromising statesmen . )
Time -- age -- usually improves decision - making . "

FP - Syd # 20 .
On October 22th we held the 20th meeting of FP - Syd , the Sydney Functional Programming group .
The meeting was held at Google 's Sydney offices and we had about 28 people show up to hear our two presenters .
First up we had Roman Leshchinskiy and his presentation " Loop Fusion in Haskell " , work that is part of GHC's Data Parallel Haskell library .
Loop fusion depends on the ability to convert operations on arrays into operations on streams .
Then , when applying multiple stream operations , adjacent conversions to and from streams can be dropped , allowing further inlining .
The real beauty of this approach is that stream operations and data parallelism can be written as a library outside of the GHC compiler and then depend on the compiler to do most of the heavy lifting .
Romain then moved on to explain that this work was just as applicable to general parallel computation on multicore systems as it was to clusters and GPUs .
Our second presenter for the evening was Barry Jay who gave us an introduction to " Pattern Calculus " .
Barry 's work on Pattern Calculus was inspired by the fact that while lambda calculus is able to adequately explain computation , it does not explain operations on data well .
In particular , lambda calculus does not distinguish between variables and data constructors while in the pattern calculus constructors are treated as a separate class ; matchable symbols .
The ideas behind Pattern Calculus are explained more fully in Barry 's book :
A big thanks to both our speakers and to Shane Stephens and Google for providing the meeting venue and the light refreshments .

WASHINGTON , D.C. --
Those pesky founding fathers .
Some days it 's hard to keep their statements straight .
John Boehner , the Republican congressman from southwestern Ohio who also happens to be the House minority leader , addressed a gathering of Republican and Republican - leaning citizens Thursday on Capitol Hill .
They were fired up , fighting for the rights guaranteed by America 's patriots .
So it was only appropriate that when Boehner joined the tea party , he waved a copy of " the Constitution " and read from it .
Except his words were from the Declaration of Independence .
An excuse can be made that what Boehner actually waved is a booklet given to all Congress members , and it includes both the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence .
Problem , is , Boehner said , " This is my copy of the Constitution .
And I 'm going to stand here with our founding fathers , who wrote in the preamble , ' We hold these truths to be self - evident ... ' "
Said Cory Fritz , Boehner 's spokesman : " Both texts are vital to the liberty beloved by every American . "
Boehner unquestionably loves and appreciates that liberty .
But to help him savor it more ( and to rub it in ? ) , the Ohio chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has sent him a booklet that has not only the Constitution but also the ACLU 's take on civil liberties .
It has a guide on what to do when questioned by law enforcement , and a nationwide directory of ACLU contacts " in case you are ever in need of legal assistance . "
This , said executive director Christine Link , may help avoid " future confusion . "
Mr. Maleki was covering a demonstration on June 20 when he and dozens of protesters were chased by members of the Basij paramilitary force .
They fled to an apartment building , where Mr. Maleki had enough time to hide his camera inside a chimney before members of the militia arrested them .
He was jailed with hundreds of others for a day .
Without his camera , authorities could not identify him as a photographer , but they recorded his national identity number .
Image Ehsan Maleki , a photographer , is one of many journalists leaving Iran in the wake of the disputed June presidential election .

Mr. Maleki never went home .
A few days later a neighbor told him that his house had been ransacked and that his computer and personal documents , including his passport , had been taken .
“ They found out that I was sending pictures to Sipa , ” he said , referring to an international photo agency .
He said he slept in a different place every night and continued to take photos of the protests , but finally decided it was too risky to stay .
He paid $ 150 to a smuggler who drove him to Kheneryeh , near the border with Turkey and Iraq .
Accompanied by a Kurdish guide , he crawled among a large herd of sheep for half an hour until they crossed the Iranian border and reached a steep cliff .
“ It took us seven hours to climb down and reach a road in northern Iraq , ” he said in a telephone interview from Iraq .
He would not disclose which city he was in for security reasons .
The journalists leaving Iran come from a range of news organizations , not just those sympathetic to the opposition .
A Web site supportive of Mr. Ahmadinejad , Parcham.ir , reported last week that two journalists for state - run television had defected to Italy and Britain .
At least two photographers who worked for Fars have also left .
Among the journalists who have left is this reporter , who covered the election and subsequent protests before leaving Iran in early July because she felt her safety was threatened .
The exact number of journalists who have left is not clear .
Some worry that their families could be harassed if the government learns they are gone .
Others are reluctant to reveal their locations in neighboring countries like Turkey and Iraq , fearing that government agents might find them and return them to Iran .
Javad Moghimi , a photographer who worked for Fars , acknowledged that he became emotionally invested in the protests .
“ The protesters were young , just like me , ” Mr. Moghimi , 24 , said in a telephone interview from Turkey .
“ It was impossible to be indifferent .
I felt it was my duty to take pictures and reflect their voices abroad . ”
Ah , stop lights .
The great equalizer .

Recently I was having some dental work done ( some crowns put on ) , and I was very intrigued by the technology that they were using–so intrigued that I decided to make a mini-documentary about the process .
Basically , they were using desktop manufacturing ( not quite 3 - D printing , but something close ) to make me a new crown on the spot , using computer assisted design .
Because I can't splice videos from my iPhone ( and because of YouTube 's length limit ) , there are two videos .
The first shows how the crown is physiclaly manufactured ( actually , the end of the process ) and the second showing how the new tooth is designed on the computer .
Check them out .
( And do n't worry .
There is no drilling or anything like that in the documentary .
The focus is exclusively on the tech . )

I 'm still figuring out the best way to do this .
At least this time I remembered to get the aspect ratio right ! )

But given C - 3P0 and Chewbacca , we 're in that loose territory . )
BTW , I want to give a very special thank you to Dr. Adam Raschke , who was an excellent documentary partner .
He was very articulate and informative , and without him I could n't have produced this kind of documentary , which was totally unscripted ( making up our words as we went along ) , unedited ( no cuts , no splices , no rearrangements ) , and unrehearsed ( no re-takes , no walk - throughs ) .

The debate over the lengthy hours and the sleepless overnight shifts that characterize medical training programs continues to rage , both in the U.S. and abroad .
But new research published in the October 14 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association underscores that getting enough sleep is n’t only crucial for medical residents .
In an analysis of nearly 1900 surgical and obstetrical procedures performed by attending physicians — that is , senior doctors who have completed training — the day after completing overnight shifts , researchers found that , in surgeries , mistakes were made nearly twice as often when the doctor had slept fewer than 6 hours , compared with those performed by surgeons who had gotten more sleep .
The study , led by Dr. Jeffrey M. Rothschild of Brigham and Women ’s Hospital in Boston , set out to determine whether working late night or overnight shifts ( between 12 AM and 6AM ) negatively impacted doctor ’s performance the day after .
Rothschild and colleagues analyzed data for procedures performed between January 2000 and December 2007 by 86 surgeons and 134 obstetricians and gynecologists who had just worked a late night or overnight shift .
Those were then compared with some 8,500 procedures performed by doctors who had n’t just pulled all - nighters .
They found that , proportionately , the rates of errors were comparable , and statistically insignificant , between control and “ post nighttime ” surgeries — 4.9 % compared with 5.4 % , respectively .
( The most frequent complications — errors — during surgeries were injured organs and bleeding . )
Longer shift length too was associated with slightly higher , but statistically negligible differences in rates of complications — physicians who worked 12 or more hours in a shift had complications in 6.5 % of procedures , compared with 4.3 % for those who worked fewer than 12 hours .
Yet what was statistically significant , the researchers point out , was the difference in errors made by surgeons who had less rest .
“ Surgeons who had limited opportunity for sleep had significantly higher rates of complications than those who had a longer sleep opportunity , ” they write .
In fact , among surgeons who had slept fewer than 6 hours the night before , mistakes were made in 6.2 % of surgeries , compared to just 3.4 % in those who ’d gotten at least 6 hours of rest .
Interestingly , the researchers did n’t find this same increase in complications among obstetrical and gynecological procedures performed by doctors who ’d gotten less sleep .
They suggest this might reflect the lower number of complications generally found in deliveries compared with surgeries , but recommend further studies to analyze the impact of exhaustion on attending physicians in obstetrics and gynecology , and across a broad range of specialties .
Future studies are essential to determining how safe it is for doctors to perform procedures after working into the wee hours , the researchers suggest .
And in the meantime , they write , “ [ f ] or situations in which it is necessary for attending physicians to conduct life - saving procedures following overnight work , effective strategies to minimize the effects of fatigue should be adopted into practice . ”
Lee Daniels 's Precious : Based on the Novel " Push " by Sapphire is a vibrant , honest and resoundingly hopeful film about the human capacity to grow and overcome .
Set in Harlem in 1987 , it is the story of Claireece " Precious " Jones ( Gabourey Sidibe ) , a sixteen - year - old African - American girl born into a life no one would want .
She 's pregnant for the second time by her absent father ; at home , she must wait hand and foot on her mother ( Mo'Nique ) , a poisonously angry woman who abuses her emotionally and physically .
School is a place of chaos , and Precious has reached the ninth grade with good marks and an awful secret : she can neither read nor write .
Precious may sometimes be down , but she is never out .
Beneath her impassive expression is a watchful , curious young woman with an inchoate but unshakeable sense that other possibilities exist for her .
Threatened with expulsion , Precious is offered the chance to transfer to an alternative school , Each One / Teach One .
Precious does n’t know the meaning of " alternative , " but her instincts tell her this is the chance she has been waiting for .
In the literacy workshop taught by the patient yet firm Ms. Rain ( Paula Patton ) , Precious begins a journey that will lead her from darkness , pain and powerlessness to light , love and self - determination .

Going on a vacation to Thailand you will probably be shocked by the street vendors that will try to sell you a fake ID card , drivers license , press card or even degree diploma , but do n’t worry – that ’s just a common thing on the streets in Thailand .
Daybreak , by Maxfield ParrishThis analysis copyright 2009 by Scott M. McDanielDaybreak was the 20th century 's single most popular print in America .
According to Alma Gilbert , the House of Art ( which handled the printing ) estimated that 1 out of every 4 homes in America had a copy .
When I first started reading up on this painting I constantly ran across the term " Dynamic Symmetry . "
It was the system that Parrish had used to lay out the composition and arrange the elements .
When I looked around for a good description of it , I did n't turn up much .
However , Jay Hambidge 's book on it from 1920 was available through Amazon , so I ordered it .
This is , I believe , the same book that Parrish would have read on it .
Since Dynamic Symmetry is so important to the composition , I 'm going to focus on that rather than on palette or other topics .
( Some prints of the painting are quite blue - green .
I 'm showing the proper colors here , though there is always the question of reproducing color of older works . )
It took me a while to really understand what was meant by composition .
I kept trying to make it more complicated and mysterious than it is .
Simply , it 's the arrangement of things in your picture .
Or , to be precise , the arrangement of lights and darks .
People talk about dynamic and static compositions , organic compositions , and balanced compositions .
Something placed right in the center of the picture will be static , they say .
What they mean is " visually uninteresting . "
( If you think about it , every painting is static - none them actually move . )
The question , then , is how to arrange things in your picture to make it visually exciting , or " dynamic . "
Look at enough examples and you 'll see that some layouts really do work better than others .
Though I have n't seen anyone even try to explainthese compositions work , they have worked out guidelines for them .
You can see these same principles of proportion and arrangement in natural objects from snail shells to galaxies .
Why do we find paintings that follow these guidelines pleasing ?
I think we unconsciously judge things that follow the proportions as more natural than other man-made objects .
But really , who knows ?
Ancient Greeks and Egyptians used these principles of proportion , but then their use disappeared .
In 1920 Jay Hambidge published a book called " The Elements of Dynamic Symmetry " that brought them back to artists and designers .
You need high school level geometry to understand them , but not more than that .
Just like we can break the human body down into its cylinders , blocks , spheres , and cones , we can break a rectangle down to component shapes .
That is what Dynamic Symmetry is all about - subdividing the square or rectangle into smaller , pleasing shapes .
Here are the basic pieces :
The square .
This is our starting point .
All sides are the same .
Let 's make up a new unit of measurement .
Rather than inches or centimeters , we 'll call it the " Parrish . "
The square above is 1 Parrish long on each side .
From it , we can make a set of special rectangles that we can use to subdivide space pleasingly .
This series of rectangles all have a side that is 1 Parrish .
The top and bases are the square roots of 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 .
I 'll use the Pythagorean Theorem to explain why in a minute , but even with out that you can still create them from the square easily enough .
Take the square and create a diagonal through it .
Treat the diagonal like the radius of a circle , and follow the circle down until it matches the base of the square .
Finally , create a rectangle with a base as long as the square 's diagonal .
If you recall , " A squared plus B squared = C squared . "
A and B are the sides of the square , and C is the diagonal ( hypotenuse ) .
Since 1 squared is just 1 , we have 1 + 1 = 2 .
So , when we rotate the diagonal down to be the base of the new rectangle , we have a a rectangle that is 1 Parrish tall and the square root of 2 Parrishes wide .
OK , if you just glazed over right there it 's time to come back .
Even without following the numbers , hopefully you can see the visual relationship between the square and this " root 2 rectangle . "
To get the rest of the rectangles , you keep going .
We can also create these rectanglesa square , like this .
Put the diagonal in the 1 Parrish x 1 Parrish square like we did before .
Also , using one of the other corners as the center put in a quarter circle inside the square .
See where the diagonal meets the circle ?
Draw a line there to make a rectangle inside the square .
That 's your root 2 rectangle .
Next , put a diagonal through the root 2 rectangle and see where it meets the circle .
Put in another line to make a smaller rectangle inside the first .
That 's your root 3 rectangle , and so on .
What you should see here is that the basis of Dynamic Symmetry is using diagonals and circles to expand or subdivide your space .
If you put the pieces of your drawing along these diagonals , curves , and lines , your illustration will have a natural , " organic " composition .
Hambidge says that there are two shapes that stand out even from the others as the key to using Dynamic Symmetry .
The first is the root 5 rectangle from above .
The second is the " golden rectangle . "
His name for it is the wonderful " Rectangle of Whirling Squares .
"
Let 's back up a second .
There 's this special sequence of numbers called the Fibonacci sequence .
If you start with 0 and 1 , keep adding the current number with the one before it to get the next one : 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 55 , ... Especially as you get to the higher numbers , whenever you divide a number into the one that came before it you get one of these irrational , never - ending decimals like pi .
This one is called phi ( ϕ ) and we can approximate it with the number 1.6180 .
This is one of those numbers that shows up in nature everywhere , but I 'm not going to go into that here .
Instead , let 's look at a rectangle that is 1 Parrish tall and 1.6180 Parrishes wide .
In a weird bit of " math - fu , " if you take two golden rectangles and overlap them so that there 's a square in the middle , you have a root 5 rectangle .
So , that 's it for the Dynamic Symmetry summary .
I left out a lot of course , but these are the basics .
If something 's not clear , fire away in the comments or in a message .
The downside of Jay Hambidge 's book was that it did n't apply these principles to any illustrations so we could see them in action .
Since that 's what this column is all about though , that 's where we 're going next .
Now , I picked up Hambidge 's book specifically for this column , so I 'm far from a Dynamic Symmetry expert .
I 'm sure I 'll be leaving things out .
That said , it did n't take long to start finding examples of it in this painting .
My first thought was , " I 'll bet the dimensions of the painting match the golden rectangle ! "
So , I reduced the image to 100 pixels tall , expecting the width to be about 161.8 pixels wide .
Oops , no dice .
It was about 180 pixels .
Next , I decided that he'd probably used one of those root rectangles as the aspect ratio .
So , I reduced it a bit and made a square on one end 1 Parrish tall by 1 Parrish wide .
Using this as the starting point I worked out the root rectangles .
Starting with a square on the left side that is 1 x 1 Parish , we see that the root 2 rectangle does n't fit .
The root 3 rectangle , though , is quite close .
( Actually the painting 's dimensions are 26.5 inches by 45 inches , so 1 Parrish = 26.5 inches . )
If the painting is 26.5 inches tall , the width for an exact root 3 rectangle would be 45.9 inches .
Notice that the diagonals from each step nicely frame the standing figure , touching the top of her head , going through her shoulders , and her waist .
Here 's something interesting about the root 3 rectangle .
You can look at it as combination of the square you started with and 2 smaller rectangle stuck onto the end .
If you make a square on the end of those smaller rectangle , what you 're left with is a that square and a smaller root 3 rectangle .
When we overlay that diagram on the painting , we see that the foliage ends right on the lines of those small squares .
On the left side the foliage takes up the upper part , which is a root 3 rectangle itself .
On the right side the foliage takes up a square while the background is the root 3 rectangle .
Since Dynamic
Symmetry is all about subdividing in organized ways , I thought it might make sense to make the root rectangles inside the center square .
The first thing to do is mark out the square and put in the quarter circle .
Before we go any further , see how the circle makes an arc that follows the reclining figure 's leg and dress and then the standing figure 's torso and head ?
Basically it 's dividing the square into foreground and background .
So now that we have the arc and the diagonal , we can create the root 2 rectangle .
That passes through the standing figure 's knees and wrists , and just above the reclining figure 's knee .
Carrying on , we see that the root 3 rectangle passes through the standing figure 's shoulders and eyes while the root 4 rectangle touches the top of her head .
Even the background foliage looks like it 's radiating out from that upper square point toward the standing figure .
Of course , the square has four corners and any of them can be the center of a circle .
Here are a couple of other diagrams .
If the lower left corner is the center of the circle , we see that the reclining figure 's knee touches the diagonal of the root 4 rectangle .
When the lower right corner is the center of the circle , we see that the reclining figure 's foot touches the Root 4 rectangle 's diagonal .
When the upper left corner is the center of the circle I 'd expected the mountains to follow the diagonals , but that 's not really the case .
I 'll get to that in a minute , but first take a minute to look at how all these diagonals together frame the figures .
Together with the diagonals for the entire painting ( not just the center square ) those figures are quite precisely defined .
Take the guide lines away , though , and they 're quite natural and relaxed - not stiff at all .
One of the concepts that Hambidge talks about is theof a rectangle .
That is , if you have a rectangle , the complement is the other rectangle you have to add to it to get a square .
One thing he says that artists often forget is that their canvas is part of a larger surface , and you can make compositional decisions based on that larger space .
Look at this :
What I 've done here is completed a square .
The painting takes up the lower part .
If you make a root 2 rectangle inside , you discover that its diagonal lines up quite nicely with the mountains in the background .
If you keep going , you get this set of diagonals .
They do n't all line up , but you can see that the nearer set of hills lines up with the diagonal of the root 5 rectangle .
Another concept Hambidge talks about is theof a rectangle .
To make its reciprocal , put a diagonal line through the rectangle .
Then , from one of the other corners make a line at right angles to that diagonal .
Put a vertical line where this new line meets the rectangle 's edge and you 'll see a smaller rectangle that is the original 's reciprocal .
Parrish used this method of right - angled diagonals to figure out how wide to make the columns .
Is your brain full yet ?
So far I 've made it about two - thirds of the way through Hambidge 's book .
I 'm certain that what I 've outlined here is just the beginning .
The horizon line , for example , and the line between the grass and the floor are not accidental , but I have n't yet figured out why they 're in that position .
( If you know , please leave a comment or a message - I 'll update the page here and give you credit . )
We 'll get to Lee Moyer 's Elements of a Successful Illustration in a moment , but first I wanted to show you one of the preparatory sketches that Parrish did while working out Daybreak .
You can see how he was working out the spacing and proportions .
You can also see that Parrish planned a third figure .
Parrish collector Alma Gilbert speculates in the bookthat because his long - time model and probable mistress Susan Lewin posed for that third figure , Parrish 's daughter asked him to remove her .
His daughter Jean was 11 at the time and was the model for the standing figure .
In the end , however , Parrish used Lewin 's body as the model for the reclining figure and gave it a different face .
That face belonged to Kitty Owen , the granddaughter of William Jennings Bryan .
( When the original painting was sold , the buyer remained anonymous and it disappeared from the public scene for nearly 50 years .
It turned out that William Jennings Bryan had bought it for a fairly high amount , and because he had political ambitions did n't want it known that he'd spent that kind of money on a painting . )
All right - time to do the elements . :
While we focus on the two figures , we 're also meant to take in the entire scene .
There are lines and pointers that guide our eye to them , but not as many as in some of the other paintings we 've looked at . :
It 's put together with Dynamic Symmetry , as I 've been explaining .
Even without that level of analysis , though , we can see that the columns frame the figures and the idyllic landscape behind . :
The palette is generally warm , particularly in the foreground .
The cool colors in the trees are n't very saturated .
The blues of the sky are n't that saturated either .
Sometimes you will see very blue - green versions of this painting .
That is a printing error - the warmer tones that you see above are closer to the original . :
The brightest area with the most contrast is the sky against the right column .
So , one of the first things we see is the mountain range , and then we come over to the figures in the foreground . :
Values also represent form and mass .
The nearest rocks and mountains are good examples of this . :
The rocks and mountains provide a rough texture that contrasts with the smooth textures of the columns , standing figure , and floor .
The reclining figure 's clothes provide a different kind of texture .
Finally , the flowers and foliage have yet another texture . :
The columns , nudity , and reclining figure 's clothing suggest a Classical Greek setting .
This lines up nicely with the use of Dynamic Symmetry because the Greeks brought it to its heights according to Hambidge . : I see a lot of detail in the mountains and foliage .
As in James Jeans ' The Last Castle , all that detail merges into a texture .
The smoothness of the foreground contrasts against that and brings the figures forward . :
There is a little bit of ornament in the reclining figure 's wrap and at the bases of the columns .
Perhaps you could consider the nature background to be ornament . :
Though narrative is n't the most important aspect of the painting , we can tell there is some sort of interaction going on between the two figures .
Has the standing girl just come from playing outside to check on the reclining woman ?
Is she waking her up ? : I find the straight , clean lines of the architecture to be a good juxtaposition against the texture and diagonals of the background . : Daybreak is mostly realistic . :
The poses and expressions show two people who are relaxed and worry - free . :
There 's very little tension in the painting , which I think is the point .
Though , I do find myself wondering how that reclining woman can be so happy and relaxed on a stone floor . :
The only clear edges are the verticals of the columns and the horizontals of the floor and horizon . :
Parrish spent quite a long time on this painting - about two years .
Aside from the sketch above , I also found photos of Jean Parrish modeling for the standing figure .
Also , see Parrish 's own comments about the painting below . :
The warm tones of the figures and foreground architecture against the cooler and less saturated background tones give a clear silhouette to the foreground elements . :
Parrish uses scale and atmospheric perspective to get the sense of space and openness we see . :
Here is what Parrish wrote to his publisher in March 1921 , " As to the ' great painting , ' its beautiful white panel is always on the wall before me , and I am thinking great things into it .
I have thought so many beautiful things into it that it ought to make a good print just as it is .
Have patience ! "
Two years later in April 1923 it went to the printers for reproduction .
That 's it for this time .
I 'm sure I just scratched the surface .
Next time I 'll take on a cover from Strangers in Paradise by Terry Moore .
Listen , man .
I 'm going to spell it out simple for you - this pice was done before Iron Patriot .
Even according to your date of Jan 2009 .
I have NO IDEA why you 're bothering me about it otherwise .
If you do n't like the piece , fine .
If you do , that 's fine too .
But you chimed in here and called my piece ' Iron Patriot ' , and it 's obvious that this work was done before that came out .
So if you 're not trolling me , WTF are you going on about ?
Mac OS X Leopard 10.6.2 will break your hackintosh .
The forthcoming OS update will not run on the Intel Atom processor , a rather petty move from Apple which , if true , will break many netbooks which have been hacked to run as more than passable Macs .
This news comes from Stellarola , the hacker who helped us out extensively with the original ( and still the best ) Gadget Lab hackintosh .
Here ’s what he has to say :
In the current developer build of 10.6.2 , Apple appears to have changed around a lot of CPU related information .
One of the effects of this is Apple killing off Intel ’s Atom chip .
The important word there is “ current ” .
The latest seed could change before being released as an actual update .
But Stella knows what he ’s talking about ( he ’s one of the guys behind the OSx86 method for easily installing the Mac OS on non-Apple machines ) , and recommends keeping your frankenmacs loaded with 10.6.1 for now .
This would n’t surprise us , especially as Apple seems to have gotten a taste for locking out unauthorized hardware with the Palm Pre cat and mouse game .

The move is unexpected because , while the Pirate Bay is rife with pirated material , the site 's spare landing page contains no content to speak of – just links , a logo and a search box .
By law , DMCA notices are targeted to specific infringing content .

Destined Enterprises operates a copyright policing business called Remove Your Content that specializing in taking down pirated copies of adult films on behalf of the copyright owner .
But that company said Friday that it did n't deliberately target the Bay 's landing page .

Searches for the Bay on Google still produce copious links to Pirate Bay , including to the torrent site 's Top 100 list of torrents , and its blog .
But the main URL is omitted , and a notice on the bottom of the search results explains that Google acted in " response to a complaint we received under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act . "
The DMCA generally provides immunity from copyright lawsuits to companies that respond to takedown notices .

Melinda writes in :
You constantly write about how having a notebook in your pocket all the time helps you in life and saves you money .
I get that you can write down your ideas in it all the time , but I ’m not a creative type .
I do n’t see how having a notebook on me at all times can save me money at all .
Aside from the fact that I ’m able to use the notebook to write down my ideas – my career ’s bread and butter – a pocket notebook constantly comes in handy for many other financial reasons as well .
( FYI , I usually just keep a simple small Mead reporter ’s notebook in my pocket , along with a good pen that does n’t run out of ink . )
Here are fourteen ways I use that notebook to directly save money .
Fourteen Ways a Notebook in Your Pocket Can Help You Save
1. Write down sale prices .
If you spy an item on sale but you ’re not really sure how good of a sale it is , jot down the item and the sale price .
Later , you can research that price and find out if it really is a great bargain .
This is particularly useful when shopping for gifts or for specific expensive purchases .
2 . Make ongoing grocery lists .
During a given week , I ’ll make efforts to prepare several meals at home .
As I ’m doing this , I ’ll often come across items that we need to replenish in our pantry – for example , last night I discovered we were nearly out of extra virgin olive oil .
Similarly , I was down in the basement over the weekend and noticed that we were out of furnace filters – something that was very easy to immediately note .
If I have a notepad with me at all times , I can add that item easily no matter where I ’m at .
Then , since my shopping list is complete , I do n’t have to do any “ wandering ” at the store , helping me save time and drastically reduce impulse buys .
3 . Do warehouse club price comparisons .
My family often shops at Sam ’s Club for many household staples , like toilet paper .
Whenever we ’re considering making a purchase in bulk , we ’ll jot down the Sam ’s Club price , then compare it to the normal price we pay at our usual grocery store .
Quite often , Sam ’s Club is less expensive , but not always .
Checking the price lets us know whether or not this item should be purchased at the warehouse club or not .
4. Record great gift ideas .
When I ’m interacting with a friend or a family member , they ’ll often drop a hint of some kind indicating a Christmas or birthday gift they ’d like to receive .
If I note that idea immediately , I can often give myself plenty of time to bargain - hunt for that specific item , enabling me to get that person a gift they ’d really like for the lowest possible price for me .
5 . Record contact info for potential clients or new acquaintances .
Whenever I ’m at a community event , I almost always meet someone interesting who wants to see my website , has a website of their own to share , or wants to keep in touch for some reason .
Having a handy notebook makes this easy – I can either jot down my own information and share it ( if I do n’t have a business card , of course ) or jot down their information and keep it .
6 . Write down recipes or other food ideas .
My parents and in - laws subscribe to tons of magazines and also have extensive cookbook collections .
Sometimes , I ’ll be browsing through them and see something really intriguing that I might want to prepare in my own kitchen .
With my notebook at the ready , I can jot down this recipe , often giving me a great idea for a low - cost meal to prepare at home .
7. Leave a note for someone .
Ever stopped by someone ’s house when they ’re not home and wanted to leave a reminder for them ?
If you have a notebook in hand , it ’s easy to just slip a note under the door , turning a useless trip into a useful one and often helping you salvage a poor situation .
8 . Make a simple price book .
If you ’re trying out a new store , record the prices of some of the items you buy most frequently – milk , eggs , bread , vegetables , fruit , and so on .
Then , use that information to compare the prices of this new store to the one you regularly shop at .
Is this new store offering better value for the things you buy ?
Finding the store that offers the best prices on your staples can make a huge difference in your routine food spending .
9 . Exchange insurance information
In a fender bender , it ’s often vital to exchange insurance information with the other person in an accident .
I ’ve been in accidents before where the other person was attempting to get off the hook because they did n’t have paper with which to exchange such information .
With a notebook right in hand , such excuses wo n’t matter – information can easily be exchanged and repairs can commence as quickly as possible .
10 .
Write down a phone number on a “ for sale ” item
Perhaps you see someone selling their car ( or some other large item ) themselves with a phone number in the window .
If you ’ve got a notebook , it ’s really easy to jot down the necessary information so you can call the person up later when you have appropriate additional research in hand to ensure that you ’re getting a good deal .
11 . Keep a “ master list ” of preferred brands
Consumer Reports often ranks the quality of various household items – toothpaste , shampoo , trash bags , paper towels , etc. – as well as the “ best buys ” for each one .
Having this information in hand can help you easily get the best bang for your buck when you ’re standing in the store trying to decide which item to buy .
12 . Write down things you want instead of buying them , as per the “ thirty day rule ”
The “ thirty day rule ” is pretty simple .
Whenever you ’re tempted to make a major purchase , instead of buying , just remember the item , put it back on the shelf , and walk out of the store .
Give yourself full permission to buy the item in thirty days if you ’re still actively wanting it or thinking about it .
I actually suggest jotting down the item if you want .
Later , you can research the item a bit , figure out if it ’s what you really want , and if the thirty days go by and you still want it , you can carefully comparison shop and get the best bargain you can find for it .
13 . Keep a detailed errand list
There are always errands that need to be run , ones that are often important to good financial health .
By keeping an ongoing errand list in your notebook , you can kill two birds with one stone – for one , you do n’t forget them , and for two , you have access to that list all the time , particularly when you ’re actually out and about .
14 . Make an omnipresent “ big goal ” reminder
Since I use my pocket notebook all the time , one great technique I ’ve found for keeping my mind in the right place is to start off the notebook by writing my big goal on every single page of the notebook .
At the bottom , I write “ Are you helping yourself get the country house today ? ”
Writing it on every page of the notebook takes a while , but that action alone pounds the message into my head .
Then , whenever I look at the notebook , I see that reminder in my own handwriting and it keeps me on a better path .
To put it simply , I could n’t live without that pocket notebook .
It ’s an essential part of my personal and financial life .

The Ordzhonikidze brought Nikita Khrushchev on a diplomatic visit A bad - tempered dinner party between Soviet leaders and the Labour Party during the Cold War may have changed the course of history , top secret CIA documents reveal .
Observations of the " fiasco " dinner in 1956 were made in the North American intelligence reports into the first visit to the Western world by leaders of the Soviet Union .
The documents , which also observed the British public 's reaction to the Soviets as well as Soviet threats of hydrogen bomb experiments , were obtained by the BBC under Freedom of Information laws .
Communist Party First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev and Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin came to Britain in April 1956 on board warships that docked at Portsmouth .
The CIA intelligence reports show the British government saw the trip as both a diplomatic opportunity and a propaganda hazard .
[ Khrushchev ] added the threat that the USSR had plenty of space to experiment with the hydrogen bomb
CIA documents
It was desperate to avoid the kind of triumphant tour the Soviets had enjoyed on recent visits to India and Burma , and deeply concerned about Soviet efforts to forge links with the Labour Party , then led by Hugh Gaitskell .
The Soviets spent eight full days in Britain , and their schedule included three days of talks at Downing Street .
They had dinner with Prime Minister Anthony Eden twice , and visited him at Chequers .
But Bulganin and Khrushchev appeared surprised and frustrated with the cool reception they received from the British public .
The classified CIA documents state : " For the most part crowds have greeted the Soviet leaders in silence , or with more jeers than cheers .
" Khrushchev has shown his irritation by intemperate and even threatening remarks . "
Bad to worse Meanwhile , the CIA , MI6 and the Naval Intelligence were all involved in a mission which put divers under the Soviet warships at Portsmouth .
One of the frogmen , Cdr Lionel Crabb , famously vanished during the operation on 19 April 1956 , forcing the British authorities to cobble together a hasty cover story .
The Royal Navy said he was feared drowned in Stokes Bay - some miles to the west of Portsmouth Harbour .
Since then , a Russian frogman claimed he cut the Englishman 's throat as he caught him placing a mine .
British diver " Buster " Crabb disappeared during the Soviet visit
Secret spy diver report revealed
And the man who formally identified a headless body of a diver as that of Cdr Crabb has said he was told to lie .
Cdr Crabb's fate is still a closely - guarded secret .
From the Soviet point of view , the diplomatic mission went from bad to worse .
A dinner with Labour Party leaders on 23 April 1956 is described in the CIA reports as " a fiasco " , undermining the Soviet plan to establish ties with Western European socialists .
" Khrushchev antagonized the Labor ( sic ) leaders by repeating charges he made in India that Britain and France had urged Hitler to attack the USSR , and by defending the Stalin - Hitler pact , " the CIA documents said .
" He further angered them by warning that if the West persisted in re-arming West Germany , the USSR would have no alternative but to seek an alliance with those forces in West Germany who desire an alliance .
" He added the threat that the USSR had plenty of space to experiment with the hydrogen bomb . "
' Simple - minded man ' Labour leaders replied with a plea for the release of Soviet Social Democrats and trade unionists in the USSR and satellites , which Khrushchev angrily rejected .
" Khrushchev was heard to say that he found it much easier to talk to the Conservatives than to the British Labour Party , " the documents continue .
" His surprise and anger was matched by their disgust at his performance , and one described him privately as a ' simple - minded man who would be capable of holding only a secondary position in a British trade union ' . "
Of all the developments , Khrushchev's clash with the Labor Party may have the most lasting effect in Britain
CIA documents Meanwhile , Soviet propaganda claimed the visit was a great success .
Pravda reported crowds of thousands cheering to welcome Bulganin and Khrushchev in their public appearances with only " occasional hostile shouts " and anti-Soviet posters carried by " hooligans " .
Nothing was said about the disastrous Labour Party dinner .
A CIA review of the visit , dated 3 May 1956 , states : " Bulganin and Khrushchev must be acutely conscious of the striking contrast between the small , cool and sometimes hostile crowds which greeted them in the streets of British cities and the cheering throngs they met in India .
" Khrushchev 's angry response to this contributed to the failure of the visit from a public relations point of view . "
In its summary , the CIA said : " Of all the developments , Khrushchev 's clash with the Labor Party may have the most lasting effect in Britain .
" His abrupt dismissal of demands for the release of social democrats brought a rare degree of unity to the opposition .
A resolution criticizing party leader Gaitskell 's conduct toward the Soviet visitors achieved only 10 votes at a 26 April meeting of the Parliamentary Labor Party . "
Gaitskell later told Khrushchev it was impossible for him to accept an invitation from the Communist Party to visit the USSR .

Yemen is different .
For all its many woes  wars , a water crisis and the rise of Al Qaeda  the country ’s adherence to ancient traditions often makes it feel like a refuge .
Even outside the Old City , the bands and crescents of medieval Yemeni architecture can be seen on many newer buildings and homes , along with the translucent alabaster windows known as gammariyas .
The traditions stayed alive largely because of Yemen ’s deep poverty and long isolation .
Until 1962 , north Yemen had been ruled for almost a millennium by xenophobic imams who tried to shut out all foreign influence .
The country largely missed the urban renewal phase of Arab history , in which kings and presidents cleared out ancient neighborhoods and markets in an effort to bring their nations into the modern age .
By the early 1980s , when Yemen was still emerging from its medieval slumber , preservation was already in vogue .
There was much to preserve .
This country has been famous for its unique architecture ever since Sabaean rulers built the skyscraper palace of Ghumdan 1,800 years ago , celebrated by one medieval poet thus :
It rises , climbing into the midst of the sky
twenty floors of no mean height
wound with a turban of white cloud
and girdled in alabaster .
Architects rediscovering the Old City soon found there was more than beauty at stake .
The traditional houses were also more durable and effective than concrete - based modern houses , and better suited to the climate .
Image Workers collected mud bricks that will be reused during the remodeling of a traditional building in the Old City of Sana .
Credit ... Bryan Denton for The New York Times
“ The traditional houses have many environmental advantages , ” said Abdulla Zaid Ayssa , the director of the government office that oversees all building and renovation in the Old City .
Jon Wellinghoff , the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , says that the U.S. may not need any new nuclear or coal power plants " ever . "
According to Wellinghof , the price to build nuclear and coal plants is too high , so the nation is better off building wind or solar projects .
“ The last price I saw for a nuke was north of $ 7,000 a kilowatt .
That ’s more expensive than a solar system , " said Wellinghoff , according to Bloomberg .
He says coal costs less than that , but is still expensive .
To provide energy for the nation Wellinghof says there 's 500 to 700 gigawatts of developable wind in the Midwest and plenty of sunlight in the southwest .
He also mentioned the potential for hydroelectric power .
How do we deal with the fact that the sun does n't always shine and wind does n't always blow ?
Well , there 's already some technology that can store solar energy , he says .
More importantly , we build bigger , better , smarter grid structures :
Wellinghoff , quoted by Greenwire : " I think it 's being settled by the digital grid moving forward , " he said .
" We are going to have to go to a smart grid to get to this point I 'm talking about .
But if we do n't go to that digital grid , we 're not going to be able to move these renewables , anyway .
So it 's all going to be an integral part of operating that grid efficiently . "
The other way to deal with intermitten renewable energy generation :
" That 's exactly what all the load response will do , the load response will provide that leveling ability , number one , " he said .
" Number two , if you have wide interconnections across the entire interconnect , you 're going to have a lot of diversity with that wind .
Not all the wind is going to stop at once .
You 'll have some of it stop , some of it start , and all of that diversity is going to help you , as well . "
But planning for modifying the grid to integrate renewables must take place in the next three to five years , he said .
" If we do n't do that , then we miss the boat , " Wellinghoff said .
" That planning has to take place so you do n't strand a lot of assets , a lot of supply assets . "
Dollhouse will not get a second season .
After a decent season premiere , the second episode of the season did even worse getting a pathetic .8 , barely better than a CW repeat .
If the show had kept stable at 1.0 , there might have been a chance of renewal , but a weekly drop like that dooms the show .
On the plus side , the episode coincided with the premiere of Stargate Universe which may have drew scifi fans away .
Fox did n't do any better with Brothers ( .8 ) and Till Death (.8 ) .
Obviously Dollhouse does n't have a good lead - in , but it should be able to attract viewers on its own .
CBS won the night with Ghost Whisperer ( 1.7 ) , Medium ( 1.8 ) and Numb3rs ( 1.6 ) which still are n't big numbers .
It 's Fridays , so we can't expect much more .
CBS seems set for Fridays for the year .
NBC did fairly well with Law & Order ( 1.2 ) , Dateline ( 1.7 ) , and The Jay Leno Show ( 1.5 ) .
L&O will probably not be renewed , but a 20 year run is good enough .
Leno continues to do well when against light competition .
The ABC repeats were very interesting .
FlashFoward tied with The Forgotten with 1.0 .
FlashForward did way better than The Forgotten for the first run yet tied with The Forgotten which bad horribly on the first run .
Procedurals still do well under any circumstance .

Then again , " SOME " might be inclinded to belive that a trial held in the city of New York , which sustained the bulk of the carnage that was visited upon our country on September 11 , 2001 , would give the trials of those that are accused of planning and assisting in carrying out the murder of innocent Americans on that day a real and legitimate opportunity to be tried in a Court of Justice as opposed to a Tribunal of Information suppression .
The difference for " SOME " is that there is a Rule of Law in our country that they do n't want to see inacted on their behalf .
One citizen 's Rule of Law is another citizen 's nightmare , causing them to fear what may happen to them now that the DOJ has decided to give the alleged perpetrators of this disaster their day in court .
From SOME Faux News Bullshitainment Corporation :
Some critics say a civilian trial -- instead of a military tribunal -- for self - proclaimed Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his accomplices could end up targeting the Bush administration and its anti-terror policies .
The Obama administration , in deciding to try alleged Sept. 11 conspirators in a New York courtroom , has said it is setting its sights on convictions , but some critics say a civilian trial -- instead of a military tribunal -- could end up targeting the Bush administration and its anti-terror policies .
One of those five defendants , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , has been at the center of the debate over those Bush - era polices , in particular the harsh interrogation techniques used on Mohammed and others in an effort to obtain information on Al Qaeda and any additional attacks .
" The government is going to try to put Khalid Sheik Mohammed on trial .
Defense lawyers will try and put the government on trial , " former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani told Fox News .
The Justice Department says in a 2005 memo that CIA interrogators subjected Mohammed 183 times to waterboarding , a near - drowning technique described by Obama officials as illegal torture .
But others disagree with Obama , most notably former Vice President Dick Cheney , who argues that the techniques used have kept the country safe from another attack .
Obama 's attorney general , Eric Holder , announced in the summer that he would investigate whether CIA officers should be prosecuted for their interrogations , setting off intense debate over the prospect of prosecuting officials from the previous administration .
But on Friday , in announcing a civilian trial for Mohammed and four other detainees , Holder dismissed questions about whether politics was a factor in the decision .
" SOME " of the people that Faux Bullshitainment interviewed for this story include Karl Rove and Tom Ridge .
Needless to say , they do n't care for the idea of this trial coming to a court in the USA .
I wonder if it 's just the fear of actual justice being meted out for the alleged perpetrators of the terrorist attacks on our country , or if it is even more the fear of being shown to be the liars and torturers that they became after this tragic event .
WMD 's my ass ...

Das „ Aktionsbündnis Winnenden “ , bestehend aus betroffenen Eltern , hat Container vor der Oper in Stuttgart am 17.10.09 aufgestellt und Jugendliche und Eltern dazu aufgerufen , Killerspiele in einem riesigen Container zu entsorgen .
Damit könne man an einer Verlosung eines Trikots mit den Unterschriften der deutschen Nationalmannschaft teilnehmen .
Das fand ich nicht besonders bloggenswert .
Bis ich dieses Video gefunden habe :
Die Aktion war wohl so erfolgreich , dass man das in dem riesen Container finden konnte :
Zum Zeitpunkt ( 14:30 Uhr ) befanden sich im Container : 2 PS2 Spiele ( darunter GTA San Andreas ) , 1 CD , 1 Gameboy Modul
Update : Die Aktion eignet sich hervorragend für ein Lehrstück in Sachen Medienkritik .
In diesem Video wird ein Dreh vor Ort gezeigt , wie man die Bilder passend für die Abendnachrichten aufbereitet :

In 2005 , a bus carrying seniors fleeing Hurricane Rita burst into flame outside of Dallas , immolating 23 nursing home residents .
Investigators later found that the bus was : driven by an undocumented migrant without a valid U.S. driver 's license , lacking adequate fire extinguishers , and not registered to operate in Texas .
When the bus had mechanical problems before the crash , the driver took it to an unqualified mechanic who failed to notice the critical fault -- an unlubricated axle that eventually melted and caught fire .
BusBank is also arranging to ferry Tea Baggers to their 9/12 march on Washington to voice their demands for unfettered capitalism .
( Update : Commenter Casual Observer asks if there 's a Dick Armey connection here .
There is .
Dick Armey 's FreedomWorks Foundation is the premiere sponsor of the 9/12 march ; and Kaloogian 's OCDB PAC is a " Gold Co-Sponsor . " )
One of the featured corporate sponsors of the Tea Party Express had to pay millions of dollars to settle lawsuits for its role in a bus fire that killed 23 elderly nursing home residents fleeing Hurricane Rita in 2005 .
BusBank ( aka Global Charters ) hired the subcontractor , Global Limo .
BusBank boasted on its website that it had a " rigorous operator certification process " to ensure the safety of contracted bus drivers .
BusBank used Global even though the subcontractor had a long record of federal and state safety violations , had entered bankruptcy , and was being sued .
BusBank 's association with Global appears to have been more than a one - off , Global Limo 's owner Jim Maples even listed Global Charters as his employer when he gave $ 5000 to the RNC in 2004 .
BusBank CEO
Bill Maulsby blamed insufficient federal oversight , " We 're not safety experts , " he said .
" We clearly need to depend on the federal government . "
In November 2006 , a federal court convicted Maples and sentenced him to five years ' probation for failure to maintain his buses .
Investigators found 168 violations in Maples ' four - bus fleet .
The following month , US Fed News reported that BusBank had been awarded Homeland Security contract worth up to $ 55 million .
In June , BusBank and Global Limo settled out of court for a total of $ 11 million , a pittance when split between the families of the 23 victims and the patients who survived the crash .
BusBank 's legal troubles are far from over .
According to one report , more lawsuits are getting underway this month .
The firm filed for bankruptcy in Delaware in August .

A leaked government report on " lessons learnt " after the Iraq war reveals " appalling " failures that left the British Army ill - equipped for battle and the subsequent occupation , it was reported today .
The documents , obtained by The Sunday Telegraph , emerged just two days before the start of the public inquiry into the UK's involvement in Iraq , chaired by Sir John Chilcot .
They are reported to contain classified interviews in which Army chiefs describe how troops were exposed to " significant risk " because of a " rushed " operation " lacking in coherence and resources " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Plans for the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 did not include " detail once Baghdad had fallen " , which allowed insurgents to exploit a " notable loss of momentum " in the post - war period .
Operations were dogged by kit shortages - from body armour that failed to arrive in time for battle to a lack of desert boots and chemical weapons protection , it was reported .
Some troops apparently had their weapons confiscated by airport security when flown to war on civilian airlines and were forced to carry their equipment as hand luggage .
Lt Col ML Dunn , of 9 Supply Regiment , Royal Engineers , said his soldiers " only had five rounds of ammunition each , and only enough body armour for those in the front and rear vehicles " .
Another commanding officer , Lt Col John Power , of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers , described part of the supply chain as " appalling " in the report .
" The in - theatre asset tracking was absolutely appalling , " he said .
" I know for a fact that there was one container full of skis in the desert . "
Communications were also beset with problems .
Ptarmigan , the main longer - distance radio , " tended to drop out at around noon because of the heat " .

In some cases " mobile phones ( using the Kuwaiti network ) were the only means of communication available to troops in contact ( combat ) " .
The report also highlights an Army weighed down by bureaucracy : " The overall impression is of headquarters which were large and busy , but which produced relatively little output .
Deployed HQs contained too many people , busied themselves with too much nugatory planning and did not run well internally . "
Though analysis of the war phase describes it as a " significant military success " , it was one achieved against a " third - rate army " .
The commanders note that " a more capable enemy would probably have punished ( our ) shortcomings severely " .
Shadow defence secretary Liam Fox said : " The accusation that British troops may have died because equipment was not ordered as part of a deliberate political act of deception is one of the most serious charges that could ever be levelled against a Prime Minister and his government .
" It is essential that the Iraq inquiry uncovers the truth . "
The United Nations cannot account for tens of millions of dollars provided to the troubled Afghan election commission , according to two confidential U.N. audits and interviews with current and former senior diplomats .
( Read bothaudits . )
As Afghanistan prepares for a second round of national voting , the documents and interviews paint the fullest picture to date of the finances of the election commission , which has been accused of facilitating election fraud and operating ghost polling places .
The new disclosures also deepen the questions about the U.N. 's oversight of money provided by the United States and other nations to ensure a fair election in Afghanistan .
" Everybody kept sending money " to the elections commission , said Peter Galbraith , the former deputy chief of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan .
" Nobody put the brakes on .
U.S. taxpayers spent hundreds of millions of dollars on a fraudulent election . "
Galbraith , a deputy to the senior U.N. official in Afghanistan , was fired last month after protesting fraud in the elections .
The audits come as President Barack Obama is struggling to craft a war policy for Afghanistan that would establish a stable government in a country with few democratic traditions .
Senior aides have made clear that Obama will not commit to sending additional troops until there is a legitimately elected government in Kabul .
On Wednesday , insurgents stormed a housing compound primarily occupied by U.N. election officials , killing eight people , including two election workers .
Afghanistan 's Independent Election Commission initially reported that President Hamid Karzai had won the majority of votes in the August election .
A recount was ordered after another U.N. - backed panel uncovered evidence of widespread fraud .
After weeks of prodding from the Obama administration , Karzai agreed last week to a runoff .
The U.N. audit reports , which are near completion but still in draft form , are likely to fuel debate over the Afghanistan election commission 's ability to carry out the new round of voting .
Karzai's challenger , Abdullah Abdullah , has suggested he may boycott the elections unless Karzai dismisses the chairman and two other commissioners .
In interviews , senior U.S. and U.N. officials said that U.N. leaders had ignored warnings as far back as 2007 that the election commission was a pro-Karzai body with few internal controls .
Another top official in the U.N. 's Afghanistan mission , Robert Watkins , acknowledged in an interview that some commission employees had contributed to the fraud in the first round of voting .
" It 's clear that some of the people " working for the commission at the polling centers " were complicit in fraud , " Watkins said .
" Some of the staff hired were not working in the best interests of impartial elections . "
But Watkins said the United Nations is working to improve the commission 's performance in the runoff .
He said the U.N. planned to slash the number of poll workers and blackball any that may have been implicated in fraud in the August elections .
As of April 2009 , the U.N. had spent $ 72.4 million supporting the commission , with $ 56.7 million of that coming from the U.S. Agency for International Development , the audit said .
Total election costs are now estimated at greater than $ 300 million , with the U.S. providing a third to half the total funding , according to one senior U.N. official familiar with the elections process .
The draft audit reports indicate that as many as one - third of payroll requests from the Afghan commission to the United Nations included " discrepancies , " such as incorrect names or amounts .
In another instance , the U.N. Development Program paid $ 6.8 million for transportation services in areas where no U.N. officials were present .
Auditors found that the development agency had " inadequate controls " over U.S. taxpayer money used to fund the commission .
A UNDP spokesman , Stephane Dujarric , said he could not comment on specific findings in the audits , since they were still in draft form .
However , he said the agency strived to rigorously account for spending despite operating in a war zone .
" The insecurity , the lack of infrastructure , the pervasive corruption and harshness of the terrain make the implementation of any project extremely difficult , " Dujarric said .
" That being said , those challenges in no way absolve us of constantly doing our utmost to ensure that monies given to us by donors are properly spent and accounted for . "
Watkins acknowledged that the U.N. had concerns about the commission as elections approached .
The development agency works closely with the commission , paying salaries , buying supplies and handling logistical questions .
However , he said no evidence had surfaced that money flowing to the commission had been used to buy votes or bribe officials .
" The indications were that ( the commission ) did not have sufficient controls in place .
I can't jump to the conclusion that the money was misappropriated . "
Watkins said he was " much more confident " about the commission 's spending practices after the U.N. tightened controls this summer .
" I think we have a good partner " in the commission , Watkins said .
The U.N. , he said , had suggested cutting the number of polling workers from 160,000 to 60,000 for the runoff election , in part to ensure better - trained workers .
The smaller work force also reflects an effort by the U.N. to have fewer polling stations and fewer workers per station .
He also said the U.N. would blackball at least 200 workers who had been linked to voting centers where fraud was alleged .
In public statements , commission officials have not yet committed to reducing staff or polling stations .
A commission spokesman did not return a request for comment .
The confidential reports are being written by two U.N. audit agencies to examine charges that the U.N. had failed to safeguard $ 263 million in money from the U.S. Agency for International Development that was channeled through the development agency to fund the elections and rebuilding projects .
USAID money accounted for about 40 percent of U.N. spending in Afghanistan between 2003 and 2009 , the audits said .
Overall , the audits found that U.N. monitoring of U.S. taxpayer funds was " seriously inadequate . "
Auditors could not find receipts , work plans or documentation to back up costs for projects such as roads and bridges .
U.N. officials did not conduct site visits to confirm work and did not prepare financial reports for donor countries like the U.S. , the audits found .
The main focus for criticism , however , was U.N. support of the election commission , a seven - member board whose members were appointed by Karzai .
Using U.S. money , the U.N. development agency paid for commission salaries , helped contract out services and was supposed to train the commission to carry out its election responsibilities independently .
But the audit found that the development agency project was " not well managed " and contained several " weaknesses . "
Auditors found that the U.N. development agency had sent more than $ 7 million to the elections commission -- including cash payments to temporary staff -- without proof of expenditures .
The commission also failed to send any financial reports to the U.N. between September 2008 and June 2009 , despite a requirement for monthly statements .
The U.N. sent $ 9 million in total to the commission without ever receiving a financial report , the audit said .
The auditors made no findings as to whether the money that flowed to the commission was implicated in the fraudulent vote counting .
Auditors said that they had hired an outside audit firm to conduct a more detailed review .
Harry Edwards , a spokesman for USAID , said the agency had not seen the audits and could not comment .
Galbraith cautioned against drawing conclusions as to whether U.N. oversight of financial issues played a significant role in the voting fraud .
He blamed Kai Eide , the Norwegian diplomat who is the senior U.N. official in Afghanistan and his former boss , as well as himself , for not flagging problems with the commission earlier .
Eide has denied any effort to cover up evidence of fraud in the elections process .
" The flaw was not a management flaw , " Galbraith said .
" It was a political flaw to put all this money into an institution that was not as advertised .
It was a political judgment not to say , 'if you want us to pay for these elections , then we insist you do them in this way . ' "
One former U.N. official with knowledge of the elections process said that the allegations of financial mismanagement were not surprising .
The official , who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the topic , said that neither the U.N. nor the elections commission had a well - developed accounting program .
The commission " had no control over their financial management side , " the U.N. official said .
" It was chaotic .
There was no outside oversight . "
Instead , this official said that senior U.N. and U.S. diplomats pushed for the U.N. development agency to " deliver " the election by working with the elections commission -- despite warnings that the commission was not truly independent .
" Nobody was paying attention .
Nobody wanted to do anything about " the problems at the election commission , the official said .
The draft audits are the latest sign of problems with U.N. oversight of U.S. money in Afghanistan .
Last year , the USAID inspector general issued a report charging that the U.N. had failed to complete U.S. - funded rebuilding projects and stonewalled an investigation into the $ 25.6 million program .
USAID 's inspector general continues to investigate Gary K. Helseth , who headed the U.N. Office for Project Services between 2003 and 2006 , in connection with the rebuilding program , a spokeswoman said .
Helseth 's attorney did not return a request for comment .
The U.N. audits , however , also criticized the work of USAID 's inspector general .
The USAID report , for instance , contained allegations that Mark Oviatt , the senior UNOPS official who replaced Helseth , had used USAID money to renovate a guest house for himself .
Instead , the audit found that the U.N. had paid $ 35,000 out of its own pocket to conduct the renovation .
Oviatt declined comment .
The U.N. audits also chastised the inspector general 's report for attempting to shirk USAID 's responsibility for problems with the development projects .
Donna Dinkler , a spokeswoman for USAID 's inspector general , said , " They can say what they want , but we stand by our findings . "
Mr Azmi took his oath in Hindi ( Photo : Fotocorp )
A legislator in the western Indian state of Maharashtra was attacked by four rivals inside the state assembly for taking an oath in Hindi .
The Samajwadi Party 's Abu Azmi was hit by legislators from a regional party who wanted him to take the oath in the local language , Marathi .
The four assailants have been suspended from the assembly for four years .
There are 18 official languages in India , of which Hindi is one .
Oaths may be taken in any of them .
The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena party has been campaigning for greater rights for the Marathi people of Maharashtra .
The party has been accused of several attacks on migrant workers in the past couple of years .
The MNS is led by Raj Thackeray - a nephew of Bal Thackeray , the founder of the right - wing Hindu Shiv Sena party .
Slapped
The MNS legislators attacked Mr Azmi on Monday as soon as he began taking the oath in Hindi .
They snatched the microphone and one MNS member , Ram Kadam , slapped him .
Later , the assembly passed a resolution suspending the four legislators - Vasant Gite , Shishir Shinde , Ram Kadam and Ramesh Wanjale - for four years for unruly behaviour .
Politicians from various parties have condemned the assault .
India 's governing Congress Party has described the incident as " constitutionally impermissible and democratically shameful " .
The assembly began a three - day special session on Monday for newly - elected legislators to take their oaths .
Assembly elections were held in Maharashtra last month and the Congress and its regional ally Nationalist Congress Party secured a comfortable win .
Maharashtra is one of India 's most important states .
Its capital , Mumbai ( Bombay ) , is the country 's financial centre .
The Congress has ruled the state for the last two terms with its ally the NCP .
Mr Azmi accused the MNS members of double standards .
" The very same MNS people who are spreading hatred , resort to Hindi during elections as they go about asking for votes in Maharashtra .
Their CDs , pamphlets , all are in Hindi , " he said .
" For seeking votes , Hindi is good , but they raise objections if some official work like oath - taking is held in the Hindi language .
" Yesterday it was proved that they have nothing against English .
If somebody takes the oath in English in the Maharashtra assembly , they will have no objection , but if anybody takes the oath in Hindi ... they will be manhandled . "

Americans have a truly depressingly low level of financial literacy , raising questions about whether many of our fellow citizens have the basic cognitive skills necessary to prosper in a complex modern economy .
Can anything be done about this ?
The behavioral economics types want the government to craft rules that would nudge the illiterate to make smart choices .
Unfortunately , this program is hobbled by the reality of government operations .
Instead of nudging the illiterate toward wise financial decisions , any paternalistic program will likely nudge people toward decisions that benefit influential special interest groups .
Perhaps we could try to provide better financial education .
This is the favored policy of many on both the center - right and center - left , who want to empower people to make good decisions for themselves .
Last Friday , for instance , officials from the SEC , FINRA and the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy visited 18 elementary schools throughout the county to teach a class on financial literacy .
“ Teaching children about money is an investment in the future , because an investment in financial literacy can pay a lifetime of dividends , ” SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said .
Unfortunately , this may just be wishful thinking .
Lisa Fairfax at the Conglomerate blog dug up a 2008 study that shows that our efforts to invest in financial literacy have a grim rate of return .
Eleven years ago the Jump$tart program began measuring financial literacy and discovered the average financial literacy score for high school students was 57.3 % , which is frighteningly low .
After a decade of effort to improve financial literacy , including hundreds of efforts at the state and federal level , the average score declined to 48.3 % .
Jump $ start notes that high school students who take financial literacy courses do not fare any better than those who do n't .
On one level , this is startling .
It challenges the very notion that we have any real clue about how to improve financial literacy .
But , beneath those raw numbers , there is some hopeful news .
When the survey was first taken , children of wealthier parents performed worse than children of poorer parents on the exam .
After a decade of financial education , that situation was reversed .
So it seems we can educate some youths in financial literacy .
Perhaps we should n't be that surprised that scores are declining .
During the same period , overall literacy and numeracy rates among Americans also fell .
So the problem is n't really confined to financial literacy .
" [ O ] ne thing I would say is that these issues are an under - appreciated cost of the bad job America does of educating poor children .
Basic math and literacy skills are n’t the same as financial literacy .
But financial literacy is built out of reading stuff ( terms of contracts , fine print on ads , etc. ) and doing a little math with it .
And an awful lot of people lack “ financial literacy ” because they ’re basically illiterate , " Matthew Yglesias wrote a year ago .
Unfortunately , we do n't really know very much about improving the situation .
Experience suggests that putting more funding and attention into education is n't doing the trick .
Some have suggested that de-emphasizing college admissions , where students are expected to do well on abstract math tests instead of practical applications of math such as paying off credit cards , might improve financial literacy .
Perhaps one practical solution would be to adopt policies aimed directly at limiting the number of poor people in the country , or at the very least not increasing the number .
It seems like common sense : if the poor are doing badly in terms of financial literacy , let 's have fewer of them .
A program of " less poor people " would include tax policies that encourage wealth creation and business formation , of course .
But also we'd want to avoid wealth destroying asset bubbles or savings destroying inflation .
A likely part of this policy mix would include restrictions on immigrants who can be expected to be on the bottom rung on the economic ladder .
Would this work ?
To be honest , we do n't know .
We 'll always have poor people , and we 're continually discovering the limited efficacy of poverty programs and education to alleviate many of the maladies that accompany poverty .
But what we 're doing now sure is n't working .
The French Football Federation was today trying to play down reports of a bust - up between the players and the coach , Raymond Domenech , ahead of Wednesday 's crucial World Cup qualifier in Serbia .
Les Bleus ' hopes of automatic qualification for South Africa 2010 could rest on the outcome in Belgrade with France knowing defeat will mean finishing top in Group Seven is no longer a possibility .
Domenech 's side have been the architects of their own downfall with another sub - standard display resulting in a 1 - 1 draw against Romania at the Stade de France on Saturday .
The spirit in the camp has not been helped by revelations this morning of a pre-match row involving Domenech and his players , led by Thierry Henry .
Le Parisien reported Domenech tried to spark a reaction from his players before the Romania game by questioning their hunger .
Henry is believed to have responded on behalf of the squad by stating the players were uninspired by training sessions before adding : " I have been in the France team for 12 years and never have I been in this situation .
We do not know how to play , where to go , there is no organisation .
There is no style , no guidance and no identity . "
The French Football Federation ( FFF ) insists there is " no urgency " to speak about the matter but the incident is sure to create further questions about Domenech 's position , which could become untenable anyway should the team not qualify .
The FFF president , Jean - Pierre Escalettes , pledged his support to Domenech yesterday , saying : " I repeat : yes , yes , yes .
I have to say it three times .
He has the job of qualifying us for the World Cup .
And I repeat that even if we have to go into the play - offs , it 's still Raymond Domenech 's job . "
France have two injury worries for Wednesday 's game with doubts over Julien Escudé and Franck Ribéry .
The defender Escudé , who scored an own - goal on Saturday , is least likely to play , with Ribéry 's problem a continuation of a calf injury that has hampered his start of the season with Bayern Munich .
Despite the French camp seemingly in disarray , Serbia 's defender Nemanja Vidic claims the visitors are still favourites to claim all three points .
The Manchester United centre - half told L'Equipe that being four points ahead of France " does not change anything " .
" We will play against a very good team , " he said .
" But the French are under pressure to get a result .
After this game we still have to play Romania .
Nothing is settled in this group . "
Kylyssa
Shay was homeless for over a year in her youth ; it lead to her activism involving homelessness .
She thinks , feels , and has opinions .
When I was homeless , I spent a lot of my time sleeping " in the rough , " which is another way of saying outdoors .
Many homed people assume the homeless do n't use shelters because they 're drug users ( and drug use is against the rules ) or refuse to follow some other aspect of the shelter 's rules .
But no , I was neither using drugs nor too defiant to obey the rules .
I 've been asked why I did n't just stay in shelters .
The issue is pretty complex , but here is my answer , my reasons for sleeping in the rough , and also some of the reasons I 've seen others avoid shelters .
Some of these might surprise you .
I know I was shocked to discover a few of them myself .
Please keep in mind that not all facilities have all or even any of these downsides .
Still , these are the things many homeless people have experienced at some facilities in the U.S. which may have caused them to later avoid using them at all .
There are good ones out there , too .
They can just be hard to find sometimes .
Note :
As someone who has worked in homeless shelters , I am very aware that the vast majority of these workers are good people who are doing their best .
I am glad that these facilities exist to help people without homes .
However , it would be an injustice to pretend that shelters in America are plentiful enough or that they 're all safe enough , or free from other downsides .

19 . No Pets Allowed
Trading faithful companionship for somewhere legal to sleep is not an option for some .
Think about your family dog , the one you 've loved for years who is a member of your family .
Now imagine that you become homeless and all you have left of your old life is that faithful , lifetime friend .
He is your only source of affection and companionship .
Could you abandon him without a second thought ?
Pets are usually not allowed into shelters , so their owners often choose to sleep outside with the only friends who have n't deserted them : their pets .
18 . Denied Entry Due to Mental Illness
Some people are denied entry due to mental illness , even if caregivers have given them paperwork stating that they are not a danger to themselves or others .
Since most workers and volunteers are not trained to distinguish between violent criminals and harmless people with mental illnesses , the tendency is to be overly cautious and refuse anyone with any mental health issues entry at some ( but thankfully not all ) shelters .
Workers and organizations cannot be blamed for being ill - equipped to handle mentally ill clients because they simply do n't have the resources to train volunteers or workers .
17 . Discrimination Against LGBTQ
People
40 % of homeless teens and youth identify as LGBT and often do n't use shelters because many of those places , like the parents who discarded them , discriminate against gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgender people .
According to the National Coalition for the Homeless ,
" LGBT youth are also disproportionally homeless due to overt discrimination when seeking alternative housing – widespread discrimination in federally funded institutions frequently contributes to the growing rates of homelessness among LGBT youth .
Once homeless , these youth experience greater physical and sexual exploitation than their heterosexual counterparts . "
Shelters are often infested with lice or other parasites .

16 . Fear of Contracting Parasites like Lice , Scabies , Pubic Lice , or Bedbugs
No matter how clean a facility is kept , the danger of getting parasites there is still very high .
Mind you , this is not the fault of staff or organizations running shelters , it is simply a hazard of having sleeping arrangements that hundreds of people cycle through ; bedbugs are now even fairly common in high end hotels .
Homeless people tend to carry a lot of parasites , likely because they tend to sleep in lots of different places .
So if you sleep every night in a different bed that a long string of other people have slept in , or if you sleep too close to an ever - changing assortment of people , eventually you are bound to get head lice , pubic lice , or scabies , and it's hard as heck to get rid of parasites when you have no home .
Bedbugs are a biting parasite that can easily infest a bedroll , backpack , clothes , or other possessions .
Homeless people do n't want to infest the homes of people who give them a place to stay for the night or to bring bedbugs to work with them .
Volunteers and employees also need to take precautions to avoid bringing bedbugs home with them .
The parasites commonly present in shelters were my second most important reason for avoiding them .
I 'm itching right now just thinking about the nasty things .
15 . Hours of Operation Incompatible with Work Hours
Contrary to popular belief , many homeless people have jobs .
Because check - in hours for shelters are often rigid and the process of waiting in line and checking in usually takes hours , many working poor cannot use them .
Others work evening or night hours which do n't allow them to get inside before curfew .
People who work from nine to five usually can't use them , either , since by the time they get off work , it 's usually too late for them to get in line for check - in .
Another reason some shelters are incompatible with employment is that they require people to attend AA or other drug abuse rehab classes , often held during normal work hours , every day or most days they use the facility , whether they have a drug or alcohol problem or not .
Others require those who use their services to take rudimentary job skill classes or other life - skill classes during business hours even if employed and already well - educated on those topics .
By the time I had a regular job , I had decided to sleep outside exclusively , so this was not a problem for me .
Shelters attract predators .

14 . Danger of Rape or Assault
Homeless shelters and the areas around them are often hunting grounds for human predators .
Some of the craftier ones get jobs at the charities while most others just watch for individuals departing in the morning or arriving in the evening .
It 's not just rapists , either .
Predators in search of " excitement " will track a lone person leaving a facility so they can beat him or harass him for fun .
Also , although there are usually attendants of some kind on watch , almost none of them are trained to deal with violent behavior , leaving users vulnerable .
Volunteer workers honestly cannot be expected to put themselves in the sort of danger intervening in such situations requires , nor can they have eyes on the backs of their heads or keep watch over everyone .
Lack of sufficient staffing is common and people can only do so much .
For me , this was the number one reason to avoid them .
Once you get raped or assaulted in a shelter or because you were trailed after leaving one , you just do n't want to try it again , no matter how hot or cold or rainy or otherwise unpleasant it is outside .
Criminals are well aware that police seldom take complaints from people without homes seriously .
Many people avoid shelters because pretending to not be homeless ( which means avoiding shelters , missions , and soup kitchens ) is one of the most effective ways to avoid such predators .
13 . Fear of Contracting Disease
Diseases spread easily in close quarters .
There 's always at least one person with a cough .
One reason it's hard to fall asleep in a shelter is the almost endless coughing .
Many of those with coughs have chronic illnesses or transmissible diseases .
Tuberculosis is frighteningly common among people living on the street .
When you may have to sleep out in the elements on any given night ( there 's no guarantee you 'll get into a shelter every night ) , even the flu can be a life - threatening disease to contract .
If you know that many people are homeless due to ill health or chronic illnesses , you 'll see why accommodations full of sick people pose an even greater risk to them .
12 . An Invasive and Disrespectful Check - In Process
This answer has brought me a lot of flack , but even though it played only a minor part in my decision not to use shelters , I feel it is important to mention :
The check - in process in some but not all of these places is sometimes humiliating and dehumanizing .
On more than one occasion , I was asked questions such as , " Do you have any sexual partners you could stay with ? " as well as other questions about my sex life .
One worker even said that I find a boyfriend to stay with , basically suggesting I exchange sexual favors for a place to sleep .
Keep in mind that I , like most women homeless more than a few weeks , had already been the victim of sexual assault .
It made me feel horrible , like I was less than a person and had nothing else to offer anyone .
Many shelters do n't offer accommodations for the handicapped .

11 . Lack of Handicapped Accommodations
While I was waiting to talk to someone about volunteering at an associated soup kitchen , I was shocked to see someone turned away because he was in a wheelchair .
Another person and I offered to pull his chair up the stairs and help him inside if he needed it , but they told us it had to do with insurance concerns and said that they were sorry but , no , he could n't stay .
That was the first time I saw a handicapped person turned away from a homeless shelter but sadly , it was not the last .
Many of these organizations make use of old buildings re-purposed to fit a bunch of beds .
Sometimes their beds are located above the first floor and they have no elevators .
Some do n't have railings in the restrooms or ramps into the rooms or buildings either .
While it is not the fault of those who run them , some facilities are unable to accommodate people in wheelchairs .
Regardless of what the Americans with Disabilities Act says , some places that provide temporary housing turn away people in wheelchairs or with other mobility limitations such as the need to use a walker or crutches to get around .
While sometimes they will offer a hotel voucher to the disabled person , that does n't always happen .
Not every organization has the funds to do this and a shelter can get shut down if they break the rules .
They truly do n't want to turn away disabled people , but they may have no choice .
10 . Drug Addictions
Yes , some people avoid shelters because of drug addictions — their own or others ' .
Since many locations have signs insisting they are drug free zones , some drug users will avoid them .
However , many drug users and dealers do not , making some of them hot spots of drug activity , and those frightened by drug related activity may come to avoid shelters because of this , quite reasonably fearing for their or their children 's safety .
Still others are themselves trying to get off drugs and being around other users makes it very difficult for them to do so , so they avoid staying there while trying to kick their drug or alcohol habits .
9. Separation of Family Members
This is a biggie and it's pretty horrible when you think about it :
Most homeless shelters separate families .
Women can bring their pre-teen children into most women 's facilities , but teenage male children ( as young as 13 ) may be required to go to a men's shelter which they may not even get into .
Can you imagine a mother leaving her young teenage son to sleep alone on the street without her protection while she sleeps inside ?
Most parents will not leave their children , so instead , the whole family sleeps in their car or outside .
Men and women usually cannot stay in the same place , so husbands and wives are separated , knowing their spouse might not get a bed somewhere else .
These people are often elderly or disabled and depend on each other for safety and care .
So again , most of them will forgo the use of temporary emergency housing so they can take care of each other .
Also , children cannot stay in the vast majority of men's shelters .
This leaves single fathers in a very difficult spot , one that is not only heartbreaking but criminal .
While some may say the children should just be taken away , the homelessness is usually temporary and the loss of a parent or parents will probably affect a child more deeply than a month or so living with insecurity and discomfort .

8. Some Service Dogs are Barred from Entry
Service dogs , other than seeing eye and hearing assistance dogs , are sometimes denied entry to homeless facilities .
Mobility dogs ( that help you stand or get into your wheelchair , assist you up stairs , etc. ) , dogs that provide assistance for mental conditions such as anxiety or agoraphobia , and other service dogs are even more often denied entry .
People frequently lose their own identification papers , often through no fault of their own , so it is no surprise that they often lose identification papers for their service animals .
Even in the case of seeing eye and hearing assistance dogs , if the person has lost the dog 's paperwork or does n't have an official harness , the dog will not be allowed inside .
Few people in that situation will abandon a service dog .
While it is perfectly understandable that facilities will not allow animals , especially those that are not service animals , it 's also perfectly understandable that disabled people would not be willing to part with an animal that increases their ability to function , especially at the risk of having that animal die from exposure or get lost or stolen .
Many people who rely on animals for independence and safety are unwilling to be separated from them for any reason .
7. Staff Assumptions about Drug Use and Criminality
While it was not often said aloud , many shelter employees and volunteers regard all people who need their services as drug addicts and criminals .
To avoid being perceived as such , many avoid using those services .
When you are homeless , many people will automatically treat you as a criminal and a drug user .
They are unable to comprehend that a person without a home may just be someone down on his or her luck without any wrongdoing on his or her part .
While I 'm sure they mean well , many organizations and their employees or volunteers take it upon themselves to cure people of their sometimes non-existent addictions and criminal ways .
Some put a lot of pressure on homeless people to attend alcohol and drug abuse counseling even if they are not alcohol or drug abusers .
I remember the smirks and questioning looks I got when I insisted I had no drug or alcohol abuse issues .
One employee actually asked me , " Well , then , why are you so skinny ? "
Forced participation in substance abuse counseling takes time away from job searches and current employment which the average person in such a situation cannot afford , causing most employed homeless people and those actively seeking employment to avoid shelters that require it .
6. Danger of Theft
While most homeless people are not thieves , a few of them are .
It only takes one to spoil it for everyone else .
When you have no home , your little bit of stuff is precious ; it 's all you have .
While I was not robbed inside a shelter , I heard stories from many who were .
They stopped using shelters to protect their few meager possessions from theft .
Shoes are among the most commonly stolen items .
Foot care is incredibly important and the loss of your only pair of shoes can be life - threatening .
It can also be extremely difficult to replace them if they get stolen .
5. Religious Differences
Most shelters and kitchens have some sort of religious service people are required to sit through to eat or sleep there .
I 'm an atheist , but this did n't bother me much .
Frankly , I was pleased to be in a climate - controlled room and sitting at rest somewhere without fear of getting harassed by gangs or police , no matter what I had to pretend to believe .
It did n't even bother me that I had to give lip - service to the notion that I was being punished by God for being a bad person .
However , some people object to this , often people with strong religious beliefs of their own who believe they already have a good relationship with God .
I 've met a fair number of people unwilling to sit through the services and pretend their situation is a just punishment from God for being a terrible person .
Very religious people might get extremely offended when someone looks down on them and tells them they do n't have a good enough relationship with Jesus to deserve a place to live .
4. Lack of Privacy and Fear of Crowds
Many homed people would argue that people who are down on their luck are not deserving of privacy .
However , the complete lack of privacy can be especially hard on people with mental disorders that make them fear crowds .
I encountered several crowd - phobic people who could not be convinced to use a homeless facility even though they were sickly and ill - suited to outdoor sleeping even when the weather was good .
Deserving of privacy or not , people with mental illnesses that cause a fear of crowds or even a fear of a moderate number of people packed into close quarters are genuinely terrified of such conditions , even in the safest of circumstances .
Charities understandably try to make the most of their square footage by squeezing as many beds into their facility as possible .
Unfortunately , that can make them frightening to people with PTSD , claustrophobia , social anxiety , or fear of crowds .
3. Lack of Control
By the time a person is on the street , his or her life is usually already careening out of control .
That feeling can be enhanced by the regimented check - in times , eating , prayer , sleep times , and check - out in a shelter .
Some people stay out - of - doors so they can feel like they have some vestige of control over their own lives .

2. Rules That Unfairly Endanger Disabled Individuals
Walkers , crutches , and canes are sometimes taken away from users at some organizations during check - in .
Sometimes , even appliances such as leg braces are taken away for " safe keeping . "
While I can understand that the danger of theft is very real , and that some people who are mentally ill might hit people with their crutches , braces , or walkers , it is frightening to be left without mobility in a strange place .
So some who have need of medical appliances or mobility assisting devices forgo the use of homeless facilities .
1. Lack of Available Beds
There is not enough safe , legal shelter for everyone .
No matter how many people choose not to use them , there are still not nearly enough beds available for those who would like to sleep indoors despite the risks involved .
In most cities in the US , there 's space for less than 25 % of the homeless people living in that city .
In some cities , there is room for less than 5 % of their homeless population .
Additionally , many cities have made ordinances limiting the number of people a charity may serve .
In some , they may not provide beds for more than 20 people !
Additionally , some cities have created ordinances barring services from being located in or near the downtown area ( where the churches and other organizations likely to provide such services are most likely to own property ) or laws preventing two shelters from being within a certain distance of each other .
This is why lines to check in form so early in the day and staff is often so quick to deny entry to people for the most trivial of reasons .
This may be why some facilities have made their requirements for use so restrictive .
In fact , some of them have made their requirements so strict that , in some cases and despite a long line of people trying to get a place to sleep , they do n't even fill the number of beds they have .
In my opinion , the ordinances are a bigger issue than the lack of funding because the ordinances have prevented people with funding from opening or expanding existing shelters .
What you can do about it is find out what your local laws are regarding homeless facilities and write to your congresspeople and representatives as well as donating to local charities and helping to fund new ones .
Are Current Shelters Perfectly Adequate to Serve the Unhomed Population ?
Do you think that current shelters are sufficient in number , quality , and dignity to serve the needs of the American homeless population ?

While this comment by Camden Reed is off - topic , I decided to allow it to be published to help illustrate how misguided religious people can interfere with helping homeless people while acting as if their efforts to stop the spread of information are somehow divinely inspired .
Because such comments are rarely civil , I 'd like to take the opportunity to publish those that are n't profanity - stuffed so that others can see that such attitudes really do exist .
Dear Camden Reed ,
What gives you the idea that Jesus wants you to stop writers from spreading information about what homeless people experience and how they can escape homelessness by " politely " asking them to stop thinking and to stop trying to find solutions ?
The Jesus my Christian friends and family members worship is a lot different from your Jesus if yours actually did put you on a quest to silence voices that make you feel uncomfortable .
My friends ' and family members '
Jesus is all about speaking with honesty , helping poor people , and reducing suffering , so they are in full support of my activism .
Why do n't you tell us about your Jesus and why He does n't want me to think or help other people with their struggles and explain why you think
He 's better than the Jesus my loved ones worship ?
By the way , I only published the comment from this particular sock puppet .

Hi , my name is Camden Reed , and I 'm a high - schooler , and I 'm reading this article to help strengthen my essay on homelessness .
I know this might be the last thing you would want to read , but I would feel guilty if I did n't take an opportunity to express Jesus with you !
Jesus saved my life a while back , and I know what it feels like to be without him .
In my opinion , no one should ever go their life separated from God .
I understand what you may be thinking .
" Why is this Christian imposing his beliefs on me ? " or " Why can't I just live my life and you live yours ? " you might ask .
Well , it 's the role of the Christian to share the good news of Jesus Christ to " all 4 corners of the Earth " .
I know it 's hard to be an atheist when people like me are always ranting about God , but I think ( from former - atheist to atheist ) every atheist fears that there actually is a God .
It 's natural .
Atheists try to make everything in the world make sense , but they can't .
I sure could n't ...
God is on the move , and He 's reaching out to you .
If you accept Jesus into your heart , you will never go through your struggles , alone .
God will never stop reaching out to you , but do n't wait until later to become a believer in Christ .
If you choose Christ , today , you 'll have one less thing to think about , tomorrow !
I believe God is calling you , and as a former - atheist , I think the best advice I can give you is to stop trying to make sense of everything .
“ I am not a genius , I am just curious .
I ask many questions .
and when the answer is simple , then God is answering . ”

“ But maybe it 's what the world needs .
A little less sense , and a little more faith . ”

Richard Sittig : I got off - track .
What I wanted to say is thank you for posting these articles , they are helping me plan ahead and brought up several things I did n't even consider !
I 'm terrified for the future but I 'm doing what I can despite my own issues to try and ensure I 'm not on the streets longer than a month , and your work has helped build the foundation of which I will launch from when that time comes .
Thank you !

Richard : @ Kylyssa
Heck , I wish there were more people like you here in Missouri .
I started out earlier reading your exhaustive article on what to buy if you are / for the homeless , and wound up here because I had concerns about the shelters especially in my area because it seems my state has some of the worst programs and shelters around .
I could be wrong .
If you had n't already guessed , I 'm essentially homeless myself ; I 'll be out on the streets at the end of the month ( my birthday , no less .
Joy :/) .
I had a turn of bad luck with former roommates stealing everything I had when I went on a temp work job trip doing landscaping .
I sent them most of the money I was making to work on the house which needed a LOT of work , and then come to find out I go home and every single thing was gone except for a couple tore up couches and useless furniture .
No idea whatever happened to these guys but it left me with next to nothing and I had already moved there because I lost my landscaping job of 12 years due to the owner selling the business .
So yea , I 'm down in the dumps .

Please explain how it would benefit , say , your own mother , if your father passed away and she became too ill to work and support herself for you to practice tough love and let her die on the street as older people tend to do when ill ?
Would you just sadly say , oh , she made her bed , now she has to lie in it , when you found out she 'd been beaten and raped as most women suffering homelessness are ?
Because that is exactly what you are advocating for .
You are advocating for the abandonment and suffering of people who are out of their depths and unable to help themselves .

Guess
Who : I think people are right , enough is enough .
Tough love is the key to ending homelessness .
Yeah , sure it sucks , but if you 're homeless cuz of choices in your life that u made then you need to suffer the consequences and if that means being homeless then that means being homeless .
Do n't get me wrong it's not that I have no compassion , I do but I do believe that in order for you to turn your life around you need to suffer all consequences for the choices in life that you make .
Tough love is the key whether it 's homelessness or addiction .
God helps those who help themselves ..

You and I both know what I 've said on this page is true .
I 'm actually glad people make comments like Irrelevant 's because many decent people just do n't comprehend the level of hatred some individuals have towards people who are homeless .
There 's frequently little logic normal people can see in anything people warped by hatred say .

This comment is for Irrelevant :
In your comment of 2 years ago , you said that a lot of the stories you 've read or heard about the shelters are fabricated , , & HOW THE HELL WOULD YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE NEVER HAD TO USE ONE !!
Rhoda :
Many people in homeless shelters are coerced into saying that they have a " disability " solely to be able to receive aid .
This is true in North Carolina and in Tennessee .
I was told " if you do not sign this form saying that you have a disability , we will not help you at the Bethesda Center in North Carolina and at the Bread Of Life Center in Tennessee .

It 's also actually cheaper .
It costs less to house a person than to maintain a single cot in most homeless shelters .
It 's safer , cleaner , healthier , and allows for the growth of self - esteem and confidence .
It aids in getting more work hours or regaining employment if the person is unemployed .
But folks do n't want the " undeserving poor " to get things they do n't feel they are human enough to have .
They 'd rather have more money spent keeping people in lousy conditions on the theory that if homelessness sucks enough , people will escape it .
They do n't realize that homelessness already sucks immensely and if people saw the way out , they 'd take it .
Most of the folks I 've helped find homes have done brilliantly all on their own once the money issue has been solved .
A huge percentage are on the streets for losing everything to medical bills or illness ( their own or a dependent 's ) , getting kicked out for being gay , being disabled Veterans the government refuses to help , working at exploitative businesses that do not pay living wages , or due to losing a job from downsizing

Providing those homes , and the rent to enable keeping them would be an infinitely better solution .

Yes , the current housing of homeless people is fine .
I 'll let the author of this article in on a little secret .
The accommodations are not supposed to be pleasant , easy to deal with or anywhere on par with a person 's actual home .
That might encourage them to want to stay in the homeless shelter , rather than re-integrate into regular society with the rest of us .
Homeless shelters are not places where people should keep coming back to again and again .
Personally , I think that people should be banned from homeless shelters after staying for more than a month .
If you can't rebound by then , you 're not trying hard enough !!!!!!

Yes , there should be 24 hour services for homeless .
However , some of the churches and shelters are adding baking soda to the clients food .
Which causes them to not only get full immediately , but causes bloating and high blood pressure .
Families are also separated in some situations , due to age .
MUCH CORRUPTION takes place through that of circles including staff and advocates slowing you down or stopping you from getting out of these shelters .
They assign people to fraternize with family members that are adulthood .
They need more professional staff and advocates .
These people are unprofessional and disrespect the homeless clients .
The clients do not receive much help , staff etc.keep much of the donated items themselves and they do not drive the clients for appointments unless your one of the few that are favored .
I have had numerous problems in the shelter .
The workers are extremely corrupt .

What a rare and wonderful shelter you manage ; you have no idea what a good organization you are in charge of if you think it is typical .
You should feel extremely proud to work where you do as your shelter displays a degree of excellence uncommon in American homeless shelters .
My " irrational " ideas about homeless shelters came from both being homeless once upon a time and using assorted shelters across the US and volunteering in them later when I was in much better circumstances .
Some of the things you mention are downright illegal in some cities .
Some American cities limit homeless shelters to a certain number of beds far less than 400 .
A shelter that is allowed to provide beds outside of the night - time hours is extremely rare .
Please leave a link to your shelter 's information page and I will be sure to promote it in the hopes it will help donations to an excellent homeless shelter .
I 'm working on a page full of good American homeless shelters to give them the credit that is due and to illustrate how it ought to be done .
Just ask the people you serve if your homeless shelter is typical of shelters they 've stayed in .
I 'll bet your shelter is the best any of them have ever found or heard of .
I 'm not sure how personal experiences count as irrational but I 'll bet most of your clients have had similar " irrational " personal experiences in other shelters .
Especially ask the lgbtq people you serve if they 've ever experienced discrimination or violence outside of or inside of other shelters .
You have no idea of what a good job you are doing in comparison to what 's out there .

Anonymous : I have worked at a homeless shelter for many years and can say this person has irrational ideas about homeless shelters .
I 'm sure there are people who should n't be working in a shelter because they lack the compassion needed .
We serve roughly 400 a night in a clean , safe environment .
We have zero tolerance for any aggressive behavior .
We make accommodations for physically challenged .
We do n't discriminate for any reason .
We make accommodations for those working third shift to sleep during the day even though we are a night shelter only .
We allow people who are impaired due to drugs and alcohol to stay as long as they behave .
We have an extremely clean facility , no bug infestation .
Our intake process is very respectful .
We always strive to treat our guest with respect and dignity .

Kylyssa Shay : @kadymitchell : Many people who are poor now had children when they were not .
Many upper - middle class people such as yourself think it is impossible to lose a job or to have a child or spouse get ill or injured enough to wipe out their savings but they are wrong ; insurance does not cover what you think it does .
Unless people have a few million dollars in the bank there 's really no way to be sure they will always have money .
That is how people such as yourself end up homeless .
You are one major illness or accident from homelessness now or in the future unless you have at least a million dollars in the bank .
Everyone is very shocked when it happens to them , especially the folks such as yourself who think poverty equals moral bankruptcy .
I hope you never face the situation but the only way many people dead set on the idea that poverty equals being a bad and stupid person is when they experience it themselves .
If an upper - middle class family becomes poor after they have children , what do you suggest be done with those children ?
It is n't as if God makes the children " did n't happen " or magically whisks them off to a rich family when a spouse dies or leaves , or if a child or parent gets so ill or injured that savings get wiped out , or when jobs get lost when the jobs cease to exist .
Would you give up your children if you suddenly became poor ?
The truth is that many families do not step up .
They believe poverty equals stupidity and moral bankruptcy .
They tell even their sick , elderly parents , " you made your bed , now lie in it " after those parents did things like putting them through college , giving them the down payments on their first houses , and providing free childcare to their children .
In working with homeless people , I encountered very few people who had children after they were poor and many who had children before illness , tragedy , or a rotten economy struck .
Most were earning middle - class or upper - middle - class wages just like the folks you think should be allowed to have children when they chose to have children .
They were just like you before really rotten stuff happened in their lives - no better , no worse .

Yes , no matter how many are built there will never be enough ... so many people have just given up .
Families have to stick together and help one another .
People have to learn if you cannot afford to have children , then do n't because it's not the governments responsibility to raise them .

Anonymous : Esvoytko is a man after my own heart .
There is no reason why someone , especially a family , should be homeless .
What a disgrace .
Whatever happened to the common good ?
I live in NYC and there are thousands of working families who are homeless .
This is a very complex problem and only a person with pathology problems would prefer panhandling to permanent shelter .
No wonder we are in this situation .
Public policies must address the social and economic issues that creates this problem instead of focusing on a few miscreants and punishing those who really need help .

Mowug1776 : S ome people have given up hope completely .
I myself at times have as well the problem is not that there 's enough beds find that the American people have lost their love for each other we are too greedy to see that we should wait and help others out there for buying the brand - new Mercedes - Benz that we may not be able to afford in a couple months .
Also that excuse could also be put out because they do n't want to help themselves I have started to help out at a mission .
I find that many of them may have even shows the lifestyle in actuality at the mission there is one man that comes in who actually is a real estate investor and quite frankly because of his sorrows drains himself to the point that he himself is homeless .
He happens to be a veteran Delta force I believe if we can help the road may be harder than he may have a will to change .
What we need is more family helping family .

Kylyssa Shay :
Math alone proves that more than 10 % of homeless people successfully re-integrate into society because otherwise , we'd be overrun with tens of millions of homeless people !
There are far more formerly homeless people than homeless people living in America .
Over 80 % of Americans who experience homelessness get into homes and do not experience homelessness again .
Math alone also shows us that there are not enough homeless shelters .
When there are more homeless people than beds , there will be homeless people who can't use them no matter how much they might want to .
I do n't know if you 've driven past any homeless shelters lately but here in Grand Rapids the lines for them wrap around the buildings .
The number of shelters and beds also keeps decreasing all while the number of homeless people increases .
Math also shows us that some people will inevitably be left without jobs ( and become likely to become homeless ) when the number of adults in our country exceeds the number of jobs that exist .
That 's not even taking into account the number of jobs out there that are too part - time to live on .
Over a period of about eighteen years I took in seventeen homeless teens and young adults , three couples , a man in his fifties and a woman in her sixties .
Out of those twenty - five people , twenty - one succeeded in re-integrating into society .
That 's around the typical 80 % mark .
Perhaps you are having such a terrible success rate because you are focusing on panhandlers and chronically homeless folks ?
And , since you gave an anecdote about a couple refusing to stay with you because you separated them , you just backed up one of the reasons I listed .
I'm secure in the knowledge that what I say here on this page about homeless shelters is true .
I 've personally witnessed most of these problems and , on occasion , I had to enforce some of these policies I disagree with while volunteering in shelters .
I 've learned of the other issues from other volunteers and from homeless and formerly homeless people .

ClifRad : Yes .
I work with the homeless and I 've had over 100 live in my house with my family over the last ten years .
They were right off the street .
Very few want to get back into the mainstream .
Probably only 10 % I 've dealt with .
It is way too easy to make it on the street with pan handling , feeding programs , food cards , SSI , state programs , hotel vouchers ...
And the reasons you gave for them not using shelter is bogus .
They are most generally rebellious and anti-social , that 's is a great generalization .
Like I said 10 % .
We had a couple , rather than be at our house where could n't sleep with one another in there on room , choose an outhouse in town .
Go figure .
They need help and that help needs to given rightly .
You work you eat .
You want to play the game your on your own .

They are most generally rebellious and anti-social , that 's is a great generalization .
Like I said 10 % .
We had a couple , rather than be at our house where could n't sleep with one another in there on room , choose an outhouse in town .
Go figure .
They need help and that help needs to given rightly .
You work you eat .
You want to play the game your on your own .

MargoPArrowsmith : I worked for a while on Saturdays doing intakes in the local state mental hospital .
The men who came in without a discharge home would be discharged ' to the street ' but they would n't do that with women .
The doctors would keep them there sometimes for months , just because they had no place to go .
So they would discharge crazy men and sane ( r ) women would be kept there as an involuntary homeless shelter .

Speth : People need homes and the support to learn or remember how to live in them .
Providing those homes , and the rent to enable keeping them would be an infinitely better solution .

Yes , the current housing of homeless people is fine .
I 'll let the author of this article in on a little secret .
The accommodations are not supposed to be pleasant , easy to deal with or anywhere on par with a person 's actual home .
That might encourage them to want to stay in the homeless shelter , rather than re-integrate into regular society with the rest of us .
Homeless shelters are not places where people should keep coming back to again and again .
Personally , I think that people should be banned from homeless shelters after staying for more than a month .
If you can rebound by then , you 're not trying hard enough !!!!!!

Irrelevant : A lot of what I 've read on here about why people do n't stay in shelters are fabricated .
And secondly ,
In Livermore there are n't any shelters for women , unless you have a big fat maggot , then u might get priority to be on the waiting list .

Yes , there should be 24 hour services for homeless .
However , some of the churches and shelters are adding baking soda to the clients food .
Which causes them to not only get full immediately , but causes bloating and high blood pressure .
Families are also separated in some situations , due to age .
MUCH CORRUPTION takes place through that of circles including staff and advocates slowing you down or stopping you from getting out of these shelters .
They assign people to fraternize with family members that are adulthood .
They need more professional staff and advocates .
These people are unprofessional and disrespect the homeless clients .
The clients do not receive much help , staff etc.keep much of the donated items themselves and they do not drive the clients for appointments unless your one of the few that are favored .
I have had numerous problems in the shelter .
The workers are extremely corrupt .

What a rare and wonderful shelter you manage ; you have no idea what a good organization you are in charge of if you think it is typical .
You should feel extremely proud to work where you do as your shelter displays a degree of excellence uncommon in American homeless shelters .
My " irrational " ideas about homeless shelters came from both being homeless once upon a time and using assorted shelters across the US and volunteering in them later when I was in much better circumstances .
Some of the things you mention are downright illegal in some cities .
Some American cities limit homeless shelters to a certain number of beds far less than 400 .
A shelter that is allowed to provide beds outside of the night - time hours is extremely rare .
Please leave a link to your shelter 's information page and I will be sure to promote it in the hopes it will help donations to an excellent homeless shelter .
I 'm working on a page full of good American homeless shelters to give them the credit that is due and to illustrate how it ought to be done .
Just ask the people you serve if your homeless shelter is typical of shelters they 've stayed in .
I 'll bet your shelter is the best any of them have ever found or heard of .
I 'm not sure how personal experiences count as irrational but I 'll bet most of your clients have had similar " irrational " personal experiences in other shelters .
Especially ask the lgbtq people you serve if they 've ever experienced discrimination or violence outside of or inside of other shelters .
You have no idea of what a good job you are doing in comparison to what 's out there .

Anonymous : I have worked at a homeless shelter for many years and can say this person has irrational ideas about homeless shelters .
I 'm sure there are people who should n't be working in a shelter because they lack the compassion needed .
We serve roughly 400 a night in a clean , safe environment .
We have zero tolerance for any aggressive behavior .
We make accommodations for physically challenged .
We do n't discriminate for any reason .
We make accommodations for those working third shift to sleep during the day even though we are a night shelter only .
We allow people who are impaired due to drugs and alcohol to stay as long as they behave .
We have an extremely clean facility , no bug infestation .
Our intake process is very respectful .
We always strive to treat our guest with respect and dignity .

Kylyssa Shay : @kadymitchell : Many people who are poor now had children when they were not .
Many upper - middle class people such as yourself think it is impossible to lose a job or to have a child or spouse get ill or injured enough to wipe out their savings but they are wrong ; insurance does not cover what you think it does .
Unless people have a few million dollars in the bank there 's really no way to be sure they will always have money .
That is how people such as yourself end up homeless .
You are one major illness or accident from homelessness now or in the future unless you have at least a million dollars in the bank .
Everyone is very shocked when it happens to them , especially the folks such as yourself who think poverty equals moral bankruptcy .
I hope you never face the situation but the only way many people dead set on the idea that poverty equals being a bad and stupid person is when they experience it themselves .
If an upper - middle class family becomes poor after they have children , what do you suggest be done with those children ?
It is n't as if God makes the children " did n't happen " or magically whisks them off to a rich family when a spouse dies or leaves , or if a child or parent gets so ill or injured that savings get wiped out , or when jobs get lost when the jobs cease to exist .
Would you give up your children if you suddenly became poor ?
The truth is that many families do not step up .
They believe poverty equals stupidity and moral bankruptcy .
They tell even their sick , elderly parents , " you made your bed , now lie in it " after those parents did things like putting them through college , giving them the down payments on their first houses , and providing free childcare to their children .
In working with homeless people , I encountered very few people who had children after they were poor and many who had children before illness , tragedy , or a rotten economy struck .
Most were earning middle - class or upper - middle - class wages just like the folks you think should be allowed to have children when they chose to have children .
They were just like you before really rotten stuff happened in their lives - no better , no worse .

Yes , no matter how many are built there will never be enough ... so many people have just given up .
Families have to stick together and help one another .
People have to learn if you cannot afford to have children do n't because its not the governments responsibility to raise them .
anonymous : No .
God says to help those in need .
Also you never know when that stranger comes along in need of a meal or a warm coat .
Could be Jesus in disguise .

There is no reason why someone , especially a family , should be homeless .
What a disgrace .
Whatever happened to the common good ?
I live in NYC and there are thousands of working families who are homeless .
This is a very complex problem and only a person with pathology problems would prefer panhandling to permanent shelter .
No wonder we are in this situation .
Public policies must address the social and economic issues that creates this problem instead of focusing on a few miscreants and punishing those who really need help .

Mowug1776 : some people have given up hope completely .
I myself at times have as well the problem is not that there 's enough beds find that the American people have lost their love for each other we are too greedy to see that we should wait and help others out there for buying the brand - new Mercedes - Benz that we may not be able to afford in a couple months .
Also that excuse could also be put out because they do n't want to help themselves I have started to help out at a mission .
I find that many of them may have even shows the lifestyle in actuality at the mission there is one man that comes in who actually is a real estate investor and quite frankly because of his sorrows drains himself to the point that he himself is homeless he happens to be a veteran Delta force I believe if we can help the road may be harder than he may have a will to change .
What we need is more family helping family .

Kylyssa Shay :
Math alone proves that more than 10 % of homeless people successfully re-integrate into society because otherwise , we'd be overrun with tens of millions of homeless people !
There are far more formerly homeless people than homeless people living in America .
Over 80 % of Americans who experience homelessness get into homes and do not experience homelessness again .
Math alone also shows us that there are not enough homeless shelters .
When there are more homeless people than beds , there will be homeless people who can't use them no matter how much they might want to .
I do n't know if you 've driven past any homeless shelters lately but here in Grand Rapids the lines for them wrap around the buildings .
The number of shelters and beds also keeps decreasing all while the number of homeless people increases .
Math also shows us that some people will inevitably be left without jobs ( and become likely to become homeless ) when the number of adults in our country exceeds the number of jobs that exist .
That 's not even taking into account the number of jobs out there that are too part - time to live on .
Over a period of about eighteen years I took in seventeen homeless teens and young adults , three couples , a man in his fifties and a woman in her sixties .
Out of those twenty - five people , twenty - one succeeded in re-integrating into society .
That 's around the typical 80 % mark .
Perhaps you are having such a terrible success rate because you are focusing on panhandlers and chronically homeless folks ?
And , since you gave an anecdote about a couple refusing to stay with you because you separated them , you just backed up one of the reasons I listed .
I'm secure in the knowledge that what I say here on this page about homeless shelters is true .
I 've personally witnessed most of these problems and , on occasion , I had to enforce some of these policies I disagree with while volunteering in shelters .
I 've learned of the other issues from other volunteers and from homeless and formerly homeless people .

Helps folks like me who have never been homeless understand better , and could be used by people working to create better shelters or to improve the conditions of existing ones .
Thank you !

The problem with using the police to determine identities is that most homeless people are n't criminals so they are n't in the system .
Loss of ID is a terrifying experience for people without homes .
It causes all the problems you mentioned plus it presents an additional danger to Americans of Mexican or Hispanic descent ; they could potentially get deported if they can't prove their citizenship .

Claudia : I challenge anyone to walk into the county clerks office without any personal identification give them your name and SS # and have them issue you new ones .
This poses a serious and in many cases life threatening problem for the homeless .
Without the proper Identification they are not able to get any assistance , such as shelters , food , housing , cash and medical care .
Even job applications require ID " s
Would it be possible for local police departments to set aside a day or two a few times a year where homeless people could come in and get their identity verified by either fingerprints police files or even a police officer that has seen proof of their id .
Then give each person a temporary photo id that they could use to get a permanent state Id

I was assaulted by a woman in the Bethesda Center in Winston - Salem , North Carolina .
Her name is " Valeria " and her case manager lied for her and took her side just so that the social worker ( case manager ) could have the money credit for placing her in a new apartment .
She is a sexual predator and the case manager is as well .
The manager of the shelter also took the side of the female assailant .

Jason : I 'm homeless right now , after spending 10 years working abroad I became ill and was repatriated to the United States .
I was happy for the medical treatment I received , but after 3 weeks and a clean bill of health — thank you sir , goodbye !
I had to leave with nowhere to go .
After being gone for ten years , I had to start from scratch .
35 degrees outside and all I had was the t- shirt , shorts and flip - flops I wore when I was returned to the States .
What I , and probably many others truly need are : A place to take a shower , an address to use for mail , canned food that we can store .
No " shelter emloyees " ruining your job search .
Or ruining your job , for that matter .
Do they not understand that it's not a good thing to go to your new boss and ask for a note so you can go back to your homeless shelter after hours so you can work a normal shift ?
The problem is , shelter employees know that in order to expand their operations ( and get more government grants ) is to house a larger homeless population .
Now although they can't " make " more people homeless , they can " keep " more people homeless by not letting them have a job .
Or throwing them out as soon as they get one .
I 've seen it happen twice now ( once to me ) .
We need clothes , a place to shower , and an address to use for mail .
That 's pretty much it .
I wo n't stay in a shelter for the reasons listed above as well as in the article .
A big thing for me is theft , and being around people who use drugs increases the chance of me losing stuff like work shoes -- and ultimately losing my job .

I wo n't stay in a shelter for the reasons listed above as well as in the article .
A big thing for me is theft , and being around people who use drugs increases the chance of me losing stuff like work shoes -- and ultimately losing my job .
ionkosmic : BIG NO unfortunately .
Just take a look at Greece .
Things are really difficult there for homeless people and refuges because very simply the people that create the government are useless and not human .
I really feel shame and pain for what is going there .

It varies quite a bit by place within the US .
In Ft. Lauderdale FL they were impossible to get into .
In Indianapolis IN I got forced to use a men's shelter ( hurrah transphobia ) when I finally got into one , in which I was robbed and raped , of course .
Meanwhile deaths and mutilations from cold were ongoing outside .
To my chagrin , I 'll very shortly find out what being homeless in New York is like .

anonymous : Definitely NOT !
I did n't know of the ordinances preventing expansion ... it seems like cities would rather house people and to keep their cities looking good , than to force people to live in the streets ...

You speak the truth sadly a few of these people who still feel like the homeless deserve it even if they were to become homeless they would still possibly feel this way I think it a coping mechanism

They also usually wo n't escort a person out for not saying " Amen " or for not looking interested during the service but they will often question them intensely .
I usually just sat through the service about what bad people homeless people are and looked interested and said whatever they wanted me to .
But I do n't have a religion so it was n't anything terrible .
It was mostly Christians with other beliefs ( like that Jes
Patriotism is usually the refuge of the scoundrel .
He is the man who talks the loudest .
- Education and Citizenship speech , 5/14/1908
Patriot : the person who can holler the loudest without knowing what he is hollering about .
- More Maxims of Mark , Johnson , 1927
A man can be a Christian or a patriot , but he can't legally be a Christian and a patriot -- except in the usual way : one of the two with the mouth , the other with the heart .
The spirit of Christianity proclaims the brotherhood of the race and the meaning of that strong word has not been left to guesswork , but made tremendously definite -- the Christian must forgive his brother man all crimes he can imagine and commit , and all insults he can conceive and utter - forgive these injuries how many times ?
-- seventy times seven -- another way of saying there shall be no limit to this forgiveness .
That is the spirit and the law of Christianity .
Well -- Patriotism has its laws .
And it also is a perfectly definite one , there are not vaguenesses about it .
It commands that the brother over the border shall be sharply watched and brought to book every time he does us a hurt or offends us with an insult .
Word it as softly as you please , the spirit of patriotism is the spirit of the dog and wolf .
The moment there is a misunderstanding about a boundary line or a hamper of fish or some other squalid matter , see patriotism rise , and hear him split the universe with is war - whoop .
The spirit of patriotism being in its nature jealous and selfish , is just in man 's line , it comes natural to him -- he can live up to all its requirements to the letter ; but the spirit of Christianity is not in its entirety possible to him .
The prayers concealed in what I have been saying is , not that patriotism should cease and not that the talk about universal brotherhood should cease , but that the incongruous firm be dissolved and each limb of it be required to transact business by itself , for the future .

PORTRAITS BY TWO FLAGGS Charles Noel Flagg 's portrait of Clemens at age fifty - five .
Regarding this portrait , Mrs. Clemens complained only that the
necktie was crooked .
" But it 's always crooked , " said Flagg , " and I have a great fancy for the line it makes . "
She straightened it on Clemens himself , but it immediately became
crooked again .
Clemens said : " If you were to make that necktie straight people would say , ' Good
portrait , but there is something the matter with it .
I do n't know where
it is . " '
The tie was left unchanged .
