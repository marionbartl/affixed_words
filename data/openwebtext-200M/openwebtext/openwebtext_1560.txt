In Uganda the conflict between apes and humans is one that causes one species to win at the cost of the other , and the loser is almost always the apes .
Recently , however , farmers in Kyamalera have learned to coexist with our closest relatives .
Apes , which used to be thought of as a commodity for bushmeat and the pet trade , are no longer just thought of as a source for poaching .
The tourism trade has bolstered the local economy by enabling locals to sell crafts and locally grown goods to the influx of outsiders with money .
The Chimpanzee Sanctuary and Wildlife Conservation Trust has given these farmers start up money to begin making crafts to sell instead of poaching as a means of subsistence .
In Hoima where most of the forests are privately owned , organizations such as the Chimpanzee Sanctuary and Wildlife Conservation Trust have been giving money to 84 different private owners of the forests to provide them with an alternative means of survival that does not require encroachment into the forest .

With the influx of support , local farmers are able to sell goods such as these rather than poaching the great apes .

New York ( CNN ) -- Charges filed Tuesday against Times Square car bombing suspect Faisal Shahzad paint him as a would - be terrorist who sought explosives training in Pakistan 's volatile Waziristan region , where government forces have been working to root out Taliban militants .
The court documents show Shahzad apparently continued to have contact with Pakistan upon his return to the United States , receiving a series of 12 phone calls originating from his country of birth in the days leading up to the incident -- five of which were made on the same day he bought the Nissan Pathfinder used in the attempted attack Saturday night .
Those phone calls ceased just three days before the failed bombing , the documents show .
" It is clear that this was a terrorist plot , " Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday .
It could have caused " death and destruction in the heart of New York City . "
Five federal charges were filed against Shahzad on Tuesday in U.S. District Court : attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction , acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries , use of a destructive device in connection with criminal violence , transporting and receiving explosives , and damaging and destroying property by means of fire .
If convicted , Shahzad faces up to life in prison on the charges .
Shahzad has waived his right to remain silent and his right to an attorney , and is cooperating in the investigation , a source familiar with the probe said .
Shahzad , 30 , a naturalized U.S. citizen from Pakistan who was living in Connecticut , was arrested at New York 's John F. Kennedy airport late Monday after boarding a flight bound for Dubai , United Arab Emirates .
He was due in federal court later Tuesday , but that appearance was delayed until at least Thursday as he continued to be questioned by authorities .
" This incident is another sobering reminder of the times in which we live , " President Obama said Tuesday .
" Around the world and here at home , there are those who would attack our citizens and who would slaughter innocent men , women and children in pursuit of their murderous agenda .
They will stop at nothing to kill and disrupt our way of life . "
The court documents allege that Shahzad admitted to investigators to driving the Pathfinder into Times Square and attempting to detonate the bomb .
The documents also reveal a clearer picture of how he was linked to the plot .

After receiving explosives training at a camp in Pakistan 's Waziristan region , Shahzad returned to the United States via a one - way plane ticket February 3 , the court documents say , citing Customs and Border Protection records .
He told immigration officials upon his return that he had been visiting his parents in Pakistan for five months , according to the documents .
He also told officials that his wife remained in Pakistan .
Authorities focused on Shahzad when they traced evidence to him from the sale of the Nissan Pathfinder used in the failed attack , information considered the linchpin of the case .
The SUV's vehicle identification number had been removed from the dashboard .
Police retrieved the VIN from the bottom of its engine block .
This , said a federal law enforcement official , led investigators to the registered owner of the vehicle and then to Shahzad , who purchased the SUV on April 24 for $ 1,300 cash via an ad on the internet , the court documents show .
He was identified in a photo lineup by the seller of the vehicle .

In addition to the bomb - making materials found in the Pathfinder -- which included gasoline , propane tanks , fireworks and non-explosive fertilizer -- investigators found a set of keys , one of which opened Shahzad 's Connecticut home .
Another belonged to an Isuzu vehicle .
Shahzad is believed to have driven an Isuzu to the airport Monday .
Phone records cited in the court documents show a series of calls made from Pakistan to a pre-paid cell phone used by Shahzad .
The phone was activated April 16 and inactivated around April 28 , last Wednesday .
The attempted attack was carried out Saturday .
Watch reaction from Pakistan on Shahzad 's arrest
Fireworks used in the attempted car bombing were purchased from a store in Pike County in northeastern Pennsylvania , a federal law enforcement source said Tuesday .
The source says the M - 88 fireworks Shahzad is accused of placing in the Nissan Pathfinder were bought at a Phantom Fireworks store in Matamoras , Pennsylvania .
A complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court says Shahzad made a phone call to an unnamed Pennsylvania fireworks store .
Bruce Zoldan , the president of Phantom Fireworks , which has 55 stores across the country , would not confirm exactly what was purchased , or when , so as not to compromise the investigation .
But he did confirm that the Matamoras store sells M - 88 Silver Solutes , which are similar to what was found in the Nissan Pathfinder .
Zoldan says his company has been in touch with the FBI from the beginning of the investigation .
The company 's national security director is a retired member of the FBI , Zoldan says , and is currently dealing with active members of the FBI and exchanging information .
The company 's vice president , William Weimer , says the M - 88s are legal to purchase by consumers because they have a limited amount of pyrotechnic composition and are not very strong .
" The products simply do not chain detonate as I 'm sure the culprit anticipated they would , " Weimer said .
FBI agents searching Shahzad 's Connecticut residence recovered fireworks and fertilizer from his garage , the documents say .
Timeline in bomb plot
As the investigation drew law enforcement officials closer to finding Shahzad , he was placed on a federal no - fly list Monday , according to FBI Deputy Director John Pistole .
The restriction helped Customs and Border Protection agents arrest him moments before Emirates Flight 202 to Dubai pushed back from the gate .
Two other passengers were removed from the plane " out of an abundance of caution " after it left the gate , a federal law enforcement source said .
Those passengers were later cleared and released .
In addition , Emirates airline said Shahzad bought his ticket with cash at the airport counter , and the staff , considering that unusual , immediately informed airport security officials .
A 9 mm gun found in a vehicle believed to have been driven to the airport Monday night by Shahzad was bought at a gun shop near his former home in Shelton , Connecticut , federal law enforcement sources said Tuesday .
The sources said Shahzad bought the semi-automatic Sub 2000 rifle less than two months ago at Valley Firearms in Shelton .
The purchase was legal , according to the sources .
Authorities were conducting surveillance of Shahzad on Monday , but they lost him before he arrived at the airport , a senior counterterrorism official said Tuesday .
An FBI official responded that surveillance operations are designed with redundancies in place , and that agents had to avoid tipping off Shahzad that he was being followed .
Hours after authorities arrested Shahzad , security forces in Pakistan seized two or three people in a raid in connection with the failed bombing , a Pakistani intelligence source said .
The Pakistan raid took place at a Karachi house where Shahzad was believed to have stayed during his last visit to the country .
Shahzad has a Karachi identification card , a sign of Pakistani residency , and his family is from volatile northwestern Pakistan , where government forces have been fighting Taliban militants who have strongholds in the area , according to Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik .
U.S. law enforcement officials are happy with the level of cooperation coming out of Faisal 's country of birth , said a source familiar with the probe .
Officials in Pakistan have been sharing intelligence with U.S. authorities and asking those same authorities to share any information Shahzad provides about terrorist training camps in Pakistan , the source said .
Pakistani Ambassador to the United States Husain Haqqani told CNN's " Situation Room " Tuesday night that , " It 's an investigation in which Pakistan will stand by the side of the United States , " adding that " Pakistanis want to defeat terrorism as much as Americans do . "
Shahzad 's father is a retired senior officer in the Pakistani Air Force , Shahzad 's cousin , Kafayat Ali , said Tuesday .
The father , Bahar Ul Haq , a former air vice marshal , lives in the Peshawar suburb of Hayatabad in what is now Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa province , formerly the North West Frontier Province .
" This is certain , that these people , they never indulged in any criminal activities , " Ali said .
" Not a family member .
Not the village from which both of these people belongs , none of the village members involved in any criminal activities or any jihad activities . "
Shahzad also has a brother named Amir who lives in Canada , a police source said .
Shahzad became a U.S. citizen on April 17 , 2009 , which aided investigators in the case , the federal law enforcement source said .
Because of his recent change in residency status , authorities had his picture and were able to show it to the seller of the vehicle .
A woman who said she lived next door to Shahzad in Shelton , Connecticut , until his family moved in July , said Tuesday that the man she knew was quiet and claimed to work on Wall Street in New York .
A spokesman for Affinion Media Group said Tuesday that Shahzad worked as a junior financial analyst for the marketing firm at the company 's Norwalk , Connecticut , office from mid-2006 to June .
The spokesman said Shahzad left the firm voluntarily .
CNN 's Craig Bell , Deborah Feyerick , Samson Desta , Tim Lister , Jeanne Meserve , Susan Candiotti , Reza Sayah , Caroline Faraj , David Fitzpatrick , Drew Griffin , Carol Cratty and Frances Townsend contributed to this report .

SANTA CLARA , Calif . -- Mike Singletary called Ted Ginn Jr. on Friday to personally welcome him to the San Francisco 49ers .
The fastest draft bust in Miami Dolphins history is bound for the Bay Area -- filling one of the Niners ' biggest offseason needs in the process and giving Ginn a well - timed fresh start across the country in the NFC West .
" We added a talented player that fit a need , " Singletary said .
" He 's a bundle of potential and his upside is off the charts .
This guy can fly . "
Ginn , a receiver and quality return man , was traded to the 49ers on Friday for a fifth - round pick -- the 145th overall selection .
The Dolphins had him on the block even before they acquired Pro Bowl receiver Brandon Marshall on Wednesday from the Denver Broncos .
While Ginn was n't sure he was on his way out when Miami got Marshall , he had a pretty good idea .
" If you know the game and you know the business , you are ready for anything , " he said on a conference call .
" I 'm just going to come into the 49ers and show 'em what I got . "
Dolphins fans began booing Ginn the day he was drafted and never stopped .
Taken with the ninth overall pick in 2007 , he made only five touchdown catches in three seasons while averaging 13.0 yards per reception .
Ginn was more successful on special teams , scoring on kickoff returns of 100 and 101 yards in the same quarter of a game against the New York Jets last season .
He became the first player with two kickoff returns of at least 100 yards in the same game .
That kind of explosive play - making ability in the return game is exactly what San Francisco was seeking after several different players Singletary tried last season could n't do a reliable job .
Ginn has n't regularly returned punts since his rookie season , but he 's eager to take on that role for a 49ers team that finished 8 - 8 and ended a franchise - worst stretch of six straight losing campaigns .
" That 's one of the things I like to do , " Ginn said .
" We have n't really talked about depth charts or playing time .
They are welcoming me with open arms and I 'm going to come in and just compete and be the player that I am .
Just let my play talk for whatever needs to be said .
... [ Singletary ] called today and said he was happy I was coming to the 49ers ; it 's a great situation for him and me . "
This was the first big move made by the 49ers since the abrupt departure of general manager Scot McCloughan last month .
Team president Jed York called it a " mutual parting " and immediately put director of player personnel Trent Baalke in charge of the draft and everything leading up to it .
Baalke said Thursday he would be both patient and aggressive in his approach to acquiring players .
" We 're going to get the players we have targeted , I promise you that , " Baalke said .
The Dolphins still have receivers Brian Hartline , Davone Bess and Greg Camarillo as complements to Marshall .
In San Francisco , Ginn will be paired with Michael Crabtree .
" I 've still got hopes of being an elite receiver , " Ginn said , acknowledging special teams as an asset to his game .
" I 'm just going to come in and do both . "
The 49ers hope Ginn can fulfill the potential he showed at Ohio State , where he tied an NCAA record with eight touchdown returns .
When Miami's selection of Ginn was announced at a team draft party , fans jeered -- they wanted Brady Quinn .
The decision was frequently mocked by detractors of coach Cam Cameron , who lasted only one season .
Ginn drew criticism for running poor routes and shying away from contact .
Last season he lost his job as a starting receiver and totaled only 38 receptions for 454 yards and one score .
" I would n't say a sense of relief but it 's always good to have a new start .
Leaving Miami , I do n't hold and grudges and no bad feelings about anything .
My time was up there .
I enjoyed it there and now it 's time to move on , " Ginn said .
" There 's no bad blood .
It 's the best decision for both of us . "
Now under the Bill Parcells regime , the Dolphins announced the trade in a one - sentence release and had no further comment .
While Ginn had been taking part in Miami 's offseason workouts , he 's ready to shift gears and get settled at the 49ers ' Santa Clara headquarters .
" Whenever they send for me , " he said of when he would show up .

These people asked Engadget to pay for access to the device , but it declined to do so after consulting with its attorneys .

If anyone feels like donating one of these to the Make John Moors ’ Dream Come True Foundation , let me know .
It would be a great opportunity for a tax write off .
.. And by the way , what makes Bob Evans think I would use this for customers ?
I would n’t use this for any damn customers .
This would be for me , and only me .
Thanks to Stephanie for discovering this dream was actually possible .
The Japanese town of Taiji received unwelcome attention when The Cove , a film following its annual dolphin hunt , won an Oscar .
Sayuri ( not her real name ) , who worked as a dolphin trainer in Taiji in the 1990s , gives her reaction to the film .
When I saw the film I was deeply shocked .
What the movie shows is very similar to my own experience of working as a dolphin trainer in Taiji .
Only it went further and showed things that even I had n't seen .
Sayuri : I wanted to free them but did not have the courage Before I ever became a dolphin trainer , I had read many books that made me think that keeping dolphins in captivity was bad .
I wondered whether or not I should choose this profession and I decided to temporarily leave the aquarium that I was working at .
I set out for Japan 's Ogasawara Islands to meet some wild dolphins .
I was literally blown away when I first saw wild dolphins .
Those dolphins were smiling , they were happy .
They had an agility that the dolphins in aquariums just did n't have .
I became worried about the dolphins that I had left behind in the aquarium .
I wanted to protect them , to make their lives just a little happier .
And so I became a trainer of captive dolphins .
I did my best as a dolphin trainer to devise ways to let the dolphins enjoy their time in the pools by teaching them tricks and trying to give them incentives to have fun .
I used to go to that same cove - the one in the film - every time fishermen would capture a group of bottlenose dolphins .
My job was to see if there were any dolphins suitable for captivity in an aquarium .
Once we 'd selected a few , we used to separate them into a selection pool and get them onto tanker boats .
It was a tremendous sight .
It was always a fight for time so we had to move as quickly as possible .
I knew that the dolphins that were not selected for the aquarium would be killed and their meat sold for food .
I was constantly at a loss for words about how that made me feel .
I often had the impulse to cut the rope that secured the nets , but I did n't have the courage
All I could see was that a rope was tied around the fin and they were taken away .
What I did n't know was that they get trapped in a small cove and killed in such a violent way , that the ocean would turn red from their blood .
There was one time when I went to the cove every day .
It was when a family of killer whales was chosen for the aquarium .
They were anxiously swimming around and with each passing day , the big dorsal fin of the leader of the group would turn over on its side and it would look up with such a sad expression .
I often had the impulse to cut the rope that secured the nets , but I did n't have the courage .
' Profitable business '
After I finally left the profession , I travelled around the world to see wild dolphins .
When I was in New Zealand , I was on a bus with people who were organising a petition against dolphin and whale hunting in Japan .
I was the only Japanese person on the bus and I felt extremely embarrassed at the time .
Fishermen in Taiji hunt both dolphins and small whales I think it is about time that we Japanese people open our eyes to what we are doing and what the rest of the world is asking of us .
I know that whale meat was a common staple a long time ago .
It was common in school lunches until the 1970s , for example .
I have heard that there are many places outside Taiji where you can eat whale meat , but I believe it is a seasonal product and I have not often seen it .
Additionally , restaurants that serve whale meat tend to be extremely expensive , so only a very small number of people who have a particular desire for the " best " whale meat go there .
The selling and eating of dolphin meat in Japan is limited to a small number of people .
Most people in Japan have no idea that dolphins are being killed for meat .
People do n't come across such information in their everyday lives , so they simply do not know about it .
There are people who talk about the hunting being part of our culture .
But our culture does n't have to be such a terrible culture .
There is no longer a necessity for dolphin hunting and the people who are doing it now are simply doing it for profit .
I have seen myself fisherman rejoicing over news that a group of killer whales was caught and that a lot of money would be coming in .
It is just a small group of hard - headed men who continue the practice of dolphin hunting with the excuse of protecting our culture .
Foreigners would often come to Taiji to buy dolphins and I remember them saying that Taiji was the only place in the world where they were able to buy dolphins so easily .
I 'm sure that if the dolphin hunting at Taiji were to stop , the captivity of dolphins in aquariums around the world would go down .
I wish that The Cove could be seen by as many Japanese people as possible so that they would understand what is really going on .
I hope dolphin hunting can finally be stopped and peace brought back to the lives of the dolphins .

BERGEN COUNTY —
A company should not have read e-mails a former employee wrote to her lawyer from a private , password - protected web account , even though she sent them from her employer ’s computer , according to a state Supreme Court ruling today that attorneys said could influence workplace privacy rules across the country .
The precedent - setting ruling upheld the sanctity of attorney - client privilege in electronic communications between a lawyer and a nursing manager at the Loving Care Agency .
After the manager quit and filed a discrimination and harassment lawsuit against the Bergen County home health care company in 2008 , Loving Care retrieved the messages from the computer ’s hard drive and used them in preparing its defense .
The unanimous decision by the state ’s highest court will have broader implications in workplaces , which increasingly rely on e-mail and the internet , according to litigators on both sides of the case .
Though disappointed , the state ’s highest court did not rule in Loving Care ’s favor , the company ’s attorney and former Supreme Court Justice Peter Verniero said the decision will be helpful to companies and employers in the future .
" The court has now clarified an area of law , and any time you have a court clarifying an area of law , it 's a positive development , ’’ Verniero said .
He noted no top court in any other state has yet taken up the issue .
Previous coverage :
• N.J. Supreme Court rules employer violated woman 's privacy by reading e-mails
• N.J. Supreme Court hears arguments on the privacy of personal e-mails on work computers
The state ’s high court found the company ’s policy regarding e-mail use to be vague and noted it said " occasional personal use is permitted . "
" The policy does not address personal accounts at all , ’’ the decision said .
" The policy does not warn employees that the contents of such e-mails are stored on a hard drive and can be forensically retrieved . ’’
Verniero predicted : " This case will be read by lawyers not only in New Jersey but potentially throughout the United States . ’’
An attorney who filed a friend - of - the - court brief on behalf of Loving Care also praised the court for giving companies some sorely needed guidance .
Marvin Goldstein , who represented the Employers Association of New Jersey , said he expects companies will use the decision to rewrite policy manuals on e-mail usage .
" The court has recognized the very legitimate and real concerns with regards to privacy .
This gives some guidance to employers in terms of how explicit ( e- mail ) policies need to be , ’’ Goldstein said .
The ruling stems from a harassment and discrimination lawsuit Marina Stengart of Bergen County filed three years ago against Loving Care of Ridgefield Park .
Stengart , then the executive director of nursing , sent her attorney eight e-mails from her company - loaned laptop about her issues with her superiors .
Stengart used her Yahoo e-mail account .
" Under all of the circumstances , we find that Stengart could reasonably expect that e-mails she exchanged with her attorney on her personal , password - protected , web - based e-mail account , accessed on a company laptop , would remain private , ’’ Chief Justice Stuart Rabner wrote in the decision , which upholds an appeals court ’s ruling last year .
" Stengart plainly took steps to protect the privacy of those e-mails and shield them from her employer , ’’ Rabner continued .
" She used a personal , password protected e-mail account instead of her company e-mail address and did not save the account ’s password on her computer . ’’
Peter Frazza , Stengart ’s attorney , said the ruling sets a new boundary for employers who believe they may have a right to all e-mails simply because they own the computer .
" Big Brother is always there , but employees have got to be comforted by the ruling , knowing they are protected , ’’ he said .
David MacKay ( pronounced mac - EYE ) , a professor of physics at the University of Cambridge , UK , was recently appointed to a three - year term as chief scientific advisor to the UK’s Department of Energy and Climate Change .
In an April 1 talk at MIT , he described what specifically would be required to shift the world ’s energy use entirely to non-carbon emitting sources .
Q . How much of an effect do you expect the so - called “ Climate - Gate ” episode to have on public attitudes to climate change , and do you think this will have any long - term repercussions ?
A . It clearly had some impact , and my feeling is that it does n’t deserve to have had impact .
I think the impression that the public has gained of what happened is entirely based on mudslinging and invention .
People allege that there was deliberate manipulation of data , and I ’m not aware of any evidence that that ’s so .
In fact , a recent House of Commons committee has just found that although they ’re not completely happy with everything , but they say the reputations of the scientists involved is intact .
So I guess what ’s needed for the long term is a clear retelling and proper exposition of the science so that the conclusions of the public will be more robust in the future .
Q . What do you think the prospects are for reaching any significant international agreement on greenhouse emissions , in the post - Copenhagen world , and do you see the Copenhagen process as having made such agreements more likely ?
A. I think there was some progress made at Copenhagen .
I think it was the first time an international agreement mentioned aiming at a target of 2 degrees warming or less .
Also there was a move toward really substantial international transfers of money .
So I do n’t think Copenhagen was all bad news .
I ca n’t predict the future , and I do n’t know what ’s going to happen .
I ’m still an optimist .
I feel that there is an international consensus that there is a problem and something needs to be done .
The difficulty is the notion of equity , of fairness , of what should different countries do .
And it ’s human nature to try to get away with doing as little as possible , so that ’s what makes it difficult .
But the good news is that there ’s a general agreement that international action is what ’s needed .
Q . What do you see as the most under - appreciated potential technology or policy that could help the world avoid catastrophic climate change ?
A . Well , the one that I ’m obsessing about at the moment is seasonal heat storage .
In Britain , our demand for energy peaks during the coldest weeks in winter , and it can be twice as big as our energy consumption at other times of the year .
In parts of America , demand peaks in the summer , during the hottest periods .
So if we could develop low - cost technologies for moving heat in time , from the winter to the summer and vice versa , I could see that making quite a difference to the scale of new energy sources that may be needed in the future .
My impression is the Dutch are currently the leaders in the creative deployment of heat storage methods .
They store heat underneath roads in the summer and then pump it out again in the winter .
And in my talk I mentioned a community in Canada called Drake ’s Landing , where they have a community heat storage which collects heat from solar hot water panels , and stores it in a huge hole in the ground , and then they can pump it back out in winter , and it provides heat for quite a few dwellings .
On the back of the book is printed in large capital letters , " THIS IS A STORY " .
It 's worth remembering that emphatic statement as you read the book .
This is not a speculation about the beginnings of Christianity , a claim to have uncovered the real , suppressed history of Jesus .
It is a fable through which Philip Pullman reflects on Jesus , on the tensions and contradictions of organised religion – and indeed on the nature of storytelling .
A fable : it should be obvious from the early chapters that this is not meant to be a realistic narrative .
Its premise is that Mary gave birth to twins : Jesus , an earthy , generous visionary , radical enough to create panic in conventional religious and political authority ; and " Christ " – a nickname for the weaker , self - righteous , fearful brother who shadows Jesus , trying to persuade him to accept a destiny he refuses .
The nickname conceals what is never said in the text : " Christ " is in fact Judas .
He is in love with miracles , with the dream of an unanswerable human authority sanctioned by God , with the mirage of a world forever safe from doubt and permeated by the benign if somewhat capricious presence of a God who reinforces his commands with – well , magic .
This shadow figure takes hold of Jesus 's identity , recording and editing what he says and does , encouraged by a mysterious stranger who eventually prompts him to betray his brother to death and stage - manages the " resurrection " appearances by presenting " Christ " as Jesus risen from the dead .
" Christ " is tormented by the knowledge that he is distorting and betraying , but accepts the stranger 's assurance that all this is necessary to stop Jesus being forgotten and to create the church in which God 's authority among men and women will be secured once and for all .
A very bold and deliberately outrageous fable , then , rehearsing Pullman 's familiar and passionate fury at corrupt religious systems of control – but also introducing something quite different , a voice of genuine spiritual authority .
Because that is what Pullman 's Jesus undoubtedly is .
Time and again , when Pullman offers his version of a familiar biblical saying or narrative , he achieves a pitch - perfect rendering in modern idiom , carrying something of the shock and compelling attraction of the original gospel text .
Just one example .
When he relates the story of Jesus healing a demon- possessed man in the synagogue , his Jesus responds to the shouts of the disturbed man with , " You can be quiet now .
He 's gone away " – subtly paraphrasing the " Be silent and come out of him " in the gospel .
This eloquently suggests the sort of sense a modern reader might make of the story , without reducing the manifest authority of the words of Jesus .
More radically , he manages to retell the parable of the wise and foolish virgins in a way that turns the biblical text completely upside down , yet creates an echo of other gospel parables in its fundamental vision – reversing moral expectations in the context of the Kingdom of God .
The narrative is mostly Pullman at his very impressive best , limpid and economical , though one or two passages feel like easy point - scoring – the Annunciation story told as a seduction , or the mechanics of a fraudulent resurrection .
At only one point does he break the flow of this narrative , in a long soliloquy by Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane on the night of his arrest .
Jesus 's own faith , it transpires , is now on the edge of extinction .
He admits to himself that there is no answer to be expected from heaven .
Looking towards
God , in the complete absence of any definable divine action or manifestation , is no longer possible .
We may look back wistfully at a world in which this once felt possible or natural ; but we have to let it go or be dishonest .
It is essentially the vision of Mary Malone in the third volume of Pullman 's His Dark Materials .
Here as there , it is expressed with some real emotional power .
But there are problems .
One is simply that nothing in the narrative has prepared us for this ; the Jesus of earlier chapters has a robust conviction of the unconditional love of God as the basis for forgiveness and generous confidence , and for principled opposition to religious nonsense and tyranny .
Set against the magical , power - hungry deity of " Christ " , this is a liberating vision of the divine .
Suddenly , it seems to have collapsed because there is no conclusive sign from heaven ; and nothing in the story helps us to see how this happens .
The problem for a believer goes deeper .
In the gospels , too , Jesus agonises in Gethsemane and gets no answer .
But he accepts that he has – so to speak – taken on the responsibility of providing an answer in his own life and death , in a way consistent with his claim throughout the gospel to be speaking on behalf of God 's liberating authority within a paralysed religious and social world .
So when he cries out to God in agony from the cross " Why have you deserted me ? " , this is the consequence of his decision to be – in his own person – God 's " answer " .
And there is no consoling word that can come to him from outside .
There is a clear narrative line in the Bible from Jesus 's revolutionary confidence in announcing God 's forgiveness , through to the terrible resolution in Gethsemane and its consequence on the cross .
Simply as narrative , I think it makes better imaginative sense than Pullman 's abrupt introduction of Jesus 's abandonment of faith .
Now Pullman would reject such a narrative line , because it claims that God 's " failure " to answer does n't decide anything .
Pullman 's Jesus is scathing about " smartarse priests " who talk about God 's absence really being his presence .
Well , yes : Christians use this kind of language .
But not to let themselves off lightly ; they 're arguing that you only get anywhere near the truth when all the easy things to say about God are dismantled – so that your image of God is no longer just a big projection of your self - centred wish - fulfilment fantasies .
What 's left , then ?
This is the difficult moment .
Either you sense that you are confronting an energy so immense and unconditioned that there are no adequate words for it ; or you give up .
From Paul to Luther , George Herbert or Dietrich Bonhoeffer in Hitler 's prisons , there are plenty who have n't given up ; and they have n't given up because they see their experience in the light of something like this understanding of Gethsemane and the crucifixion .
That apart , Pullman leaves the Christian reader with a genuine paradox to ponder , and he does n't – to his credit – suggest that the arguments are not serious .
The sinister stranger in the book – who stands for all philosophical system - makers who want to improve on history by importing eternal truths at the expense of ordinary truthfulness – insists to " Christ " that Jesus 's message can only survive clothed in the language of miracle and power .
It is very much the argument we find in the mouth of Dostoevsky 's Grand Inquisitor – that Jesus was too radical for ordinary human consumption , and for his memory to survive at all , you will have to lie about him .
But what Pullman does n't fully allow , I think , is the degree to which the New Testament itself is already aware of the dangers .
Mark 's gospel , in particular , presents a Jesus who insistently refuses to use his own miracles to prove his status , and a company of disciples who are chronically incapable of understanding Jesus 's challenges .
It seems to recognise the irony that the more you say about Jesus the more you risk getting it wrong .
And through the Christian centuries , these unresolved tensions and deliberate ironies in the Bible have gone on prompting people to resist the lure of Pullman 's " Christ " and his anxious religiosity – a Francis of Assisi , a Bonhoeffer ; an Óscar Romero , murdered 30 years ago last week for his resistance to state terror in El Salvador .
They have seen through the surface froth of religion and heard the voice Pullman himself obviously finds so compelling .
That should make us pause before deciding that the New Testament is quite as successful in sanitising an uncomfortable history through religiously convenient " truth " as Pullman implies .
It is aware of its own temptations .
It trains its readers in self - questioning .
Not always , God knows , given the church 's record .
But often enough to mean that the gospels are still a more resourceful text even than such a searching , teasing and ambitious narrative as Pullman has given us .
Rowan Williams is Archbishop of Canterbury .
His Dostoevsky : Language , Faith and Fiction is published by Continuum .
98 percent of Americans are getting a tax cut this year thanks to Democratic legislation opposed by every single Republican .
The teabaggers are still upset , of course , since this is somehow more evidence of " socialism " .
They are distraught that the richest 2 percent are n't getting their taxes cut as well .
So here 's my grand idea -- how about 100 percent of the teabaggers send their tax cut to the 2 percent richest Americans who did n't get one .
Sure , Sarah Palin made over $ 12 million last year , but she did n't get a tax cut !
So the teabaggers can helpfully send her their tax cut so that she can accumulate more wealth .
And in Trickle - Down fantasy land , that means more jobs for everyone .
Yeay !
One helpful progressive even decided to put this form together to make it easier for them to forward their tax cuts to the richest of the rich .
It 's a great opportunity for them to put their words into action .
A gang has attempted to steal the Stone of Destiny , the battered talisman of Scottish royalty that has been repeatedly targeted by thieves and politicians .
This time thieves turned up at Scone Palace , Perthshire , between closing time on Wednesday and opening time yesterday with a similar - sized boulder weighing 200 kg ‑ about as much as a fridge freezer .
The gang hauled the sandstone boulder off its plinth and replaced it with the lookalike , undeterred by the fact the palace stone is a century - old replica of the original , which left Scone some 700 years ago .
There was a clue in the attached brass plaque , which was also stolen .
It reads : " A replica of the stone upon which the Kings of Scots were crowned on Moot Hill until 1296 when Edward I took the stone to Westminster Abbey . "
It is thought the thieves may have stopped to read the inscription while carrying away their booty , as the stone was later found dumped in the palace grounds .
Lord Stormont , whose family owns the stately home and historic Moot Hill chapel where the attempted robbery took place this week , said : " The fact that the intruders went to the trouble of chipping off all the surrounding mortar and bringing in a fake stone of similar size , which would have required at least four people to lift , suggests that a high degree of planning went into the escapade . "
It will be replaced , he said , but with extra security measures .
A spokesman for Tayside police described the incident as " very unusual .
Officers are currently making inquiries into the possible motivation for someone swapping the stones .
Both of the stones are of considerable weight and would require at least three to four people to carry them .
Transport would also have been required , " he added .
The genuine Stone of Destiny , said to be the seat on which the ancient high kings of Scotland were crowned , remains at Edinburgh castle .
Possibly .
After Edward brought it ‑ or , it has been claimed , a replica prepared by the monks ‑ to London it remained in Westminster Abbey .
It was used in the coronation of most monarchs until Christmas Day 1950 , when a group of students stole it and brought it to Scotland .
The stone turned up at Arbroath abbey a few months later .
It was returned to England , but rumours have since circulated that the stone sent south was a replica .
It remained at Westminster for nearly 50 years , despite Scottish nationalists demanding its return and at least one request from Ireland , where some believe the stone originated .
In 1996 the prime minister , John Major , caved in to pressure and announced he was sending the stone home .
A plethora of sites claimed it ‑ including Scone , Stirling and Dunfermline ‑ but the stone was sent to Edinburgh , accompanied by bagpipers and armed guards , where it remains .
The real stone 's travels are far from over .
The empty slot remains in the coronation chair and , whenever it is next needed , the stone will once again be brought to London .
Some worshipers at a Catholic church in Oklahoma are outraged over a crucifix hanging above the main altar that they say shows an image of genitalia on Jesus , The Oklahoman reports .
Rev. Philip Seeton , pastor of St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church in Warr Acres , says some church members have left the parish and others who do n't like it have stayed , the newspaper reports .
See a photo of the controversial crucifix here .
While some viewers see as a large penis covering Jesus ' abdominal area , Seeton tells The Oklahoman that the controversial portion of the 10 - feet - tall crucifix is meant to be Jesus ' abdomen " showing distension " — not a penis .
He says a local iconography artist designed the crucifix following " specific rules of iconography and church art " and that he has no plans to remove it .
Monsignor Edward Weisenburger of the Oklahoma City Archdiocese does n't have a problem with the crucifix either , the paper says .
The Oklahoman says it was alerted to the controversy by " numerous " current and former church parishioners who expressed outrage over what many called a " pornographic " depiction of Jesus .
" I think it 's an embarrassment to our Lord , " parishioner Rita Cook , who has attended the church for 35 years , tells the paper .
" I think it 's an embarrassment to our parishioners .
And I think it 's an embarrassment to our visitors . "

Different anticonvulsants have been used and drug resistant epilepsy described in AS patients .
Today there is enough evidence that some drugs act better than others and that often , ( as in RTT patients ) movement abnormalities , tremors and attention deficit spells can be misinterpreted as seizures given that the EEG anomalies persist also in absence of crises .
From an accurate evaluation of 45 cases , Valente et al [ 30 ] reported a good control of crises with Valproate ( VPA ) alone or in association with benzodiazepines ( fenobarbital PB or clonazepam CZP ) .
Recurrent myoclonic SE were best controlled by VPA and ethosuximide .
On the contrary , epilepsy was worsened by carbamazepine ( CBZ ) , oxacarbazepine and vigabatrin [ 31 ] .
Topiramate ( Franz et al [ 32 ] ) and ethosuximide ( Sugiura et al [ 33 ] ) were successful in small samples of AS patients with drug resistant epilepsy .
Dion et al [ 34 ] evaluated Lamotrigine ( LMT ) efficacy in 5 patients with different types of seizures ( myoclonic , tonic clonic , atypical absences ) unresponsive to other drugs ( VPA , Benzodiazepines , phenytoine , carbamazepine and topiramate ) obtaining a good control in 3 of them .
The potential myoclonic effect of LMT limits its possible use in these patients , and more case controlled studies are needed .
Ketogenic diet was helpful in some children with untreatable epilepsy [ 4 ] .
Piracetam is said to be effective in controlling distal myoclonus [ 26 ] .
Non convulsive status epilepticus , which should be early treated according to protocols , demonstrated a variable response to treatment with benzodiazepines , ketamine and corticosteroids [ 35 ] in limited number of patients .
Personal experience
Our series of patients with AS showed a seizures type distribution similar to that reported in Literature .
All patients had febrile seizures before the onset of a frank epilepsy .
Myoclonic seizures were the most frequent in infancy , followed by atypical absences and tonic clonic seizures .
None had convulsive SE .
Valproate and topiramate were preferentially used anticonvulsants but in the majority of cases epilepsy was hardly controlled .
The critical EEG showed parossistic 1 - 1.5 c/s discharges of spike - waves complexes .
The background activity was constituted by a persistent generalized 4 - 6 hz activity arising from the temporo - parietal regions ( Fig. 2a ) .
With time the EEG pattern changed showing a very slow background activity mixed with multifocal spikes ( Fig. 2 b ) .
Figure 2 EEG at different ages .
( a ) Generalized burst of spike and spike waves with high amplitude , prevalent in the anterior regions , ( b ) Very slow background activity mixed with multifocal spikes .

Besides these data , our personal experience suggests us the importance of a early diagnosis in view of a possible familial recurrence .
Babies with AS , are initially easily unrecognized as the facial and behaviour phenotype become clear later in life .
Seizures can occur as early as the first few months and other more common diagnosis are often considered ( i.e. perinatal brain hypoxia , febrile seizures , B6 unresponsive seizures ) .
At that age , the observation of fine finger tremors may represent the only clue that should press the clinician to ask for genetic tests .
Later in life , in girls with microcephaly , seizures , stereotyped hand movements and hyperventilation Rett syndrome must be ruled out .
Nevertheless , a number of patient can remain undefined on a molecular basis .
We now are aware of another condition , named Pitt - Hopkins syndrome with similar clinical signs and we suggest to verify also this possible diagnosis in AS and RTT cases without a molecular confirmation .
Pitt - Hopkins syndrome , initially described in 1978 in two unrelated patients with mental retardation [ 36 ] , is characterized by severe psychomotor delay , seizures and recurrent episodes of hyperventilation , acquired microcephaly and distinctive facial appearance : large nose with high philtrum , cupid 's bow lips , macrostomia and wide - spaced teeth .
With time a progressive protrusion of the lower face structures appear .
This phenotype can easily suggest the diagnosis of AS being often associated with happy demeanor , sleep disturbances and seizures .
EEG shows occipital or central delta waves unusual for the age and , in older patients , pseudoperiodic complexes during wakefulness mixed with spikes and slow spike / waves .
Pitt - Hopkins syndrome is linked to a microdeletion of chromosome 18q21 and mutations of the TCF4 gene [ 37 ] .
This gene shows a widespread expression in developing human embryos playing a role on cell fate determination and differentiation during development .
The impaired development of the noradrenergic neurons pathway might cause abnormal respiratory network inside the brain .
Distinguishing between a hungry Scottish wildcat and a ray of sunshine is rarely difficult .
Hamish , top feline at the Highland wildlife park in the Cairngorms , provides a perfect example .
It is lunchtime and he is in a stroppy mood .
His keeper is late with his dish of raw meat .
Hence Hamish 's display : a tail bristling like a Christmas tree , a set of snarling fangs and a barrage of hissing and yowling for the humans standing outside his enclosure .
This is an animal with a grievance – and a temper .
Hamish is massive , as big as a medium - sized dog , and weighs almost 8 kg , double the weight of an average household tomcat .
This is a real muscled bruiser .
" I have come out of that enclosure with blood dripping from my hands on many occasions , " says Robbie Rankin , a keeper at the wildlife park .
A solitary hunter that kills rabbits , not to mention the occasional hare or young roe deer , the Scottish wildcat is ferocious , elusive – and endangered .
Once widespread across the British Isles , the wildcat has disappeared from all but a few ecological niches in the Highlands .
And numbers continue to tumble , an issue that will be addressed in two Scottish Natural Heritage reports , on wildcat distribution and wildcat genetics , that are to be published this month .
For several years , conservationists have warned that loss of habitat , road accidents and – worst of all – the spread of domestic cat populations are having a devastating impact on the Scottish wildcat .
Populations of a species which has earned itself a reputation for its aloof ferocity and independence are plunging to catastrophic levels .
There are now fewer pure - bred Scottish wildcats than there are tigers in the wild .
It is estimated only 400 or so survive in the wild , mostly in the Cairngorms area .
" Until recently , we thought there were about 3,500 wildcats in Scotland , " says Dr David Hetherington , manager of the Cairngorms Wildcat Project which was set up to help save the species .
" But then a detailed study was done on animals that had been killed in accidents .
It was found that only about 12 % of them were actually pure wildcats .
The rest were either feral cats or hybrids of wildcats and feral cats .
As a result , we had to drop our estimate of wildcat numbers from several thousand to only a few hundred .
That was the wake - up call to the seriousness of the situation . "
Today , saving the Highland wildcat has become a key concern for Scottish conservationists and understanding its relationship to its domestic cousin , the household cat , will play a pivotal role in that work , say scientists .
The origin of the world 's cats has been a source of dispute among animal experts for decades .
Most domesticated animals , such as dogs , lived in packs or herds in the wild and had clear dominance hierarchies that were exploited by the first farmers who took over the role of their leaders .
By contrast , cats are solitary hunters that defend their territories fiercely against transgressors .
So how were they transformed into domestic moggies ?
And for that matter , where did this change take place ?
In the past , some scientists argued that cat domestication occurred in a number of different locations , with each domestication spawning a different breed .
By this reckoning , British tabbies were descendants of British wildcats .
Others claimed that domestic cats were ancient Egyptian in origin , and pointed , as evidence , to the fact they were worshipped as gods in the days of the pharaohs .
Then , in 2000 , the issue was resolved – in an unexpected manner – by researchers led by Carlos Driscoll of Oxford 's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit .
His team took samples from 979 wildcats and domestic cats from across the world and found the wildcats grouped into three main genetic clusters : the European wildcat , Felis silvestris silvestris ; the Middle Eastern wildcat , Felis silvestris lybica , and the southern African wildcat , Felis silvestris cafra .
The team looked at domestic cats in the UK , the US , Japan and elsewhere and found that they were all made up of members of Felis silvestris lybica .
The inference was clear .
" That the domestic cats grouped with Felis silvestris lybica alone among wildcats meant that domestic cats arose in a single locale , the Middle East , and not in other places where wildcats are common , " states Driscoll and colleagues in a paper in Scientific American .
Combined with other evidence , the research paints a clear picture of the domestic cat 's origins .
As neolithic men and women created the first , primitive townships and settlements 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East , mice , rats and other vermin moved in to raid their grain stores and their rubbish heaps .
Middle Eastern wildcats followed after these pests and before long they had adapted to life among men and women .
The cats did little harm to humans and would have been encouraged to stay because they were such effective pest - controllers , says Dr Andrew Kitchener , principal curator of birds and mammals at the National Museums of Scotland .
" The scientific evidence indicates that the ancestry of domestic cats goes back to Mesopotamia where genetically similar wildcats now live . "
Then as agriculture spread from the Middle East , the cats came with the farmers .
They spread into Europe and then into Britain .
And still the cats followed .
Thus the household moggie , a feline immigrant from the Middle East arrived in the homes of Britain , while the nation 's own wildcats – made up of members of the larger , stronger striped species of European wildcat , Felis silvestris silvestris , were pushed to the margins of the nation as settlements spread and its wild places were stripped away .
" Wildcats disappeared in lowland England around 1800 , " says Hetherington .
" Then they vanished from Wales and northern England around 1860 .
Finally , they went from southern Scotland .
All we have left is a few hundred around the Cairngorms and places like the Black Isle .
The trick now is to find a way to stop them from disappearing completely . "
The Cairngorms Wildcat Project was set up last year with the specific remit of halting the animal 's decline .
It has a simple logo – " Highland Tiger , the Scottish wildcat " – to hammer home the fact that the animal has become as endangered as the tiger and that it is , pound for pound , as ferocious as any other feline on the planet .
It also happens to be the only one native to the British Isles .
" Our first aim is simply to raise awareness , " adds Hetherington .
" We have this special animal living in the Highlands that we should be tremendously proud of .
The more people that start to care for it , the easier it will be for us to save it . "
Routine risks facing wildcats include crossing major roads and avoiding being shot , by mistake , by gamekeepers .
( It is against the law to kill a wildcat but not a feral cat in Scotland . )
But most of all it is the danger posed by interbreeding with domestic cats that worries conservationists like Hetherington .
" The problem is not one caused directly by domestic cats , " he adds .
" The trouble arises when household animals go wild , mate and create colonies of feral cats .
These form at the edges of villages and in farms .
Some of these feral animals meet up with wildcats and they mate .
Female wildcats become pregnant and give birth to kittens that are not purebred wildcats .
Slowly , the species loses its unique status and vigour and animals become hybridised .
That is the real problem today . "
The short - term answer , he says , is to promote vigorously the principles of good cat ownership : neuter all pets and make sure they are properly vaccinated for all major feline diseases .
" We are trying to turn off the taps in terms of the supply of feral cats in the countryside , " adds Hetherington .
" They pose a risk not just of interbreeding but of bringing diseases from domestic populations into the wild so they affect wildcats .
We need to involve gamekeepers , vets , cat protection officers and a range of other conservationists .
The trouble is that it will take us a long time to find out if we are succeeding .
These are very elusive animals , after all .
Studying them is very difficult . "
And that is a problem for many wildcat experts .
Merely waiting around collecting data without forming a plan of action is not enough , says Kitchener .
" Just look at the Chinese river dolphin .
A lot of people were supposedly working towards its conservation , but no one actually did anything practical .
Then one day they realised that it had just disappeared . "
The answer for the Highland wildcat , he argues , is not just to tackle the dangers it faces from feral animals , but to launch a full captive breeding programme as a matter of urgency .
" That may involve taking some animals from the wild to make sure we can build up the best genetic stock but we will have just to face up to that .
In five or 10 years ' time , if you find the game is up for the animal in the wild , you will then be able to think practically about reintroductions in particular areas .
But if you just keeping saying we are not sure and do n't do anything , we could end up with no wildcats left at all . "
Not every wildcat expert agrees .
Some point out that there is little point in reintroducing animals to the wild if the causes of their eradication there have not been dealt with .
The new animals will just get killed like their predecessors or hybridised with domestic cats .
Yet Kitchener insists it is imperative that work begins on building up a reintroduction stock before populations crash any further .
" Look at the Iberian lynx .
A few years ago , its numbers were down to around 100 .
So conservationists collected a third kitten from every litter on the basis that a third kitten is normally killed by wild parents .
Then they reared the kittens and are now ready to start reintroducing them into the wild .
We should be planning that now .
The alternative is a future with no wildcats left in the British Isles . "
LONDON — When President Toomas H. Ilves of Estonia arrived in Turkey last week , he had prepared for a state visit — one state visit .
What he got , courtesy of an erupting volcano in Iceland , was more like a presidential road trip — nine countries in four days — evoking the sedate diplomacy of a bygone era .
Mr. Ilves left Istanbul on Sunday .
On Monday he ate an impromptu dinner with President Boris Tadic of Serbia .
In Poland , he stopped to lay a wreath on the fresh tomb of President Lech Kaczynski .
In between , he and the Estonian first lady got their coffee and gas at convenience stores .
“ I am not Odysseus returning to Penelope after 20 years ; it has only been four days , so it is O.K. , ” said Mr. Ilves , speaking by cellphone as he approached Estonia just in time to host a dinner for visiting dignitaries .
Airports rumbled back to life across Europe on Wednesday .
But after volcanic ash shut down air travel across the continent for a week , passengers still faced uncertain prospects for boarding flights .
Uncounted thousands of others , having opted for land or sea journeys , were telling of epic adventures that involved , among many weary details , big out - of - pocket expenditures and a shortage of clean socks .
In the most recent survey conducted by the BBC and Harris Poll , more than 60 percent of respondents said the US is worse than other countries when it comes to teaching math and a majority expressed the same opinion about the science curriculum in the US .
So how can those numbers be turned around ?
In South Korea the answer lies in longer days and a much stricter study regimen .
It is a model which even President Obama has praised but it is not without its drawbacks .
The BBC's John Sudworth reports on the drive to succeed in Seoul .
Well , this is basically one of our worst New York nightmares : Late last night / early this morning , a 30 - year - old nurse was with her friends at Social , a bar in midtown .
A guy tried to dance with her , and she blew him off , whereupon he followed her into the bathroom and beat the crap out of her .
The attack was so vicious , according to the police , that the woman sustained a broken eye socket and a broken nose , and possibly a fractured skull .
So , that ’s scary and horrifying .
So is this : Despite having surveillance video , this many hours later , they still have n’t found the guy that did it .

President Obama is struggling to fulfill campaign promises to pass energy and immigration measures , but he ’s poised to notch another victory for a stump - speech vow : to make sure veterans ’ funding is n’t held hostage to the government ’s bad finances .
While watchdogs caution there ’s still a long list of problems for veterans , all sides agree the President Obama has made big strides on promises he made in 2008 when competing for military votes against Republican nominee and Vietnam veteran Sen .
John McCain - to fully fund the Veterans Administration , expand access to care in rural areas and improve treatment for mental health conditions , such as post - traumatic stress disorder .
“ The accessibility with this administration has been outstanding .
They listen , they reach out to the veterans ’ service organizations , they see the value in communicating , ” Peter Gaytan , executive director of the American Legion , the nation ’s largest veterans ’ organization , with 2.5 million members .
Even amid competing priorities and a deepening recession , Mr. Obama last year managed to secure the biggest increase in funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs in 30 years .
And as Congress begins writing spending bills for 2011 , despite a spending freeze on some other domestic spending , he ’s looking for more aid for veterans .
Mr. Obama ’s proposed VA budget for fiscal 2011 asks for $ 125 billion - a 10 percent jump from what Congress enacted for 2010 , which was itself more than 16 percent more than 2009 .
The discretionary portion of next year ’s budget request - the part the administration and Congress have the most direct control over - is up nearly 20 percent since 2009 , to total $ 60.3 billion .
In the area of mental health , Mr. Obama ’s budget for next year directs $ 5.2 billion in specialized funds for treatment of PTSD as well as for traumatic brain injury and other related conditions .
It also asks for $ 2.5 billion to construct new VA centers and improve existing facilities .
“ Across the board , the president has kept his promises to our veterans and will continue to uphold our obligations to all who have served , ” White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said , noting that Mr. Obama “ has a deep respect and appreciation for our service members and veterans . ”
Perhaps one of the reasons Mr. Obama ’s veterans policies have flown under the radar - relative to his hard - fought victory on the health care overhaul - is they draw bipartisan support at a time when the nation is still fighting two wars .
In addition to approving double - digit budget increases , lawmakers on both sides of the aisle came together last year on a bill that put the portion of the VA ’s budget that deals with medical care on a two - year track to insulate it from legislative delays .
They also signed off on the post - 9/11 GI bill , which provides Iraq and Afghanistan veterans with money for tuition and housing while in school .
More recently , the Senate last week approved a bipartisan bill that expands benefits for the caregivers of wounded veterans and tries to accommodate those in rural areas by expanding the VA ’s telemedicine program and travel reimbursements .
The bill , authored by Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Daniel K. Akaka , Hawaii Democrat , now awaits the president ’s signature .
“ I would think there ’s more agreement than disagreement ” on veterans ’ issues , said Brooks Tucker , deputy staff director for Republicans on the committee .
But there are still bones of contention .
While veterans groups roundly praised the leadership of VA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki , a retired U.S. Army general , the agency lacks a permanent undersecretary for benefits .
The previous administrator stepped down in January , leaving the Veterans Benefits Administration - which one advocate described as the “ Achilles heel ” of the VA - without a leader who ’s earned Senate backing to tackle the troubled claims process .
“ We realize that President Obama and Secretary Shinseki inherited this catastrophe , but they really need to fix it now , ” said Paul Sullivan , executive director of Veterans for Common Sense .
Mr. Sullivan ’s group has called for an overhaul of the VBA , which determines eligibility for federal benefits .
While veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have free health care for five years , veterans from other wars and those whose time has expired must fill out a 23 - page claim form to be eligible for care .
To make matters worse , Mr. Sullivan said , VBA employees are sparsely located - there is only one VBA office in Virginia and one in Maryland , for example .
And the backlog is astonishing : About half a million veterans are waiting on average six months for an answer to a new disability claim , while an additional 200,000 are waiting for an answer on an appealed claim , according to Mr. Sullivan .
“ That ’s too many veterans , and they ’re waiting too long , ” he said .

Authors with writer 's block , listen up :
With the iPad poised to bring e-books into the main , along with e-book publishing services like Smashwords inking deals with Apple to get your work in the iBookstore , you 're now running out of excuses .
Smashwords reportedly signed a distribution deal for e-books in Apple 's iBookstore , the e-reader app for the iPad , according to blogger Steve Weber 's Plug Your Book website .
Smashwords helps authors digitally publish their books for free .
The company charges only a small percentage of any book sales .
Weber posted an email that Smashwords founder Mark Coker apparently sent to more than 4,000 authors in the Smashwords network , telling them how to get their e-books ready for the iBookstore .
Coker would not neither confirm nor deny the email and declined further comment .
According to the email , authors " must take steps now to ensure your books make it in time for inclusion in the Apple iPad 's iBookstore 's big launch April 3 . "
Some of the requirements include cover image pixel size and conformance to the EPUB format .
Smashwords has been upgrading its converters and creating " scrubbers " to clean files , according to the email .
All books in the iBookstore must have prices that end in $ .99 .
E - books can be free , too .
Apple also requires an e-book be priced less than its print counterpart , according to the email .
E - book pricing has been a controversial issue .
At the iPad 's unveiling in February , Apple flashed prices for e-books at around $ 15 .
Major publishers lined up behind the iPad , including Penguin , HarperCollins , Simon & Schuster , Hachette Group , and Macmillan .
This was an affront to Amazon , which had refused publishers ' requests to raise its e-book price from $ 10 .
The following weekend , Amazon pulled Macmillan books from its virtual store , as a sign of discontent .
Two days later , Amazon agreed to raise prices of e-books as well as return Macmillan books to its virtual shelves .
Smashwords ' email sheds light on Apple e-book pricing .
" For any mass market or trade paperback books with a list price greater than $ 22.00 , you can set whatever price you want , " the email reads .
" If your book is only available in Hardcover , and the Hardcover price is under $ 22.00 , then the maximum allowable price for your ebook is $ 9.99 ...
If your hardcover book is priced above $ 40 , you can price your Apple ebook at any price you like . "
Here 's the best part for aspiring authors : " How much does distribution to Apple cost you ?
Nothing .
Like all Smashwords services , it 's free .
We earn our income when your books sell .
We will pay you 60 percent of the list price for all your sales . "
Smashwords has published more than 9,000 e-books .
Some well - known authors include Gary Wolfe ( author of the book that inspired the movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit ) , Anne Frasier , Mark Sullivan , and John Buffalo Mailer ( son of Norman Mailer ) .
For new writers , a Smashwords and iPad deal could help ignite an already hot market .
Market researcher Gartner has dubbed 2010 as the year of the e-reader .
The International Digital Publishing Forum reported that wholesale sales of e-books increased 124 percent from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2009 .
One of the most popular apps on the iPad will be the e-reader , say analysts .
And that 's good news for authors , especially as more people have an e-reader in their hands .
Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty forecasts iPad shipments of eight to 10 million this year , up significantly from her prior prediction of five million .

" Buffy the Vampire Slayer " star Nicholas Brendon has been charged with four misdemeanors , after officials say he tried to fight a bunch of cops last month .
Brendon was charged with one count resisting arrest , two counts of battery against a police officer and one count of vandalism .
As we first reported , law enforcement sources say they received a call on March 17 that a drunk guy was causing a commotion in Venice , CA .
When cops arrived , we 're told Brendon tried to throw a few punches at 'em , then took off on foot until cops caught up and tasered his ass -- twice .
Brendon -- who faces two years in jail and a $ 4,000 fine if convicted -- is due back in court on April 7 for his arraignment .
On his way to work
The new government of Kyrgyzstan , installed yesterday evening after ousting US - backed President Kurmanbek Bakiyev , today thanked Russia for the support provided in their uprising , but suggested that the “ status quo ” on military bases would remain for the time being .
Comments from the new government seemed to fly in the face of those made by top Obama Administration official Michael McFaul , who pointedly denied that the Russians had anything to do with the regime change and insisted that the US and Russia were in talks aimed at calming the situation .
But Russia has already recognized the new government , while the US has simply said it remains unclear who is in charge .
Russian PM
Vladimir Putin has spoken directly with the new de facto leader , former Foreign Minister Roza Otunbayeva , and pledged to supply Russian humanitarian aid to the nation .
Both Russia and the United States have military bases in the small nation , a comparative rarity for the two major powers .
The US recently secured a new lease on the Manas base from Bakiyev , though it came with a major increase in rent .
But the US has had to curb flights out of Manas , and some members of the new government suggested earlier in the day that the base might have to close sooner .
Otunbayeva seemed to attempt to reassure the US about the base , however , and suggested that they could remain , pending the consideration of “ new issues . ”
Aufstieg durch Bildung ?
Goedart Palm
Die schöne neue Bildungsrepublik
Diesmal empfiehlt sich die FDP im Landtagswahlkampf NRW 2010 als Partei unserer
Wahl an mit der plakativen Formel " Aufstieg durch Bildung " .
Das Thema " Bildung " habe für die FDP Priorität .
Nicht anders wirbt das Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschen mit diesem Spruch : " Aufstieg durch Bildung zu ermöglichen , ist für den Zusammenhalt wie für die wirtschaftliche Leistungsfähigkeit unseres Landes von prioritärer Bedeutung .
Derzeit fehlt es in unserem Bildungssystem an Durchlässigkeit für den Aufstieg .
So haben Kinder von Akademikern eine fast doppelt so große Chance , die gymnasiale Oberstufe zu besuchen , und eine dreieinhalbmal so hohe Studienanfängerquote wie Kinder von Nichtakademikern .
Für deutsche Jugendliche ist die Chance , eine qualifizierte Berufsausbildung zu genießen , bei gleichem Leistungsniveau der allgemeinen Fachleistungen mehr als doppelt so groß wie für ausländische Jugendliche . "
" Bildung " ist zwar nicht wie Leben und Gesundheit das höchste aller Güter , doch das Lob der Bildung klingt so unverdächtig , dass wir wenigstens das für eine richtige Entscheidung der Politik halten möchten .
Bildung befriedigt jedes Herz , bietet Linken wie Rechten , Fortschrittsgläubigen und Konservativen , Realisten oder Romantikern breiteste Projektionsflächen , ihren Traum vom besseren Leben anzureichern .

How to become Socrates
Doch lässt sich die Frage , welche Bildung morgen noch wichtig sein könnte , in einer radikal beschleunigten
Welt überhaupt sinnvoll beantworten ?
Welche Bildung wichtig ist , dürfte sich heute mehr denn je erst später , vielleicht also zu spät , als richtig oder falsch darstellen .
Zuvor schien es jedenfalls bequemer zu sein : " Die Rückkehr zur humanistischen Bildung ist nicht Flucht in die Vergangenheit , sondern ein Weg in die Zukunft , der einzige , der uns geblieben ist ...
Wie sollen wir in Zukunft bestehen können , wenn wir nicht dort wieder anknüpfen , wo wir einst unser innerstes
Wort zu sagen hatten , ein Wort , das kraft Dauerhaftigkeit und Unmittelbarkeit seines Bezuges zu den geistigen Grundlagen des Abendlandes auch europäische Geltung besaß ? "
Das verkündete verkündete 1946 der berühmte Bildungsguru Georg Picht als Auftaktprogramm der deutschen Gelehrtenrepublik .
1964 legte der Visionär folgenreich und medienwirksam mit der " Bildungskatastrophe " nach , die kurze Zeit später von dem amerikanischen Bildungspolitiker Philip Hall Coombs mit der " Weltbildungskrise " noch getoppt wurde - was Untergangsspezialisten , die nicht nur in Deutschland ein einträgliches Arbeitsfeld finden , wie immer begeisterte .
Picht begriff Bildung zwar als Wirtschaftsfaktor einer Gesellschaft , doch die Botschaft humanistischer Bildung veränderte den Bildungsbegriff nicht : Erst lernen wir Latein und Griechisch , um dann zu erfahren , was Sokrates oder Platon , meinetwegen auch noch Goethe und Herder , in dieser spätmodernen Globalgesellschaft für richtig befunden hätten .
Wie " Dauerhaftigkeit " und " Unmittelbarkeit " des Wissens antiker Sklavendemokratien in Wirtschaftswundersystemen oder in ihren heutigen desolaten Verfallsformen wertvoll werden sollen , vermögen humanistische Bildungskonzepte nicht widerspruchsfrei anzugeben .
Sokrates hatte augenscheinlich viel freie Zeit für höhere Bildungsformen , die nicht dem karrieristischen Erwerb von Weiterbildungszertifikaten geopfert wurden , um sich den nächsten Job zu sichern .
Zwischen " Vollhonks " und Schwarmintelligenzen
Die " Durchlässigkeit " des Schulsystems würde enorm gefördert , wenn das Menschenbild der Schule nicht länger mit universalistischen oder romantischen Hintergrundannahmen verkoppelt wäre .
In Gesellschaften , die auf ein Miteinander und Kooperativität angewiesen sind , könnten spezifische Begabungen viel stärker gefördert werden , als sie das gegenwärtige , konkurrenzorientierte Generalprogramm zulässt .
Die Kombination von sprachlich - literarisch - künstlerischen , geistes - sowie gesellschaftswissenschaftlichen und mathematisch - naturwissenschaftlich - technischen Fächern bleibt eine unerträgliche Zumutung für Einzelbegabungen .
Das Mainstream - Repertoire aus Natur - und Kulturwissenschaften , mit dem Pennäler dank G8 immer härter traktiert werden , lässt die Frage nach dem " cui bono " unbeantwortet .
Die herrschenden Curricula sind hoffnungslos antiquiert , wenn sie etwa darauf bezogen werden , in der Click - oder Stirb - Welt von facebook , ebay , amazon und unbegreiflichen Widerrufserklärungen zu existieren .
Gewiss , Generationen und avanciertes Wissen wachsen nach , doch " the digital gap " wächst in allen Varianten schneller , als wir uns das heute vorstellen wollen .
Was Hänschen lernt , lernt Hans nimmermehr .
Lehrer kommen mit der digitalen Unübersichtlichkeit oft genug nicht mehr mit , was wohl unter anderem ihren unermüdlichen Netzeifer beflügelt , schändliche Plagiate zu outen .
Diese schnell erworbenen " Bildungsanleihen " können indes nicht nur eilfertig als verlotterte Moral wikipediatisierter Schüler verbucht werden .
Lernen in den Zeiten des verführerischen Monitors wird zwar zu einem ambivalenten Schicksal der Schüler , in dem kognitive Primäreigenschaften und - techniken wie Konzentration , Schreiben oder " Lesen " – auch im Geschlechtervergleich – erheblichen Anfechtungen ausgesetzt sind .
Der " Bildungsdiebstahl " , dem Filesharing und Musikdownload nahverwandt , ist aber zugleich Symptom einer radikalen Veränderung des Wissens , das sich in seinen Vernetzungslüsten nicht allzu schulhörig daran bindet , was Kulturwahrern und - verwahrern frommt .
Promiskuitiv angelegtes Wissen lässt sich weniger denn je dem Einzelnen zurechnen , auch wenn das die herrschenden Klassifikationssysteme zwischen dem Primus und dem " Setzen - Sechs - Kandidaten " durcheinanderbringt .
Je mehr technische und mediale Möglichkeiten dem Menschen zukommen , je rasanter der Wissenstransfer wird , desto unheimlicher werden die Verhältnisse , ohne sie je noch als Bescheidwisser eines G8 - Abiturs zu durchdringen .
Wer also heute von " Bildung " spricht , trägt die Beweislast , dass Wissensgesellschaften sich morgen nicht zur Unkenntlichkeit verändern .
Die hybride Durchdringung menschlichen Wissens durch Computer und Internet führt zu einer Explosion der Wissenspraxis , die schlecht mit gegenwärtigen Menschenbildern kompatibel zu schalten ist .
Denn auch ungeachtet der zähen Diskussion , ob und wie der evolutionäre Sprung zur künstlichen Intelligenz gelingt , werden die zukünftigen kognitiven Systeme nicht mehr vorrangig mit menschlichen Bildungsparametern durchmessen .
Was dagegen hier und heute als Allgemeinbildung regelmäßig unhinterfragt propagiert wird , ist keineswegs lediglich als Grundlage für späteres Spezialwissen zu rechtfertigen .
Die Grenzen sind fließend , doch die Ausmistung des Lehrstoffs gegenüber der Unbeweglichkeit von ressortegoistischen Kultusverwaltungen ist eine überfällige Aufgabe .
Spätere Karrieren von Schulversagern und Schulabbrechern jenseits dieser allgemeinen Fundierung lassen nur den Schluss zu , dass der mit alten Hypotheken belastete Begriff der " Allgemeinbildung " absolut revisionsbedürftig ist .
Der viel gescholtene antiautoritäre Pädagoge A.S. Neill formulierte es weiland noch drastischer : " Was hat es für einen Sinn , einem Jungen , der später Autos repariert oder Strümpfe verkauft , quadratische Gleichungen beizubringen ?
Das ist Wahnsinn . "
Würde man Persönlichkeits - und Schülertypen genauer betrachten , könnte das kostenintensive und frustrierende Schulversagen , die Unwürdigkeit des " Sitzenbleibens " und " Durchmogelns " durch Hassfächer erheblich reduziert werden .
Das Wissen um und für den Abstieg
Der Begriff der Bildung bleibt ideologieverdächtig oder rhetorisch unverbindlich , wenn er nicht auf seine bedingte Eignung für den persönlichen Erfolg oder gar Lebensfreude in einem konkurrenzorientierten Wirtschaftssystem kritisch hinterfragt wird .
Bildung wurde nach klassischen Idealen an die Persönlichkeit gekoppelt , ja mehr : an das wahre Menschsein .
Bildung , wie sie jetzt wieder zum ultimativen Politikprogramm hochgejazzt wird , verfolgt heute ungleich prosaischere Zwecke .
Es geht um die Verwertbarkeit menschlicher Fähigkeiten im Wirtschaftsleben .
" Die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit eines Landes beginnt nicht in der Fabrikhalle oder im Forschungslabor .
Sie beginnt im Klassenzimmer " , formulierte bereits der Menschen - und Maschinenverwerter Henry Ford .
Das ist vielleicht nicht per se eine Teufelei , aber für die Grenzen des Bildungsbedarfs und des dahinter stehenden eindimensionalen Kulturbegriffs verantwortlich .
Die Marginalisierung von Kunst , Musik und Sport , Ethik und Psychologie , Techniken der Alltagsbewältigung und Persönlichkeitsbildung in den Schulen zeigt die Grenzen des herrschenden Bildungsbegriffs an .
Diese Austrocknung menschlicher Interessen wird noch deutlicher in der betrieblichen Praxis , die auch jenseits von Fließbändern nicht selten dem lebenslänglichen Lernprogramm Hohn spricht .
Viele moderne Aufgabenbereiche sind hochspezifisch und wenig " volatil " auf dem sozialdarwinistisch ausgerichteten Arbeitsmarkt .
Menschen , die jahrelang in der Monokultur eines Unternehmens auf winzige Zuständigkeiten oder entfremdete Robot - Tätigkeiten festgelegt werden , verlieren ihre " Marktfähigkeit " , wenn sie sie denn je besessen haben .
Solche Systemanforderungen sind nicht beliebig zu verändern .
Arbeitslose Akademiker werden das Hohelied der Bildung auch nicht mit Überzeugung singen .
Sie folgen eher dem Refrain Mark Twains auf den Wert der Bildung als " das , was übrig bleibt , wenn der letzte Dollar weg ist " .
Zwar sind die nominellen Prozentzahlen dramatischer als der eher kleine Anteil der arbeitslosen Akademiker an der Gesamtzahl der Arbeitslosen .
Doch akademische Laufbahnen sind fragil genug geworden , wenn sie für den Aufstieg garantieren sollen .
Jenseits der blässlich gewordenen Orchideen neouniversalistischer Bildung hängen die Aufstiegschancen zum El Dorado der Besserverdienenden ohnehin von vielen Umständen ab , unter denen die Bildung nicht der hervorragendste sein muss .
" Mittelmäßig zu sein stellt die vorteilhafteste Fähigkeit des Geistes dar " , verriet Maurice Joly 1867 in seinem ungeschminkten " Handbuch des Aufsteigers " .
Bereits der Tellerwäscher ist kein Bildungsriese , sondern einer , der unermüdlich malocht , Entfremdung verinnerlicht , um dann wenigstens im Märchen als Rockefeller zu enden .
Paris Hilton , die nicht in der Spülküche anfangen musste , wuchert augenscheinlich auch nicht mit Bildung .
Und ganz oben ?
Wirtschaftsbosse hinderte oft genug ein Lehrberuf nicht , den Aufstieg zu schaffen .
Bill Gates und andere Großkopferte sind gar Studienabbrecher ( weitere Beispiele ) .
Ist Guido Westerwelle aufgrund seiner Bildungsqualitäten aufgestiegen oder eher als eifriger Parteimensch ?
Politikkritiker wie Hans Herbert von Arnim haben immer darauf insistiert , dass erfolgreiche Protagonisten im Kastensystem bundesrepublikanischer Politik und ihrer Parteien keine echte Chance haben , wenn sie nicht die Ochsentour machen .
Der Aufstieg der politischen Mittelmäßigkeit läuft über das Dienen oder besser : Dienern , läuft oft genug über schlecht kaschierten Nepotismus und Ämterpatronage .
Darin sind sich Herrschaftsformen ähnlich , die doch der Papierform nach völlig verschieden konstruiert sind .
Prekariat als Schicksal ?
Fraglos sinken die Chancen auf Arbeit mit schwachem Bildungsgrad .
Genauso fraglos ist die Durchlässigkeit des Bildungssystems nicht für alle Kinder gleichmäßig gewährleistet , was sich indes längst nicht abschließend in der vordergründige Betrachtung erledigt , welche Schultypen vorzugswürdig sind .
Der Bildungsforscher Klaus Hurrelmann mahnt : " Eltern und Kinder haben das Gymnasium vor Augen - diese Schule für Professoren und Rechtsanwälte .
Da trauen sie sich nicht hinein , wenn ihre eigene soziale Konstellation ganz anders ist . "
Wichtig wäre es weit darüber hinaus , die gesellschaftliche Durchlässigkeit für menschliche Fähigkeiten bzw .
fröhliche Wissenschaft insgesamt zu erhöhen .
" Die widerrechtliche Ausübung der Astronomie " kann mutatis mutandis für viele Wissensstrukturen formuliert werden , deren Professionalisierung von institutionalisierten Ein- und Ausschlüssen beherrscht wird , um die einträglichen Tröge der Wissenschaft nicht durch unangepasste Talente zu gefährden .
Insofern konstituiert sich die Bildungselite nicht lediglich über ihre konkurrenzlosen Fähigkeiten , sondern mindestens ebenso verdankt sie ihren Anspruch den Abschottungsmechanismen ihrer Einrichtungen .
Bildung bleibt auch jenseits der uneingelösten Selbstverständlichkeiten eines fairen Bildungssystems eine fragile Angelegenheit , in der Pädagogen und Zukunftsforscher , wenn denn die Zukunft nicht ohnehin über deren Hybris lacht , nicht zu beneiden sind .
Wer einen Aufstieg durch Bildung verspricht , überhebt sich gegenüber der unwiderruflichen Demontage der Arbeitsgesellschaft gewaltig .
" Aufstieg durch Bildung " ist eine durch und durch eindimensionale Formel , die den Blick dafür trübt , dass die Karriereoptionen dieser Gesellschaften zahlreiche Momente voraussetzen , von denen Bildung längst nicht reklamieren kann , das wichtigste zu sein .
Wer sich den grassierenden Politikbetrieb ansieht , könnte allenfalls als ungebildeter Mensch den Eindruck gewinnen , dass Bildung hier den höchsten Stellenwert besitzt .
" Frech kommt weiter " hieß es in der aufrichtigeren Kaffeewerbung , die in ihrem Erkenntniswert über die politrhetorisch ständig nachgeölte Gebetsmühle " Leistung muss sich wieder lohnen " hinausgeht .
" Aufstieg durch Bildung " duftet nach Karrieregewinnen für jedermann , um den sozial immer schlechter abgefederten Abstieg in das verschämte Prekariat auszublenden .
Das Prekäre am Prekariat ist dabei nicht die selbstverordnete Hoffnungslosigkeit , sondern eine immer rücksichtslosere Arbeitswelt , die den
Wert durchschnittlicher Leistungsfähigkeit immer weniger abruft und vor allem : immer schlechter bezahlt .
Mit dem von Jeremy Rifkin 1995 präsentierten Stichwort " The End of Work " verbindet sich der rapide Rückgang von Arbeitsplätzen bei gleichzeitigem Produktivitätszuwachs .
Das sind objektive Tendenzen , die nicht durch McJobs oder gar das paradoxe Fantasma einer totalisierten Bildungselite ohne menschliches Mittelmaß verdrängt werden können .
Wenn nicht die Abkoppelung gesellschaftlichen Reichtums von der Arbeit gelingt , werden die Bildungspropagandisten und Fortschrittseuphoriker bald sehr allein sein .
Bildung jenseits der sozialen Frage
Unter der Rubrik " Bildungskampagne " konstatieren die Liberalen : " Mit ihrer liberalen Bildungsoffensive stellt sich die FDP der Bedeutung von Bildung als der neuen sozialen Frage des 21 .
Jahrhunderts . "
Die soziale Frage ist historischer Betrachtung nach nicht unverbrüchlich mit Bildung verkoppelt .
Arbeitsverhältnisse wurden über unvordenkliche Zeiten nicht vorrangig durch Bildung bestimmt , sondern durch die mehr oder weniger schön gefärbte bis camouflierte Notwendigkeit , schöne Freizeit für schnödes Geld zu opfern .
Wer sein Handwerk gelernt hatte , besaß es – und blieb bei seinen Leisten .
Erst die späte
These vom " lebenslangen Lernen " hat dieses praktische Modell in Zweifel gezogen .
Fraglos sind die Halbwertszeiten von Wissen enorm gesunken .
Wie viel Wissen um Computer , Internet und allen übrigen Techno - Kram haben wir aufgenommen , das heute bereits obsolet und damit ökonomisch wertlos ist ?
Unsere " soziale Frage " kann aber nicht davon abhängig sein , ob Menschen nach langen Bildungs - und Arbeitszeiten nun auch noch unter das Joch lebenslänglicher Bildung geraten .
Büffeln im Altenheim , um die Rente aufzupolieren ?
Denn wie garantieren unsere Bildungsenthusiasten nicht allein der Liberalen , sondern vieler Parteien , dass dieser Bildungszumutungen von Menschen überhaupt noch erträglich verarbeitet werden kann ?
Das rührt an das unausgesprochene Apriori der Abhängigkeit des Wissens von Menschen , die nun immer schneller rotieren sollen - denn anders können und dürfen sie ihre " soziale Frage " nach liberalem Credo ja nicht mehr lösen .
" Lernen unter den veränderten Bedingungen des Alters dient der persönlichen Lebenszufriedenheit und zielt auf die Befähigung zur Mitgestaltung der Gesellschaft und zur Erweiterung notwendiger Kompetenzen zur individuellen Lebensführung .
Lebenslanges Lernen auch im fortgeschrittenen Alter kann der Wirtschaft und der Gesellschaft insgesamt helfen . "
So formuliert die Bund - Länder - Kommission im typischen Weichzeichnerstil auch gegenwärtiger Bildungsphrasen , die den Bildungsbegriff nicht in seiner antagonistischen Struktur darauf untersuchen , ob es nun um " Lebenszufriedenheit " oder abgenötigte " Wirtschaftshilfe " geht .
Denn auch wenn das immer seltener in glücklicheren Berufskarrieren koinzidieren mag , dürfte das Modell der " Totalverzweckung des Menschen " ( Erich Ribolits ) erheblich verbreiteter sein .
Doch selbst diese klassische Ressourcenverwertung kommt nun an einen Punkt , wo sich selbst Ausbeutung mangels Arbeit für alle Beteiligten immer weniger lohnt .
Vielleicht sollten Parteien und Parteimenschen das Lob der Bildung , das sie anderen predigen , daher nun zuvörderst auf sich selbst beziehen .
Dann könnten sie den inzwischen aus dem Vorschein heraus getretenen und immer beklemmenderen Bildungsterror als solchen bezeichnen und die sozioökonomische Befindlichkeit von Menschen davon abkoppeln .
Das zu erwartende Resultat der Wissensgesellschaft mit exponentiell wachsenden Wissensbeständen liegt für Menschen nicht in der besinnungslosen Akkumulation von Wissen , sondern im " Triumph des Nichtwissens " ( Manfred Prisching ) oder anders formuliert : in der relativen Gnade wuchernder Ignoranz .
Nicht nur unter diesen Auspizien hat jeder Mensch das Recht in einer Gesellschaft anständig leben zu können , ohne gebildet sein zu müssen .
Gesellschaften haben aus guten und noch mehr schlechten Gründen , trotz sinkendem Arbeitsvolumen immer noch zu viel Arbeit zu verteilen , die wenig Bildung , dafür aber viel Selbstüberwindung voraussetzt .
Das mag beklagt werden , kann aber nicht in der Zumutung enden , Menschen Lasten aufzubürden , die in Politik und Wirtschaft als persönliches Lebensschicksal definiert werden .
Auch hier hilft uns die wahre Bildung von Huckleberry Finn und Tom Sawyer respektive ihres - durchaus gebildeten - Schöpfers Mark Twain weiter : " Für mich gibt es wichtigeres im Leben als die Schule . "
Bereits die Entstehung des Vexierspruchs " Für die Schule und nicht das Leben lernen wir " präsentiert Bildung als paradoxe Ware .
Selbst wenn Politiker also bereit wären , die Beschaffenheit dieser vorgeblich so köstlichen Ware genauer anzugeben , was sie regelmäßig in ihrer diffusen Begriffsfetischisierung vermeiden , können wir diese Ware ohne die notwendigen Korrekturen am bestehenden Menschen - und Gesellschaftsbild so nicht für ausreichend zukunftstauglich halten .

Muni drivers and management remain as far apart as ever over the city 's demand for major contract concessions - but then , the list of proposed take - backs is long .
Among them :
--
The 8 percent pay premium for drivers who work after 6 p.m .
--
The 50 - cents - an - hour premium for employees who work in the same Muni division for more than five years .
--
The $ 2 - an - hour premium for drivers who are transferred to another shift or division .
-- Free fitness club memberships for employees , which cost the system about $ 200,000 a year .
-- Free Muni passes for drivers and their families .
Management also wants to reassign the six employees now paid to do union business full time .
And it wants to boost the workload for the three dozen or so " full - time " drivers who , for reasons no one can explain , are now assigned to just one run a day .
Officials of the Transport Workers Union say their members are being " scapegoated in the mass media for the financial mess , " and that the real problem is Muni mismanagement and bloated salaries for executives .
Some of the work rules that Muni is trying to amend were supposed to have been changed under a 2007 City Charter amendment that guaranteed Muni drivers would be the second - highest - paid in the nation .
One manager told us , however , that as soon as Muni started negotiating the changes , the union went screaming to Mayor Gavin Newsom , who was gearing up to run for governor at the time - and Muni was told to back off .
Bunk , says mayoral spokesman Tony Winnicker .
He insists it was Muni brass that did n't want to put the screws to the drivers at the time , fearing they would end up with an even more entrenched union leadership .
Besides , once the charter was amended , the city had given away any leverage it had to get the work rules changed .
It 's not helping the current situation that the union is in such disarray that it canceled votes this week on its counteroffer to Muni .
Or that union local President Irwin Lum , pleading that he needed a break from the stress , took off to Paris for rest .
Kaplan kicks it up :
She 's been in office for just a year , but Oakland City Councilwoman RebeccaKaplan announced Tuesday that she 's forming a committee to raise money for a mayoral run - a move she hopes will kick the race wide open .
" It 's taking the next step on what is a fascinating journey , " Kaplan said .
The first step might have come during her run for City Council when she switched from Green Party member to Democrat , securing a number of endorsements in the process .
Kaplan - who served on the AC Transit board before winning her at - large council seat - joins fellow Councilwoman JeanQuan and former state Senate President Pro Tem DonPerata in the lineup to replace Mayor Ron Dellums , who has yet to announce whether he will run for re-election in November .
Kaplan is a progressive , an environmentalist and a lesbian - three groups that have healthy constituencies in Oakland .
Since coming on the council , she has also courted the town 's small businesses and builders and was instrumental in the campaign to create a tax on medical marijuana clubs .
" Oh boy , " said City Councilman Larry Reid .
" This is going to make things very interesting .
" But then , things are always interesting here in Oakland . "
Party time :
For somebody who never liked to ask for money , San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom sure has been burning up the phone lines lately to score dollars for his run for lieutenant governor .
Newsom raised $ 121,000 in the past month , on top of the $ 255,000 he already had on hand - and he 'll need every bit of it .
His rival for the Democratic nomination , Los Angeles Councilwoman Janice Hahn , is n't backing down - as evidenced by her decision to seek the state party 's endorsement at this weekend 's convention in Los Angeles , something she had pledged not to waste resources on before Newsom 's late entry into the race .
Hahn is breaking out the checkbook big time , for everything from a Friday night chocolate and martini party for the convention 's 2,800 delegates to " Hahn 2010 " hand sanitizer .
As a result , Newsom is being drawn into a party endorsement fight his advisers do n't expect to win .
He 's also having a bit of trouble on the local front : Newsom failed to get the 60 percent vote he needed to win the city 's Irish American Democratic Club endorsement , and the San Francisco Women 's Political Committee went for Hahn despite a pitch from the mayor .

Rephrase the Lie Backwards
Hunched shoulders
More info than you asked for
When someone is lying , they will do one of three things .
A ) Show emotion when they have none , B ) show no emotion ( think of a poker face ) , or C ) mask one emotion with another .
Keep a close eye on the person you are speaking to , not just there eyes but also their entire face .
The upper half of a persons face is a much more reliable measure than the lower half .
It generates more involuntary clues and is extremely difficult for someone to control .
The muscles used in smiling for example is the most revealing clue to tell if a smile is genuine or manufactured is in the eyes .
Look at the muscles that surround the eye socket .
The major muscle running from the cheekbone at an angle to the corner of the lips indicates a sincere smile .
Micro-expressions that flit across the face often expose a person 's real thoughts .
Imagine if you were to watch people on videotape , frame by frame , you would see them showing their true emotion just before they show the fake expression designed to cover up the lie .
But these ultra - brief facial movements , or micro-expressions , only lasting a fraction of a second , are n't easy to spot .
Even professionals trained in lie detection can't always isolate them .
And deliberate liars tend to add other expressions , like smiling , to disguise a lie .
If their facial expressions are not in sync with what they are saying .
They might be hiding something or lying .
For example , if the moment calls for a smile and the smile is delayed or the timing is off ..
A genuine smile will crest over their face like a wave .
While most people may interpret darting , unfocused eyes as a classic sign of lying , it 's vital to consider the context of the behavior .
For example , experienced poker players are careful not to make too much of eye “ tells . ”
People usually look to the left or right when thinking about an answer .
Someone not making eye contact should arouse suspicion , but eye contact can be a tricky evaluation tool : Consider that a psychopath can look you in the eye and lie with ease .
And in some cultures , it 's considered inappropriate to maintain eye contact .
Even though a high percentage of communication is thought to be non-verbal , no single part of the body — such as the eyes or hands — reveals the whole story when it comes to lying .
People who are lying often become more still :
Hand gestures that normally accompany talking may occur with less frequency or intensity , and there may be fewer arm and leg movements .
The person becomes more focused on telling the lie , so they get quieter in their body .
A few more examples can be found here .
If you suspect you 're being lied too , try this technique , which experts say can trip up a liar .
Try asking questions quickly — one after the other .
“ The initial lie is easy , ” explains Kang Lee , director of the Institute of Child Study at the University of Toronto , and whose behavioral work with children can often be applied to adults .
“ The follow - up lie is more difficult .
When you continue to ask questions and put people on the spot , it gets harder to maintain the lie .
” If you suspect that you are being lied to , ask the person to explain the events leading up to the problem backwards and see if they can get it right !
Often , a lie is planned out as a series of events in a certain order leading up to something going wrong .
They will have planned the events in a certain order to cover the bases but not the other way round .
If it 's the truth , then it will be easy to remember .
If they are telling the truth then it will be easy !
When a person lies , unless they are a professional liar , will subconsciously try and make themselves small and inconspicuous .
As a result , they will often hunch their shoulders , which reinforce their desire to remain small .
Watch out for this .
Other body gestures include crossing their arms or overtly lean away from you while talking to you .
A liar might be so paranoid about being untruthful that they 'll offer much more information than you asked for - liars know that a good liar tells more details in order to look innocent .
So when your colleague goes off into a tangent about how he never got your message , but he did get a weird message on his answering machine that made him laugh , and that made him think of the other night when ...
You might have to ask him to revert to the topic at hand .
Do n't be afraid to ask questions .
DETROIT - A Belleville , Mich. , father faces up to four years in prison after police say he used his 2 - year - old daughter as a human shield to avoid being shocked with a Taser by an officer .
Jesse Cox , 27 , faces a preliminary examination Thursday on charges including second - degree child abuse , a four - year felony , and home invasion in the Saturday incident in Warren , Mich .
" It 's disturbing for sure , " Warren Police Sgt. Heidi Metz said about the incident .
" And it 's his own child .
It 's not like it 's somebody else 's child . "
Cox broke through the screen door at his ex-wife 's home about 3:30 p.m. EDT when she refused to let him in , Metz said .
She called police , who then ordered Cox outside .
He refused and argued with officers , who were in the doorway telling him they were going to arrest him for breaking in .
" He takes what we call a fighting stance , clenched his fist , and that 's when one of the officers pulled out his Taser , " Metz said .
The officer pointed the Taser at Cox , who picked up his daughter and held her in front of him , Metz said .
Officers grabbed Cox by the arm and the child 's mother grabbed the girl , he said .
Officers wrestled Cox to the ground , Metz said .
He was arraigned Monday in 37th District Court in Warren , Metz said .
His bond was set at $ 15,000 cash or surety .
The rise in human emissions of carbon dioxide is driving fundamental and dangerous changes in the chemistry and ecosystems of the world 's oceans , international marine scientists have warned .
" Ocean conditions are already more extreme than those experienced by marine organisms and ecosystems for millions of years , " the researchers say in the latest issue of the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution .
" This emphasises the urgent need to adopt policies that drastically reduce CO 2 emissions . "
Ocean acidification , which the researchers call the ' evil twin of global warming ' , is caused when the CO 2 emitted by human activity , mainly burning fossil fuels , dissolves into the oceans .
It is happening independently of , but in combination with , global warming .
" Evidence gathered by scientists around the world over the last few years suggests that ocean acidification could represent an equal -- or perhaps even greater threat -- to the biology of our planet than global warming , " co-author Professor Ove Hoegh - Guldberg of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies and The University of Queensland says .
More than 30 % of the CO 2 released from burning fossil fuels , cement production , deforestation and other human activities goes straight into the oceans , turning them gradually more acidic .

" The resulting acidification will impact many forms of sea life , especially organisms whose shells or skeletons are made from calcium carbonate , like corals and shellfish .
It may interfere with the reproduction of plankton species which are a vital part of the food web on which fish and all other sea life depend , " he adds .
The scientists say there is now persuasive evidence that mass extinctions in past Earth history , like the " Great Dying " of 251 million years ago and another wipeout 55 million years ago , were accompanied by ocean acidification , which may have delivered the deathblow to many species that were unable to cope with it .
" These past periods can serve as great lessons of what we can expect in the future , if we continue to push the acidity the ocean even further " said lead author , Dr. Carles Pelejero , from ICREA and the Marine Science Institute of CSIC in Barcelona , Spain .
" Given the impacts we see in the fossil record , there is no question about the need to immediately reduce the rate at which we are emitting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , " he said further .
" Today , the surface waters of the oceans have already acidified by an average of 0.1 pH units from pre-industrial levels , and we are seeing signs of its impact even in the deep oceans , " said co-author Dr. Eva Calvo , from the Marine Science Institute of CSIC in Barcelona , Spain .

" Future acidification depends on how much CO 2 humans emit from here on -- but by the year 2100 various projections indicate that the oceans will have acidified by a further 0.3 to 0.4 pH units , which is more than many organisms like corals can stand , " Prof .
Hoegh - Guldberg says .
" This will create conditions not seen on Earth for at least 40 million years . "
" These changes are taking place at rates as much as 100 times faster than they ever have over the last tens of millions of years " Prof.
Hoegh - Guldberg says .
Under such circumstances " Conditions are likely to become very hostile for calcifying species in the north Atlantic and Pacific over the next decade and in the Southern Ocean over the next few decades , " the researchers warn .
Besides directly impacting on the fishing industry and its contribution to the human food supply at a time when global food demand is doubling , a major die - off in the oceans would affect birds and many land species and change the biology of Earth as a whole profoundly , Prof.
Hoegh - Guldberg adds .
I have what I would charitably describe as a hate - hate relationship with email .
I desperately try to avoid sending email , not just for myself , but also in the code I write .
Despite my misgivings , email is the cockroach of communication mediums : you just can't kill it .
Email is the one method of online contact that almost everyone -- at least for that subset of " everyone " which includes people who can bear to touch a computer at all -- is guaranteed to have , and use .
Yes , you can make a fairly compelling case that email is for old stupid people , but let 's table that discussion for now .
So , reluctantly , we come to the issue of sending email through code .
It 's easy !
Let 's send some email through oh , I do n't know , let 's say ...
Ruby , courtesy of some sample code I found while browsing the Ruby tag on Stack Overflow .
require ' net / smtp ' def send_email ( to , subject = " " , body = " " ) from = " my@email.com " body =
" From : #{from}\r
To : #{to}\r
Subject : #{subject}\r
\r
#{body}\r
" Net:: SMTP.start ( '192.168.10.213 ' , 25 , ' 192.168.0.218 ' ) do |smtp| smtp.send_message body , from , to end end send_email " my@email.com " , " test " , " blah blah blah "
There 's a bug in this code , though .
Do you see it ?
Just because you send an email does n't mean it will arrive .
Not by a long shot .
Bear in mind this is email we 're talking about .
It was never designed to survive a bitter onslaught of criminals and spam , not to mention the explosive , exponential growth it has seen over the last twenty years .
Email is a well that has been truly and thoroughly poisoned -- the digital equivalent of a superfund cleanup site .
The ecosystem around email is a dank miasma of half - implemented , incompletely supported anti-spam hacks and workarounds .
Which means the odds of that random email your code just sent getting to its specific destination is .. spotty .
At best .
If you want email your code sends to actually arrive in someone 's AOL mailbox , to the dulcet tones of " You 've Got Mail ! " , there are a few things you must do first .
And most of them are only peripherally related to writing code .
1 . Make sure the computer sending the email has a Reverse PTR record
What 's a reverse PTR record ?
It 's something your ISP has to configure for you -- a way of verifying that the email you send from a particular IP address actually belongs to the domain it is purportedly from .
Not every IP address has a corresponding PTR record .
In fact , if you took a random sampling of addresses your firewall blocked because they were up to no good , you 'd probably find most have no PTR record - a dig -x gets you no information .
That 's also apt to be true for mail spammers , or their PTR does n't match up : if you do a dig -x on their IP you get a result , but if you look up that result you might not get the same IP you started with .
That 's why PTR records have become important .
Originally , PTR records were just intended as a convenience , and perhaps as a way to be neat and complete .
There still are no requirements that you have a PTR record or that it be accurate , but because of the abuse of the internet by spammers , certain conventions have grown up .
For example , you may not be able to send email to some sites if you do n't have a valid PTR record , or if your pointer is " generic " .
How do you get a PTR record ?
You might think that this is done by your domain registrar - after all , they point your domain to an IP address .
Or you might think whoever handles your DNS would do this .
But the PTR record is n't up to them , it 's up to the ISP that " owns " the IP block it came from .
They are the ones who need to create the PTR record .
A reverse PTR record is critical .
How critical ?
Do n't even bother reading any further until you 've verified that your ISP has correctly configured the reverse PTR record for the server that will be sending email .
It is absolutely the most common check done by mail servers these days .
Fail the reverse PTR check , and I guarantee that a huge percentage of the emails you send will end up in the great bit bucket in the sky -- and not in the email inboxes you intended .
2. Configure DomainKeys Identified Mail in your DNS and code
What 's DomainKeys Identified Mail ?
With DKIM , you " sign " every email you send with your private key , a key only you could possibly know .
And this can be verified by attempting to decrypt the email using the public key stored in your public DNS records .
It 's really quite clever !
The first thing you need to do is generate some public - private key pairs ( one for every domain you want to send email from ) via OpenSSL .
I used a win32 version I found .
Issue these commands to produce the keys in the below files :
$ openssl genrsa - out rsa.private 1024 $ openssl rsa - in rsa.private - out rsa.public - pubout - outform PEM
These public and private keys are just big ol ' Base64 encoded strings , so plop them in your code as configuration string resources that you can retrieve later .
Next , add some DNS records .
You 'll need two new TXT records .
_domainkey .example.com
" o=~ ; r=contact@example.com " selector._domainkey .example.com
" k=rsa ; p={public-key-base64-string - here} "
The first TXT DNS record is the global DomainKeys policy and contact email .
The second TXT DNS record is the public base64 key you generated earlier , as one giant unbroken string .
Note that the " selector " part of this record can be anything you want ; it 's basically just a disambiguating string .
Almost done .
One last thing -- we need to sign our emails before sending them .
In any rational world this would be handled by an email library of some kind .
We use Mailbee .NET which makes this fairly painless :
smtp .
Message = dk.Sign(smtp .
Message , null , AppSettings.Email.DomainKeyPrivate , false , " selector " ) ;
3 . Set up a SPF / SenderID record in your DNS
To be honest , SenderID is a bit of a " nice to have " compared to the above two .
But if you 've gone this far , you might as well go the distance .
SenderID , while a little antiquated and kind of ..
Microsoft / Hotmail centric .. does n't take much additional effort .
SenderID is n't complicated .
It 's another TXT DNS record at the root of , say , example.com , which contains a specially formatted string documenting all the allowed IP addresses that mail can be expected to come from .
Here 's an example :
" v=spf1 a mx ip4:10.0.0.1 ip4:10.0.0.2 ~all "
You can use the Sender ID SPF Record Wizard to generate one of these for each domain you send email from .
That sucked .
How do I know all this junk is working ?
I agree , it sucked .
Email sucks ; what did you expect ?
I used two methods to verify that all the above was working :
Test emails sent to a GMail account .
Use the " show original " menu on the arriving email to see the raw message content as seen by the email server .
You want to verify that the headers definitely contain the following : Received - SPF : pass Authentication - Results : ... spf=pass ... dkim=pass
If you see that , then the Reverse PTR and DKIM signing you set up is working .
Google provides excellent diagnostic feedback in their email server headers , so if something is n't working , you can usually discover enough of a hint there to figure out why .
Test emails sent to the Port25 email verifier
Port25 offers a really nifty public service -- you can send email to check-auth@verifier.port25.com and it will reply to the from : address with an extensive diagnostic !
Here 's an example summary result from a test email I just sent to it : SPF check : pass DomainKeys check : fail DKIM check : pass Sender - ID check : pass SpamAssassin check : ham
You want to pass SPF , DKIM , and Sender - ID .
Do n't worry about the DomainKeys failure , as I believe it is spurious -- DKIM is the " newer " version of that same protocol .
Yes , the above three steps are quite a bit of work just to send a lousy email .
But I do n't send email lightly .
By the time I 've reached the point where I am forced to write code to send out email , I really , really want those damn emails to arrive .
By any means necessary .
And for those who are the unfortunate recipients of these emails : my condolences .
Last Thursday was the 40th anniversary of Earth Day , and the CEO of one electric - car maker took the occasion to speak out on some of the popular myths around the manufacturing and use of electric vehicles .
Richard Canny , who runs the recently refinanced
Think , published a list of " top 10 EV myths busted " to provide some rational counterpoints to a series of assertions about EVs .
Some of the concerns are based in reality ; others are simply ignorant .
NOTE : We did a little streamlining and copy editing .
Think City
think city ev motorauthority 005
thinkcity_003
The Th!nkCity takes about four hours to charge and offers a driving range of up to 120 miles
Think Global was unveiling new concept vehicles like the Ox as recently as last year ’s Geneva Motor Show
Here 's the first half of Canny 's list , along with our comments on Think 's rebuttal to each one .
We 'll publish the second half tomorrow .
(1) You are just moving pollution out of the cities to the countryside .
Think says : Electric vehicle motors are 3 to 5 times [ as ] efficient [ as ] gasoline - powered vehicles .
While it 's best to power EVs from renewable energy sources ( which are growing quickly ) , the efficiency of EVs makes them cleaner , producing less carbon , under any situation - even when they are charged using coal - fired electricity .
We say : Largely , but not entirely , true .
It depends on what you 're comparing to .
If you compare to a gasoline car that gets 25 miles per gallon , it 's entirely true .
If you compare to a 50 - mpg 2010 Toyota Prius , certain edge cases emit more carbon to drive 1 mile on grid power than on gasoline .
One U.S. example : North Dakota 's grid , which is powered almost entirely on ( relatively dirty ) coal .
(2) Customers will never buy a car with less than a 200 - mile range
Think says : So - called ‘ range anxiety ' diminishes when people get used to driving EVs on a daily basis [ and get used to charging their cars overnight like their cell phones ] .
As more EVs hit the road , businesses and cities will add charging points to encourage EV use .
And THINK recently announced a new standard for fast charging - zero to 80 % charged in just 15 minutes [ for ] those rare situations when an EV will be needed to cover more than 100 miles in a single day .
We say : Largely true .
We would have added that multi-car households switch vehicles based on their daily duty cycle : Compact sedan for errands by one or two people , minivan or large sport-utility for hauling the soccer team to games .
They 'll do the same with electric vehicles , using them appropriately and leaving them home when more range is needed .
(3) The battery wo n't last
Think says : EV batteries are designed to last at least 10 years and more than 100,000 miles .
THINK has cars on the road in Europe with batteries approaching the 10 - year mark and [ its ] modern Lithium-ion batteries [ will ] meet or exceed that target .
We say : Agreed .
No major carmaker is going to launch an electric vehicle without a high degree of confidence that the batteries will hold up .
(4) You 'll need to build a lot more power plants
Think says :
Actually , there 's enough off - peak electricity in the U.S. to power 79 % of U.S. driving demand .
As more EVs are deployed , it 's important to ensure that the smart - charging ( time - based charging management ) and vehicle - to - grid connectivity progresses as well .
We say : Correct .
One study showed that even if one - third of all miles driven in the U.S. were powered from the grid , the increase in demand would be only a handful of percentage points .
(5) We 're going to run out of lithium , and is n't it poisonous ?
Think says : Lithium carbonate today comes from dried salt lakes in South America ( Chile , Argentina and Bolivia ) and China .
There are also other huge sources for lithium , although these are more expensive to develop .
The industry will not have a shortage of lithium for the next decade .
It is also possible that new battery technologies will be based on other light metals like Zinc or Nickel .
Lithium from used batteries will be recycled in dedicated recycling plants .
Lithium batteries contain no poisonous heavy metals like lead in lead - acid batteries or cadmium in NiCd batteries .
We say : Correct .

I had heard this question a lot of time and also seen people struggling to take the printout of Linux man pages , instead of the fact that it is one of the very simplest task .
This can be done in a series of steps or in one single steps .
I will be explaining both here .
Converting man page into text files :
# man passwd | col - b > passwd.txt
This will create a passwd .
txt file which can be printed easily .
Taking Printout of text file :
You can take the printout of the text file by using any of the following commands :
# cat passwd. txt | lpr
OR
# lpr passwd.txt
One liner command :
You can also use this one liner command to take the printout of the man page :
# man passwd | col - b | lpr
You can also print “ info ” pages with the same procedure :
# info passwd | col - b | lpr
Create PDF :
If you would like to create a pdf of man pages then that can also be done by this simple command :
# man -t passwd | ps2pdf - passwd.pdf

Sweet Justice is a Javascript library you can drop onto any web page to create beautiful justified text .
Even supercalifragilisticexpealadocious .
Sweet Justice lovingly inserts the obscure yet wonderful soft hyphen into the text of any element marked with the sweet - justice class , and turns on CSS text justification .
It requires either jQuery or YUI3 to function .
Enjoy !

From Wikipedia : Justification has been the preferred setting of type in many western languages through the history of movable type .
This is due to the classic Western manuscript book page being built of a column or two columns , which is considered to look " best " if it is even - margined on the left and right .
The classical Western column did not rigorously justify , but came as close as feasible when the skill of the penman and the character of the manuscript permitted .
Historically , both scribal and typesetting traditions took advantage of abbreviations ( sigla ) , ligatures , and swash to help maintain the rhythm and colour of a justified line .
The use of movable type solidified this preference from a technological point of view .
It was much easier to handle and make emendations to large amounts of type that had words or syllables at the ends of lines than it was to respace the ends of lines .
Its use has only waned somewhat since the middle of the 20th century through the advocacy of the typographer Jan Tschichold 's book Asymmetric Typography and the freer typographic treatment of the Bauhaus , Dada , and Russian constructivist movements .
Not all " flush left " settings in traditional typography were identical .
In flush left text , words are separated on a line by the minimum word spacing built into the font .
Continuous casting typesetting systems such as the Linotype were able to reduce the jaggedness of the right - hand sides of adjacent lines of flush left composition by inserting self - adjusting space bands between words to evenly distribute white space , taking excessive space that would have occurred at the end of the line and redistributing it between words .
This feature , known as " ragged right " or " in and out ragged " , was available in traditional dedicated typesetting systems but is absent from most if not all desktop publishing systems .
Graphic designers and typesetters using desktop systems adjust word and letter spacing , or " tracking " , on a manual line - by - line basis to achieve the same effect .
I ’ve already said I like the acquisition of Ryan Whitney at the NHL trade deadline , but what he told me in the Edmonton Oilers dressing room this morning sent a shiver down my spine .
Speaking of body parts , it seems
Whitney has bad feet .
Anybody who has been paying attention knows that Whitney had surgery on his left foot in August 2008 , a procedure that limited him to 48 games in 2008 - 09 after seasons of 38 , 59 and 40 points in Pittsburgh .
The surgery , called an osteotomy , is defined as a procedure to shorten , lengthen or realign a bone or bones .
The catch is the operation was n’t done to repair a broken bone , but to correct a chronic condition wearing inserts in his skates did n’t remedy .

Given all the fun the Oilers have had with Nikolai Khabibulin ’s back this season , would it make anybody else nervous if Whitney suggested he ’s now having problems with his right foot ?
Apparently , he is .
What he said
" The left foot is just great , the one I had surgery on , " Whitney told reporters at Rexall Place this morning .
" I ’m just kind of battling a little bit with the right one right now .
It ’s just kind of about figuring out what ’s going to work and what ’s best for me and how to feel healthy again .
That ’s half the battle of playing well .
I think it ’s just something I was kind of born with . "

Pardon ?
Whitney , 27 , gave no indication today his right foot is bothering him enough that he will miss any games down the stretch .
There ’s been no indication he ’ll require surgery .
I have n’t asked the Oilers medical staff about that .
Likewise , I do n’t know if the Oilers shipped Lubomir Visnovsky to Anaheim for Whitney knowing about the condition or not .
It does , however , at least seem reason for pause , given the four - year contract handed Khabibulin , despite his previous back problems .
It ’s something to keep an eye on .
Looking to rebound
Whitney , who played with the US Team at the 2010 Olympics , is n’t using his foot problems as a crutch when it comes to his fall - off in production these past couple seasons , but it ’s not a stretch to suggest it ’s impacted his performance .
In 2005 - 06 with Pittsburgh , he had 38 points in just 68 games as a 22 - year - old .
In 2006 - 07 , he had 59 points in 81 games .
In 2007 - 08 , he had 40 points in 76 games .
After surgery , which was performed in Charlotte , North Carolina , he played 28 games with the Penguins , scoring 2 - 11 - 13 , before being dealt to Anaheim , where he added 10 assists in 20 games .
He ’d scored 4 - 24 - 28 in 62 games with the Ducks this season when the trade came .

" I think it ’s just , partly , not being healthy , " Whitney said when I asked him about the past two seasons .
" You never want to make excuses , but you ’ve got some injuries I had to deal with .
" You ’re dealing with certain things .
At the same time , though , it ’s just about kind of really finding your passion for the game and working harder to get better . "
And …
— Adding to the team ’s ridiculous injury woes , defenceman Ladislav Smid is out for the season because he needs surgery to repair a disc problem in his neck , according to coach Pat Quinn .
— The infection Sheldon Souray has after surgery to repair a broken hand is serious enough that he ’s been hospitalized .
Captain Ethan Moreau told Jim Matheson and I this morning Souray knew something was badly amiss when he bumped his elbow and it swelled up like a balloon .

Scientists at The University of Western Ontario have discovered the biological link between stress , anxiety and depression .
By identifying the connecting mechanism in the brain , this high impact research led by Stephen Ferguson of Robarts Research Institute shows exactly how stress and anxiety could lead to depression .
The study also reveals a small molecule inhibitor developed by Ferguson , which may provide a new and better way to treat anxiety , depression and other related disorders .
The findings are published online in the journal Nature Neuroscience .
Ferguson , Ana Magalhaes and their colleagues used a behavioural mouse model and a series of molecular experiments to reveal the connection pathway and to test the new inhibitor .
" Our findings suggest there may be an entire new generation drugs and drug targets that can be used to selectively target depression , and therefore treat it more effectively , " says Ferguson , the director of the Molecular Brain Research Group at Robarts , and a professor in the Department of Physiology & Pharmacology at Western 's Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry .
" We 've gone from mechanism to mouse , and the next step is to see whether or not we can take the inhibitor we developed , and turn it into a pharmaceutical agent . "
The research was conducted in collaboration with Hymie Anisman at Carleton University , and funded through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research ( CIHR ) .
" According to the World Health Organization , depression , anxiety and other related mood disorders now share the dubious distinction of being the most prevalent causes of chronic illness , " says Anthony Phillips , the scientific director of the CIHR Institute of Neurosciences , Mental Health and Addiction .
" Using the power of molecular biology , Stephen Ferguson and colleagues provide novel insights that may be the key to improving the lives of so many individuals coping with these forms of mental ill health . "
The linking mechanism in the study involves the interaction between corticotropin releasing factor receptor 1 ( CRFR1 ) and specific types of serotonin receptors ( 5 - HTRs ) .
While no one has been able to connect these two receptors on a molecular level , the study reveals that CRFR1 works to increase the number of 5 - HTRs on cell surfaces in the brain , which can cause abnormal brain signaling .
Since CRFR1 activation leads to anxiety in response to stress , and 5 - HTRs lead to depression , the research shows how stress , anxiety and depression pathways connect through distinct processes in the brain .
Most importantly , the inhibitor developed by the Ferguson lab blocks 5 - HTRs in the pathway to combat anxious behaviour , and potentially depression , in mice .
While major depressive disorder often occurs together with anxiety disorder in patients , the causes for both are strongly linked to stressful experiences .
Stressful experiences can also make the symptoms of anxiety and depression more severe .
By discovering and then blocking a pathway responsible for the link between stress , anxiety and depression , Ferguson not only provides the first biological evidence for a connection , but he also pioneers the development of a potential drug for more effective treatment .
Hello everyone , long time no post .
As I ’m used to do lately , I failed in keeping up all the stuff I ’m doing in my blog , so I thought about writing a quick recap of what ’s going on in my land .
Telepathy - KDE – New stuff
I am now working at Collabora : as I ’m still a student , I got hired part time and have been assigned to telepathy - kde : so if you noticed some extra activity on my side being thrown into that part of KDE , you now know the reason 🙂
I have to say I ’m pretty excited about that and I found myself liking the project and Telepathy itself a lot : expect some more news on this specific topic soon .
For the moment , I started getting involved into the various projects ( including Telepathy - Qt4 ) , and already achieved something : you can now handle your contacts through telepathy - contactlist ( so adding / removing contacts , handling groups , etc… ) and have them synchronized with the corresponding nepomuk resources .
I am also writing a small API which would allow KDE applications to access Telepathy functions easily from Nepomuk resources .
Telepathy really brings a lot to the table , and it can be a great addition to KDE .
Just keep an eye on us , you might hear some exciting things 😉
On a side note , a big thank you to George Goldberg for helping me in getting up to speed with the project .
KAuth
KAuth is definitely in " maintainance mode " : I fixed some small bugs in the last days , improved backend handling with dynamic plugins , and it definitely appears rock solid – there are no open bugs against it that I remember right now , and it ’s becoming more widespread by the minute .
KDE 4.5 will probably feature KDM ’s KCM using KAuth , which was probably one of the most awaited modules to be ported to this new framework .
I ’d also love to see some more applications following the drill and abandoning the " launch UI as root " meme : for example , I ’d love to see the excellent KDE ’s partitionmanager ( btw , it ’s hands down the best software out there for managing your disks , give it a shot ) using KAuth and no longer running its GUI as root .
On a related note , it is planned to have KNewStuff3 using KAuth for system - wide installation .
Yeah , this means you will be able to install new wallpapers / plasma themes / amarok scripts / whatever you might think for all of your users .
Polkit - kde -
1
Things had to slow down on that front , for obvious reasons .
Although , in SVN there ’s an almost working KCModule which is able to manage polkit actions and system administrators .
Hopefully somebody will help me giving it the bit of love it needs for a release 🙂
Power management
In 4.5 , PowerDevil has been improved a lot – this thanks to many people who came up with patches .
Especially , Holger Macht pushed some bug fixes and some usability fixes ( which removed some controls like power management schemes ) based on the latest kernel and power management stack improvements which relieved various options from the GUI .
Also , there are some more patches by Felix Geyer which are in process of being implemented , which will fix some of the most annoying bugs ( double suspension , brightness control ) found in PowerDevil these days .
So expect a better power management experience in next 4.4 releases and especially in the upcoming 4.5 .
For the future ( 4.6 or 4.7 ) , PowerDevil might undergo a partial or total rewrite , due to a variety of factors .
First of all , I ’d like to implement at least a good part of the features I described in this previous post ; secondly , PowerDevil ’s code is starting to show its age and my inexperience at the time of its writing ; thirdly , there will be some changes in the Solid stack .
Solid : : Control is about to disappear .
Yep , you heard correctly : that small set of libraries in kdebase / workspace will be " eaten " by the components which make use of it .
Why ?
Because S: : C is meant to be used by the corresponding component only ( PowerDevil , NetworkManagement , BlueDevil… ) , and has never guaranteed API stability .
Merging the code would allow us to reduce complexity and sparse code .
I already hear cries from developers who used Solid : : Control : : PowerManagement in their applications – but do n’t worry .
A basic API ( e.g. just what you need ) will be exposed ( probably through DBus ) by " future PowerDevil " instead , and I ’ll try to commit to a stable API once this will happen .
Also , the logic for suspension / hibernation will be probably moved to the session manager , which is where it belongs .
More than that , there will be some further improvements to profile handling , inhibition handling , and more stuff .
And we ’re not forgetting upower ( former DeviceKit ) support : you might be able to use it very soon , as a backend appears to be ready somewhere .
Just watch out my blog for an announcement .
That ’s all , folks
Hope you enjoyed the reading .
Give out your feedback , and if you ’re interested in giving out a helping hand on any of these topics , feel free to get in touch with me , I ’d be more than happy 🙂

The Führer Cult Germans Cringe at Hitler 's Popularity in Pakistan
Germans are popular in India and Pakistan , but not always for the right reasons .
Many in South Asia have nothing but admiration for Adolf Hitler and still associate Germany with the Third Reich .
Everyday encounters with the love of all things Nazi makes German visitors cringe .
Dirt has an amazing ability to take in practically anything and end up better than when it started .
You could bury the nastiest , angriest thing imaginable and , in no time at all , it 's pushing up daisies .
This seeming inexhaustible capacity of dirt to forgive us our sins is the root of our planet 's biology .
It 's also the heart of a charming , if occasionally cloying , new documentary , " Dirt ! The Movie , " airing nationwide Tuesday as part of the Independent Lens series on PBS .
Filmmakers Bill Benensen and Gene Rosow start at the beginning , covering in a matter of seconds the big bang , the birth of the planet , the slopping over of early life - forms from sea to shore , and millions of years of birth , death and decay .
All that rotten stuff , mixed with clay and who knows what , piles up to form the very ground beneath our feet .
Actually , it forms our feet , too , and all the rest of us , more or less , in a way the movie tries to make clear as mud .
We take dirt for granted .
" Dirt ! " asks us to dig down a little deeper , turning the world inside out to show us what living muck is really about .
" We need to stop treating it like , well , dirt , " says actress Maggie Gyllenhaal , who introduces the series .
It sort of makes sense , in a mystical sort of way .
The documentary alternates between reverential and goofy .
The reverence derives partly from " Dirt : The Ecstatic Skin of the Earth , " by William Bryant Logan , an earnest New Yorker who worships the stuff others clean out from under their fingernails .
Grubbing about wearing an ancient ball cap , Logan is a veritable Doctor of Dirt , an expert on things like root - balls .
He appears in the movie as a man on a mission .
He wants city dwellers to wake up and smell the crap .
He relishes the very names for it , putting " dirt " on a list of " strong words " like " house , " " eat " and a bleeped - out synonym for merde .
One of the more charming among the many animated segments illustrates a chapter from Logan 's book in which a worker named Clyde , after parking his pickup beneath a maple tree , falls 40 feet from a scaffold .
While he is recovering in the hospital , the refuse and gunk in the back of the truck sprouts a garden .
Ordinary miracles
That 's just one everyday miracle covered in " Dirt ! "
Another one is how the movie manages to explain the microbial minutiae underlying the ultimate pedestrian substance without bogging down , or losing its good humor .
The goofiness - starting with the exclamation point in the title - comes from the filmmakers ' desire to make a watchable documentary .
" We hope to go beyond the dedicated environmentalist audience and reach everyone , " Rosow said during an interview .
" We wanted to give people a real sense that this is a living substance . "
There are very few multisyllabic words .
Instead , we get gaggles of animated preverbal dirt critters , chirping like hamsters , looking annoyed when asphalt is poured over them and protesting with picket signs against the rapacious humans .
The main point of all this is that we diss the living dirt - the Rodney Dangerfield of natural resources , Rosow said - at our peril .
We may have a future , it seems , but only if enough of us make it to the " companion interactive Web site " ( dirtthemovie.org ) and learn how to " come back into balance with dirt . "
Evil farmers
In the simple moral calculus of the movie , the evil comes in the form of corporate monoculture farming , which wages a soul - killing war on Mother Earth and her happy bugs by unleashing giant - clawed digger machines .
Some of these scenes seem cut from " War of the Worlds . "
The dirt lovers , by contrast , fairly skip along through their organic gardens , producing hearty soups under the supervision of Alice Waters or turning Rikers Island convicts into gentle weed whackers who would n't hurt a turnip .
They are all ingredients in an easygoing , funny and occasionally profound tale of our planet 's pestered organic layer .
There 's too much sweetness , for my taste , in the circle - of - life philosophizing and nowhere near enough gross stuff to satisfy the 14 - year - old longing to see something dead and oozing , its eyes bugging out .
At least Logan 's book had a memorable chapter about the guidance system of earthworms .
You only get a handful of worms in the film , and only a single close - up of a fresh cowflop .
Benensen and Rosow found no time for even a single corporate clod to explain things from the agribusiness point of view .
Instead , they linger among potterymakers and mushroom hunters , tell us an African folktale about a hummingbird fighting a forest fire and show us a wine snob tasting dirt in a vineyard .
Maybe all we are is dust in the wind , but cheer up .
At least there 's no Kansas soundtrack .
In the forgiving spirit of the subject matter , we let it go and end as we began - fertilizer , if we 're lucky .
We should try to save the dirt , for the sake of civilization .
But if we do n't , dirt is perfectly capable of saving itself , one way or another , even if the way turns out to include tossing the entire human species into the slop bucket .
Dirt !

Just as Congress is set to begin debating ethanol - related subsidies , Growth Energy , a lobbying group for the ethanol industry , is starting a $ 2.5 million , 6 - month national television ad campaign aimed at defending ethanol , and portraying it a way to break the country 's addiction to foreign oil .
Grown Energy is headed by Jim Nussle , a former Republican congressman from Iowa and former member of George W. Bush 's cabinet who is now president and CEO of a Virginia - based PR and lobbying firm called the Nussle Group .
The corn / ethanol industry has been in decline for the last two years due to the economic downturn , which reduced the demand for both gasoline and ethanol .
The ad campaign seeks to put a positive spin on ethanol , increase the market for ethanol , and counteract the idea that growing corn and other crops for fuel displaces food crops and causes higher food prices .
Ethanol is blended into gasoline , but has n't caught on because it 's less widely available and can be more expensive to use on a per-mile basis .
While it is cheaper than gas , ethanol contains a third less energy than gas , and gets 30 to 40 percent less mileage .

Hamde Abo Rahma sends this report on the latest protest in Bil’in :
Today ’s demonstration marked the culminating event in the Fifth Bil ’in International Conference for Palestinian Popular Resistance , which began on Wednesday , April 21 with a full line - up of speakers including politicians , leaders of Popular Committees , Israeli activists , and international solidarity activists .
The conference continued through Thursday and Friday .
After the final conference session on Friday morning , in which workshop groups reported on their conclusions in preparation for the conference statement , the conference participants gathered with scores of other Israeli , international , and Palestinians waiting at the mosque for the weekly demonstration .
Today ’s demonstration was larger than normal in size , and lasted an especially long period of time .
Serious injuries were sustained during the demonstration , and several were arrested .
Present at the demonstration were local political figures , including Mustafa Barghouti , and international solidarity leaders such as Luisa Morgantini .
At 1:30 pm the crowd of demonstrators processed to the site of the Wall , carrying posters and flags , and were immediately met by soldiers , sound grenades , and smoke bombs .
Protestors encountered a line of soldiers who were hiding ; these soldiers fired a wall of gas at the protestors in order to force the demonstrators into a second line of soldiers who were waiting to make arrests .
Demonstrators reported that soldiers showed no discrimination with their firing , shooting directly at the faces of the protestors , and no discrimination in their arrests , trying to arrest even journalists .

Several serious injuries were sustained .
Imad Rizka , approximately 37 years of age , from Yaffa , was shot in the forehead with a tear gas canister .
He was taken away immediately to Ramallah Hospital by ambulance .
His condition is unknown at the time of writing .
Rizka is well - known in Bil’in , as he comes to the village every Friday to demonstrate .
Soldiers fired a great deal of tear gas from both sides of the fence .
Demonstrators were forced to retreat , but among those who remained , several were arrested .
Soldiers crossed the fence and advanced well into the demonstrators ’ territory , grabbing five demonstrators .
Those arrested were a Palestinian journalist Muheeb Barghouti ; an Israeli journalist , an elderly Palestinian man named Abu Sadi ; Israeli activist Tali Shapiro ; and two internationals from Liverpool , England , who were visiting Bil ’in as part of a twin cities partnership .
The soldiers took them away in between firing rounds of tear gas to drive the protestors back .
Additional injuries are as follows :
One demonstrator from Italy , struck in the back by a tear gas canister ; an Italian demonstrator who was shot in the arm with a new type of weapon ; an Israeli activist ; Um Samarra , 45 , from Bil ’in , who was hit in the leg by a tear gas canister ; Haitham al - Khatib , cameraman , who was slightly injured ; a Palestinian woman from Bethlehem who sustained a leg injury ; and a Palestinian journalist named Abbas al - Momni .
Today ’s protestors showed great tenacity in the face of tear gas , injuries , and arrests , and an especially large number of demonstrators remained at the fence , facing the soldiers .
The demonstration lasted an especially long period of time , as demonstrators refused to completely leave the area , and returned several times during lulls between waves of tear gas .
Update from the Popular Struggle Coordination Committee :
Emad Rezqa was hit in the forehead by an aluminum tear gas projectile shot directly at him by Israeli soldiers during the weekly anti-Wall demonstration in Bil ’in earlier today .
He suffered a fractured skull and brain hemorrhage .
Rezqa is currently hospitalized at the Hadassa Ein Karem hospital in Jerusalem .
The demonstration Rezqa was injured in concluded the three - day International Bil ’in Conference on Popular Struggle , and was attended by hundreds of people .
Five demonstrators were arrested during the protest .
The march , which commenced at the village ’s mosque after the midday prayer , was attacked with tear gas some 30 seconds after reaching the gate in the Wall , despite the fact that it was entirely peaceful .
The gas forced most of the participants to retreat back towards the village , but a smaller group managed to stay by the gate , chanting and shouting slogans .
A few minutes after , a group of soldiers began firing a second round of tear gas projectiles , this time directly at the demonstrators from a distance of about 30 meters .
Rezqa was hit and quickly evacuated to the Ramallah hospital with blood gushing from his forehead .
He was transferred to the Hadassa Ein Karem hospital after being x-rayed and diagnosed as suffering a broken skull .
Following Rezqa ’s injury , soldiers invaded Bil ’in through the gate in the Wall and arrested four protesters who were staging a sit - in some hundred meters away from the Wall , as well as a journalist who was next to them .
Another demonstrator was similarly injured today during a demonstration in the village of Nabi Saleh .
The protester was hit in the head with a tear gas projectile shot directly at him after the Army invaded the village even before the demonstration began .
In Ni’ilin , roughly 300 people demonstrated in solidarity with the villages political prisoners .
The demonstration was attended by two PLC members from the Change and Reform party – Mahmoud Ramahi and Fadhel Saleh , who joined the protest today following Ramahi ’s statement in support of the popular struggle last Wednesday during the Bil ’in conference .
Ramahi and Slaeh ’s participation is yet another sign of the recent expansion of the popular struggle and the momentum the movement is gaining in the Palestinian street .
Where does spying fit in a drug company budget ?
Is n’t Big Pharma always complaining that the cost of their research warrants high drug prices ?
Is spying part of the research ?
For one company it is .
Politico broke the story that Amphastar Pharmaceuticals hired private investigators to gather information on high - ranking officials at the Food and Drug Administration in 2008 .
The company claims it was looking for evidence of any collusion between the officials and a rival company , during the approval process for an Amphastar - developed blood - clotting drug .
The story caught the attention of Senate Finance Committee chair Max Baucus who voiced outrage .
“ Pharmaceutical companies should be focusing on getting their drugs approved based on health research and science rather than wasting their resources hiring private investigators to snoop around the lives of FDA regulators and their families , ” Baucus told Politico .
( Maybe he ’s looking for a way to look tough on drug companies after the heavy criticism he came under for his role during the torturous health care debate ? )
According to documents obtained by the Senate Finance Committee , the PI ’s plan was to look into an FDA official ’s “ and her relatives and friends . ”
Plus , her “ financial status and lifestyle change since 2004 ; any entities … that [ she ] , her relatives or friends , partially own or are affiliated with in the U.S. ”
The firm conducted a similar investigation into the other official ’s life , but in both cases , found nothing .
( Not that it would be beyond belief that FDA officials collude with drug companies .
In 1989 , three FDA employees were indicted for taking bribes from drug companies . )
Still the whole bizarre story points to the sickness in the health industry that puts profits before people ’s needs .

Next Sunday , 18 April , will be Baylee Almon 's 16th birthday .
There will be a party and cakes , and her younger half - sister Bella and half - brother Brooks will be there .
A place will be set for Baylee , but she will attend in spirit only , not in body .
The day after her first birthday , on 19 April 1995 , six years before 11 September 2001 , Baylee was one of 168 people – including 19 children and babies – who died in a bomb attack on American soil .
The Alfred P Murrah building in Oklahoma City was bombed at 9.01 in the morning , as a normal working day on the Great Plains was getting under way – not by Islamic fundamentalists plotting in Afghan caves , but by a paramilitary unit of Americans who called themselves " patriots " , led by a former serviceman and 1991 Gulf war veteran , Timothy McVeigh .
McVeigh was executed in 2001 , and his principal accomplice , Terry Nichols , is serving life .
" McVeigh was one of us , " says Baylee 's mother , Aren Almon - Kok , now remarried to a military veteran of Dutch descent who was wounded in that same Gulf war .
" McVeigh was an American , like me and Baylee , " she says , " and he walked into the building and saw the daycare centre where the children played – he knew they were there .
Why did he do it ?
What was the point ?
There is no answer , and I 've always said that the reason I wanted to see him die was nothing to do with closure , because there ain't no closure .
It was so I 'd never have to hear him explain himself , and justify what he'd done . "
The fact that the 168 deaths at Oklahoma were the result of Americans killing Americans in the name of America has made the incident in some ways harder for the nation to process than 9/11 and the less complicated enemy , al - Qaida .
" It made a terrible difference that this was homegrown terrorism , " says Almon - Kok .
" It left you with nothing to trust or believe in , apart from my faith that this city did everything it could in the aftermath , and that we have a legal system which , for the most part , works .
But that does n't answer why fellow Americans wanted to come killing our kids . "
Perhaps this is why the Oklahoma bomb is not as centre stage in America 's collective memory as it should be .
When Al Gore was interviewed about the extreme right by Larry King recently , there was no mention of Oklahoma .
Coverage of last month 's arrests of militants belonging to an offshoot of the same Michigan militia that McVeigh belonged to omitted to mention the bomb , days away from its 15th anniversary .
There is extreme awkwardness around this enemy within , but also current concern about reverberations of McVeigh 's cause : war against the American government .
" What scares me , " says Kari Watkins , executive director of the Oklahoma National Memorial and museum , " is that society now is configured much as it was in 1995 .
The militias are back , there 's a language of extremism out there , of hatred against the government , threats of violence . "
Monday 19 April will mark the 15th anniversary of the bomb , but it is also the date chosen by the Tea Party , a right - wing activist organisation , for national protest , in all state capitals , against the current administration .
In Oklahoma the Tea Party has bowed to the solemnity of the date , so that two events will occur on different days : one on 15 April , howling abuse at the government , and another on 19 April solemnly honouring the lost and the survivors .
Nevertheless , there is local outrage .
" I do n't know how they dare , " says Keith Simonds , a police officer at the core of the rescue operation in 1995 , " spewing their hatred on a day of remembrance . "
No one is saying that the Tea Parties or their protest are comparable to McVeigh , " but all it takes is a few dangerous extremists out there to hear things the wrong way , " says Watkins .
The Great Plains of America 's heartland are no strangers to disaster : tornados , drought , prairie fires and of course the red plains turning to dust bowl in 1938 , causing the " Okie " exodus west , registered into epic history by John Steinbeck 's The Grapes of Wrath and the songs of Oklahoma 's greatest son , Woody Guthrie .
But by 1995 , Oklahoma City had become a reasonably but not ostentatiously prosperous state capital with an economy based on natural energy , in which the largest employers were the state and federal governments .
So there was nothing in the universe to prepare Almon - Kok , the day after Baylee 's first birthday party , for what followed .
Nor Kathleen Treanor , who lost her four - year - old daughter , Ashley Eckles , and both her parents , Luther and LeRue .
Reporting on the bombing for this newspaper , I met Treanor wandering beside the rubble on the night of the explosion , holding a picture of little Ashley , in vain hope .
There was nothing to alarm Claude Medearis , a customs officer , as he popped by the office to make a phone call – which he would never make – on his way to an appointment elsewhere .
Nothing to indicate that Florence Rogers ' meeting with her staff at the Federal Employees Credit Union savings co-operative would be disturbed and 18 of her employees killed .
The sky was deep blue above the prairie , until contaminated by a plume of black smoke at 9.01 am .
Something had been festering in the American undergrowth .
Calling themselves a militia , gatherings of extremely right - wing men ( and some women ) were crawling around the backwoods in camouflage fatigues playing war games against a loosely termed " federal government " .
Absurd , certainly , but the movement had a seriously dangerous core .
Back then I explored this group and some of its more ( preposterous ) propositions : there should be an uprising against " The New World Order " , of which the US government was a puppet ; there was a site in Nevada where the militias believed a crashed UFO had been taken , the government plotting with aliens .
The movement 's leadership in Indiana were apparently preparing for armed insurrection , and a training compound in Arizona was headed by a man Timothy McVeigh knew , William Cooper , who threatened me when I tried to visit .
In Cooper 's 1991 book , Behold a Pale Horse , he insisted that the prison transfer centre in Oklahoma City was a " concentration camp " for those resisting the New World Order of the Antichrist .
In November 1994 , on his radio station , Cooper issued a call to arms : the militias should be ready , he said , to " fight a war " within six months .
Closer to hand , at another compound called Elouhim City – visited by McVeigh – the leader of the Oklahoma militia , Robert Millar , urged his followers to " take whatever action necessary against the US government " .
A few weeks later , McVeigh and Nichols parked a rented Ryder truck packed with 2.15 tonnes of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil outside the Murrah Building , lit a fuse and walked away .
Baylee Almon had a smile like a spring daisy , and before she and the 167 others were killed by the ensuing explosion , this city of the plain was wrapped in glorious pear blossom , as it is this Eastertide , time of Resurrection in this deeply religious city , and of birth on the land beyond .
In 1995 , 19 April followed Easter Sunday by three days .
But that smiling infant was not the child the world came to know – it was the baby cradled in a fireman 's arms , lifeless , in what emerged as the enduring image of the attack .
" That photo took on its own life , " says Almon - Kok in her official video - recording at the memorial , " which was horrible for me , because after a while I could n't ever remember Baylee being alive . "
Now , says Almon - Kok , " we tried to get a handle on it in the courts , get it off of T - shirts and things , but we were turned down because the judge said Baylee was not a public figure before the attack " – thereby not protected by privacy laws .
" If she 'd been Michael Jordan , we'd have been OK , " says her husband , Stan Kok .
" That is not my child , in the picture , " insists Almon - Kok .
" My child was a beautiful little girl who loved to play . "
But the picture was not the only obstacle on Almon - Kok 's road of reckoning .
" People kept saying : ' She 's in paradise , a better place ' , and I said ' NO , she should be here with me ' .
Others asked : ' Why were you a single mother ?
Who 's the father ? ' "
There was even " a weirdo in California who became obsessed with Baylee , sent letters to her grave and moved to Oklahoma to be ' near her ' .
He knew where we lived " .
The family took a court injunction to ban the grave - stalker from the state of Oklahoma .
Aren Almon was lucky to meet a fine man in Stan Kok , who says of these supplementary tribulations : " I 've got to the point when nothing surprises me any more , and that 's a sad world , when nothing surprises you . "
But of all the endurances , says Almon - Kok , none struck harder than " people asking me why I left my child in a nursery in a federal building .
I said I expected my daughter to be safe in a federal building . "
And it was this which took Mrs Almon - Kok on a remarkable crusade : to ensure the installation of reinforced , shatterproof glass in all federal nurseries and eventually all federal buildings .
In September 2000 , President Bill Clinton signed into law congressional bill number HR 4159 , better known as Baylee 's Law , which ensured glass protection that might have saved an incalculable number of lives on 19 April .
" I suppose I believe that bad things happen for a reason , " says Almon - Kok , " and that my loss could save other lives . "
So that " when 9/11 happened , I watched those people carrying their pictures of their loved ones , looking , and thought : ' I 've so been there . ' "
But it was only later , visiting New York and Washington , that staff from the Pentagon came to thank Almon - Kok for their lives : " Their section of the Pentagon , near where the plane came in , was the only section where the new glass had been installed . "
But Almon - Kok 's grief is now more private , at home near Choctaw , on open prairie .
" Things had to change for me and the children .
Bella was used to being with me on the road campaigning – eating at 2 am meant nothing to her .
She grew up climbing all over furniture in the White House .
But Brooks wanted to be in bed at 8 o'clock , and that calmed things down for all of us .
Some people kept what happened from their children , but I wanted them to know .
They feel her presence : Brooks had a project at school called I Have a Dream , and he wrote : ' My wish is that Baylee did n't have to die . ' "
By 1995 , 23 - year - old Catherine Alaniz had tried her level best to recover from her husband 's death in the 1991 Gulf War .
When Andy Alaniz was killed by " friendly fire " on the day of the ceasefire in Iraq ( which the Pentagon initially denied ) , Catherine , aged only 19 , had been six months pregnant with her daughter , whom she called Andee .
Inevitably , her mother Sharon and father Claude , a US customs agent , had been bedrocks of strength for the young widow .
On the morning of 19 April Catherine took a call : " Did you feel that ? "
There had been an " explosion downtown " : the caller mentioned the federal courthouse .
" My dad worked downtown , " Catherine recalls thinking , with a shudder .
" I called his office number , but it was switched through to Houston , like happens at night , even though it was after 9 am . "
Catherine rushed to her parents ' house , to find " my mom sitting on the floor , rocking back and forth with the phone in her hand , waiting for my dad to call .
I sat down next to her , wrapped my arms around her and I told her , ' Dad is going to be OK .
God would n't do this to both of us . ' "
It took several days for both women to learn that another husband and father , aged only 41 , had now been lost .
" Evidence had to be collected , " says Catherine .
" Then a woman in hospital who 'd survived , her name was Priscilla , told us dad had gone by the office to make a call .
That he'd been there at the time of the bomb .
So we knew , but not officially .
Next day , we went to the funeral of the other customs officer killed , Paul Ice , and the pastor said , ' Hope for the best ' , but we already knew , and next day it was confirmed . "
" I 've thought this through , " says Catherine , " and I 've decided that the only reason God would take my husband would be so I could help when Mom lost hers .
Mom wanted to get involved immediately , in the committees , and the trial , to separate herself , emotionally . "
The trial of Timothy McVeigh in Denver , and the long road to his execution was a Calvary for the victims and survivors .
At one point , the judge ruled that victims could not observe the proceedings if they wanted to make impact statements in the event of a guilty verdict .
As McVeigh neared his execution , media developed a grotesque fascination with him .
Gore Vidal corresponded with the mass murderer , and a book came to be ghost - written in which McVeigh dubbed the dead children " collateral damage " and those he had bereaved " the woe - is - me crowd " .
For Catherine Alaniz , the trial was at times too much : " McVeigh sitting there , smirking at us , and we not being allowed to cry , show emotion or wear buttons and ribbons " , in guidance from the judge .
" Sometimes I had to leave the courtroom .
But I stayed on in Denver with Mom and got involved in a local Catholic church , making hundreds of ham and cheese sandwiches for the homeless .
And they had a programme visiting people dying of Aids , and I met a man , a Hispanic man , who was dying and I hugged him and he said he had n't been hugged for years – it turned out he was from Oklahoma City . "
Of course , there was also downtime for the bereaved families to talk : with each other , with survivors and with those who had rescued them .
Police officer Keith Simonds was among them , anxious to give his impact statement after the verdict .
Officer Simonds of the Oklahoma Swat team had clocked on for duty at 7 am on 19 April 1995 and was answering a call north of the city when he heard the explosion , saw the plume of smoke and rows of his colleagues ' cars parked near the federal building .
He took a radio call " from the east side of the building : ' We 've got wounded here , ' it said .
' I 'm in the basement .
You need to shut off the water , it 's flooding down here . ' "
After failing to persuade a fireman to accompany him or give up a flashlight , Simonds descended into the water : " It was a wreckage , the whole thing had come down , and we were crawling over debris to our victim , a lady called Sharon Littlejohn , trapped .
Tyres were exploding , the water rising , and I said to my colleague , you take the legs , I 'll take the upper torso .
The water had been ankle - deep , now it was knee - deep .
As we reached the surface I told her , ' Can you see the light , ma'am ?
It 's going to be OK ' , and her arm suddenly hit me – I 'd been holding onto exposed bone . "
Officer Simonds ' rescue of Ms Littlejohn became another iconic photo - image of that day . " [ But ]
I had to keep working , I had to keep going , " says Simonds , unaware then that the picture had been taken .
" I was walking through the children 's playground , that 'd become a morgue – it was real hard that where the children played was where they were now laid out dead , in that biddy playground . "
During his incursions into the building , he said , " I saw an officer carrying a girl with a white dress with roses on it .
I thought ' that 's a good omen ' , and that she was alive .
Later , I realised it was a white dress with blood on it , and she was dead . "
Officer Simonds was told by prosecutors in the McVeigh trial that he should not give his impact testimony : " The judge and jury had heard so much , it might have backfired , they told me .
As a police officer , I understood .
As a man , I was pissed .
So I really wanted to give my statement in the Nichols trial . "
Ready to do so , and on the plane back to Denver for the Nichols trial , a young lady two rows ahead of Simonds was trying to get volunteers for a Christmas party for the homeless being organised by a church near the courthouse .
" I thought she 'd never stop , " recalls Simonds .
" What about some of you officers helping out ? " suggested the young woman .
" Next day , " recalls the police officer , we went to a teahouse , and the same lady told me , ' We 'll make sure you get to do your testimony ' , and I did . "
There was something about her , thought Officer Simonds , and the feeling was mutual .
Her name was Catherine Alaniz , now Simonds : the rescue cop had met the woman he would before long make his wife .
Home for the Simondses and their merged families is now a house in the Oklahoma suburb of Noble – a household of chattering teenage girls and visiting older brothers , grace before dinner , gazebo in the garden running down to a creek and a cabinet in the sitting room in tribute to the lost men in Catherine 's life , and the officer 's bravery that day .
" We live in this world of quick fixes , " says Catherine , " but there 's no such thing .
You can't plan when the loss will get you .
There 's no reason why the 15th anniversary should be any easier or harder than the 5th , or the 14th . "
Keith Simonds , when he is not on the beat , protecting dignitaries or riding his Harley - Davidson , gives classes to children on the impact – and avoidance – of violence .
" I tell them my story and tell them to report violence : I tell them if the third man in the plot , name of Fourrier , had told the police what McVeigh and Nichols were up to , I would n't be here today .
I tell 'em to watch for gangs , to do sports or clubs or cheerleading instead ; I tell even the baddest of them : it 's OK to have feelings . "
" The thing I cannot explain to myself , " says Catherine , " is that it was an American who did this , who had walked by the children he killed .
You lose your false hope that it cannot happen here .
This was n't someone from the Middle East – an American did this to us , and it can happen again . "
There was something unique about Oklahoma City 's response to the bombing , which one sensed immediately at the time .
The Okies love where they live with good reason : theirs is probably the least pretentious city in the world .
They have down - to - earth decency , a rugged decorum , easy - going diligence .
These characteristics came into play in the hour of horror , loss and need .
Ted Wilson , chaplain to the fire department , recalls the rota of fast food chains and local pizza joints providing endless free meals for rescue workers and the vigils of those who hoped for news of loved ones , often in vain .
He remembers round tables of local business donating cash for all reasons .
" If word went out that they needed batteries at the site , " he says , " a truckload of batteries would arrive . "
Rescue workers from out of town would return to their camp beds to find their clothes anonymously washed and ironed .
People literally gave the shoes off their feet ; local TV became an emergency needs swap - shop , often having to appeal to citizens to hold back as blood donation banks became saturated .
The aftermaths of outrages such as 9/11 , Beslan or Srebrenica are characterised by grating and grated nerves – friction , even – between the differently traumatised bereaved , survivors and rescue workers .
The different wounds cut so deep , and so unforgivingly to the individuals affected , that often these constituencies , though bonded by the same horror , are as divided as they are united by raw emotion and grievous loss .
" It was n't easy at first , " says Catherine Simonds , " People would say to me , ' Well , I lost a child ' , and I 'd think , ' Well , my dad was my grandma 's baby . ' "
Almost uniquely , Oklahoma has suceeded in bringing these people together into what Rashell Hammons , the mother of children who survived – faced by those whose children did not – calls " an extended family " .
This is a far more formidable and singular achievement than it will appear when the bereaved , survivors and rescue workers gather together tomorrow week , and it did not happen by accident .
The anniversary commemorations are held at the Oklahoma National Memorial , a place most of the bereaved and survivors say they love , and in which they feel at home , helped , comforted if not healed .
" I love it , " says Catherine Simonds , " it is very , very beautiful . "
In a time such as ours of much thought and debate over what memorials and monuments should represent and achieve , this site sets a gold standard .
It is unrivalled anywhere .
The Oklahoma memorial is in part set on the gaping space left by the Murrah building , but includes some of its jagged , incinerated walls .
There are 168 empty bronze chairs set on a lawn , each engraved with a name , their bases illuminated during darkness , so that the chairs of the dead float on beacons of light .
At either end are huge " Gates of Time " marking 9.01 , the last moment of the city 's innocence , and 9.03 , " the moment we were changed forever " , says the guidebook .
This place is always open , and the bereaved come often , as do survivors – there is always someone to tell their story to a visitor .
Passing teenagers instinctively switch off their boom boxes ; the 24 - hour toilets are always clean .
" It 's not a cemetery , where people come to mourn , it is a place to remember and to learn , " says director Kari Watkins .
" A memorial should be beautiful , it should be a place that 's always open , 24 hours , at its best for anyone who lost a family member , or even just those passing on I - 40 who come by to look . "
The space is quite a lesson to post - 9/11 New York , whose memorial committees have serially visited .
Inside , the Oklahoma museum is a journey from the moment of normality at 9.01 am , through the explosion , chaos , claustrophobia of entrapment , the rescue operation , arrests and aftermath – all narrated by the videotaped testimony of living bereaved and survivors , and ending with redemptive light and a window overlooking the chairs of the lost .
The driving forces behind the memorial , Watkins and her visitors ' services director Joanne Riley ( who spends as much of her time coordinating the survivors and bereaved ) , decided that their project would in itself become part of the process that brought those people together .
As a result , opposite the chairs across a reflecting pool , the " Survivors ' Tree " , an American elm that miraculously survived the bombing , remains , surrounded by the " Rescuers Orchard " , smaller trees literally rushing towards it .
Involved from the beginning was Florence Rogers , chief executive officer at the Federal Employees Credit Union , a co-operative banking system .
That morning , in preparation for an audit of her bank , she called a meeting for 8.30 in her office on the third floor .
" I remember to this very day a girl called Claudette Meek saying : ' Look at all the primary colours we 're wearing today , we look like a basket of Easter eggs . '
So I remembered what they were wearing , and had no idea how important that would be when it came to indentifying the bodies . "
One of which was that of Claudette Meek .
At 9.01 , says Rogers , " I had just read an item off the list and turned – and bang – I could see clearly through the far wall .
The floor had gone clean away , down into what we called the pit , leaving me alone on 18in of floor that had held .
I know it sounds stupid , but I thought ' Oh my God , this is like a bad movie , and when it 's all over , I get out of here . '"
Rogers was rescued , through a window , but that was the beginning of her grief .
" They would bring me the purses , a girl called Robin Huff 's – it contained ultrasound photographs of the baby she was going to have .
Her little husband was so sad to see them ; he was a man who had grown up with my boys , since cub scouts .
I had 33 employees and I lost 18 of them .
They were my girls , my family .
Every Christmas , they would come here for a party – champagne and presents .
That 's when I miss them all , but I can't grieve for 18 people at once – each of them has their day .
Something will happen , like one day I found a Santa 's sleigh up there on the shelf , and that was Claudette 's day .
One day I saw a girl just like Sonia , eating a donut like she did , and that was Sonia 's day . "
Also up on the third floor that morning , " where my bank was " , was Ted Wilson , pastor at Grand Boulevard Baptist church and part - time chaplain to the Oklahoma Fire Department , now ministering full - time to fire officers who , he says , " are still coming , after 15 years , suddenly traumatised , their brains finally processing this information , after all this time " .
Wilson is also a qualified intermediate paramedic , and objected to " the bodies of the children being laid out in their playground – a bad omen for later .
They said they had to be close by the building , but we did move 'em to a parking lot . "
Before long , Wilson had " gotten in through a skylight to be working to release a trapped woman , still alive , on the third floor where my bank was .
I was working with a tall state trooper , and the scare came for a second bomb and for us to evacuate the building .
The trooper said he was n't leaving the lady , and I said , ' Well , if you 're not going , I ai n't either . '
So we kind of had the place to ourselves – and I located the lady 's purse on top of the desk .
Now there 's two things a lady needs to be accounting for , her hair and her purse .
Well , her hair was pretty messed up , but I said : " Ma'am , you need n't worry ' bout your purse , and you need n't worry about yourself either . '
We became friends after she was released from hospital , Nancy Ingrams by name – she passed away just last year . "
Wilson 's job quickly changed to that of counselor and chaplain , and has not changed since .
" I 'm treating guys now , 15 years on , who 've been treading water all that time and it suddenly hits .
They were working for eight hours through rubble to reach a victim who has died .
And if you do that , you personalise them on the way .
You find their crucifix , their purse , pictures of their children , personal items .
You are spending time with that dead person .
You 're saying : ' I must rescue the kids , but please do n't let me be the one to find them . '
You 're finding body parts , and what we are saying is you have to think of it as reconstitution of a person , you 're scraping body matter , but you 're not a ditch digger .
We tell them they have done the best they can to restore as much of that person back to their family as was possible . "
On Monday week , 19 April , the national Tea Party protests will be held across America , venting anger at the Federal government .
In Oklahoma City , however , their protest will be held four days earlier , so as not to coincide with the memorial at what was the site of the federal government building – almost an admission by the Tea Party that they are playing with fire .
" They 'll say they 're coming here to protest Obama 's health care programme , " says Keith Simonds , " but that 's not what it is .
They 're here to spew their hatred , vomiting their political agenda .
How dare they come here ? "
" One purpose of this memorial , " says Kari Watkins , " is to teach the impact of violence .
On Easter Monday , our biggest effort this year becomes law , against considerable opposition : that the story of the bomb be entered into the school curriculum for the state of Oklahoma .
We need to teach this story , especially right now , when in America there are a lot of the same movements that were around in 1995 , there 's a similar mood , a polarisation .
Look , no one wants the government on their backs – who does ?
- but all this alarms me , and we must work against it by teaching the consequences of violence against the language of violence . "
The day of Watkins ' interview , nine people appeared in court in Detroit , members of an offshoot of McVeigh 's Michigan militia called Hutaree , charged with " seditious conspiracy " to kill a police officer and then bomb the funeral cortege , in order to spark insurrection akin to that sought by McVeigh .
The previous week , congresswoman Louise Slaughter , who voted for President Barack Obama 's health care reform , received one of many threats of violence to elected representatives , this one pledging that snipers would " kill the children of the members who voted for health care reform " .
Such language makes the blood run cold in Oklahoma ; and the fact that most people in Oklahoma are deeply conservative makes the irony of both the bomb and their disgust at this language all the more cogent .
A warm evening breeze strokes the garden of empty chairs , while a late sun illuminates their bases against the opacity of oncoming dusk .
As twilight falls , so does a haunted serenity , and silence – but for evening birdsong and the hoot and rattle of a freight train passing through town and out across the plains .
The memorial 's lights come up in phases , so that first the great Gates of Time shine out , reflected in the shallow pool between them , then the chairs of each person killed appear to hover on lamplight .
In the second row of chairs , indicating the building 's second floor , 15 chairs are smaller than the others , commemorating the children .
At the end , slightly apart , is that inscribed " Miss Baylee Almon " , whose mother Aren 's lovely face nevertheless wears the scars of grief until dispelled by a smile , at a joke by Bella or Brooks , or a memory of Baylee alive .
Recently , Bella choked on some beef jerky and Aren was worried she 'd been alone , but Bella said : " It 's OK , Mom , Baylee was here . "
On Monday week , Bella will , for the second time , read out the names of the children killed in 1995 , in reverse alphabetical order , so that the sister she never met , but whose birthday she will have celebrated the previous day , will come last .
And there , standing at a distance from the others , is the chair in honour of customs agent Claude Arthur Medearis , for whose daughter the bomb was a very different kind of fire from that which killed her first husband – though also from an American military man .
" My husband had driven a Bradley military vehicle in the Gulf war , " says Catherine Simonds .
" Timothy McVeigh also drove a Bradley vehicle in the Gulf war .
My husband died , but McVeigh lived .
Then he came to Oklahoma City four years later and killed my dad .
What am I supposed to think about that ? "
Mandelson driven around Alps in classic Ferrari of Rothschild heir at the centre of £ 500 m dinner with an oligarch
After the unrewarding task of trying to keep Labour in power , Lord Mandelson is no doubt relieved to be back in the old routine – courting the rich and famous .
The former Business Secretary is pictured in the passenger seat of a black open - top Ferrari Daytona Spider , worth at least £ 250,000 .
At the wheel is his friend , 38 - year - old banking heir Nat Rothschild , who was offering hospitality to the Labour peer at one of his chalets in Klosters , in the Swiss Alps .
The picture is proof , if it were needed , that Lord Mandelson has a taste for the kind of high life that would otherwise be beyond his purse .
Rich friends , fast cars : Lord Mandelson enjoys a spin in the passenger seat of friend Nat Rothschild 's Ferrari Daytona Spider in Klosters , Switzerland
Of course , now he has departed Westminster following the general election defeat , the chance of making his own fortune beckons again .
Yesterday there were reports that he could be the next chief executive of the troubled petroleum giant BP .
Anji Hunter , Tony Blair 's former gatekeeper , has previously served as the company 's communications chief .
Even if the prospects of the peer taking on such a time - consuming job were being played down last night , his unrivalled contacts in the international business world would come in useful .
Pleading innocent : Lord Mandelson says he was not aware of the purpose of a dinner between him , Mr Rothschild and a Russian oligarch - which led to the loss of British manufacturing jobs
During his Klosters sojourn , Lord Mandelson 's BlackBerry mobile phone was constantly in use as he kept abreast with his contacts in the worlds of business and politics .
Repeatedly the 56 - year - old could be seen walking in dandelion - infested parkland near his host 's home with papers and a jotting pad .
Old habits , like expensive tastes , die hard .
Lord Mandelson has offered a remarkable defence to Daily Mail revelations about a deal which netted a Russian oligarch friend hundreds of millions of pounds , but cost British manufacturing jobs .
Alpine getaway : Lord Mandelson clearly quickly acclimatises to the expensive lifestyle of his rich friends
At the weekend , the Mail told how the then EU Trade Commissioner was flown in Mr Rothschild 's private jet on an ' unplanned ' and unofficial trip to Moscow .
There the pair attended a small , private dinner held by their mutual friend , the controversial Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska , who is barred from entering the U.S .
Deripaska had arranged the meal in January 2005 to seal negotiations for the £ 250 million sale of two aluminium plants to the American metals giant Alcoa .
A similar sum was to be invested in the sites .
Sources told the Mail that the Americans ' had concerns ' over the level of tariffs that would be imposed on the aluminium the plants exported into the EU .
Lord Mandelson was in a position to allay those fears .
Over the next three and a half years he was in charge of EU trade and these tariffs were slashed .
Alcoa closed its
Welsh production plant shortly after the deal , with the loss of hundreds of jobs .
Industry analysts also blamed the deal for undercutting other British and European plants which also closed .
An Alcoa agent , who is being investigated by U.S. authorities for alleged corruption in the Middle East , donated thousands of pounds to a think - tank Lord Mandelson headed .
But yesterday Lord Mandelson claimed he had no idea of the purpose of the dinner , until the Mail story appeared .
He said he was simply ' waiting for another appointment ' when he sat at table with Mr Deripaska , Mr Rothschild and the Americans .
In a letter to the Mail , Lord Mandelson said ' nothing could be further from the truth ' than that he had acted in an ' inappropriate manner ' .
From Saturday 's Daily Mail
He added : ' In respect of the dinner with Rusal and Alcoa executives , I only attended the engagement briefly as I was waiting for another appointment .
' I had no knowledge of or any involvement in a transaction between both companies .
Given that the dinner was being held , as I understand it now , to mark the completion of negotiations that had already taken place I fail to understand how I could have influenced the deal .
' With regards to the decision by the EU to reduce tariffs , the Director - General for Trade in the European Commission , David O'Sullivan , confirmed … that I made no personal intervention to support the commercial interests of Mr Deripaska . '
In the past , Lord Mandelson has been opaque about how long he has known Mr Deripaska .
He even suggested through a spokesman that they had first met no earlier than 2006 .
Two years ago Lord Mandelson 's holiday at the Rothschild family villa on the island of Corfu ended in ugly headlines , followed by controversy and claim and counter claim .
During the summer of 2008 Lord Mandelson and Mr Deripaska met and dined together after the latter 's super yacht was moored off the Mediterranean isle .
At the same party , hosted by Nat Rothschild , it emerged that another guest was George Osborne – now the Chancellor of the Exchequer .
Later both men were accused of briefing against each other over what had been said during the private party .
Undeterred , Lord Mandelson again used the Corfu base in the summer of 2009 when he effectively acted as Prime Minister while Gordon Brown took a break .
Just Cause 2 Uses Steamworks DRM
" Just Cause 2 uses Steamworks all the way , " Square Enix London Studios community manager revealed to Shacknews commentor acare 84 through the magic of Twitter .
Steamworks integration means that developers can use Valve 's digital distribution platform Steam for such features as matchmaking , automatic game updates , downloadable content , plus server - side save and setting storage .
However , said integration also means that Steam must be installed for the game to be played , which has caused rival digital distribution outlets to not sell such titles .

Emergency ?
Call 911 -- for a small fee .
Strapped for money to hire additional police officers and firefighters , Ventura will soon charge a monthly fee for emergency calls to help pay for services .
Residents in the seaside community will pay $ 1.49 a month for emergency service access beginning May 1 .
If they choose to opt out of the plan , they will be charged $ 50 for each 911 call .
City officials stressed that the action is vital to improving public safety services .

“ Let ’s be clear , the problem is we just do n’t have enough police and firefighters , ” said City Manager Rick Cole .
“ Our whole goal is get to a place where we can respond within five minutes to life - threatening emergencies at least 90 % of the time . ”
The fee will be levied on about 158,000 residential and business land lines and cellphones in the city .
With exemptions for certain low - income residents and pay phones , Ventura hopes to raise at least $ 2.2 million annually to cover much of the cost of operating its 911 dispatch center .
The money will also be used to hire six additional police officers and three firefighters .
Currently , Ventura has 134 sworn officers and 75 fire personnel to serve a population of 107,000 .
The two public safety agencies handled nearly 55,000 emergency and 911 calls last year .

But response times have not kept pace with the city ’s growth .
Only 56 % of police responses were within five minutes ; 49 % for fire personnel .
“ It does n’t really matter how well the call center works , we do n’t have the people to respond to the calls , ” said Deputy Mayor Bill Fulton .
“ We thought this was the best way to give the 911 system permanent funding . ”
Councilman Neal Andrews , who cast the lone vote against the fee this week , said the panel should not have authorized it without a public vote .

“ The 911 service is a core part of our public safety program ; it ’s not something people should have to pay for extra .
It ’s not optional , ” Andrew said .
“ The public has a right to expect access to emergency services on demand -- when they need it , without encumbrances of any kind . ”
Don Facciano , president of the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn. , agreed
“ Our main point is that it ’s a tax , ” he said .
“ So just call it a tax and put it before voters and let it be judged on its own merits . ”

Ventura is believed to be the only Southern California city to adopt such a charge .
But similar 911 fees are in place in several Northern California communities , including Santa Cruz , San Jose and San Francisco .
Ventura City Atty .
Ariel Pierre Calonne said that allowing residents to opt out of paying the monthly fee should protect the new ordinance from lawsuits .
“ I think we ’ll be successful if challenged , ” Calonne said .
A “ good Samaritan ” exemption in the ordinance will waive the $ 50 per call charge if someone who opted out contacts 911 to assist someone else .
Businesses with multiple phone lines will be charged for three phones per trunk line .

Meanwhile , Fire Chief Mike Lavery said that while he welcomes three extra personnel , his department is about 25 positions below where it should be .
“ We went too long , almost 20 years , without adding any new people , ” Lavery said .
“ That ’s too long not to invest in the public safety arena and to still expect to keep up . ”

Last March , my study of the effect of peak oil on U.S. imports had brought Mexico to the fore ( “ The Impending Oil Export Crisis ” ) .
As our # 3 source of imports , the crashing of its supergiant Cantarell field had put the future of our oil supply into serious jeopardy .
The possibility that Mexico ’s oil and gas exports to the U.S. could go to zero within seven years looked very real .
As I explained in that piece , rising domestic consumption coupled with declining supply puts an ever - tightening squeeze on imports .
I have found no evidence that policymakers are paying any attention to this critically important dynamic , but it is the very point of the peak oil spear .
Were it not for the market meltdown and recession , it would have pierced our vital organs .
Instead we felt a pinprick .
Hardly anybody realized what it really was , and most ran off on a wild goose chase for evil oil speculators .
Now Venezuela has appeared on my radar for similar reasons … only this time we ’re really going to feel it .
Let ’s begin with a review of Mexico ’s exports .
Mexico
Shortly after publishing that article , I casually remarked to my friend and fellow energy analyst Gregor Macdonald that Cantarell ’s production could fall to under 0.5 million barrels per day ( mbpd ) by the end of the year .
I arrived at this somewhat startling conclusion by calculating the effect of its decline rate–at the time , 38 % and accelerating–on production of 0.77 mbpd in January , down precipitously from its 2.1 mbpd peak in 2003 .
Gregor ’s recent data sleuthing on Cantarell found its production in December 2009 was 0.527688 mbpd , just a hair above my estimate .
To update the data on Mexico , it ’s now our # 2 source of imported petroleum because Saudi Arabia has fallen from # 2 to # 4 .
As of November 2009 ( the latest data available ) the U.S. imported 1.08 mbpd of crude and finished petroleum products from Mexico .
Its exports to the U.S. peaked at 1.46 mbpd in 2004 , the same year as its production peaked .
Net exports ( production minus consumption ) fell to 1.06 mbpd in 2008 .
For the years 2005 to 2008 , Mexico ’s exports to the U.S. declined by 0.51 mbpd .
In 2010 , supply is expected to fall to 2.5 mbpd–nearly half a million barrels per day less than 2009 .
Mexico nationalized its petroleum operations in 1938 in a constitutional amendment and handed over total control to the state oil company Petróleos Mexicanos ( PEMEX ) , with predictable results .
Oil now provides more than 40 % of the country ’s revenues , which have been used to pay for a vast array of public services and line the pockets of the oligarchy while starving investment in both upstream activities ( new oil supply ) and downstream ( finished products ) .
Consequently , Mexico ’s oil reserves have decreased by more than 75 % in two decades ( owing partly to the correction of a previous , ridiculously inflated figure ) , production has begun to decline , and exports are falling fast .
It now imports $ 4.5 billion a year worth of gasoline , $ 10 billion a year in petrochemicals , and 25 % of its natural gas , mostly from the U.S .
This despite having nearly 13 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and more than 50 billion barrels of ( unproven ) reserve potential .
Mexico would be in a far better position , were it not for its hostile stance on foreign participation .
PEMEX simply lacks the technical ability to develop its more difficult , remaining resources –particularly deepwater .
Venezuela
As of November , the U.S. was importing 0.9 mbpd from Venezuela , making it our # 3 source .
Its exports to the U.S. peaked at 1.8 mbpd in 1997 , the same year as its production peaked .
Net exports ( production minus consumption ) have fallen 38 % from the 1997 peak of 3.1 mbpd to 1.9 mbpd in 2008 .
Venezuela ’s oil exports to the U.S. have been declining markedly since 2004 , after a long period of relative stability .
From 2004 through 2009 , Venezuelan petroleum exports fell 0.7 mbpd .
Like Mexico , Venezuela is endowed with enormous energy resources , and could be producing at a far higher level .
Estimates of its oil reserves range from 153 billion barrels of certified proven , to 513 billion barrels technically recoverable in the USGS ’
January estimate , to 1.5 trillion barrels in offshore potential if you believe the effervescent Dr. Marcio Mello of Brazil .
Most of it is heavy oil , a low grade which must be upgraded to synthetic crude .
And like Mexico , President Hugo Chavez has exiled the Western oil companies who might have made the investment to bring those resources to market .
A Nation in Free Fall
The good times rolled for Chavez in the first years after his election in 1998 .
His socialist programs to rebuild the country and raise its the standard of living were popular , but expensive , and soon began to fail under the crush of declining energy supply .
Oil revenues make up 90 % of Venezuela ’s foreign earnings , so its dependence on oil exports is extreme .
Billions of dollars in profits from the national oil company , Petroleos de Venezuela SA ( PDVSA ) were diverted to welfare programs and into the pockets of oligarchs , while investment in future petroleum and power supply languished .
The precipitous drop in oil prices since mid-2008 only compounded the revenue shortfall .
Oil production has fallen 25 % since Chavez was elected , and a long , devastating drought has cut into its hydropower supply , of which 73 % comes from the massive Guri Dam .
Chavez responded by nationalizing most of its petroleum operations and its grid in 2007 .
In 2009 another 76 oil services companies on the Maracaibo Lake were taken over .
The projects now sit abandoned , waiting for PDVSA to compensate the displaced operators and put them back into operation .
Almost half a million hectares of land were seized in 2009 , with the rationalization that it was underused .
Measures to counter the declining hydro supply have been implemented in a haphazard fashion , resulting in frequent , unscheduled blackouts , including seven national blackouts since 2007 .
Malls and government offices have had their hours of operation cut , and water rationing has been imposed .
“ Some people sing in the bath for half an hour , ” Chávez cried at a cabinet session in October .
“ What kind of communism is that ?
Three minutes is more than enough ! ”
In January , a wave of public protest erupted , prompting Chavez to implement a rapid series of desperate measures .
Rolling blackouts were imposed in the capital city of Caracas .
After a few days of protests , Chavez lifted the blackouts and fired the electricity minister .
Blackouts are expected to be reinstated in an effort to keep hydro reservoir levels from falling to the point of collapse .
A recent report gave the power shortage a paradoxical twist , indicating that power from one of the state refineries may have to be diverted to the grid , cutting distillate output by 200,000 barrels per day or more .
This will result in less heating oil for China , who will make up the loss by burning more coal .
Chavez devalued Venezuela ’s bolivar currency by half , and nationalized a chain of French - owned supermarkets over alleged price gouging .
He ordered cutbacks in the operation of state - run steel and aluminum manufacturing operations , which account for up to 20 % of the country ’s power demand .
This week he turned to Cuba for help on how to cope with the power shortage , since it has been through similar problems .
The island nation is providing tens of thousands of energy - efficient lightbulbs and cloud - seeding technology to Venezuela .
Last weekend , he forced six television channels off the air for failing to broadcast one of his speeches ( up to six hours in length ) in a continuation of his campaign for “ communicational hegemony . ”
Since December , all radio and television networks are required by law to broadcast his speeches live , whenever he chooses to make one .
Nationwide student marches have been met by troops armed with rubber bullets , and at least two deaths have been recorded .
Chavez has said he ’s prepared to take “ radical measures ” should the situation worsen , begging the unsettling question of what could be more radical than what he has already done .
Looking East , Not North
Now Chavez is turning east for help in developing his nation ’s oil and gas resources .
Recent agreements include a $ 20 billion joint venture with Russia to develop the Junin 6 field in the Orinoco oil belt , with a potential top production rate of 450,000 barrels per day .
China has agreed to build a refinery and develop the Orinoco heavy oil fields , and Venezuela has guaranteed 560,000 barrels per day to China this year .
Venezuela has launched its first major auction for drilling rights in more than a decade , for access to areas east of the existing operations in the Orinoco .
Developing the leases will be expensive because of their distance from the existing infrastructure , and winning bidders are expected to make offers in the $ 10 billion - plus range including early payments of at least $ 1 billion , financing plans , and commitments to build the necessary roads , pipelines , ports and upgraders .
Potential bidders include Spain ’s Repsol , Japan ’s Mitsubishi , the U.K. ’s BP , and Chevron .
Given the sheer size of its resources , it ’s too soon to declare the end of Venezuela ’s glory days in the oil patch .
However it does seem likely that the new barrels it brings to market will be headed east , not north , and Western producers will have very little stake in the projects .
Chavez will put exports to the U.S. on a short path to zero the first chance he gets .
Oh Imports , Where Art Thou ?
The combined decline in imports from Mexico and Venezuela for 2005 through 2008 is 0.89 mbpd .
If the trend continues in 2009 , then over 1 mbpd will have disappeared from the U.S. import stream in the last five years–an 8 % decline from 2004 levels .
Since 2007 , the loss of production from Cantarell alone was 0.7 mbpd , but the recession cut U.S. demand by 2 mbpd , effectively masking the decline .
Which raises the question : If U.S. demand rises from here , where will those barrels come from … and how much will they cost ?
The U.S. is not only first in the world in its demand for oil , but in paying the market rate for it .
Nobody else buys 8.5 mbpd of crude at retail .
Drivers in Venezuela are still filling up for 25 cents a gallon even as their exports decline .
Mexico ’s gasoline prices are more on par with the U.S. , but its consumption has been rising steadily since 1997 and continues to cut into exports .
Saudi Arabia ’s domestic consumption is currently growing at the rate of 7 % per year , following a trend of more than three decades .
It uses a whopping 1.5 mbpd–1.8 % of total world oil supply !– to desalinate water , at the equivalent of 7 cents a gallon .
Before the OPEC cuts of 2009 , its exports to the U.S. had essentially flatlined at 1.5 mbpd since 2004 .
Exports from our # 5 source , Nigeria , have also declined , from 1.17 mbpd in 2005 to 0.98 mbpd in 2008 .
In fact , of the top five oil exporting countries to the U.S. , representing 63 % of our crude imports , only Canada posted an increase , of 0.2 mbpd .
The combined annual net oil exports from our top three exporting countries –Canada , Mexico and Venezuela–illustrate our situation :
Given the very modest increases from unconventional domestic production and Canada , the decline of imports from Mexico and Venezuela means the U.S. will be increasingly forced to depend on suppliers farther afield –the very same suppliers that China has been buying into in size .
The “ collision course with China ” that I wrote about in July 2005 has nearly reached the point of impact .
It also means that when oil prices rise again , the pain will be far greater for the U.S. than it is for our top suppliers .
Next time , the spear of declining oil exports will puncture a lung .
The oil export crisis has arrived .
We just have n’t felt it yet .
Do n't Miss : How To Deal With Peak Oil >
Liberal Democrat voters would prefer to see Nick Clegg supporting Gordon Brown – rather than David Cameron – as prime minister in the event of a hung parliament after the election , according to a new survey .
The ComRes poll for The Independent and ITV News shows that 46 per cent of Liberal Democrat supporters would be happy if the election resulted in a hung parliament and Mr Brown remained in Downing Street ; it found 31 per cent would be happy if Mr Cameron became prime minister in these circumstances .
The opinions of Liberal Democrat voters would be important if no party wins an overall majority on 6 May .
Mr Clegg would need the backing of his party 's MPs , leading activists and members to enter into a coalition with a minority government .
According to ComRes , the surge in support for the Liberal Democrats since Mr Clegg won last week 's first televised leaders ' debate may have peaked .
The Conservatives are ahead on 32 per cent ( up one point since The Independent on Sunday 's poll at the weekend ) , Labour on 28 per cent ( up one point ) , the Liberal Democrats also on 28 per cent ( down one ) , and the other parties on 12 per cent ( down one ) .
These figures would leave Labour , with 279 MPs , 47 seats short of an overall majority .
The Tories would have 245 seats and the Liberal Democrats 94 .
The volatility of the electorate is shown by a ComRes finding that more voters would favour a hung parliament with Mr Cameron as prime minister than one with Mr Brown remaining in No 10 .
Some 34 per cent would be happy with the Tory leader as prime minister in a hung parliament , and 31 per cent Mr Brown – even though the overall party ratings would leave Labour as the largest single party .
In a ray of hope for the Tories , voters would be most happy with a Conservative government ( 41 per cent ) , with 36 per cent saying they would be happy with a Labour government .
But on all four possible election outcomes tested , the public would be more unhappy than happy , confirming that the election is still wide open .
Mr Clegg continued to dominate the campaign yesterday , forcing Mr Cameron to shelve a TV election broadcast attacking Mr Brown and record a new one in the back garden of his Notting Hill home addressing the unexpected threat posed by Mr Clegg , which has alarmed the Tories .
Mr Cameron warned that a hung parliament would result in " indecision " and could leave Britain " stuck " with Mr Brown .
His aim was to seize back the " change " mantle from Mr Clegg , who will occupy the centre - stage spot in the second leaders ' debate on Thursday .
Mr Cameron admitted that the election has been " shaken up " , but argued that his " big idea " – replacing Labour 's " big government " with a " big society " – would mean " smashing apart the old politician - knows - best system " .
Both the Tories and Labour turned their fire on Liberal Democrat policies .
Mr Brown conceded that Mr Clegg was enjoying a " political honeymoon " but predicted it would be short - lived .
The Prime Minister said : " I know a little about what it means to have a short political honeymoon .
You go through these phases .
I wish him well in his . "
He criticised the Liberal Democrat plans to cut tax credits and child trust funds , and the party 's opposition to renewing the Trident nuclear weapons system .
Today Mr Brown will try to play to his strengths by unveiling a " growth manifesto " .
He will say : " The Conservatives believe that growth can happen by itself so long as government gets out of the way .
But growth does n't happen by chance .
That is the economics of yesterday .
Government is needed to pull away the barriers and obstacles that hold business back . "
Mr Clegg said it was only to be expected that the two old parties would " lash out " as soon as voters showed they were ready to choose " something different " .
He said : " The general election campaign is starting to come to life for the simple reason that a growing number of people are starting – and it is only a start – to believe , starting to hope , that we can do something different this time . "
The Liberal Democrat leader added that voters were seeing " that the old tired choices that they have been given by the old parties of the past no longer need to govern the way we run politics in the future " .
ComRes found that the Tories are in third place among women ( 27 per cent ) , while men are much more positive about them ( 37 per cent ) .
Labour is in third place in the North of England , Wales and the South - West , reflecting the surprise Liberal Democrat advance .
Mr Clegg 's party enjoys its strongest support ( 39 per cent ) among 35 - 44 year - olds and is ahead among the C1 and C2 social groups .
A crumb of comfort for the Tories is that people who decline to say how they would vote would be happiest with a Cameron - led government .
An ICM survey for The Guardian showed the Liberal Democrats ( with 30 per cent ) in second place behind the Tories ( 33 per cent ) , with Labour trailing third ( 28 per cent ) .
Newborn With Pre-Existing Condition Gets Coverage
Insurance company offers to pay for newborn caught in insurance coverage gap .
April 2 , 2010  -- Houston
Tracy made the rounds on national blogs before he was even a month old .
At 12 days old , he already had survived a rare birth defect , a feeding tube and open - heart surgery .
But his family was in a battle with an insurance company to get his surgeries covered .
His parents , Kim and Doug Tracy of Crowley , Texas , did n't have health insurance for themselves .
The Tracys said insurance agents assured them they could buy health insurance for Houston once he was born .
But then , Houston 's parents found out that the term " pre-existing condition " can apply the moment someone is born .
Doug Tracy , 39 , called his congressmen .
Then the local news media spread the word .
" People from Sweden , from Australia were calling me , " Doug Tracy said .
Soon , Darren Rodgers the C.E.O. of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Texas called Tracy too .
Within a few days of negotiations , Tracy said he had a letter from Rodgers that promised to pay for Houston 's surgery and offered him insurance coverage .
" I feel thankful and I feel blessed , " said Tracy .
Following is the story of the Tracy family 's confusing struggle to get health insurance for Houston when his mother and father were not already covered .
The First Sign of Something Wrong
" When he came out , he made one little cry and he did n't really cry much , " said Doug Tracy .
Tracy cut the umbilical cord and watched the hospital staff clean his son .
But before his wife , Kim Tracy , 36 , could touch their son , doctors got worried .
" We could tell there was something wrong by the way they [ the doctors ] were acting , " Doug Tracy said .
Houston 's skin was n't turning a shade of pink like most newborns because , somehow , his blood was n't getting enough oxygen .
Doctors rushed Houston , with Doug Tracy riding by his side , in an ambulance to Cook Children 's Medical Center in Fort Worth , Texas .
Within hours , the Tracys would learn their son was born with a heart condition called d-transposition of the great arteries , meaning the aorta and pulmonary artery are transposed where they should meet the heart .
Doctors wanted to operate within days to save his life .
" In Houston 's case , he would not have survived had he not gotten the care , " said Dr. Steve Muyskens , a pediatric cardiologist at Cook Children 's Medical Center who treated Houston .
" Most children with this [ would ] have a demise within days to months . "
Muyskens said that with the aorta and pulmonary artery switched , the system creates two separate pools of blood -- a small amount that travels from the heart to the lungs and back to the heart , and another pool of blood that travels from the body to the heart and back out without ever reaching the lungs for oxygen .
" The red blood just circles on one side and blue blood circles on the other , " Muyskens said .
All of Houston 's organs , including his heart , would soon die without red blood .
Even if doctors could stabilize a child with Houston 's heart condition , they would only have a short window to operate .
One Surgery Could Save a Life
" The gold standard is surgery -- arterial switch procedure , " said Dr. Daphne Hsu , division chief of pediatric cardiology at Montefiore Medical Center in New York .
" The procedure has to be done before the child is one month old because then the heart starts to change and adjust to the circulation , and the pressure in the heart drops . "
Houston was born on Monday , March 15 .
By Friday that week , doctors operated successfully .
Muyskens expects
Houston will have a normal life and likely wo n't even need medications .
" Everybody 's nicknamed him Rocky around there , because he 's a fighter , " said Tracy .
But by March 24 , the Tracy family formally heard their son was denied health insurance .
" We do n't have health coverage on ourselves because it's too expensive these days and because of the economy , " Doug Tracy said .
The Tracys are small business owners and would have to buy individual policies , which they have for their other children Cooper , 4 , and Jewel , 11 .
The family had no idea there was something wrong with Houston before he was born , Doug Tracy said .
" Prenatal , every doctor visit was perfect , his heart beat was fine , " he said .
But Tracy said he called Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas twice in preparation of Houston 's birth , and he asked if they could get a policy on his son before he was born .
" They said , ' We ca n't do that , ' because he was n't born yet , but as soon as the baby 's born go online and fill an application out , " Doug Tracy said .
He applied for Houston 's insurance March 18 , and the first month 's premium of $ 267 was charged to his credit card , he said .
" Wednesday , the 24th , is when I got a letter of decline ; they declined it the day after the [ health insurance ] bill was signed , " Doug Tracy said .
The provision in the health insurance reform act that prohibits health insurance companies from denying coverage to children with a pre-existing condition will take effect six months after the bill was signed into law this week .
Family Searches for Insurance Coverage
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas declined a phone interview with ABCNews.com about procedures to enroll newborns and their policies in light of the new health care reform act .
But the company was willing to e-mail a prepared statement .
" We share the public 's concern for this child and for uninsured children across our state .
As you may know , federal privacy laws prohibit me from releasing any information about members or potential members of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas [ BCBSTX ] , " Margaret Jarvis , senior manager of media and public relations at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas , wrote in an e-mail .
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas automatically would cover newborns of parents who already had a policy with them for 31 days , Jarvis said .
After that time , parents could opt to include their baby on their plan whether or not the child had health issues .
" For children whose parents are not BCBSTX members , who want child - only coverage , we offer individual policies , beginning at the age of 60 days , " wrote Jarvis .
" BCBSTX has spoken with the father of this child , and we are exploring all available alternative coverage options . "
Doug Tracy said his son now will have a Blue Cross and Blue Shield policy through the Texas Health Insurance Risk Pool , which will cost $ 277 a month -- $ 10 more than the premium on the policy he tried to take out for his son .
" It worked out , " he said .
" It was great . "

A California hospital plans to distribute more than 100 Apple iPads among its health care workers to allow them look at X - ray images , EKG results and more on the portable touchscreen device , according to a new report .
Nick Volosin , director of technical services at Kaweah Health Care District in Visalia , Calif. , told Network World that he bought three iPads for testing , and plans to implement more than 100 at the facility in the next two months .
Various patient monitoring programs will be accessed through Citrix virtual desktop and application delivery software .
Using the Citrix Receiver , the hospital will be able to have its workers access desktop applications without writing proprietary software for the iPad .
The iPads will be distributed to home health care and hospice workers , nurses , dietitians and pharmacists .
Because tight supply has forced Apple to turn down volume orders , the hospital had to work with Apple directly to make such a large purchase .
Volosin told author Jon Brodkin that the iPad and its 10 - hour battery life will replace a laptop for many employees , particularly because it will eliminate the need to charge multiple times throughout the day , and it does n't need to be turned on and off .
In addition to patient - related services , employees will also be able to use the device to do traditional office tasks like check their e-mail .
Another selling point for the iPad : the price .
Starting at $ 500 for the 16GB Wi-Fi model , Volosin reportedly said that it is a more affordable option when compared to a traditional touchscreen tablet , which can cost as much as $ 3,000 .
In addition to Volosin 's three test units , about 20 doctors have purchased their own iPads to use at the office .
One kidney specialist said the device has made him more efficient and also improved patient safety .
Many hospitals have eyed Apple 's iPad since the device was first announced earlier this year .
Some health care workers believe tablet computers help doctors and nurses spend more time with patients .
One San Francisco program dubbed " Destination Bedside " uses tablet computers to provide X - rays , charts , prescriptions and notes .
“ From my human point of view , I could n’t believe it would be so easy to wreak that kind of havoc on the city , when they ca n’t see what is really going on there , " Mr. Schmitt said in an interview from Germany on Monday night .
The Web site also posted a 17 - minute edited version , which proved to be much more widely viewed on YouTube than the full version .
Critics contend that the shorter video was misleading because it did not make clear that the attacks took place amid clashes in the neighborhood and that one of the men was carrying a rocket - propelled grenade .
By releasing such a graphic video , which a media organization had tried in vain to get through traditional channels , WikiLeaks has inserted itself in the national discussion about the role of journalism in the digital age .
Where judges and plaintiffs could once stop or delay publication with a court order , WikiLeaks exists in a digital sphere in which information becomes instantly available .
“ The most significant thing about the release of the Baghdad video is that several million more people are on the same page , ” with knowledge of WikiLeaks , said Lisa Lynch , an assistant professor of journalism at Concordia University in Montreal , who recently published a paper about the site .
“ It is amazing that outside of the conventional channels of information something like this can happen . ”
Reuters had tried for two and a half years through the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the Iraq video , to no avail .
WikiLeaks , as always , refuses to say how it obtained the video , and credits only “ our courageous source . ”
Mr. Assange said “ research institutions ” offered to help decrypt the Army video , but he declined to detail how they went about it .
After decrypting the attack video , WikiLeaks in concert with an Icelandic television channel sent two people to Baghdad last weekend to gather information about the killings , at a cost of $ 50,000 , the site said .

David Schlesinger , Reuters editor in chief , said Tuesday that the video was disturbing to watch “ but also important to watch . ”
He said he hoped to meet with the Pentagon “ to press the need to learn lessons from this tragedy . ”
It has thrills , spills , sword fights , violent sexual assault and – to modern ears – a terrible ending , but the little - known 18th century play Double Falsehood was propelled into the literary limelight today when it was claimed as a lost Shakespeare .
Professor Brean Hammond of Nottingham University will publish compelling new evidence next week that the play , a romantic tragi-comedy by Lewis Theobald is – as the author always maintained it was – substantially based on a real Shakespeare play called Cardenio .
Hammond has been backed in his assertion by the Shakespeare publisher Arden and there are unconfirmed rumours that the play will open at the Royal Shakespeare Company 's Swan Theatre in Stratford when the venue reopens after its three - year closure .
The claim represents 10 years of literary detective work by Hammond .
" I do n't think you can ever be absolutely 100 % but , yes , I am convinced that it is Shakespeare , " he said .
" It 's fair to say it 's been something of an obsession .
You need to ask my wife but a fair few of my waking hours have been devoted to this subject . "
Theobald 's Double Falsehood , or The Distrest Lovers was first performed in 1727 at the Drury Lane theatre in London , along with the remarkable claim that it was based on Shakespeare 's " lost play " Cardenio , which was first performed in 1613 .
Theobald claimed to have three original texts of Cardenio .
Double Falsehood went down well with audiences , but it was badly received by expert observers who dismissed Theobald as a hoaxer .
Alexander Pope , in particular , was scornful but the two were committed enemies .
" Theobald was the author of a volume in 1726 called Shakespeare Restored which was a hatchet job on Pope 's editing of Hamlet , " said Hammond .
" In that volume Theobald made it pretty clear that he considered himself superior to Pope . "
The denunciation became accepted as fact : Theobald was little more than a hoaxer , albeit an audacious one .
The play then went largely to ground apart from a performance in 1846 when – after the audience shouted " author ? author ? " – a plaster bust of Shakespeare was brought out .
It was laughed off stage .
The play reads like Shakespeare , but reworked Shakespeare .
Hammond called Double Falsehood a " flawed play " , adding : " This version of the Shakespeare play has been doctored .
Theobald cut out material that he did n't think appropriate , but this was quite common .
Shakespeare was very frequently rewritten in the 17th and 18th centuries . "
The play is much shorter and more bitty than a normal Shakespeare play and there are no long speeches .
But there is plenty of action that centres on two men and two women , including an aristocratic villain called Henriquez who ravishes the virtuous young girl Violante .
By the end he has repented and is strikingly forgiven by all .
The Arden Shakespeare 's general editor , Richard Proudfoot , said the play was being made accessible for the first time in 250 years .
" I think Brean Hammond 's detective work has been superb .
He is quite open to the obvious fact that there is an element of speculation , but both of us believe that the balance of doubt lies in favour of its claim being authentic rather than a total fabrication . "
Over the years some 77 plays have been attributed in whole or in part to Shakespeare , about half of them wrongly .
There are also plenty of theories and books published claiming Shakespeare 's plays were written by Edward de Vere , Sir Francis Bacon or Christopher Marlowe .
Act 2 , scene 1 of Double Falsehood
Lopez [ to Fabian ] :
Soft , soft you , neighbour ; who comes here ?
Pray you , slink aside .
[ They withdraw . ]
Henriquez : Ha !
Is it come to this ?
O the devil , the devil , the devil !
Fabian [ to Lopez ] :
Lo you now , for want of the discreet ladle of a cool understanding will this fellow 's brains boil over !
Henriquez :
To have enjoy'd her , I would have given – what ?
All that at present I could boast my own ,
And the reversion of the world to boot
Had the inheritance been mine .
And now –
Just doom of guilty joys !
– I grieve as much
That I have rifled all the stores of beauty ,
Those charms of innocence and artless love ,
As just before I was devour'd with sorrow ,
That she refus'd my vows and shut the door
Upon my ardent longings .
Lopez [ to Fabian ] : Love !
Love !
Downright love !
I see by the foolishness of it .

Obama 's brief stop will include a one - on - one meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai , an expanded meeting with Karzai 's cabinet and U.S. officials , and a speech to American military personnel .
It is Obama 's second stop in a war zone as commander in chief , coming about a year after a similarly secretive trip to Iraq .
Karzai was notified about Obama 's visit just an hour before he arrived , the White House said .
MSNBC
Does n't sound like the Secret Service or military trust Karzai 's government to have too much advanced knowledge .
As always , I pray for President Obama 's safety .
Per Faux News reporting , Obama will meet with Karzai , McChrystal and meet with the troops , he then will leave Afghanistan in about 4 hours .
Where to next
More from the NYT
General James L. Jones , the National Security adviser , told reporters aboard the flight to Bagram that Mr. Obama would try to make Mr. Karzai " understand that in his second term , there are certain things thhttp://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/3/28/115350/954?mode=editat have not been paid attention to , almost since day one . "
Gen .
Jones said those things included " a merit - based system for appointment of key government officials , battling corruption , taking the fight to the narco - traffickers , " which , he said , " provides a lot of the economic engine for the insurgents . "
At the presidential palace , Mr. Obama and Mr. Karzai walked and chatted along a red carpet as they made their way to an Afghan color guard , where the national anthems of both countries were played , in a welcoming ceremony that lasted 10 minutes .
White House officials disclosed no information about the trip until Mr. Obama ’s plane had landed in Afghanistan , and had even gone so far as to inform reporters that the president would be spending the weekend at Camp David with his family .
In fact , Mr. Obama ’s trip is occurring during the Afghan night , and he is expected to be on his way back to Washington before most Afghanis wake up Monday morning .

Google announced the addition of OAuth support in Gmail in a blog post today , a highly positive move that allows you to give third - party applications access to the contents of your e-mail without having to give them your password .
You may be familiar with the term from Twitter , who added OAuth support back in April of last year .
Besides making a more secure Gmail environment , the news could be even more significant if it inspires a flush of innovation from third - party developers to build custom applications on top of Gmail .
Google itself occasionally adds experimental new functionality via Gmail Labs that users can opt into , but a secure OAuth sign - in platform could be a key feature that really promotes an explosion of Gmail apps from outside developers .
It remains to be seen if that Gmail app gold rush will take off , but at least one company is already taking advantage of the new OAuth feature .
Syphir makes an iPhone application called SmartPush , which lets you define under what conditions an incoming e-mail should trigger a push notification on your phone .
As illustrated in the screenshot above , thanks to OAuth you do n't have to give Syphir your Gmail password in order to access your e-mail .
Online cloud backup service Backupify let us know they 'll be adding OAuth support for their Gmail backup service as well beginning tomorrow .
What do you think :
Will we see an explosion of third - party Gmail Apps emerge ?
What kind of apps would you want to see built on top of your e-mail ?
Acknowledges " certain similarities , " describes them as " homage , " apologizes
The Comics Worth Reading blog reports on a statement issued by Nick Simmons , the artist of Incarnate comic book series , regarding the alleged plagiarism of Tite Kubo's Bleach manga :
Like most artists I am inspired by work I admire .
There are certain similarities between some of my work and the work of others .
This was simply meant as an homage to artists I respect , and I definitely want to apologize to any Manga fans or fellow Manga artists who feel I went too far .
My inspirations reflect the fact that certain fundamental imagery is common to all Manga .
This is the nature of the medium .
I am a big fan of Bleach , as well as other Manga titles .
And I am certainly sorry if anyone was offended or upset by what they perceive to be the similarity between my work and the work of artists that I admire and who inspire me .
The Robot 6 blog at the Comic Book Resources news site has confirmed with Radical Publishing , the publisher of Incarnate , that the statement comes from Simmons .
Radical announced on Wednesday that it halted the production and distribution of Incarnate and was attempting to " contact the publishers of the works in question in an effort to resolve this matter . "
Posters on several online communites noted the similarities between Kubo 's artwork ( pictured at right ) and Simmons ' artwork ( pictured at left ) early last week , and the controversy caused Radical , Viz , and even Kubo himself to react .
Update : More background information added .
Update 2 : A person claiming to be " Nick Simmons " posted a series of inflamatory comments on a Facebook page " calling for legal action against Nick Simmons for plagiarism of other works . "
Those comments , which have since been removed from the Facebook page , have not been verified by any reputable source as coming from the actual Nick Simmons .
On the other hand , the entirely separate statement on the Comics Worth Reading blog has been verified by Simmons ' publisher .
If there 's anything science is good at , it 's discovering new , strange ways for us to get cancer .
Scientists have found a new one : Turning on the lights when you take a late - night trip to the bathroom .
Thank you , science .
According to actual scientists from the UK and Israel , sudden exposure to light at night " triggers an ' over - expression ' of cells linked to the formation of cancer . "
Scientists compared a group of mice that were exposed to a light for one hour to mice that were kept in the dark , and found that brain cells linked to their Circadian rhythm were changed .
( Presumably in a way that increased the risk of cancer , though this Daily Mail article does not offer any details about the changes , because people who read newspapers cannot understand things . )
One researcher had this recommendation :
If you want to get up to go to the toilet , you should avoid reaching for the light switch .
There are some plug - in lights that just glow , that are safe and you could use them as an alternative .
Clearly , this research is sponsored by the " plug - in lights that just glow " industry .
Hey , scientists , here are some other trivial things we do every day .
Bet you can't prove they cause cancer , too !
Lay in bed for 10 minutes in the morning after our alarm goes off , trying to work up the courage to face the day .
Leave our headphones on our head when using the computer even though we 're not listening to any music
Give all the yellow Skittles in the bag to a friend
Always try to get an aisle seat on a plane
Put salt on our cucumbers ( sometimes , but not always )
Alright , science .
Do your stuff !

NEW DELHI : After a day of high drama that saw the Rajya Sabha swarm with more than a hundred marshals in blue dresses called in to bundle out seven MPs blocking proceedings , the House recorded a historic vote in favour of a bill providing for 33 % reservation for women in Parliament and assemblies .
The legislation is likely to be brought to the Lok Sabha after the vote - on - account has been passed , with the Congress leadership showing that it was not deterred by the bigger strength of the quota opponents in the lower House .
It has to be brought to the LS as a logical corollary , said Sonia Gan - dhi although she refused to get into the specifics of the likely time - table .
The vote had been vehemently stalled by anti-women 's quota protesters in the RS throughout Monday while the government calculated the political fallout of all - out hostilities with SP and RJD leaders Mulayam Singh and Lalu Prasad .
While the government dithered , a handful of dissenters held the House to ransom .
On Tuesday morning , the mood was different .
Armed with Sonia 's directions , the government was ready to seek suspension of the dissenting MPs .
After a four - hour debate in the afternoon , the House scored a thumping 186 votes with just one MP , Sharad Joshi of the Swatantra Paksh Party , voting against the bill .
Before the discussion which saw MPs rising to the occasion with only a few partisan jabs , the government prepared for the day on a war footing after having cut an indecisive figure on Monday .
The mood was set at the Congress core group 's meeting after the RS concluded its disrupted proceedings where Sonia made it clear that the women 's bill could not be abandoned .
Government managers had been restrained against the protesters due to concern over the political fallout of snapping ties with SP and RJD chiefs Mulayam Singh and Lalu Prasad and the resultant reduction in the buffer of 320 - plus MPs that UPA enjoyed in Lok Sabha .
SP would have to take on Congress for Muslim vote
This would be sharply whittled while the say of allies — whom Congress had managed well so far — would increase .
But the Congress leadership kept in mind what it saw was an inevitable drift of SP and RJD away from Congress , given their competing political interests .
SP would have to take on Congress for the Muslim vote in UP and in Bihar Sonia 's party was determined to carve an identity quite separate from Lalu .
If floor management became difficult after the women 's bill , it was inevitable .
The Congress core group took stock at PM Manmohan Singh 's office around 1 pm after the government managers already set their strategy in motion .
Once again , Sonia 's view that the party and government could not back off was clear .
Indeed , doing so would have severely hurt the government 's esteem and raised the morale of the anti-quota brigade sky high .
It would have laid the government open to a savaging from BJP and Left .
After getting the bill through Rajya Sabha , government sources are careful of when it will be moved to Lok Sabha where an even sterner test awaits it .
The government had to deal with just about 8 - 10 dissenters in Rajya Sabha but in Lok Sabha , Mulayam and Lalu can be expected to lead the opposition .
Though the bill 's passage is a blow to the two Yadav leaders , the possibility of having to marshal out 30 - 40 MPs is not easy to contemplate .
In keeping with its priorities , the government is moving a discussion on the general budget in Lok Sabha on Wednesday itself .

Is the Women ’s Reservation Bill really an effective way of empowering women ?
During the " Strike and Day of Action to Defend Education " on Thursday , tens of thousands of students , teachers , professors and administrators marched in California and some 30 other states to protest cuts in education spending .
David Patterson , a librarian at Cañada College , a community college in Redwood City , proved typical .
Asked beforehand to explain his participation , he employed the vocabulary of idealism that appeared on every placard and sounded from every bullhorn .
" I 'm hoping that students . . . feel connected to Montgomery , to Selma . . . to the sit-ins , to Freedom Riders , to the farmworkers ' struggle " of the 1960s and ' 70s , Mr. Patterson wrote on the Socialist Worker Web site .
" Now that 's an education : To see your fight against oppression connected to a long line of others ' fights . "
The demonstrations did offer a certain sort of instruction , though not of the kind Mr. Patterson and his fellow protesters had in mind .
They demonstrated the entitlement mentality and self - absorption that has come to dominate much of higher education .
Immigration in the US ' Arizona May only Be the Beginning '
In the United States , a large number of people support a strong clampdown on immigration -- including a controversial Arizona law that allows people to be detained if they do not have proper paperwork .
Political scientist Jens Hainmueller argues the debate will get more heated in the coming months .
Sony already irked a few people by removing the " install other OS " with its PS3 firmware 3.21 update , and it looks like it may have also inadvertently drawn the ire of quite a few other users .
Judging from reports on the official PlayStation forums , a sizable number of PS3 users have run into an array of different problems after installing the update , which range from folks not being able to log into PSN or load a disc after the update , to users not being able to turn on their PS3 at all -- some have even reported freezing during the update process .
Of course , there 's also lots of users that have updated without any issues whatsoever , and the problems do n't seem to have yet drawn an official response from Sony .
Let us know how things worked out for you in the comments below .

And now , just in time for Oscar junkies , comes a new statistical mincing of the movies that may someday yield an award category of its own : best fit between a movie ’s tempo and the natural rhythms of the brain .
Reporting in the journal Psychological Science , James E. Cutting of Cornell University and his colleagues described their discovery that Hollywood filmmakers , whether they know it or not , have become steadily more adroit at shaping basic movie structure to match the pulsatile , half - smooth , half - raggedy way we attend to the world around us .
This mounting synchrony between movie pace and the bouncing ball of the mind ’s inner eye may help explain why today ’s films manage to seize and shackle audience attention so ruthlessly and can seem more lifelike and immediate than films of the past , even when the scripts are lousier and you feel cheap and used afterward , not to mention vaguely sick from the three - quart tub of popcorn and pack of Twizzlers you ate without realizing it .
According to the new report , the basic shot structure of the movies , the way film segments of different lengths are bundled together from scene to scene , act to act , has evolved over the years to resemble a rough but recognizably wave - like pattern called 1/f , or one over frequency — or the more Hollywood - friendly metaphor , pink noise .
Pink noise is a characteristic signal profile seated somewhere between random and rigid , and for utterly mysterious reasons , our world is ablush with it .
Start with a picture of Penélope Cruz , say , or a flamingo on a lawn , and decompose the picture into a collection of sine waves of various humps , dives and frequencies .
However distinctive the original images , if you look at the distribution of their underlying frequencies , said Jeremy M. Wolfe , a vision researcher at Brigham and Women ’s Hospital , “ they turn out to have a one over f characteristic to them . ”
So , too , for many features of our natural and artifactual surroundings .
Track the pulsings of a quasar , the beatings of a heart , the flow of the tides , the bunchings and thinnings of traffic , or the gyrations of the stock market , and the data points will graph out as pink noise .
Much recent evidence from reaction - time experiments suggests that we think , focus and refocus our minds , all at the speed of pink .
If you ’re sitting at a task , Dr. Cutting said , “ sometimes you ’re good at it , sometimes your mind wanders , sometimes you ’re fast , sometimes you ’re slow , and the oscillating patterns that occur are generally one over f . ”
His questions : Does Hollywood play pink ?
Are movies structured to appeal to this most basal of beats ?
Over at the Copper and Blue , Derek Zona put together a very detailed post highlighting the ever - present reality of " groupthink " among hockey fans and why the growth of stats is important in fighting it .
Here 's the most important bit :
In the world of sports fans , confirmation biases abound .
It 's impossible for individual fans to record , catalog , process , analyze and interpret the results of hundreds of independent events occurring constantly throughout a game , but it 's much easier to pick out those events and sequences of events that support their conclusions .
Any hockey fan that has sat silently shaking their head while the crowd piles on an undeserving player recognizes this immediately .
It 's a powerful psychological force , especially in a setting like sports .
Fans can confirm their biases for themselves and immediately fall back on thousands , sometimes hundreds of thousands of fellow fans to confirm what they already know .
This is the very foundation of groupthink : Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that can occur in groups of people .
Rather than critically evaluating information , the group members begin to form quick opinions that match the group consensus .
Because it 's impossible to critically evaluate those hundreds of independent events , fans end up rallying together in support of or against the lowest common denominator in observational terms .
And this is why statistics and the analysis of those statistics is crucial .
Statistics , at the lowest level , are simply a vast collection of events .
Even though the fans ' understanding and analysis of the game continues to grow ( thanks to people like Vic , Gabe , JLikens and Tyler ) , there remains a vast majority of fans , people who know better and simple - minded folks that wallow in ignorance , sometimes willfully .
To be fair , Zona was referring to specific events and past arguments within the Oilers community ; and it's not that groupthink is always wrong .
It 's just that it 's not always justifiable all by itself .
Often times , the emotions that hockey games bring out of most fans lead to emotional responses - regardless of how true they are or not .
We forget past events to focus on what just happened , both good and bad .
For example , after the Rangers game , you 'll notice a number of comments late in the GameThread and the recap lamenting how the Devils tend to give up leads late in the game or that it was familiar .
Some immediately pointed to the late loss to Los Angeles earlier this season and the infamous Game 7 of last year 's playoffs .
But is it true ?
No , not by a long shot .
Tom Gulitti actually looked up the stats in the comments to this post at Fire & Ice and found that the LA game and the recent shootout loss to the Rangers were the only two times the Devils lost all season by giving up a late goal .
Twice out of 75 games is hardly " always . "
It 's actually been quite rare in 2009 - 10 .
But at the time , no one wanted to look up the numbers - they wanted to vent and in doing so committed themselves to a hive mind .
Do n't mistake me , I 'm not saying that fans should give up part of what it is to be a fan .
Emotional , spur - of - the - moment thoughts and feelings are totally understandable and expected .
But we ( and I do include myself , I 'm not on any horse , much less a high one ) , as a fanbase , would be a lot better off in judging what the Devils are and what they are n't if we take a step back sometimes and ask , " Is this really true ? "
Some of the posts I have written were done specifically to address a recent or larger issue that some fans have about the Devils , determining if the common sentiment is true or not .
That 's why I wrote a post not too long ago describing Mike Mottau 's resurgence .
Did he have a bad game last night ?
I thought he did ; but the rest of the month is proof that it was just that - one bad game .
No , we do n't have the same access to game tape that the Devils and other teams collect .
We do n't have the resources ( time , personnel , money , etc. ) to pile through every type of event .
I 'm not even sure what stat can show more abstract concepts , like how great Dainius Zubrus is along the boards compared to , say , Ilya Kovalchuk .
But we do have more information available .
We can view any goal from this season ( and in a few past seasons ) on NHL.com and determine what went right or wrong for each goal .
Sites like Behind the Net compile data that we can use in determining a player 's results .
Places like Puck Prospectus look to develop and discuss new metrics and put together more general articles with a statistical basis .
Basically , we can do more than just rely on pure groupthink .
Stats wo n't necessarily answer everything completely - context is an absolute must for a lot of these advances statistics ; but they do provide a lot more evidence for analysis and judgment .
What should we do about groupthink ?
What can we do about confirmation bias ?
Well , we can't eliminate it entirely ; but we can look at a few statements of Devils fans groupthink .
Let 's look within ourselves as a fanbase and bring up whatever common sentiments about players and the team that we hear , say , or think .
Then let 's see if they are true or not .
It does n't always need to be complex .
For example , with the Devils ' 5 - 1 loss to Philadelphia last night , questions were raised about how the Devils perform on the second half of back - to - back sets .
User elesias actually looked up the team 's record in those games and found that the losing has been a recent phenomenon .
Right then and there , groupthink / potential groupthink was confronted and addressed with available facts .
So let 's raise the issues .
Please list some common thoughts
Devils fans have about the team or a certain player .
I 'm sure some of you will bring up Martin Brodeur or Colin White ; but let 's not stop there .
I can't guarantee that we can address all of them - though it'd be perfect for a FanPost if you want to take a stab at answering them .
Let 's make this a more self - aware and intelligent community by taking this head on .
Dalton Ghetti has been carving teeny , tiny pencil tip sculptures for 25 years .
Mr. Ghetti , who owns about as many possessions as a monk , is aware how unusual his craft is .
He started carving tree bark when he was a child and experimented with everything from soap to chalk before settling on graphite .
It 's second nature now , and for 90 percent of his work , all he needs is a sewing needle , a razor blade and a carpenter 's or No. 2 pencil .
' The pencil tip is great ; it 's like a pure , very homogenous material , ' he said .
' It cuts in the same direction , not like wood , which has a grain .
But when I tell people how long it takes , that 's when they do n't believe it .
That 's what amazes people more , the patience .
Because everything nowadays has to be fast , fast , fast . '
The illusion of " government " ...
Solutions Larken Rose
The greatest weapon the oppressor has is the mind of the oppressed .
May 13 , 2008 - I get regular complaints from people who say that , while they agree with many of my criticisms of how our " government " functions , I offer no solutions .
In reality , I repeatedly offer the only solution there is .
Trouble is , there is a range of solutions people are willing to consider , and when I tell them that nothing in that range will do any good , they declare that I have no solution to suggest .
( And I 'm not even talking about violent revolution .
While that can , by itself , remove a particular set of tyrants , it does n't remove the problem of tyranny .
To wit , the American Revolution ended up creating the largest extortion racket and the most powerful standing army in the history of the world . )
What even many " limited government " folk do n't see is that they have been TRAINED to focus on completely worthless , ineffective methods of " change . "
And the one thing -- which is amazingly simple -- which actually WOULD unravel the tentacles of tyranny , existentially scares the heck out of all of the indoctrinated peasants .
The slaves are taught that petitions or elections , or lobbying for this or that legislation , is the only CIVILIZED way to achieve " change , " and to fight for freedom .
In reality , those are all ways to solidify your own enslavement , because they all reinforce the idea that you need the PERMISSION of tyrants in order to be free .
In other words , all such " solutions " are premised on the assumption that you are the PROPERTY of " government , " and so must beg it to LET you be free .
Do we try to " vote out " carjackers and muggers ?
Do we politely petition and lobby common thugs to please not assault us and rob us ?
Of course not .
Not only is it ineffective to ask crooks to please be nice , but there 's no need to " win them over . "
We do n't need their permission in order to have the right to defend ourselves and our property .
And yet ALL " political reform " that you 'll hear about from any but the most " extreme " corners consists of ASKING tyrants to please not oppress us so much .
In short , the minds of the oppressed are stuck in a paradigm which renders futile all of their efforts to achieve freedom .
Imagine an island tribe that believes that the volcano on the island is a god , and whenever misfortune occurs , they attempt to appease that god by giving it a human sacrifice .
After a while , those in the tribe get bummed out , not only because lots of innocent people are dying horrible deaths , but because the crops are n't improving , the weather is as bad as ever , and nothing else seems any better .
So they keep tinkering with their method of god- appeasing , but nothing seems to work .
They try giving sacrifices only during full moons ; they try giving the volcano only pretty young women ; they try all sorts of dances and chants while flinging people in -- nothing seems to work .
Of course , no amount of tinkering will do the slightest bit of good .
Until they lose their irrational superstitions , and realize that throwing people into a volcano will NEVER improve the crops , all of their efforts will be not only useless , but horribly counter - productive ( especially for those fed to the volcano ) .
So it is with modern statists .
As long as their efforts are focused upon trying to reform " government " -- in other words , trying to somehow create a NICE master , who will CHOOSE not to oppress his slaves -- their efforts will be in vain .
As long as they believe in irrational superstitions like " servant governments , " " the consent of the governed , " " elected representative government , " and so on , they will remain enslaved .
As long as they accept the notion that someone has to be " in charge , " that someone has to be making and enforcing " the rules " for everyone , that someone has to be given huge , super - human rights and powers to keep us all in line -- as long as the people believe that , they will be extorted , assaulted , controlled , enslaved and oppressed .
The following is an excerpt from " How to Be a Successful Tyrant " : " However , while the peasants will tolerate a lot , there are limits to their patience .
But those limits can be all but eliminated simply by giving them some sort of outlet ( completely ineffectual , of course ) for their displeasure with you and your regime .
As long as there is some system of " checks and balances " whereby the peasants can appeal to different levels and agencies of your regime , they will almost never resort to violence .
" You have to work within the system . "
That should be your mantra , and it will quickly be echoed by most of the peasants .
Of course , working within your " system " is never going to get the peasants freedom or justice , but even giving them the illusion of " due process " and some form of appeal will keep most of them forever banging their heads against a bureaucratic wall instead of actually resisting you . "
So what is the solution ?
Stop throwing sacrifices into the volcano .
In other words , stop treating " government " as if it has any " authority " over you .
Of course , it does have the power to hurt people , and you 'll have to take that into account .
But stop thinking , talking , and acting as if its control of you is inherently legitimate or justified .
Stop voting ; stop calling its commands " laws " ; stop treating its thugs with respect , as if what they do is justified or legitimate .
Stop sending them the message that you AGREE that they are your rightful masters .
Again , you may have to comply with much of their coercion just out of self - preservation , but do n't ever give them the " sanction of the victim " ( as Ayn Rand called it ) by treating them as if they have the RIGHT to rule you .
Of course , one or two people doing this wo n't end an empire .
In fact , it wo n't even change the day to day life of the one or two people much .
Nonetheless , being able to free your MIND -- being able to escape the mindset of a slave -- and then trying to help others do the same , will not only reveal a power and a freedom you never knew you had , but will plant the seed which will , slowly but surely , grow into the solution that will end all tyranny .
As Steven Biko said , the greatest weapon the oppressor has is the mind of the oppressed .
So are you ready to wrench YOUR mind out of the grip of your enslavers ?
Or are you still too attached to the cult of " government " ?
Let me leave you with one more quote from my " Tyrant " book .
Put yourself in the shoes of your oppressors , and imagine what the world really looks like to them .
Your peasants must never be allowed to realize the power they have .
Their power can be " deadly " to your regime , even if they do not resort to violence at all .
Gandhi led millions of people in India in a bizarre " revolution " that crippled British control of the country .
Amazingly , they did this without any violence .
To a large extent , they defeated an empire by doing nothing .
Mere passive noncompliance with the commands of an empire ( a.k.a. " doing nothing " ) , if done by enough of the subjects , spells certain doom for any tyrant .
If one day all of your victims decide not to pay your " taxes " any more , there is nothing you can do to preserve your power .
If they all decide to ignore your laws , your " laws " cease to exist .
Always remember : your " authority " exists only in the minds of the peasants .
If they ever stop perceiving you as an " authority , " your reign is over .
And it probably wo n't even be a dramatic , violent end .
Instead , you may simply fizzle into irrelevant oblivion , as the peasants , including your enforcers , simply " forget " to bow to your will .
They wo n't even need to oust you ; they will simply ignore you out of existence .
Choose any historical tyrant and imagine what would happen if one day everyone in his regime woke up and said : " That guy is looney - tunes , and I 'm not listening to him any more ( and his mustache looks stupid too ) . "
Would they then feel the wrath of the tyrant ?
Nope , because there would be no one to enforce that " wrath . "
The power of every tyrant is 100 % illusion , and you darn well better know how to keep that illusion alive if you want to stay in power .
So , are you letting the illusion stay alive in you ?
STUMBLE IT !

Gyoza , or Japanese potstickers , are not normally served with chocolate fudge sauce , but ice cream gyoza are !
Here ’s how to make your own cookie dough and ice cream dessert gyoza .
Gyoza presses , also called dumpling , potsticker , or dough presses , are readily available and can be found relatively cheaply .
We found ours at Daiso , a Japanese dollar store chain .
We used this recipe from Cupcake Project for eggless cookie dough for “ raw ” eating rather than baking .
That ’s a good idea because what we ’re making here is not baked or fried , just simply cookie dough and ice cream .
You can also use your favorite recipe or even store bought dough ( and make your own judgement call about eating raw dough that contains eggs ) .
Mix up the dough , roll it into a log , wrap in plastic and refrigerate until it is well chilled .
Do n’t add any chocolate chips or other crunchies that will add texture to your dough .
You want it to be smooth for rolling out thinly .
Cut a slice of dough off of the log onto a piece of plastic wrap .
Fold the plastic wrap over the slice of dough and roll it out until it is a little larger than your gyoza press .
Peel the plastic wrap off of one half of the circle of dough .
Lay the thin dough over the press and gently push it into the center to make a depression for the ice cream .
Put a small spoonful of ice cream into the depression .
Close the press carefully but firmly until the two sides are squeezed together .
Carefully open the press , using the plastic wrap to pull the dough away from the press .
The dough has a tendency to crack along the edges , but can be pressed back together .
After you remove the gyoza from the press , trim any excess cookie dough off the edges with a knife .
You can reuse the excess dough for more gyoza ; just be sure to chill it again first .
Put the finished gyoza in the freezer until you ’re ready to serve .
The frozen dough will insulate the ice cream and keep it from melting , and has a wonderful texture .
Once you ’ve made one and have a feel for how thin the dough should be , you may want to roll out all of your remaining dough slices .
Then you can fill them one after another , putting each one in the freezer as they ’re completed .
Once they ’re thoroughly frozen , serve with chocolate dipping sauce .

After a sustained lullof very little solar activity , the sun is finally coming back to life .
In mid-December , solar physicists observed a large group of sunspots that had manifested itselfon the solar surface — the largest group of sunspots to emerge for severalyears .
Scientists at the European Space Agency ( ESA ) are studying the sunspots and how this flare - upcompares to previous levels of solar activity .
" This lastminimum was much deeper and longer than anybody predicted , " said Bernhard Fleck , ESA 's project scientist for the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) , in a statement .
" We were beginning to joke that we had enteredanother Maunder minimum . "
The Maunder minimum , which occurred between 1645 and 1715 , was a phase in which sunspots — visibleindicators of solar activity — were largely absent from the sun .
The past twoyears have been similar , with the sun exhibiting little activity on itsspotless face over 70 percent of the time .
Sunspots are coolerregions on the surface of the sun that appear visibly dark and arecharacterized by intense magnetic fields .
Typically , thesun undergoes a cycle of activity that lasts approximately 11 years .
Yet , until last December , astronomers were left to grapple with the sun 's apparentinaction .
Since then , however , solar activity has significantly increased .
In mid-January , an even largergroup of sunspots emerged , and even more recently , several large , active areashave been making their way across the face of the sun .
Furthermore , on March 28 , Thomas Ashcraft , an amateur astronomer in New Mexico , observed astrong , radio- active burst from the sun and broadcasted the news over his radiotelescope , as reported by Spaceweather.com .
Still , scientists sayit is premature to conclude that these recent events are evidence that the sunis headed toward another energetic cycle of activity .
The strength of a solar cycleis determined by the strength of the magnetism at the poles of the sun , whichis currently very weak .
So , despite the Sun 's increased activity in recentmonths , astronomers do n't anticipate major changes to the solar cycle .
" I think we areheading for something like the early 20th century when everything was much lessactive , " Fleck said .
Historical records indicate that , until the last fewyears , the level of solar activity has been unusually high .
As a result , thisperiod can be considered a return to more normal levels of activity , rather thana drop and resurgence .
Still , ESA 's findingswill play an important role in the progress of solar observation [ more photosof the sun ] .?
" When SOHO waslaunched almost 15 years ago , understanding the solar cycle was not one of itsscientific objectives , now it is one of the key questions , " Fleck said .
As newer spacecraft , such as NASA 's Solar Dynamics Observatory , are launched , SOHO scientists will beable to provide data that is consistent with NASA 's newer instruments .
As such , astronomers will be able to calibrate and compare datasets far more accurately .
In addition , SOHO hasthe unique capability to watch for ' coronal mass ejections ' coming straight forEarth .
It is the only spacecraft in line with the sun that can observe thisbehaviour , which can disrupt telecommunications , GPS and power lines .
The European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation made a few test flights Saturday to assess the impact of volcanic ash on aircraft , a Dutch ministry spokeswoman said .
One KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
Boeing took off from German Duesseldorf airport on Saturday night and landed safely at Amserdam 's Schiphol airport .
Other test flights had taken place in France and Belgium during daytime on Saturday .
The test flights were performed at lower altitude than usual , and no passengers were on board .
These were part of a series of tests across the European Union , the spokeswoman said , " We want to see what the damage could be to the engines . "
In a statement , KLM said that it carried out the test flight Saturday evening between about 19:45 and 21:00 hours Central European Summer Time ( 1745 and 1900 GMT ) in Netherlands airspace using a Boeing 737-800 .
The flight was carried out to establish whether air quality in the atmosphere met the requirements for safe flight .
" No problems were encountered during the flight . "
" At first glance there is no reason to suspect that anything is amiss .
We observed no irregularities either during the flight or during the initial inspection on the ground . "
CEO of KLM , Peter Hartman said .
" We hope to receive permission as soon as possible after that to start up our operation and to transport our passengers to their destinations . "
KLM expects to receive the final results of the technical inspection Sunday morning .

Achieving custom ablation
First , wavefront sensing devices or aberrometers measure the wavefront distortions created by all the structures in the eye . [ 6 ]
The complete optical aberration of the eye is the cumulative sum of the aberrations created by all the eye structures .
It is not known which structures give rise to which aberration component , but the total aberration of the eye is measured .
Mathematically , the aberrated wavefront can be described by Zernike polynomials .
The weighted - sum of a number of polynomials may be used to reconstruct the aberrated wavefront .
The higher the number of polynomials used , the better it approximates the actual wavefront .
Second , the information generated by the wavefront analyzer is used to guide excimer laser treatment to counteract the eye 's aberrations .
Third , the excimer laser uses a small spot scanning beam to precisely place the custom ablation profile onto the cornea .
This laser should have a fast eye tracker to null all eye movements .
Without a fast eye tracker , saccadic eye movements may degrade the effect of the precise laser ablation profile .
Adaptive optics
Wavefront technology and adaptive optics were first used by astronomers in designing land - based telescopes to reduce unwanted wavefront distortions .
Stars twinkle because when starlight passes through the earth 's atmosphere , the light rays are bent by air of different temperatures and densities ( turbulence ) .
Without adaptive optics , the randomly distorted starlight entering a telescope will be magnified and will appear as scintillating blobs .
In the Gemini telescope , a separate column of starlight is funneled into a wavefront sensor .
The wavefront sensor separates this column of light and samples each zone to calculate how the atmosphere distorts the light rays .
The information from the wavefront sensor is fed back to a deformable mirror capable of changing shape hundreds of times per second to counteract the distortions caused by the atmosphere .
In other words , the distorted light rays from the distant stars can be undistorted by combining wavefront analysis and adaptive optics .
Three types of wavefront analyzers or aberrometers
Aberrometers measure optical aberrations by different methods .
Ray - tracing devices and Tscherning aberrometers measure aberrations as light enters the eye .
Hartmann - Shack wavefront analyzers measure aberrations as light exits the eye .
The Dresden Wavefront Analyzer uses the Tscherning aberrometer 's method to calculate optical aberration .
A frequency - doubled Nd: YAG emits laser through a mask to create 128 parallel light rays onto the retina .
If the eye was a perfect optical system , these rays would appear as an array of perfectly spaced dots on the retina .
In an imperfect biological optical system , aberration would cause these rays to appear as deformed dots and an irregular array on the retina .
A charge - coupled device ( CCD ) camera , via indirect ophthalmoscopy , captures the image of dots on the retina .
Then , the aberrated wavefront is reconstructed by using Zernike polynomials .
Theo Seiler , MD , used the Dresden Wavefront Analyzer to measure the precise aberrations in the eye , and then performed custom ablation with the Wavelight Allegretto laser .
In the 2000 America Academy of Ophthalmology meeting , he presented data comparing custom ablation results with standard LASIK results .
The follow - up period was 3 months .
Of custom ablation patients , 15 % achieved best spectacle corrected visual acuity ( BSCVA ) of 20/10 compared to 5 % with standard ablation .
In the custom ablation group , 45 % were between 20 /16 and 20 /12 compared to 30 % of those who received standard ablation .
In the custom ablation group , 30 % were 20 /20 compared to 50 % in the standard ablation group .
At this stage , Seiler emphasized that the main use of custom ablation is to repair previous irregular ablations , and the potential of achieving super vision is yet to be realized .
In an article published by Mrochen in 2001 , 3 months follow - up data were shown after wavefront guided LASIK using the Allegretto laser on 35 eyes . [ 7 ]
Uncorrected visual acuity ( UCVA ) of 20/20 or better was achieved in 93.5 % of eyes , and BSCVA of 20/10 or better was achieved in 16.0 % of eyes .
Ray tracing aberrometer ( Tracey ) is similar to the Tscherning aberrometer because it measures aberration when light enters the eye .
Instead of light beams entering simultaneously , they enter sequentially into the eye .
After each light ray reaches the retina , the photodetector records and computes its aberration .
The advantage of this method over other aberrometers is that in the presence of a highly aberrated eye , criss - cross of light rays is avoided , ie , different light rays , when fired sequentially rather than simultaneously , are less likely to be confused by the photodetectors .
One of the goals of custom ablation is to repair eyes that underwent suboptimal older generation refractive procedures that increased the eyes ' optical aberrations .
High aberration eyes may cause confusion when the Tscherning and the Hartmann - Shack aberrometers are used , but , theoretically , the Tracey aberrometer will be able to measure large aberrations .
Another advantage of the Tracey aberrometer is that it functions at higher speeds than other systems ; therefore , it is not affected by saccadic eye movement .
The prototype delivers 320 light rays in 20 milliseconds over a 6 - mm zone .
In the Hartmann - Shack Wavefront analyzer , an eye - safe laser beam enters the eye .
If the eye is emmetropic , the light that scatters back from the retina exits the eye as parallel rays .
Aberrations in the eye cause deviations in the exiting light rays , which are measured by a wavefront sensor .
The Autonomous ( Summit Technology , Inc , Waltham , Mass ) , VISX ( Santa Clara , Calif ) , and Bausch & Lomb Surgical ( Munich , Germany ) analyzers rely on a Hartmann - Shack Wavefront analyzer .
Autonomous , in partnership with Zeiss Humphrey Systems , developed the CustomCornea Accessory Device .
The eye is aligned with a fixation target , an eye - safe probe laser , a video camera , and a wavefront sensor .
The probe laser emits an eye - safe laser into the eye , and , after the light is reflected back , a wavefront sensor measures the directions of the distorted light rays .
At the 2000 International Society of Refractive Surgery meeting , Marguerite McDonald , MD , reported data on 23 bilateral LASIK and 13 bilateral PRK surgeries .
One eye of each patient was selected randomly for CustomCornea treatment , while the other received conventional LADARVision ablation profile .
In the myopic subgroup that received LASIK , at 6 months postoperatively , 85 % of the eyes treated with custom ablation achieved an uncorrected vision of 20 / 25 or better , and 92 % treated with conventional ablation profile achieved an uncorrected vision of 20 / 25 or better .
In the hyperopic subgroup , 80 % of the eyes treated with custom ablation achieved an uncorrected vision of 20/40 or better , and 90 % treated with conventional ablation profile achieved an uncorrected vision of 20 /40 or better .
This suggested that custom ablation created less perfect results compared to conventional LASIK .
In the myopic subgroup that received PRK , at 6 months postoperatively , 85 % of the eyes treated with custom ablation achieved an uncorrected vision of 20/20 or better , and 65 % treated with conventional ablation profile achieved an uncorrected vision of 20 / 20 or better .
Higher order aberrations decreased by 46 % using customized PRK and decreased by only 26 % using customized LASIK .
VISX introduced the WaveScan Wavefront Analysis System in 2000 , which uses the Hartmann - Shack analyzer principle .
The sensor consists of adaptive optics mounted on microchips to create a matrix of lenslets ( micromirrors ) that refract thousands of light rays .
The analyzer focuses the light rays onto a CCD chip and reconstructs the wavefront entering the lenslet array and calculates the aberrations using Zernike polynomials .
The process of wavefront analysis and data presentation for each patient 's eye is termed waveprint , as it depicts the " fingerprint " of the eye .
VISX went one step ahead to use the wavefront data to ablate a plastic lens called the PreVue lens , so that the patient can wear this lens on a trail frame to mimic the effect of what they will see after receiving custom ablation .
If patients were able to see better than 20/16 with the PreVue lens , then they were candidates to be included in the VISX custom ablation trial .
In the 2001 ASCRS meeting , Kraft reported data from 17 eyes that were treated with custom ablation .
Preoperative BSCVA of 20/12.5 was 6 % , 20/16 was 59 % , and 20/20 was 100 % .
Postoperative UCVA of 20/12.5 was 29 % , 20/16 was 94 % , and 20/20 was 100 % .
These results seem to indicate that custom ablation increased the likelihood of super vision , but the same pattern of results were obtained when patients were treated with the conventional ablation pattern using the VISX S3 laser with 6.5 - mm treatment zone and a blend zone .
The Zywave aberrometer ( Bausch & Lomb Surgical , Munich , Germany ) uses the principle of a Hartmann - Shack sensor .
The Zyoptics system links the data from the Zywave system that performed wavefront analysis with the Orbscan IIz , which provided anatomical customization to the Technolas 217Z laser .
At the American Academy of Ophthalmology Refractive Surgery Interest Group meeting ( October 2000 ) , Michael Knorz , MD , reported prospective data on 32 patients in whom one eye received the regular LASIK treatment , and the other eye received Zyoptix custom ablation treatment . [ 8 ]
Out of the 32 patients , 21 patients experienced an increase in best - corrected visual acuity , 7 patients showed no difference , and 4 patients had worse outcome than the Planoscan software .
These represent early data when nomograms have not been perfected yet because best - corrected visual acuity data were presented rather than uncorrected visual acuity data .
In the Zyoptics study performed at TLC Windsor , Probst reported that in 100 eyes with 3 - months follow - up , postoperative UCVA of 20/15 or better was 45.0 % , 20/20 or better was 89.0 % , and 20/40 or better was 99.8 % .
These compared favorably with those completed with conventional ablation , which showed postoperative UCVA of 20/15 or better was 29.0 % , 20/20 or better was 84.0 % , and 20/40 or better was 99.5 % .

It seems like some people are constantly wringing their hands about how poor people eat ( to wit : badly . )
And the most popularly proposed solution is to teach them ( “ them ” ) more about nutrition !
Or educate them in general .
Because obviously they just do n’t know what they ’re doing .
And that ’s why they eat so badly , and hence , why their health tends to be poorer !
And eureka ! — you have a tidy solution that not only absolves financial and economic guilt , but , as a bonus , allows richer , more - edumacated people to assume the role of benevolent experts .
Here comes the part where I bust up that nice , warm bubble bath .
The reality is that people who do n’t have enough money ( or the utilities and storage ) to buy and prepare decent food in decent quantities , cannot ( and should not ) be arsed to worry about the finer nuances of nutrition .
Because getting enough to eat is always our first priority .
That ’s why Ellyn Satter ( yes , her again ) created the Hierarchy of Food Needs .
Which looks like this :
The idea is that , before we worry about nutrition ( i.e. , “ instrumental food ” ) we ’ve first got to HAVE food .
Enough of it .
Consistently .
And it ’s got to be acceptable to us ( which , for some people , might mean not coming from the garbage , or meeting certain standards of preparation ) and it ’s got to taste reasonably good .
A little variety is nice , too .
These are not silly little preferences that can be brushed off lightly — even “ tasting good , ” which seems to always be the first thing thrown out the window when someone decides to change their diet For Health Reasons .
Tasting good is actually a function , biologically , of
food ’s microbiological safety and freshness ( meaning it ’s not spoiled or contaminated with sick - making germs ) , food ’s caloric density ( there ’s that pesky ENOUGH FOOD thing again — because calories and water trump everything else , nutrition - wise , and hey , guess what ??
Sweet , fatty foods are the order of the day when it comes to caloric density ) , and food ’s chemical safety ( meaning , it ’s not naturally poisonous , chemically adulterated , or containing some toxin produced by sick - making germs . )
Of course , flavour is n’t infallible — C. botulinum ca n’t be detected by taste , for example , and ethylene glycol , a .k.a. antifreeze , is apparently as tasty as it is poisonous — but there ’s likely a strong evolutionary reason why we developed certain flavour preferences .
And it ’s not because we ’re totally depraved and destined by our love of Twinkies to doggy - paddle the Lake of Fire forever and ever , amen .
It ’s because , for the most part , those preferences kept us fed and out of trouble with food .
And they still do .
For most of us , this becomes apparent for the second reason listed above — when we ’re hungry .
I ’m sure you ’ve noticed how cake and fried foods and whatnot become SUPER MASSIVELY APPEALING when you ’ve either missed a meal or started a diet .
It ’s not because you lack willpower or have an inborn preference for BAD , BAD JUNK FOOD — it ’s because those foods are naturally jam - packed full of what you need right that instant : energy .
Meaning , calories — most of them coming from carbohydrate ( whether it ’s starch or sugar ) for instant energy , and fat for MOAR energy ( and tasty , creamy mouthfeel , to boot . )
So , extend this to someone who does n’t have enough food on a regular basis .
In my neighbourhood , which is poor , corner stores sell Ensure and Boost individually for about $ 2 , right up in a big display near the counter .
You find empty bottles of the stuff laying around on the sidewalk next to smashed beer bottles .
It ’s complete nutrition ; it ’s portable and requires no preparation ; and it ’s reasonably calorie - dense .
Imagine being hungry and walking into that corner store with a couple of bucks in your pocket .
Sure , choosing the Ensure over a chocolate bar or bag of chips might make logical sense , and you might even do that sometimes to ensure you do n’t end up with some horrific nutrient deficiency .
But there ’s one important point I forgot to mention about Ensure and Boost : not super tasty .
So , when it comes down to it , you ’re likely to choose the tastier option — which is pretty calorically dense and provides some nutrition ( as well as the satisfaction of chewing actual food ) — more often than not .
And it ’s not because you ’re stupid , ignorant , lazy , or just a bad , bad person who loves bad , bad food .
It ’s because other needs come first .
The following quote from this book sums things up nicely as it relates to what people really need when it comes to nutrition , and how nutritionists , dietitians , and social workers can best help :
Is it our role to teach the poor how to live quietly on less than minimum standards of health and decency and how to starve on minimum wage ?
Do we teach them how to budget malnutrition more neatly ?
Or is it our job to struggle for those minimum standards …?
I think you know what answer I ’d choose .
And once again , we ’re back to the social determinants of health .
You want people to eat better ?
Give them enough money , a place for cooking and storage , and access to a decent variety of food .
Then you can worry about the finer points of nutrition .

The Dutch will be looking to warm up for their World Cup adventure in style .
Kick - Off : Wednesday , May 26 , 20:00 CET .
Badenova - Stadion , Freiburg , Germany .
Looking Ahead To World Cup
Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk made a controversial decision in leaving out former Manchester United and Real Madrid striker Ruud van Nistelrooy from his provisional squad .
This has n't gone too well in certain quarters but the Dutch national squad is brimming with quality and talent upfront .
The Netherlands had a sensational World Cup qualifying campaign , winning their group with a 100 % record .
Although it has to be said that the Dutch did n't really have the best of teams in their group , winning each of the eight games is not an easy feat .
The Dutch have been drawn with Denmark , Cameroon and Japan in Group E for the World Cup and will be eager to use these friendly internationals as preparatory matches .
The last time the Oranje played an international match was in March against the USA , whom they defeated 2 - 1 at the Amsterdam ArenA .
Recovering From England Defeat
Former Atletico Madrid coach Javier Aguirre took over the Mexican national team in April 2009 after Sven - Goran Eriksson was given his marching orders .
He started with a 2 - 1 defeat to El Salvador but the 51 - year - old has since led ‘el Tri ’ to the World Cup finals in South Africa quite comfortably .
Mexico also won the 2009 Gold Cup under his guidance .
Aguirre had led Mexico to three successive wins in friendly games until Monday 's defeat to England at Wembley .
Mexico had defeated Senegal , Angola and Chile but went down 3 - 1 to the Three Lions in London .
However , it must have been a good experience playing one of the stronger sides in the World Cup finals and indeed the Mexicans should be looking forward to taking on the Netherlands in Germany .
It is likely that Mexico will lose the match but for a side that will have to confront South Africa , Uruguay and France in the group stage in South Africa , playing stronger opponents such as England and the Netherlands is a good practice ahead of the tournament .

TEAM NEWS
Netherlands
Van Marwijk has some injury concerns .
Liverpool striker Ryan Babel picked up a hamstring injury during the training camp in Austria and wo n't be able to play against the Mexicans .
Defender Ron Vlaar is also being plagued by hamstring problems and is doubtful .
PSV midfielder Ibrahim Afellay picked up a knock after a collision with Andre Ooijer during a training session earlier this week , but he should be able to play .
However , Van Marwijk could hand some youngsters the chance to prove their worth before announcing the confirmed Oranje squad on Thursday .
Probable Lineup ( 4 - 2 - 3 -1 ) : Stekelenburg ; Boulahrouz , Heitinga , Mathijsen , Braafheid ; De Jong , Schaars ; Kuyt , Van der Vaart , Afellay ; Van Persie
Mexico
Javier Aguirre is likely to put a strong side against the Netherlands .
Giovani dos Santos , who started against England on Monday evening , could start yet again and so would the Manchester United - bound forward Javier Hernandez .
Probable Lineup ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : Ochoa ; Aguilar , Osorio , Rodriguez , Salcido ; Juarez , Marquez , Torrado , Dos Santos ; Vela , Hernandez .
PLAYERS TO WATCH
Robin van Persie ( Netherlands )
The Arsenal forward is rated as one of the best players on the planet but the 26 - year - old missed a large chunk of the 2009 - 10 campaign with injuries .
However , the former Feyenoord attacker , placed 103rd in the Castrol Rankings , appears to have gained 100 % fitness and he will be drafted into the starting line - up against Mexico on Wednesday .
Giovani Dos Santos ( Mexico )
The former Barcelona striker has had a awful two years in club football but he was excellent against England on Monday .
Dos Santos is one of the most gifted players of Mexico and he will be looking to express that talent on Wednesday evening with his runs and crosses .
PREDICTION
The Netherlands should win this match .
However , the Oranje will have to be careful not to take Mexico 's attackline casually .
Netherlands 3 - 1 Mexico

Dear Cecil : Tycho Brahe , the astronomer , is buried here in Prague in a church .
That 's not so unusual .
What is rather strange is the persistent rumor that he had a silver nose , something to do with a duel .
Did it tie on around his face with silk strings ?
Did it have little hooks that went around his ears , like eyeglasses ?
Was it surgically attached ?
I 'm truly curious .
I also wonder if it tarnished , and whether he had to polish it .
Did it make a note like a whistle when he blew his nose ?
Raymond Johnston , chief copy editor , Prague Post
Cecil replies :
Glad to be of help , Ray .
I know how tough it is for journalists to come by this kind of information .
What you heard was no rumor .
Tycho Brahe ( 1546-1601 ) , the father ( or at least the godfather ) of modern astronomy , really did wear an artificial nose , owing to the fact that the real one had been sliced off in a duel .
You may think : this does not sound like the scientists I know .
Tycho Brahe , however , was no ordinary stargazer .
It happened in 1566 while the 20 - year - old Tycho was studying at the University of Rostock in Germany .
Attending a dance at a professor ’s house , he got into a quarrel with one Manderup Parsbjerg , like himself a member of the Danish gentry .
Over a woman ?
Nah — tradition has it that the two were fighting over some fine point of mathematics .
( My guess : Fermat ’s Next - to - Last Theorem , which posits that 2 + 2 = 5 for very large values of 2 . )
Friends separated them , but they got into it again at a Christmas party a couple weeks later and decided to take it outside in the form of a duel .
Unfortunately for Tycho the duel was conducted in pitch darkness with swords .
Parsbjerg , a little quicker off the dime , succeeded in slicing off the bridge ( apparently ) of Tycho ’s nose .
Reconstructive surgery then being in a primitive state , Tycho concealed the damage as best he could with an artificial bridge made of precious metals .
He carried some nose goop with him always , either to polish the nose or to glue it more firmly in place .
But no hooks or string , and probably no whistling either .
High - handed and irascible , Tycho Brahe was the kind of guy who got into duels .
Luckily he was also a genius .
Fascinated by the stars since his youth , he discovered that existing astronomical tables were grossly inaccurate and set about making his own meticulous observations of the heavens , a project that occupied him for most of his life .
To keep him from going abroad , the king of Denmark and Norway gave Tycho a prodigious quantity of cash ( $ 5 billion in today ’s money , by one estimate ) and his own island .
There Tycho constructed an observatory where for 20 years he compiled the impressive body of astronomical data that his assistant Johannes Kepler subsequently used to deduce the laws of planetary motion .
All this , mind you , with the naked eye ; the telescope had n’t yet been invented .
To give you a further indication of the type of guy we ’re dealing with there , Tycho did n’t marry the mother of his eight children , employed a dwarf as a jester , kept a pet elk ( which died after breaking a leg while going downstairs drunk ) , dabbled in alchemy , and tyrannized the local peasantry .
After his royal patron died of excessive drink he managed to tick off everyone in Denmark , had his subsidies revoked , and eventually found it wise to leave the country .
Having relocated to Prague , he died after drinking heavily at dinner , obviously a pretty common fate in those days .
Tycho ’s tomb was reopened in 1901 and his remains were examined by medical experts .
The nasal opening of the skull was rimmed with green , a sign of exposure to copper .
Presumably this came from the artificial nose , which supposedly had been made of silver or gold .
The experts put the best face on this , as it were , saying that Tycho was an expert in metallurgy and probably wanted an alloy that was durable and skin colored .
Sure , guys .
I say Mr. Astronomy got nicked in the nose department twice .

Air conditioners and refrigerators work the same way .
Instead of cooling just the small , insulated space inside of a refrigerator , an air conditioner cools a whole car .
Air conditioners use chemicals that easily convert from a gas to a liquid and back again .
This chemical is used to transfer heat from the air inside of a car to the outside air .
The machine has three main parts .
They are a compressor , a condenser and an evaporator .
The compressor is located on the engine , because it is typically belt driven .
The condenser is located at the front of the car to take advantage of air coming in from the moving vehicle .
The evaporator is located closer to the cabin of the car , usually under the dash or near the firewall .
The working fluid arrives at the compressor as a cool , low - pressure gas .
The compressor squeezes the fluid .
This packs the molecule of the fluid closer together .
The closer the molecules are together , the high its energy and its temperature .
The working fluid leaves the compressor as a hot , high pressure gas and flows into the condenser .
If you look at the condenser , look for the part that has metal fins all around .
The fins act just like the radiator in the car and helps the heat go away , or dissipate , more quickly .
When the working fluid leaves the condenser , its temperature is much cooler and it has changed from a gas to a liquid under high pressure .
The liquid goes into the evaporator through a very tiny , narrow hole .
On the other side , the liquid 's pressure drops .
When it does it begins to evaporate into a gas .
As the liquid changes to gas and evaporates , it extracts heat from the air around it .
The heat in the air is needed to separate the molecules of the fluid from a liquid to a gas .
The evaporator also has metal fins to help in exchange the thermal energy with the surrounding air .
By the time the working fluid leaves the evaporator , it is a cool , low pressure gas .
It then returns to the compressor to begin its trip all over again .
Connected to the evaporator is a fan that circulates the air inside the car to blow across the evaporator fins .
Hot air is lighter than cold air , so the hot air in the car rises to the top of the interior just like it rises to the top of a room .
There is a vent there where air is sucked into the air conditioner and goes down ducts .
The hot air is used to cool the gas in the evaporator .
As the heat is removed from the air , the air is cooled .
It is then blown into the car through other ducts usually at the floor level .
This continues over and over and over until the interior of the car reaches the temperature you want the car cooled to .
The thermostat senses that the temperature has reached the right setting and turns off the air conditioner .
As the room warms up , the thermostat turns the air conditioner back on until the car reaches the temperature
AMAZING : Chinese Concept -
The train that never stops at a station : A brilliant new Chinese train innovation - get on & off the bullet train without the train stopping .
VERY COOL CONCEPT !
No time is wasted .
The bullet train is moving all the time .
If there are 30 stations between Beijing and Guangzhou , just stopping and accelerating again at each station will waste both energy and time .
A mere 5 min stop per station ( elderly passengers cannot be hurried ) will result in a total loss of 5 min x 30 stations or 2.5 hours of train journey time !
How it works ( view the movie - in mandarin though ! ) : 1 . For those who are boarding the train :
The passengers at a station embarks onto to a connector cabin way before the train even arrives at the station .
When the train arrives , it will not stop at all .
It just slows down to pick up the connector cabin which will move with the train on the roof of the train .
While the train is still moving away from the station , those passengers will board the train from the connector cabin mounted on the train 's roof .
After fully unloading all its passengers , the cabin connector cabin will be moved to the back of the train so that the next batch of outgoing passengers who want to alight at the next station will board the connector cabin at the rear of the train roof .
2 .
For those who are getting off :
As stated after fully unloading all its passengers , the cabin connector cabin will be moved to the back of the train so that the next batch of outgoing passengers who want to alight at the next station will board the connector cabin at the rear of the train roof .
When the train arrives at the next station , it will simply drop the whole connector cabin at the station itself and leave it behind at the station .
The outgoing passengers can take their own time to disembark at the station while the train had already left .
At the same time , the train will pick up the incoming embarking passengers on another connector cabin in the front part of the train 's roof .
So the train will always drop one connector cabin at the rear of its roof and pick up a new connector cabin in the front part of the train 's roof at each station .
Innovation ?
How can global warming be real when there 's so much snow ? "
Hearing that question — repeatedly — this past February drove Joseph Romm nuts .
A massive snowstorm had buried Washington , DC , and all across the capital , politicians and pundits who dispute the existence of climate change were cackling .
The family of Oklahoma senator Jim Inhofe built an igloo near the Capitol and put up a sign reading " Al Gore 's New Home " .
The planet can't be warming , they said ; look at all this white stuff !
Romm — a physicist and climate expert with the Center for American Progress — spent a week explaining to reporters why this line of reasoning is so wrong .
Climate change , he said , is all about trend lines .
You do n't observe it by looking out the window but by analyzing decades ' worth of data .
Of course , snowstorm spin is possible only if the public ( and journalists ) are statistically illiterate .
" A lot of this is counterintuitive , " Romm admits .
Statistics is hard .
But that 's not just an issue of individual understanding ; it 's also becoming one of the nation 's biggest political problems .
We live in a world where the thorniest policy issues increasingly boil down to arguments over what the data mean .
If you do n't understand statistics , you do n't know what 's going on — and you can't tell when you 're being lied to .
Statistics should now be a core part of general education .
You should n't finish high school without understanding it reasonably well — as well , say , as you can compose an essay .
Consider the economy : Is it improving or not ?
That 's a statistical question .
You can't actually measure the entire economy , so analysts sample chunks of it — they take a slice here and a slice there and try to piece together a representative story .
One metric that 's frequently touted is same - store sales growth , a comparison of how much each store in a big retail chain is selling compared with a year ago .
It 's been trending upward , which has financial pundits excited .
Problem is , to calculate that stat , economists remove stores that have closed from their sample .
As New York University statistician Kaiser Fung points out , that makes the chains look healthier than they might really be .
Does this methodological issue matter ?
Absolutely :
When politicians see economic numbers pointing upward , they 're less inclined to fund stimulus programs .
Or take the raging debate over childhood vaccination , where well - intentioned parents have drawn disastrous conclusions from anecdotal information .
Activists propagate horror stories of children who seemed fine one day , got vaccinated , and then developed autism .
Of course , as anyone with any exposure to statistics knows , correlation is not causation .
And individual stories do n't prove anything ; when you examine data on the millions of vaccinated kids , even the correlation vanishes .
There are oodles of other examples of how our inability to grasp statistics — and the mother of it all , probability — makes us believe stupid things .
Gamblers think their number is more likely to come up this time because it did n't come up last time .
Political polls are touted by the media even when their samples are laughably skewed .
( This issue breaks left and right , by the way .
Intellectually serious skeptics of anthropogenic climate change argue that the statistical case is weak — that Al Gore and his fellow travelers employ dubious techniques to sample and crunch global temperatures . )
Granted , thinking statistically is tricky .
We like to construct simple cause - and - effect stories to explain the world as we experience it .
" You need to train in this way of thinking .
It 's not easy , " says John Allen Paulos , a Temple University mathematician .
That 's precisely the point .
We often say , rightly , that literacy is crucial to public life :
If you can't write , you can't think .
The same is now true in math .
Statistics is the new grammar .

Addressing Concerns about Padrino
Posted on April 04 , 2010 by Nathan | categories : ruby
Over the last week , we have taken the first steps towards showing Padrino to a larger audience of Ruby and Sinatra fans .
Our team and other developers have gotten around to announcing Padrino on RubyInside , Rubyflow , the Ruby5 Podcast , Hacker News , the Sinatra Google Group , among other sources .
The chatter on twitter and the fact that Padrino has become a most watched ruby repo this month on Github shows this little framework is gaining an audience .
Thus far , our team has been very pleased with the feedback that we have gotten even already after the various announcements .
The response has been overwhelmingly positive and constructive and we wanted to thank everyone for taking the time to explore what Padrino is all about !
At the same time , there have been a couple questions that have popped up along with some valid criticisms and / or confusion as to what the Padrino framework is all about .
I would like to take this blog post as an opportunity to address many of these concerns as well as talk a little bit about the future of Padrino .
Why another web framework ?
Are n’t there enough out there already ?
This is probably the most common criticism that I have seen so far when a developer immediately reacts to hearing about Padrino .
I definitely understand this reaction and I consider this a reasonable question to ask whenever a new web development framework pops onto the stage .
First , I would like to disagree that Padrino is a ‘ new ’ web development framework at all .
When you take a deeper look at Padrino , it quickly becomes clear that we have not strayed far from our Sinatra roots .
This is not a ‘ brand new ’ framework by any stretch .
This is simply an enhanced super - set of Sinatra !
If a developer knows Sinatra , then they already know basic Padrino .
If a gem on Github works currently on rack or Sinatra , the very same gem will already work on Padrino without any modifications whatsoever !
There is virtually nothing about Padrino that steps on Sinatra ’s toes .
Second , I would argue that Padrino is very different from a typical ‘ new ’ web framework .
Padrino ’s codebase is fairly small all things considered .
Not ‘ Sinatra small ’ but certainly fairly miniscule in comparison to Rails or most full - stack frameworks .
During the development of Padrino , our team was committed to absolutely never re-inventing the wheel .
Whenever possible , we have taken popular , existing , and battle - tested libraries and integrated them together to make development easier .
We used usher to enhance routing , a modified pony for developing the mailer , bundler for managing dependencies , and the excellent thor for the generators , tasks and templates .
We understand that new code usually means unstable code and have tried to use existing tools whenever possible !
Third , while we have indeed taken the time to combine excellent libraries and integrate them for the purpose of enhancing Sinatra , it is also important to point out that we have not become an ‘ opinionated ’ framework ’ .
In fact , we have worked hard to make Padrino agnostic and yet still maintain a smooth and easy development flow .
The generators and the admin system are both engineered to be able to support an arbitrary number of different tools or library choices .
A Padrino application could just as easily be using Mongoid , Rspec , Less and Erb or Datamapper , Shoulda , Sass , and Haml .
We do n’t mind and make it easy to use any stack that you already like working with !
Has n’t Padrino ruined the whole intention of Sinatra by making it too heavyweight ?
All three current core developers of Padrino have fairly extensive experience using Rails and Sinatra .
We have developed many applications for hobby , for clients and for companies we have worked for in the past .
I personally cannot say I have much disdain for Rails at all .
In fact , I sincerely enjoyed programming web applications with Rails for years .
However , once I stumbled onto Sinatra and started experimenting with simple applications , I was very impressed with how lightweight and expressive Sinatra could be .
I appreciated Sinatra and the spirit of that micro- framework so much that I started using it for more and more of my development work .
However , anyone who has fallen in love with Sinatra knows that eventually you run into various brick walls and major nuisances that make Sinatra impractical for large applications .
Yet , I felt that with a few standardized additions , Sinatra could easily be enhanced to support applications of an arbitrary size .
Those tools that I built were the early stages of an older library of mine called sinatra_more .
This became modestly popular and from there ( with help from DAddYE , Arthur and others ) , ultimately evolved into the Padrino framework that we have today .
Padrino is about building where Sinatra leaves off and creating a cohesive set of standardized building blocks to allow developers to push Sinatra development to new heights and far more complex applications than typically feasible prior .
Keep in mind that Padrino is simply a superset of Sinatra and that a developer can pick and choose which Padrino features he would like to include in his application .
In fact , Padrino is modular enough that most of the functionality can be included right inside an existing Sinatra application rather easily .
How does Padrino compare to Monk , Chicago , sinatra_more , Pancake , etc ?
Another common question that I have seen emerge is an explanation on how Padrino compares to existing Sinatra ‘ glue ’ extension such as Monk , Chicago , sinatra_more , Pancake .
Here I will briefly outline what each existing one is and how this differs from Padrino .
Monk is primarily a skeleton ( bare application ) which gives you a solid starting point for developing a Sinatra application .
The default skeleton will give you a Sinatra application with a structure , which can be tested using Contest , Rack : : Test and Webrat .
To store things you ’ll have Ohm , a persistence layer that talks to Redis .
Other niceties included , like a logger , a settings hash and proper reloading for easier development .
While monk is a very cool library , it is actually quite a bit different in scope from Padrino .
Monk does allow for creating skeletons of different types , but no proper ‘ generator ’ is available and the skeletons provided do not really compare to totally agnostic generators that are offered by Padrino .
Padrino also provides all of the niceties afforded by monk ( improved logger , configuration hash , proper development reloaded ) along with other great features like i18n localization , admin dashboard , mail delivery , view helpers , form helpers , form builders , enhanced routing and much more .
Chicago is a library filled with “ testing helpers , extensions , and macros used commonly by Thumble Monks ” .
Looking at Chicago , you can tell that the developers were running into some of the same annoyances that led to the development of Padrino .
Chicago provides enhanced support for SASS in your application , basic helpers such as ‘ anchor ’ , ‘ stylesheet_include ’ , and ‘ javascript_include ’ along with helpers to make testing easier with a few frameworks .
Chicago is undoubtedly an excellent library and in many ways a precursor to Padrino : : Helpers which contains nearly all the functionality within Chicago and much , much more .
If you like Chicago , you will love using Padrino for the same reasons .
sinatra_more is the direct ancestor of Padrino .
The developers of both are the same and the intention of them both are almost exactly the same .
Padrino simply builds off of what sinatra_more started and created a more comprehensive and integrated set of functionality .
If you have enjoyed using sinatra_more , Padrino provides everything you have appreciated along with many additional features .
pancake is a very cool project that provides very useful helpers on top of Rack that assist in constructing Rack stacks as mixins .
Almost all key aspects of web frameworks are covered in Pancake as mixins to help you create your own re-usable Rack Stacks without worrying about the really low level plumbing .
Pancake actually overlaps very little with Padrino .
I recommend experimenting with Padrino applications as part of the Pancake Rack stack !
In addition , there are admittedly lots of libraries that provide small subsets of the functionality afforded by Padrino .
Many of these libraries are great and there is nothing about Padrino that prevents them from being used !
In fact , any library that you can use in Sinatra can be used the exact same way with Padrino .
Padrino simply gives you a very strong starting point for building powerful Sinatra applications .
For more information on Padrino , be sure to read our page devoted to why to use our framework which contains additional explanations and comparisons .

Found sound collage gurus the Books return with a new album this July on Temporary Residence .
The album is called The Way Out and here 's your first listen .
" Beautiful People " boasts backwards vox , calming singing about science and math , brass , and a ( relatively ) rigorous drum beat .
Nobody else really makes music like this .
Check out our interview with the guys from last year for more details on the forthcoming record .
ABC News reports that since quitting in the middle of her first term as Governor of Alaska , Wasilla Hockey Mom Sarah Palin has hauled in at least $ 12 million .
That conservative estimate is based on publicly available records and news accounts .
The actual number is probably much higher , but is hard to quantify because Palin does not publicize her earnings .
She reputedly got a $ 7 million deal for her first book , with the bulk of that money due after her resignation as governor , and $ 250,000 per episode , according to the entertainment trade press , for each of eight episodes of a reality show about Alaska for the The Learning Channel .
She has managed to keep a lid on reliable figures for her earnings from a multi- year contract with Fox News and a second book deal with HarperCollins .
A Palin aide responding to questions from ABC News said the governor " is now a private citizen .
As a result , her fees and earnings are private . "
China is set to overtake Japan as the world 's second biggest economy China 's economy grew at an annual rate of 11.9 % in the first quarter of the year , which experts say could lead to a revaluation of the yuan .
The growth figure was slightly higher than expected , while consumer price inflation was surprisingly low at 2.2 % .
" We have got off to a good start this year , " a Chinese spokesman said .
The figures have helped to fuel debate among experts about whether the recent fiscal stimulus package could be stoking up problems for the economy .
" There is a lot of talk about overheating , " Glenn Maguire , chief economist for Asia Pacific at Societe Generale , told the BBC .
" But the classic symptom is inflation . "
March 's consumer price inflation was 2.4 % versus expectations of 2.7 % , and producer price inflation was 5.9 % versus the expected 6.4 % .
KEY DATA RELEASED Q1 growth : + 11.9 % ( year - on - year ) Q1 industrial production : +19.6 % Q1 fixed asset investment : +25.6 % Q1 retail sales : +17.9 % Q1 CPI : +2.4 % March CPI : +2.4 % March PPI : +5.9 % " There had been speculation on the back of strong construction data [ of ] an imminent rate hike , " added Mr Maguire .
But given the low inflation , he now thinks the next step will be a revaluation of the yuan .
Either policy - a rise in interest rates or an increase in the value of the yuan - could be used to help slow the Chinese economy .
However , China has been under pressure from President Obama to address the yuan , which many commentators say is undervalued and gives the Chinese an unfair advantage in export markets .
But the Chinese refuse to be rushed .
" I think , on the exchange rate problem , the biggest headache we face is n't the economic problem , rather it is that this problem is being highly politicised , " Chinese commerce minister Yi Xiao Zhun told the BBC .
" China should still maintain stability in the trade policy and exchange rate policy , " he added .
Wasted investment ?
However , other economists fear that the rush by the Chinese authorities to boost investment spending during the global recession may have been too hasty .
Property prices surged in March , heightening fears of a bubble .
" In the short term you can get as much growth as you are willing to pay for " , Michael Pettis , professor at Peking University 's Guanghua School of Management , told the BBC .
" [ But ] it has turned out to be very hard for Beijng to rein in investment spending , especially at the local [ government ] level , " he added .
" The worry is that these seemingly - strong growth numbers may reflect a surge in investing that turns out to be very wasteful in the longer run . "
Bubble Data showed that urban property prices in March grew at their fastest rate in over four years .
Cheap and plentiful loans are helping to push up housing prices and raising fears of a bubble , BBC business reporter Linda Duffin says .
That is why mortgage rates have been raised and a new sales tax on homes has been introduced , she adds .
But the low inflation rate in the first quarter eases pressure on Beijing 's policymakers to raise interest rates and cool the boom .
And if the government is successful at keeping growth at a manageable rate , China is likely to overtake Japan as the world 's second biggest economy this year , our reporter says .
Li Xiaochao , spokesman for China 's National Bureau of Statistics , told reporters in Beijing that the " momentum of national economic recovery " had further expanded and there was " a good foundation for reaching the targets set for the whole year " .

Child rape inside the catholic church is spinning madly past the zone of WTF and straight into the twilight zone of " can this really be happening ? "
Another predatory preacher in the land that tries to sell itself as something like a constitutional republic has come forward and admitted to molesting over 200 kids , including two of his own children !
Words do n't describe the depth of this kind of crime .
Maybe if these child raping pigs had a faith that actually held them accountable for their own actions , they 'd act like civilized people .

Looking at the iPad app rollout , you can easily separate the digital wheat from the chaff in the content industries , and you can see those who are developing digital businesses and those who are trying to protect print margins and who see the iPad as a vertical , closed model to control and monetise content .
There are those who believe that they sell content and that they should be compensated for it .
Just as with the music industry , they couch this in terms of repaying content creators , when it really is more about wistfulness for the days of double - digit profit margins .
Those who view their primary business as selling content believe that not only can they charge for it but that they can actually charge the same or more for it , just because it is on the iPad .
Time , for example , is charging $ 4.99 a week for their iPad ‘ magazine ’ .
Scott Karp , CEO of Publish2 and editor of Publishing2.0 , put it as clearly as it needs to be put on Twitter :
Paying $ 4.99 for magazine on newsstand includes cost of printing / distribution .
Now you pay for iPad instead , so magazine should cost less .
What do you get for $ 4.99 a week ?
Unique interactivity including landscape and portrait mode , scroll navigation and customizable font size
Oh , I ’ve never seen that in a mobile web browser , I say with incalculable levels of sarcasm .
That ’s like morons in the 90s having Java animation that you actually could n’t do anything with and calling that interactivity .
You think that ’s insane and delusional , just wait , it gets even better !
No content sharing on the app , which I ’m assuming means you ca n’t bookmark or Tweet your favourite stories , and you ’ll have to buy and download the app every single week .
There is also no indication that they will charge for their now free iPhone app or their website .
Note to Time digital strategists :
Sorry caching your site so I can take it with me when I ’m on the move is n’t a feature worth your premium pricing .
I do that now , and have done it for years , with an open - source app called Plucker and an aging Palm T3 .
I ’m truly sorry .
Do you actually use the internet or digital devices or do you just indulge your bosses ’ angry fantasies about the good old days ?
Let ’s look to Rupert Murdoch ’s proud paid content pioneer , the Wall Street Journal .
What is the Wall Street Journal selling ?
The past .
Alan Murray , deputy managing editor and executive editor , online for the Wall Street Journal , says on MarketWatch :
We have come up with a version of the Wall Street Journal on the iPad that I think is closest you get to a newspaper reading experience on a digital device .
To be fair to Murray , he goes on to say that anyone giving their content away for free on the web wo n’t be able to convert those readers on the web to paid readers on the iPad .
Murray says :
You have these apps , but you also have a web browser .
So I do n’t see how any newspaper that is giving its content away for free on the web is going to be saved by the iPad because the iPad makes it easier to access that free content .
Unless the Wall Street Journal ’s app not only delivers me a ‘ newspaper reading experience ’ ( which I frankly am not missing anyway ) but also picks my stocks for me so that I can retire next year , I ’m not going to pay $ 17.99 a month for it when I can subscribe to their website for $ 1.99 a week .
I did n’t work on a journalist ’s salary and still manage to be in a financially secure position by giving money away to grumpy old media moguls like Murdoch .
Paul Kedrosky , venture capitalist and private equity investor who writes the blog Infectious Greed , said on Twitter :
Paying $ 17.29 / mo for WSJ iPad app should disqualify you for something important , like being allowed to use money .
As I ’ve said before , Murdoch for all of his brash brilliance has no understanding of the economics of digital businesses .
I give him props for still having the power to shift the discussion , and I think that his paywall strategy at the Times might help it stem its £ 250,000 a day losses .
However , his paywall strategy is a defensive move , not a long term strategy .
Unless he starts building credible digitally - focused businesses as soon as the paywall brings in some cash to stabilise the business , it will be a brief pause on the path to collapse .
Now , let ’s look at other strategies for the iPad .
Let ’s look at the FT .
Robert Andrews , UK editor of paidContent , says that the FT secured sponsorship that allows it to offer its iPad app for free for two months , after which time they will shift to subscription model with the promise of additional features .
Much cleverer .
Suw and I talk often that one thing really lacking when it comes to digital content is commercial experimentation .
The FT securing sponsorship for a free app for two months is a good step at not only experimenting with content but also with payment models .
The Economist earlier this year released a report on social networking , allowing users to download it for free and giving sponsor prominent credit for the offer .
This is clever .
Premium sponsorship opportunities for special content or services .
Look at the development thinking behind National Public Radio ’s iPad app .
They did market research and found that up to 5 % of their audience were planning on buying an iPad .
They knew what the opportunity was .
They also used iPad development to improve the experience for visitors coming from search or social networking services , explains Kinsey Wilson , senior vice president and general manager of NPR Digital Media .
Compare the strategies and thinking .
On the one hand we have a set of pricing models that deliver marginal value for premium prices and show very little that differentiate themselves from the web experience , although they expect to charge more .
These pricing models are based on a sense of entitlement to set pricing as it was in the days of print .
I wo n’t even call them strategies because they lack any kind of realistic strategic thinking .
On the other hand we have a set of strategic pricing structures .
NPR takes a realistic look at the commercial potential , does market research and develops its app not just for a single device but also as a chance to make improvements to their overall service .
The FT experiments not just with content but also with the commercial strategy .
In terms of who is positioning themselves for the future by delivering value to their audiences and experimenting with business models , it ’s clear .
If any company thinks that the iPad will allow them to rebuild the monopoly rent pricing structure of the 20th Century , then you ’ve really fallen prey to the Steve Jobs ’ reality distortion field , and you ’ve blown yet another chance to build a credible digital business .
However , I ’ve got a game you might want to check out , Final Fantasy .

President Obama meets with Chinese President Hu Jintao at the Nuclear Security Summit .
Obama 's nuclear wizardry and Iran
Sir Francis
Bacon once said , “ In civil business , what first ?
Boldness .
What second and third ?
Boldness .
And yet boldness is a child of ignorance and baseness . ”
At the Nuclear Security Summit President Barack Obama is presiding over in a transportation - gridlocked Washington this week , he is achieving a boldness — but not of bravado .
Rather , it is one of calculated subtlety and strategic depth .

Obama has brought together 47 world leaders to get them to commit to safer nuclear materials management practices and prevent trafficking in weapons of mass destruction .
Obama is changing the direction of global gravity .
He is also confronting Iran without the shallowness of bombing vs. sanctions vs. public humiliation that his administration has been flirting with .
In the past week , and over the next month , Obama is showing what a U.S. - led world order should look like .
This is a huge shift , for the world has n’t had much faith in America ’s abilities to deliver .
For example , in taking on strategic challenges like getting the Israelis and Palestinians on a two - state pathway ; or ending the anachronistically simmering Cold War conflict in U.S. - Cuba relations ; or persuading Iran to forgo a nuclear weapons track , most of the world has seen an America unable to achieve the objectives it sets out for itself .
In recent years , this has translated into a sense that the United States is a well - branded , globally important but underperforming country , whose influence is weakening — more like a national version of General Motors than Google .
Now , out of the blue , Obama is changing the game .
In a quick succession of deals focused on pre-empting a 21st - century nuclear nightmare , Obama has mended the foundation and infrastructure of a global nonproliferation regime that United Nations Ambassador John Bolton , Sen. Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) , Vice President Dick Cheney and others of the pugnacious nationalist wing of the last administration worked hard to tear down .
And , by bringing together 47 key leaders , Obama is signaling to all stakeholders that a nuclear crisis with Iran and other potential breakout states would undermine the global commons .
Yet he is not vilifying Iran or its leaders .
He is not making the same “ axis of evil ” mistake President George W. Bush did .
Instead , Obama is showing the benign and constructive side of U.S. power to other great states like India , China , Brazil and Russia .
He is also inviting Iran to get in compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and get back into a club that matters — where Iran could be respected for adopting a sensible course .
This comes on the heels of Obama ’s release last week of a Nuclear Posture Review .
It pledges to cut the size of the nuclear weapons footprint in U.S. arsenals while simultaneously influencing the cost - benefit realities for nations either “ in ” or “ out ” of the nuclear nonproliferation club .
The most obvious holdouts are Iran and North Korea — but frankly , there ’s also Israel .
The nuclear review also makes clear that the biggest nuclear concerns are nonstate actors , not states .
Obama has made a Faustian bargain in this new review .
For he is allotting more financial resources to U.S. labs for maintenance and modernization of the current weapons stockpile , while pulling the plug on new weapons development .
Vice President Joe Biden should be given the credit for this crucial deal , which kept the national security right from mugging the president during the process .
Finally , Obama has signed a historic strategic arms reduction treaty with the Russians .
This reverses the erosion of a relationship that — like the U.S. - China relationship — is crucial to virtually all the administration ’s goals .
The primary reason driving Defense Secretary Robert Gates to stay on in the administration was to reconfigure U.S. - Russia relations .
It had become so riddled with suspicion that Russia may well have vetoed any U.S. progress on the Iran front .
Senior Russian officials tell me that the tag team of Gates on the military side and Undersecretary of State Ellen Tauscher on the diplomatic front changed the climate from unproductive mutual skepticism and hostility to pragmatic respect .
And this may now lead to new collaborations .
Coming next , in May , is sure to be reactivated U.S. leadership at the once - every - five - years review of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Five years ago , Washington conveyed its disdain through envoys , whose policy postures were shaped by Bolton ’s suspicions of international groups that bordered on a hyper - view of U.S. sovereignty .
This NPT review with U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice and Tauscher — and with Obama at the helm — is now a part of a soft but perhaps effective strategy to contain Iran ’s nuclear pretensions .
The administration ’s team has worked hard to entice China and Russia into a partnership so they do not become more allied with Iran ’s course than Washington’s .
Obama has now showed two essential strengths .
First , he can deliver what he promised in September 2009 , when he chaired a special Security Council session .
Second , his team understands the difference between approaches that have strategic depth and can move global players into new positions versus those that are vapidly bilateral and uncompelling to either party .
Before Obama reset this new global contract on nuclear issues , Washington and Tehran had negotiated via public jabs .
Meanwhile , the U.S. - led effort to impose harsh sanctions on Iran was more about feeding U.S. political opinion than successfully steering Iran in a new direction .
Getting key stakeholders sewn together on this , through revitalized global institutions , is a far more effective way to animate the choices Iran may make .
Obama ’s global nuclear wizardry — focused on Iran and North Korea — may yet fail .
He still needs to find a way to deal with the Iranian leadership ’s paranoia about Western regime change efforts .
He also has to balance carrots for Iran with constraints .
But Obama and his team are finally showing a Nixonian deftness for creating new possibilities at just the time the world believed America was a global has - been .

Whatever the reason , the fact that so many young adults were n’t firmly rooted in the workforce even before the crash is deeply worrying .
It means that a very large number of young adults entered the recession already vulnerable to all the ills that joblessness produces over time .
It means that for a sizeable proportion of 20 - and 30 - somethings , the next few years will likely be toxic .
No young people were present at a seminar for the unemployed held on November 4 in Reading , Pennsylvania , a blue - collar city about 60 miles west of Philadelphia .
The meeting was organized by a regional nonprofit , Joseph ’s People , and held in the basement of the St. Catharine ’s parish center .
All 30 or so attendees , sitting around a U - shaped table , looked to be 40 or older .
But one middle - aged man , one of the first to introduce himself to the group , said he and his wife were there on behalf of their son , Errol .
“ He ’s so disgusted that he did n’t want to come , ” the man said .
“ He does n’t know what to do , and we do n’t either . ”
I talked to Errol a few days later .
He is 28 and has a gentle , straightforward manner .
He graduated from high school in 1999 and has lived with his parents since then .
He worked in a machine shop for a couple of years after school , and has also held jobs at a battery factory , a sandpaper manufacturer , and a restaurant , where he was a cook .
The restaurant closed in June 2008 , and apart from a few days of work through temp agencies , he has n’t had a job since .
He calls in to a few temp agencies each week to let them know he ’s interested in working , and checks the newspaper for job listings every Sunday .
Sometimes he goes into CareerLink , the local unemployment office , to see if it has any new listings .
He does work around the house , or in the small machine shop he ’s set up in the garage , just to fill his days , and to try to keep his skills up .
“ I was thinking about moving , ” he said .
“ I ’m just really not sure where .
Other places where I traveled , I did n’t really see much of a difference with what there was here . ”
He ’s still got a few thousand dollars in the bank , which he saved when he was working as a machinist , and is mostly living off that ; he ’s been trading penny stocks to try to replenish those savings .
I asked him what he foresaw for his working life .
“ As far as my job position , ” he said , “ I really do n’t know what I want to do yet .
I ’m not sure . ”
When he was little , he wanted to be a mechanic , and he did enjoy the machine trade .
But now there was hardly any work to be had , and what there was paid about the same as Walmart .
“ I do n’t think there ’s any way that you can have a job that you can think you can retire off of , ” he said .
“ I think everyone ’s going to have to transfer to another job . ”
He said the only future he could really imagine for himself now was just moving from job to job , with no career to speak of .
“ That ’s what I think , ” he said .
“ I do n’t want to . ”
Men and Family in a Jobless Age
In her classic sociology of the Depression , The Unemployed Man and His Family , Mirra Komarovsky vividly describes how joblessness strained — and in many cases fundamentally altered — family relationships in the 1930s .
During 1935 and 1936 , Komarovsky and her research team interviewed the members of 59 white middle - class families in which the husband and father had been out of work for at least a year .
Her research revealed deep psychological wounds .
“ It is awful to be old and discarded at 40 , ” said one father .
“ A man is not a man without work . ”
Another said plainly , “ During the depression I lost something .
Maybe you call it self - respect , but in losing it I also lost the respect of my children , and I am afraid I am losing my wife . ”
Noted one woman of her husband , “ I still love him , but he does n’t seem as ‘ big ’ a man . ”
The man who falsely confessed nearly four years ago to murdering JonBenet Ramsey is under investigation for cyberstalking a woman he met when he was a teacher and she was 9 years old , a Seattle TV station reports .
KING 5 News is reporting that Samantha Spiegel , 19 , told Inside Edition that she first met John Mark Karr in San Francisco 10 years ago when he taught there as a substitute teacher .
They reconnected over video chat and e-mail .
When she tried to break off their relationship , she claimed that Karr threatened to kill her , according to the TV station ’s Web site .
San Francisco police told KING 5
News that they are investigating Karr .
Karr was arrested in August 2006 in Thailand after confessing to killing Ramsey , the 6 - year - old beauty queen , in her Boulder home on Dec. 26 , 1996 .
A DNA analysis 12 days later revealed Karr was lying about the murder .
KING 5 News said Karr may be living in Seattle and may have changed his appearance to look like a woman .
He even stayed at a shelter for battered women , the report states .
The station cites court documents showing that Karr changed his name to Alexis Valoran Reich in Washington ’s King County district court in 2008 .
Spiegel said Karr , against whom she has a restraining order , became a woman in to get closer to young girls , the TV station reported .
“ That ’s part of the reason he wants to change his appearance , ” Spiegel said .
The station claimed that Karr is also accused of trying to form a cult of JonBenet look - alikes , and that he would call these young girls “ The Immaculates . ”

When you talk to most Americans about taxes , primarily what they think about is the U.S. government and the federal income tax .
But while that may be the biggest tax that most Americans pay , the reality is that the truly insidious nature of the tax system in the United States is how it sucks money out of us in dozens of different ways until we do n’t even feel it anymore .
Instead of having one or two big tax bills , U.S. taxpayers face a “ death by a thousand cuts ” as tax after tax after tax just keeps coming .
Most Americans do n’t even realize how many kinds of taxes they pay .
Before reading the rest of this article , try to estimate how many different kinds of taxes that Americans pay each year .
Five ?
Ten ?
Twenty ?
Well , below we have listed over 50 different kinds of taxes that Americans pay .
It is no wonder the Tea Party movement is growing so fast !
People are sick and tired of constantly being financially drained by tax after tax .
But even as you read this , members of the White House panel charged with reducing the U.S. national debt are considering recommending the adoption of a “ European - style ” Value Added Tax as a way for the U.S. government to bring in even more money .
Well , the truth is that millions upon millions of Americans are quite sick of being taxed into financial oblivion and they have one giant message for those who want to tax us some more ….
“ We Are Being Taxed Enough Already ! ”
Just consider the following list of the various types of taxes that Americans have to pay each and every year …..
Accounts Receivable Tax
Building Permit Tax
Capital Gains Tax
CDL license Tax
Cigarette Tax
Corporate Income Tax
Court Fines ( indirect taxes )
Dog License Tax

When you add all the taxes together , a significant percentage of Americans end up paying well over 50 percent of their income in taxes of one form or another .
And the list above does not even include all of the new taxes that are in the new health care law that was just rammed down the throats of the American people .
When you add up all the taxes in that bill , it amounts to the largest tax increase in the history of the United States .
But if you enjoy being taxed until you are dry then none of this should bother you .
Sadly , according to an official U.S. government report , even with all of this taxation rapidly growing interest costs on the national debt together with spending on major entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare will absorb approximately 92 cents of every dollar of federal revenue by the year 2019 .
That is before a penny will be spent on anything else .
Because of our reckless financial insanity , the U.S. government is now facing a financial crisis of unprecedented magnitude .
But whatever we end up giving to the federal government just never seems to be enough .
It ’s voracious appetite for spending just seems to multiply the bigger it gets .
The really tragic thing is that the U.S. federal government is not just spending our money .
It is spending the money of our children and our grandchildren and of our great grandchildren .
We are being taxed into oblivion and yet the U.S. government apparently has no shame in stealing increasing amounts of money from future generations year after year after year .
Do you think that the U.S. federal government will one day wake up and decide that we are being taxed enough already ?
No .
The truth is that unless we vote out all of the Republicans and all of the Democrats that have been taxing us to death , they will keep right on doing it .
We deserve better and future generations deserve better .
Caltrain has gone broke and will likely need to wipe out half its service — including weekend , nighttime and midday trains — officials warned Thursday , bracing passengers for a major shake - up to the popular commuter line that links San Francisco to the South Bay .
“ This is not an April Fools ’ joke , ” Caltrain CEO Mike Scanlon told the agency ’s board of directors .
“ This is real .
We ’re at a watershed moment where there ’s a possibility this railroad could go away . ”
Scanlon said the service cuts , which would idle trains for much of the day , would need to be completed by June 2011 , although the agency may begin slashing its schedule as soon as this fall .
The train line is falling victim to a combination of declining revenues from state and local agencies and falling ridership .
Although officials expect a passionate outcry from riders who depend on Caltrain , they insisted the dire warnings are n’t a ploy to justify more fee increases or tax hikes .
The cuts would hamper those who rely on Caltrain to get to work during odd hours , prevent most service to special events such as San Francisco Giants and San Jose Sharks games , and leave cities planning dense developments near train stations in the lurch .
The cuts would affect an average of 18,211 weekend riders , 5,718 midday riders and 2,082 nighttime riders , officials said .
Caltrain ’s board , needing to slice about $ 30 million from its $ 97 million budget , will vote on specific proposals at a future meeting after holding public hearings .
Caltrain officials said the service cuts will further jam traffic on roadways .
The majority of Caltrain ’s 40,000 daily passengers ride during commute times , and much of that service may remain untouched because it is the most profitable .
But Caltrain also runs hourly service that stops at every station on weekends , plus on weekdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and after 8 p.m .
Those trains , including 32 on Saturday and 28 on Sunday , are facing elimination .
John Murphy rides Caltrain from San Francisco to work in Santa Clara , balancing the commute with taking care of his young son .
He said the midday cuts would be “ horrible ” and would force him and his wife to buy a second car , move closer to his office or switch jobs .
“ All the jobs I can do are down here ” in Silicon Valley , Murphy said .
“ My wife is in marketing — all her jobs are up ( in San Francisco ) .
Caltrain makes it work . ”
Caltrain ’s financial state has long been declining , and officials trimmed the weekday schedule from 98 to 90 trains in August and hiked fares in early 2009 .
The agency has lost $ 10 million in funding from the state each of the past three years .
And for more than a year , it has been losing riders , which account for 40 percent of its revenue .
But now a new , more damaging problem has emerged .
Scanlon , who is also the CEO of the San Mateo County Transit District , or SamTrans , said he will ask that agency ’s board of directors to lower its Caltrain contribution by nearly 70 percent by July 2011 .
SamTrans , the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority and San Francisco Muni each provide Caltrain with a subsidy , which combined amounts to $ 39.4 million .
But with the smaller SamTrans contribution , VTA and Muni will lower their shares proportionately .
SamTrans , Muni and VTA all recently cut service and raised fares , and Scanlon said they are “ beyond broke . ”
A fare increase has not been proposed , as officials say it would drive away even more riders .
They also do n’t expect to propose any ballot measures , such as tax increases , citing the recession .
As part of the service cuts , some employees would lose their jobs , although officials are not sure how many .
It costs $ 60.4 million per year to run the railroad , plus another $ 13.8 million for fuel and $ 9.9 million for administration .
The agency spends the remaining $ 11.9 million on shuttles , insurance , maintenance , utilities and other services .
Officials stopped short of saying they expected to close the railroad , which has been open since 1863 and carrying passengers since 1904 , but said the news calls into question the operator ’s ability to survive .
Scanlon said the agency ’s business model is simply not sustainable .
“ We ’re rapidly approaching a cliff , ” he said .
“ It ’s going to be very , very painful .
It ’s probably going to force people back to congested freeways .
People are n’t going to be able to get to jobs ; they ’re not going to have basic mobility . ”
Scanlon said there are some long - shot possibilities for more money — such as the reinstatement of state transit assistance or help from the Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission .
But he said it would have to be a yearly commitment from a government during a climate in which they are all spending less .
“ I do n’t see any silver bullets , ” he said .
At the Caltrain station in Santa Clara on Thursday afternoon , those waiting to ride the train were n’t happy to hear the news .
“ Ca n’t we do something about this ? ” asked Alyssa Salcido , a 20 - year - old Santa Clara University student .
“ I know a ton of students who ( use Caltrain to ) go into the city to see a play or have dinner or go to the games .
I ’m not for this at all . ”
Salcido , who does not have a car , said she rides Caltrain to visit her siblings in San Francisco .
Without Caltrain , “ How am I going to get there , fly ? ”
Anna Koster of Santa Clara had a similar reaction .
“ Oh my God , that would be terrible , ” Koster said .
“ It looks like I could just get to and from work , but could never get sick and leave early or stay really late .
I also use Caltrain to go to San Francisco on the weekends , and that would be out . ”

PHOENIX -- Arizona lawmakers expressing doubt over whether President Barack Obama was born in the United States are pushing a bill through the Legislature that would require the president to show his birth certificate to get on the state 's 2012 ballot .
The House passed the measure Wednesday on a 31 - 29 vote , ignoring protests from opponents who said it 's casting Arizona in an ugly light and could give the elected secretary of state broad powers to kick a presidential candidate off the ballot .
" We 're becoming a national joke , " Rep. Chad Campbell , a Phoenix Democrat who opposes the measure , said Thursday .
The measure 's sponsor , Republican Rep. Judy Burges of Skull Valley , said she is n't sure Obama could prove his eligibility for the ballot in Arizona and wants to erase all doubts .
" You have half the population who thinks everything is fine , and you have the other half of the population who has had doubts built up in their mind , " Burges said .
So -called " birthers " have contended since the 2008 presidential campaign that Obama is ineligible to be president because , they argue , he was actually born in Kenya , his father 's homeland .
The Constitution says that a person must be a " natural - born citizen " to be eligible for the presidency .
Hawaii officials have repeatedly confirmed Obama 's citizenship , and his Hawaiian birth certificate has been made public , along with birth notices from two Honolulu newspapers published within days of his birth in August 1961 .
Courts have rebuffed lawsuits challenging Obama 's eligibility , but the issue has n't gone away .
Lawmakers have introduced similar bills in a handful of other states .
They include Oklahoma , where a measure passed the House but failed in the Senate , and Missouri , where a bill was withdrawn before any action was taken .
Eleven U.S. House Republicans have signed on to a federal bill , but it has n't received a hearing in the Democrat - controlled House .
Arizona 's measure would require U.S. presidential candidates to submit documents to the secretary of state proving they meet the constitutional requirements to be president .
The secretary of state could then decide to keep a candidate off the Arizona ballot if he or she had reasonable cause to believe the candidate was ineligible .
Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett opposes the bill , arguing it gives his office too much power , according to his spokesman Matthew Benson .
Benson said Bennett , a Republican , has no doubts about Obama 's citizenship .
The bill now goes to the Senate , where supporters are trying to pull together enough votes to pass the measure .
If they do , it 's unclear if Republican Gov. Jan Brewer will give it her support .
Her spokesman , Paul Senseman , said the governor wo n't comment on pending legislation , but he added she does n't have doubts about Obama 's citizenship .
The measure comes amid a string of controversial proposals in Arizona that have garnered national attention , including a sweeping illegal immigration crackdown awaiting action by the governor and a measure allowing people to carry concealed weapons without permits .
The governor signed the gun bill last week .
Rep .
Tom Chabin , D - Flagstaff , pleaded with his colleagues to oppose the birth certificate measure Wednesday .
" When you undermine the sitting president of the United States , you undermine our nation , and it makes us look very ugly , " Chabin said Thursday .
But some supporters insist the bill is n't aimed at Obama , it 's just common sense .
" It 's our ballot , " said state Sen. Jack Harper , R- Surprise , who believes Obama has proven his citizenship .
" The parties need to prove that their nominee is eligible to hold the office of president to be on our ballot . "

The Harstad - based company Hydra Tidal will install a full - scale ( 1.5 - MW ) prototype of its tidal energy plant at Gimsøystraumen , a marine channel in Nordland County .
The Morild floating power plant will be moored to the seabed and mostly submerged , with turbine wings spanning a diameter of 23 metres .
However , its most unique feature is that its turbine blades are made of laminated pine .
Wood has not been used in modern turbine blade designs for decades .
But company founder and R&D director Svein D. Henriksen extols the virtues of wood for such applications .
“ Wood is a porous , homogenous material — so it has better mechanical and hydrological characteristics than today ’s conventional materials such as composites and steel .
The major challenge is the actual assembly process , but we believe we have found a good solution . ”
He points out that using wood in turbine blades is also an environmentally sound choice , especially in a lifecycle perspective .
Assembly , installation and maintenance are simpler for a floating facility than for one permanently anchored to the seabed .
The Morild power plant can be assembled on land and then towed to its operating location for installation .
It can also be detached and floated to the surface for repair .
Two Projects with Research Council Funding
Hydra Tidal is receiving funding for two different projects under the Research Council of Norway ’s RENERGI programme .
One project is studying Morild ’s wood components at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology ( NTNU ) laboratories in Trondheim and will verify the company ’s findings .
The other project involves testing the effects of extreme environmental conditions on the entire Morild construction .
The primary objective is to examine , test and analyse how such conditions affect a floating facility for converting the energy of slow coastal currents , tidal streams and ocean currents .
The projects will culminate in a full - scale test in the water in June 2010 .
The costs of developing the concept have totalled roughly NOK 125 million over the last 10 years , funded primarily by a large number of industrial participants and investors .
International Potential , Job Creation
In the channel where Morild is to be placed at the end of June , the maximum current is 3.5 knots , with tidal periods of six hours , 20 minutes .
The plant will start out generating a modest 1 GWh annually , but the testing phase is intended to focus on verifying the technology rather than on production levels .
“ After testing , we will move the plant to Moskenesstraumen ( a channel with tidal streams up to six knots ) , where its output will be stepped up considerably , ” explains Mr Henriksen , who also has great ambitions for Morild internationally .
“ There are powerful ocean currents along many of the world ’s coastlines , and foreign players have shown considerable interest in this project .
At the moment we have patent applications being processed in about 20 countries . ”
“ Our objective is to develop this technology in close collaboration with Norwegian industry players in order to create jobs in Norway .
This can be done , provided that there are conducive framework conditions for commercialising successful technologies . ”
Although he is a proponent of establishing better commercialisation schemes in Norway , Mr Henriksen believes that funding for development should remain highly competitive .
“ That ’s the only way to ensure that the winning technologies really are the best ones in the long run . ”

Discussion forums on the internet have not welcomed Harper Collins 's marketing ploy , with reviewers on Amazon sharing their displeasure .
One said : " How disgusting that they 'll take a literary classic , and revamp it just so it looks like the " teen sensation " that is Twilight .
Drawing this parallel is an absolute atrocity , Emily Bronte would be turning in her grave if she could see this .

Paul Krugman repeated his criticisms of Republicans he made last week and hit Mitch McConnell for his lie that resolution authority is setting the banks up for future bailouts .
Krugman :
Anyone who says we need to be bipartisan should bear in mind that for the last several weeks Mitch McConnell , the Senate Minority Leader had been trying to stop reform with possibly the most dishonest argument ever made in the history of politics , which is the claim that having regulation of the banks actually bailing out the banks and that basically the argument boiled down to saying what we really need to do to deal with fires is abolish the fire department , because then people will know that they can't let their buildings burn in the first place , right .
It 's an incredible ... so anyone who says bipartisan does n't include the Senate Minority Leader .
Here 's more from Krugman 's column on the topic The Fire Next Time :
A range of activities to help you get involved with nature , whether you are at home , in the park or on the beach .
To most of the world , the majestic Alps present a scene of wonder .
But to European merchants and truckers , they present a troublesome and costly roadblock .
Enter the ambitious AlpTransit Tunnel .
At just over 56 miles , this Swiss monster is the longest tunnel in the world .
That is , it will be once workers complete this enormous project .
Follow a team of miners as they risk death beneath billions of pounds of mountain , slowly but surely carving out massive support and maintenance tunnels .
For the main channel , engineers use custom - designed TBMs ( Tunnel Boring Machines ) – 250 feet long , 33 feet in diameter , with 500 - pound drilling heads that pound the rock into submission .
But , it ’s not as simple as digging a hole .
In this subterranean world , rock actually explodes , walls crumble , floods erupt and great rivers of mud are seemingly everywhere .
Watch as technicians outfit their men with special laser imaging equipment that helps workers forecast potential fractures and cave - ins .
Once a section has been dug , concrete walls are thrown up to keep the newly carved portion from collapsing – but if the concrete dries too fast , it implodes under the pressure , and the mountain comes crashing down .
It ’s just another day at the office for the world ’s most extreme engineers .
MELBOURNE
City Council sent the cleaners into Hosier Lane on Thursday to tidy up the rat - infested garbage , but they caught the wrong rat .
A request by deputy lord mayor Susan Riley to clean up the laneway , world famous for its colourful street art , inadvertently resulted in the painting over of a stencil of a rat by the celebrated British graffiti artist Banksy .
'' I went down there on Thursday and saw the cleaners and said : ' You realise you have just painted over a Banksy ? ' , '' Hosier Lane resident Kerry Butcher told The Age yesterday .
'' And they said : ' We are just doing what we 're told ' . ''
Banksy , who created several stencils in Melbourne on a visit in 2003 , is regarded as the world 's foremost street artist .
In 2008 , a London wall bearing one of his stencils allegedly sold on eBay for $ 472,528 .
His works on paper sell at auction for hundreds of thousands of dollars .
Last week lord mayor Robert Doyle was pictured in The Age under a stencil of himself in Hosier Lane as he praised its street art as a ' ' legitimate expression of artistic intent ' ' .
On “ dual loyalty ”
Last week , the online journal Politico published a story by reporter Laura Rozen on certain divisions within the Obama administration on Middle East policy .
What made the story especially explosive was a quotation from an unnamed administration source describing senior White House aide Dennis Ross as being " far more sensitive to Netanyahu ’s coalition politics than to U.S. interests . "
As one might expect , this statement raised the old specter of " dual loyalty , " and from several directions .
Critics of Ross suggested that he was guilty of it , while defenders complained that he was being tarred with a familiar anti-Semitic slur .
Indeed , Rozen subsequently updated her story with a statement by NSC chief of staff Denis McDonough defending Ross and underscoring " his commitment to this country and to our vital interests , " an obvious attempt by the administration to head off the issue before it gained traction .
How should we think about the " dual loyalty " question , either in this context or in many others ?
To me this is a tricky issue that ought to be handled with some delicacy , and we ought to employ a different vocabulary to discuss it .
One might start by remembering that the phrase " dual loyalty " has a regrettable and sordid history , given its origins as a nasty anti-Semitic canard in old Europe .
Accusing anyone — and especially someone who is Jewish — of " dual loyalty " is bound to trigger a heated reaction , and for good reason .
Furthermore many people believe patriotism ( i.e. , love of one ’s country ) is a profoundly important value , so any behavior that seems to be at odds with that principle carries powerful negative connotations .
In a world where nationalism remains a potent doctrine , casting doubt on anyone ’s loyalty is a serious charge .
More recently , however , scholars have used the term " dual loyalty " in more analytical and neutral fashion , based on the obvious fact that all human beings have multiple loyalties or attachments .
Most of us feel a strong attachment to our own country , for example , but we also feel a sense of loyalty to family , friends , religion , ethnic groups , sports teams , etc. ) .
Patriotism is only one of these competing loyalties , and does not necessarily trump the others .
The novelist E. M. Forster famously remarked that if forced to choose between betraying a friend or betraying his country , he hoped he would have the guts to betray the latter , and a 2006 Pew survey of Christians in thirteen countries found that 42 percent of U.S. respondents saw themselves " as Christians first and Americans second . "
All this is just to remind us that " loyalty " to a country is just one of the many attachments that we all feel .
Moreover , in a world where members of different national or ethnic groups often live in many different places , tensions inevitably arise between different sorts of national allegiance .
Today , therefore , scholars use the term " dual loyalty " to describe the widespread circumstance where individuals feel genuine and legitimate attachments to more than one country .
A good example is Israeli political scientist Gabriel Sheffer ’s book Diaspora Politics , which distinguishes between " total , " " dual , " and " divided " loyalties , and Sheffer shows that all three responses are bound to occur when members of particular ethnic , national , or religious groups live in different countries .
Needless to say , in a melting - pot society like the United States , it was inevitable that many Americans would also have strong attachments to other countries .
These different attachments may reflect ancestry , religious affiliation , personal experience ( such as overseas study ) , or any number of other sources .
The key point , however , is that in the United States it is entirely legitimate to manifest such attachments in political life .
Americans can hold dual citizenship , for example , or form an interest group whose avowed purpose is to shape U.S. policy towards a specific country .
This is how the American system of government works , and there is nothing " disloyal " about such conduct .
But what about getting directly involved as a government official , and in issue - areas where important interests are at stake ?
Instead of invoking phrases like " dual loyalty , " a rhetoric that immediately invokes connotations of betrayal ( or even treason ) , I suggest we frame the issue as one of potential conflicts of interest .
Simply put , is it in the best interest of the United States as a whole to place U.S. policy on key issues in the hands of people whose even - handedness is not beyond question , and especially when there is evidence that they feel a strong personal attachment to a foreign country with whom the United States may have important disagreements ?
In many walks of life , we routinely expect people to recuse themselves from issues in which their own interests or attachments might affect their judgment .
Judges and jurors are excused from cases where they have clear ties to one of the contending parties .
University faculty and administrators are often expected to divulge relationships ( including outside consulting ) that might affect their objectivity or probity .
We would also regard it as inappropriate if a financial advisor recommended investing in a company owned by a family member , and all the more so if they failed to divulge the connection .
Why ?
Because there is a conflict of interest .
By the same logic , we have valid reason for concern whenever someone was making policy in an area where they have clear financial interests ( which is why public officials are often expected to liquidate certain investments or place them in blind trusts ) , or if their prior associations made it clear that they felt a strong attachment to one or more interested parties .
There are good reasons why a former lobbyist for an oil company might not be the best choice for the Department of Interior or the Environmental Protection Agency ( which is not to say that such appointments never happen , of course ) .
Because a public servant ’s responsibility is to do what is in the best interest of the country as a whole , and not to favor the interests of any specific group , we normally worry when an obvious conflict of interest is discovered .
And that same principle ought to apply to the making of foreign policy .
Identifying potential conflicts of interest can be tricky , however , which suggests we ought to proceed carefully .
It would be inappropriate , it seems to me , to disqualify anyone from public service in a particular policy area solely on the basis of their ethnic or religious background or even their family ties .
It would be wrong to exclude someone from work on South Asia policy simply because they were a Pakistani - American or an Indian - American .
Similarly , I would not exclude a Muslim American , Arab - American , or Jewish - American from involvement in U.S. Middle East policy simply because of their background , or exclude someone who happened to be married to a Korean from working on U.S. policy in East Asia .
But when an individual ’s own activities or statements give independent evidence of strong attachment to a particular foreign country , is it a good idea to give them an influential role in shaping U.S. policy towards that country ?
If disagreements arise between that country and Washington , wo n’t this place these officials in a difficult position , and raise questions about their ability to conduct policy in a wholly objective manner ?
And even if they are sincerely attempting to advance the U.S. interest , wo n’t their sense of identity with the foreign country in question incline them towards certain approaches that may or may not be optimal ?
To return to where we began :
Is n’t it obvious that U.S. policy towards the Middle East is likely to be skewed when former employees of WINEP or AIPAC have important policy - making roles , and when their own prior conduct has made it clear that they have a strong attachment to one particular country in the region ?
The point is not to question their patriotism , which is not the issue .
Rather , the question is whether an attachment to Israel shapes how they think about the peace process , Iran , and the extent to which U.S. and Israeli interests are congruent .
Their patriotism can be above reproach , but their advice may still be advancing policies that are not in the U.S. interest .
By the way , I ’d have the same worries if U.S. Middle East policy were turned over to key figures from the American Task Force on Palestine or the National Iranian - American Council .
When there are important national security issues at stake , would n’t it make more sense to have U.S. policy in the hands of people without strong personal feelings about any of interested parties ?
Ironically , someone like that might end up pursuing policies that were better for all concerned .
A weeklong anchoring stint on MSNBC by Donny Deutsch ended abruptly on Wednesday , and four people briefed on the decision said the cancellation stemmed from an unflattering mention of that channel ’s No. 1 anchor , Keith Olbermann , a day earlier .
Mr. Deutsch had labeled his hour on MSNBC “ America the Angry , ” and Mr. Olbermann was shown briefly in a series of clips of media figures during a segment that pondered what role the media plays in fomenting the public ’s anger .
The four people briefed on MSNBC ’s decision said Mr. Olbermann ’s anger about the segment prompted the cancellation of the weeklong “ America the Angry ” series .
Mr. Deutsch would not confirm that , but he said Wednesday afternoon that “ for whatever reason they decided they did n’t want to go with it the rest of the week . ”
“ I was disappointed because I think I ’m on to something really special here that needs to be done , ” he added , something that is neither red nor blue in terms of its politics .
“ It ’s time the purple voice is out there , ” Mr. Deutsch said .
“ Enough already . ”
The four people briefed on the decision also said that Mr. Deutsch ’s executive producer for the hour , Gresham Striegel , was sent home .
Reached on his cellphone Wednesday afternoon , Mr. Striegel declined to comment on any of the claims .
Mr. Olbermann ’s detractors have repeatedly claimed in the past that he has refused to host his show on occasions when he was unhappy with management .
An MSNBC executive privately denied the claim that Mr. Olbermann , who is not a part of the channel ’s management , influenced the decision to bench Mr. Deutsch , but would not say so publicly .
In a reply to an e-mail message from The New York Times , Mr. Olbermann said : “ Your account is entirely untrue .
Your e-mail is the first I am hearing of any of this .
What I know of what happened is this : Phil Griffin phoned me yesterday enraged at what was on that show and I did n’t disagree with him . ”
Mr. Griffin is the president of MSNBC .
MSNBC seemed to confirm that the segment about the media ’s role in instigating anger was troubling .
“ The segment did not go unnoticed and we ’re dealing with it internally , ” said Jeremy Gaines , an MSNBC spokesman .
The segment in question also included clips of Bill O’Reilly , Rush Limbaugh , and Glenn Beck .
One of the guests , the radio host Hugh Hewitt , said that Mr. Olbermann and another MSNBC host , Ed Schultz , are “ the biggest hate - mongers in television . ”
Mr. Deutsch , an advertising executive who formerly had a prime - time show on the sister network CNBC , was scheduled to anchor the 3 p.m. hour for the full week .
The MSNBC host Alex Witt will fill in at 3 p.m.
Wednesday , according to one of the people briefed on the decision .
The people who were briefed would not speak on the record because they feared retaliation by the network and because they were not authorized to speak about the matter .
Some of the people said the decision suggests that criticism of MSNBC is not allowed on MSNBC , potentially a troubling development .
Both CNN and the Fox News Channel show media criticism programs each weekend .
Tweens were likely so preoccupied with their hyperventilating over Justin Bieber at Sunday ’s Easter Egg Roll at the White House that they missed some news that would have caused them to shriek at an even higher pitch .
J.K. Rowling , who read a selection from the first Harry Potter book at the event , responded to a fan question about further Potter - themed novels with this : “ I ’m quite sure in the not - too - distant future , I will bring out another book . ”
As long as it ’s not a spinoff from the point of view of an obscure character no one remembers , we ’re onboard .

Barbara Kafka never fails .
Her recipes may be confusing — combining odd ingredients with peculiar cooking methods — but I 've never completed a recipe of hers that did n't ultimately awe me .
She has a singular focus on flavor above all else , so while things might not always look right on paper , they come out right in the bowl .
That 's especially true for this recipe from Soup : A Way of Life , where there are so few ingredients , you 'll wonder whether it will hold together at all .
Yet , after the five minutes it takes to cook , you 'll be greeted by a bowl of warming and fragrant soup , perfumed with basil and with surprising amount of depth .
I have only one piece of advice : use good chicken stock .
This recipe lives or dies by it .
So , I know I 'm usually really relaxed about canned chicken stock , and admittedly use it often , but this is the time to use the real thing .
Luckily I had a batch in the freezer ready to go .
You can actually simplify this recipe even more if you have some pre-made pesto , though it is spectacularly easy to whip up a batch at home .
Kafka actually calls for eliminating the pine nuts and Parmesan from the pesto , because she feels like it competes with the other flavors .
Like a lot of things about this soup , it does n't make a whole lot of sense .
But it works .
Cryptic has said that it does n’t have any plans to release a sequel to its Star Trek MMO in the future .
Instead , it would rather continue to support the one it has out now .
Speaking with CVG , producer Craig Zinkievich said that it just does n’t “ make sense ” to introduce a sequel in the MMO market .
“ I ’m not really sure it makes sense to create a sequel in the MMO market .
Typically , you see an MMO called a sequel because either a new team worked on the property or the original team wanted to reboot their IP , ” he offered .
“ With Star Trek , the beauty is the story is never really finished , so as the IP continues to grow , so can we .
“ Barring a new edition of our engine , I ca n’t really see us doing a sequel . ”
Star Trek was released in February , and it has Klingons , Tribbles , and the Borg .

Some Mexicans fear freedom
BLOOD streaked the faces of the scores of young men dragging heavy wooden crosses up a hill in Iztapalapa , a suburb of Mexico City , on Good Friday .
Looking on at this annual re-enactment of the crucifixion were tearful crowds of blue - veiled “ town virgins ” — and on a billboard in the background , a giant , nearly - nude model , advertising condoms with a wink .
Religiosity and militant secularism have long rubbed along together in Mexico City and in the country as a whole .
But the gap in attitudes between the freewheeling capital and deepest Mexico is widening , stoking culture wars of the sort more familiar north of the Rio Grande .
Since 2006 the Federal District , encompassing much of Mexico City , has been governed by a left - of - centre socially liberal mayor , Marcelo Ebrard .
In March his officials performed 88 gay marriages , the first in Latin America .
Paperwork is in train for the first adoptions by gay couples .
Mr Ebrard 's administration has also simplified divorce and allowed the terminally ill to refuse treatment .
Most polarising of all , in 2007 it approved a law granting women the right to abort in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy — something previously unheard of in Latin America outside Cuba .
More is to come : a bill to legalise prostitution is pencilled in for next year , and discussions are under way to extend drinking hours to 5am .
As Mexico City liberalises , much of the rest of the country is moving in the opposite direction .
Since the 2007 abortion reform , more than half of the country 's 31 other states have preventively amended their constitutions to define life as beginning at conception .
Last year four states went further , introducing laws that double the penalty for abortion if it is found that the woman is of “ ill repute ” .
Prison sentences can be lengthy : some states treat abortion as murder .
And even when abortion is permitted , such as in cases of rape , the cumbersome authorisation required often makes it impossible .
Some wonder if a similar backlash may be looming with respect to gay rights .
The Supreme Court , which gave the green light to Mexico City 's abortion law , is mulling whether its gay weddings infringe the constitution .
Human Rights Watch , a New York - based group , hopes that the court will issue a ruling broad enough to establish a constitutional right for gay couples to marry across the country .
Paradoxically , one reason for the rude health of social conservatism is the spread of political liberalism .
The Institutional Revolutionary Party , which ran Mexico for seven decades until 2000 , persecuted the church with varying vigour and imposed secularism .
Divorce was notoriously free and easy ( Marilyn Monroe was one satisfied customer ) .
It is an irony that “ the dismantling of an authoritarian regime has led to the emergence of intolerance ” regarding homosexuality , reproductive rights and religious minorities , notes Soledad Loaeza , a political scientist at the Colegio de México , a graduate school .
Conservatives are limbering up for a battle to lift the longstanding ban on religious education in public schools .
But the tide may yet turn again .
Mexico is not immune from the paedophilia scandals that are enveloping the Catholic church .
Marcial Maciel , a Mexican priest who founded the Legionaries of Christ , an ultra-conservative Catholic movement , was a serial abuser .
The conservative National Action Party , which has held the presidency since 2000 , is flagging in the opinion polls , and its younger members are restless .
Some state institutions are loosening up : the National Commission for Human Rights , an official body , which opposed Mexico City 's abortion law , has a new director and is not against gay marriage .
Migration is helping to spread liberal attitudes .
North of the border Hispanic voters are often seen as conservatives .
But Mexican politics is being influenced by migrants returning from the United States with liberal ideas they have picked up there .
Less cheerily , the travails of migration all too often pose a challenge to the traditional family .
Mexican wedding services have been known to include prayers for the couple to stay together should one of them move to the United States .
It was in a dingy socialist meeting hall a century ago in Copenhagen that women from 17 countries gathered and launched the idea of a day which would champion the rights of women .
All over the world this weekend women are marching , celebrating and protesting , not least in London where last night thousands of people thronged Trafalgar Square to mark the 100th International Women 's Day .
The theme chosen this year is progress : the progress women have made in the past century , and the long journey that many have ahead of them .
The latest statistics on the lot of women in Britain and around the world suggest that some undoubted gains over those 100 years have now stalled , or been reversed , more recently .
Just 19.5 per cent of the MPs in Britain are women ; a record so poor that it puts the UK 69th in the world for our proportion of female parliamentarians – behind Afghanistan , the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan .
Of course , 100 years ago women had no vote and would wait almost another decade to get a single MP with no Y chromosome , but equality is further off than it might appear .
According to a hard - hitting report by the Fawcett Society to be published tomorrow , at the current rate of progress it will take 200 years to achieve an equal number of women in Parliament .
When it comes to implementing the laws of the land , women have even less say than in Westminster – and are now losing what little input they had .
In 2008 /09 , the number of women applying for Queen 's Counsel was at its lowest level in 10 years .
Higher up , there is only one female judge on the UK Supreme Court and just 15 of 109 High Court judges are female .
The picture is not much better for those at the other end of the legal system : two - thirds of the women in prison are there for non-violent crime , compared to 45 per cent of men ; and since 1997 the female prison population has soared – increasing by 60 per cent , as opposed to a 28 per cent rise for men .
Although women 's freedoms in Britain are clearly manifest and to be celebrated , some women have yet to benefit .
The broadcaster and parliamentary candidate Esther Rantzen says : " There are still women in this country who are forced into marriages , very subservient to the men in their families – I 'm told there are women who are told how to vote by men .
I 'm very aware that the freedoms I was brought up to prize – equality of education , equality of ambition – are n't available to all the women in the UK . "
There are also reasons to be troubled by the numbers exposed to violence .
Some three million women in the UK undergo rape , domestic violence , trafficking , forced marriage and other violence every year .
Twenty per cent of people still believe it is sometimes acceptable for a man to hit or slap his girlfriend if she is wearing revealing clothes in public .
But one cause for concern is more intangible : how women are perceived and how they see themselves .
Natasha Walter , author of The New Feminism , is worried : " The eagerness for change has slowed .
I think we 've slowed down because of complacency : there was a feeling that the argument 's been won and we 've got the policies in place .
Also , there 's been a cultural change resulting from the mainstreaming of the sex industry , which has narrowed the options of young women as to what being attractive is . "
All this is arguably a side issue for the five million or so women living in poverty in Britain .
Women have 40 per cent more chance of being poor than men , with the gender pay gap still at 16.4 per cent for full - time work and 35 per cent for part - time .
The figures from the Fawcett Society suggest that Britain has some way to go before its society can be considered equal .
Ceri Goddard , the Fawcett 's chief executive , says : " Since the first International Women 's Day , the feminist movement has achieved some pretty totemic successes – the right to vote , an equal pay act , and more access to education and work .
But , for all the strides we 've made , many of our successes are fragile : for example , after the increases of 1997 we might well end up with fewer female MPs this time .
It 's clear that we still need a major push to get women 's equality away from the margins and into the centre of the key debates . "
Campaigners yesterday highlighted the universal challenges faced by women around the world .
Of course , the hardship and challenges faced by women in Britain can seem almost insignificant when compared to that tackled daily by those living in countries blighted by poverty , oppressive regimes and institutionalised misogyny .
In the developing world , access to education , proper health care and basic freedoms can be forever blocked if you are born female .
On the following page , the IoS has highlighted six personal experiences that illustrate some of these of these issues .
Ellie Levenson , author of The Noughtie Girl 's Guide to Feminism , says the solution lies in choosing the right battles .
" Internationally , there are huge issues about women being denied basic human rights – from female genital mutilation , which also happens here , to women not being allowed to go out on their own , being denied passports or not allowed to drive .
Domestically , we have fights for equal pay in the workplace .
In the home , while men do more child care , there are other areas such as care for the elderly and even cleaning . "
The charity Concern , whose Women Can't Wait campaign will be launched tomorrow , draws attention to the fact that , for the first time in human history , there are more than a billion people going to bed hungry every night – and the majority of these are women .
Phoebe Asiyo , a women 's rights advocate in Kenya who is now the UN Development Fund for Women 's goodwill ambassador , said : " Women are still more likely than men to be at risk of hunger because of systematic discrimination .
It is unacceptable that though poor women produce the majority of food , they make up the majority of the world 's hungry . "
But there are reasons to be optimistic .
In Britain , though the pay gap persists , there are signs that it is closing .
Women 's median weekly earnings for full - time employment rose by 3.4 per cent between 2008 and 2009 , men 's rose by just 1.8 per cent .
In health care , life expectancy for women in Britain continues to outstrip men's .
Opinions are changing , too .
A survey for the Government 's Equalities Office , to be released tomorrow , shows that 63 per cent of Britons believe there are too few women in Parliament .
Worldwide , some 39 million girls are denied even a primary education , but in the UK girls consistently outperform boys at school .
So are things still improving for women ?
That is certainly what the historian Lisa Jardine believes .
" Britain loves to think things are slipping back , but things are systematically improving for women – it 's just that we expect more .
Women 's expectations will stop being ' realistic ' when they reach absolute parity with men .
I do n't know when it will happen , but it will happen . "
Million Women Rise : Thousands join the march through the streets of London
If the theme was oppression , the mood was anything but .
Whistles , songs , chants and cheers drowned out the regular din of a Saturday lunchtime on Oxford Street as thousands of women rejoiced in their collective – if temporary – power .
Men on the pavement watched open - mouthed , unsure what to make of the colourful spectacle of yesterday 's Million Women Rise march in London .
Monique Stretton could have told them .
The 21 - year - old from Leicester says that , for her , turning up was all about showing any of the three million women who experience violence every year in the UK they are not alone .
" Hopefully , people who need help and who walk past will realise there is support out there and make that phone call , " she says .
All along the route from Speakers ' Corner in Hyde Park to Trafalgar Square , people are transfixed by the display of female solidarity .
Camera phones flash as passers - by capture the moment .
Bizarrely , it 's mainly men who are taking pictures .
" It 's always the men , " says Amy White , 24 .
" They take them while clutching on to their girlfriends . "
Marchers like Amy and Monique embody the latest wave of women who are standing up for their rights , specifically in this instance not to be abused .
They are young and passionate about their cause .
" It 's events like this that make people realise there is a feminist movement .
It 's celebratory , not angry , " Amy adds .
For Sabrina Qureshi , who started the marches three years ago , the events are about raising awareness of violence against women .
" I 'd just had enough .
A young woman I used to work with saw a man attack a woman in the street and she felt really powerless to do anything .
So we decided to march to increase our visibility and to show that there is a way forward , a shared vision of a world without violence . "
Qureshi adds they are helping to empower a whole new generation .
" My three - year - old niece , who has been on all three marches , now calls herself a ' super she - ro feminist ' . "
What she made of the event is not clear but four - year - old Zayna , who came with her mum , Syreeta Loney , was definitely impressed .
" It 's very big . "
Which , one hopes , sums up the impact it will have had .

' Parity with men will happen ...'
It 's clear women can do anything boys can do .
What 's disappointing is men are n't interested in doing everything women can do .
Why is n't every union campaigning for men's rights to equivalent paternity leave ?
Bea Campbell , Feminist and Green Party candidate
Things are systematically improving for women – it 's just we expect more .
Women 's expect - ations will stop being ' realistic ' when they reach parity with men .
It will happen .
Lisa Jardine , Professor of Renaissance Studies at Queen Mary , University of London
All over the world women are raped , buried under veils or stoned to death .
Middle - class women here have got it made .
They should be standing up for women without a voice .
Claire Rayner , Agony aunt and vice - president of the British Humanist Association
We are at the stage of reassessing : women 's rights are becoming women 's choices .
A lot was done quickly , heads down .
It 's time we got our heads up , looked round and made choices .
Jane Robinson , Social historian
There are huge issues about women being denied basic human rights internationally – from female genital mutilation , which also happens here , to women not being allowed to go out on their own .
Obama softly threatens Dennis Kucinich
President Obama just finished enthralling a crowd in Ohio in one of the last acts ( one hopes ) of his push to pass health - care reform .
Rolling up his shirtsleeves , Obama began his speech with a little public arm - twisting , calling out a few of the local notables assembled ; and way up at the top of his list was Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D ) , in whose district Obama was speaking .
Just in case it was n’t clear why the congressman , who has criticized Obama from the left on issues such as Afghanistan , got such special mention , it was obvious seconds after Obama mentioned Kucinich ’s name .
Someone in the crowd screamed , “ Vote yes ! ”
The president responded with just a hint of guile , “ Did you hear that , Dennis ? ” Kucinich , of course , is among the liberal House Democrats who might Ralph Nader - esquely vote against health - care reform because it ’s not lefty enough for them .
“ A couple other members of Congress are here , ” Obama continued , making even plainer that Kucinich was being singled out .
As the White House is privately putting the hard press on House members to vote for health reform , all of that attention from the president must be flattering -- and one of the softest threats you ’ll hear about in politics .

Plus - size label Lane Bryant created a commercial for their new Cacique line of lingerie , which the label claims
Fox and ABC agreed to air but then did n’t really want to .
Lane Bryant suggests they have an unfair issue airing images of curvy women in lingerie , while they have no problem with Victoria ’s Secret ’s racy ads .
The company posted a little rant on their blog , alleging that ABC “ restricted our airtime ” and refused to air the ad during Dancing With the Stars .
Meanwhile Fox , they say , “ demanded excessive re-edits and rebuffed it three times before relenting to air it during the final ten minutes of American Idol , but only after we threatened to pull the ad buy . ”
The post continues :
“ Yes , these are the same networks that have scantily - clad housewives so desperate they seduce every man on the block — and do n’t forget Bart Simpson , who has shown us the moon more often than NASA — all in what they call ‘ family hour . ’ …
Does this smack of a double standard ?
Yep .
It does to us , too . ”
Bryant says the networks had a problem with the cleavage in the ad , which you can watch below .
We do n’t see that it ’s much different from a Victoria ’s Secret ad .
The girls do n’t have fans blowing in their faces or vampy shadow effects or sexy jazz hands or aggressive synchronized walks like VS ads do .
Sure , they have bigger bosoms .
But as far as raciness goes , it does n’t feel more shocking than anything else on TV .
The tans and styling on Dancing With the Stars could probably use more toning down than this commercial .

I checked out Wizard World ’s new Anaheim Comic
Con this past weekend .
At only 10 - 15 minutes away , it seemed like a waste not to go , and with Anaheim courting Comic - Con International , I wanted to get a better sense of the convention center .
So I bought a Saturday ticket , drove out for the afternoon , and had a much better time than I expected .
Photos are at Flickr if you want to jump straight to them .
Arrival
For those not familiar with the area , the Anaheim Convention Center is literally across the street from Disney ’s California Adventure .
There is n’t much in the way of public parking in the area that is n’t attached to a shopping center , a hotel , or Disneyland , but there was plenty of room in the convention center parking structure .
Of course , it took more than 10 minutes to get into the structure — longer than I spent on the freeway !
There were two events at the convention center this weekend : Anaheim Comic Con in Hall D , and a Specialty Coffee event in Halls B , C and E . I was half - tempted to find out whether the coffee event was open to the public !
Main Floor
The first thing I saw when stepping onto the main floor was the Red Mist car from Kick - Ass ( which opened this weekend ) .
The second thing was the Suicide Girls booth .
The third was a long line of people waiting for an event .
There was the usual mix of collectibles dealers , comics dealers , artists , celebrities , the ever - present giant T - shirt booth , prop & costume exhibits , fan groups , etc .
There was a heavy Star Wars fan presence ( more about that later ) .
The one that really surprised me was the bar that had been set up next to the food service area !
The weird thing :
There was virtually no industry presence .
I ’m not sure I saw a single comic publisher booth .
In the battle between C2E2 and Wizard , the publishers came down solidly on the side of C2E2 , not even bothering to send a token delegation to Anaheim .
It can be done .
Last year , DC did full - up DC Nation panels at both WonderCon ( California ) and MegaCon ( Florida ) the same weekend .
Space !
Compared to WonderCon two weeks ago , the main floor seemed bigger , but took less time to explore .
Judging by the floor plans , the area actually used looks about the same , but the breakdown was different :
Registration was handled at the front of the hall , not in the lobby or another room .
The back was blocked off for staging .
There were lunch tables at one side near the food service .
( This was sorely missing at WonderCon ! )
Artist ’s Alley was quite a bit smaller .
The celebrity autograph area was huge .
It was probably comparable to the last Wizard World Los Angeles , except that I remember a lot of empty space at that con , a bigger Artist ’s Alley , and a smaller celebrity area .
I ’d actually guess that the celebrity area at this con took up about 1/4 of the floor space !
One annoying thing : the main floor was at one end of the convention center .
The programming rooms were at the opposite end .
Because of the coffee con in between , to get to the panels , you had to go outside , then walk along the entire length of the convention center , then go back inside and up to the second level .
Star Wars and Batman
The Star Wars presence was probably a mix of two things : 1 . Regional groups are n’t going to Chicago .
2 . It ’s the 30th anniversary of The Empire Strikes Back .
That included groups such as the 501st Legion , the Saber Guild , LA Jedi , and a group that builds working droids .
The Sabre Guild had a prime spot near the T - shirt booth and had set up a ring to perform mock lightsaber battles and demonstrate other skills .
Sort of like a mix of fencing and tall flags with lightsabers .
They also had music from the movies playing continuously all day , broken up occasionally by the disco version of the Star Wars theme .
There were a couple of really good Aayla Secura costumes in that group , and a little girl wearing a Republic Jedi costume who at one point added a Hit - Girl mask and wig and posed in front of the Kick - Ass car .
The other big costume theme was the 1960s Batman TV series — almost certainly because the con had brought together much of the show ’s cast , including Adam West , Burt Ward , Julie Newmar , Yvonne Craig and Lee Meriwether , and the Batmobile .
The Sexy
Because of the light industry presence , there were n’t many in the way of booth babes .
The Evil Cheerleaders seem to be everywhere these days , plus there were cheerleaders for a energy drink called Bite Me . I was surprised at how many kids were posing with them , actually .
Suicide Girls had a big presence , with at least a dozen models , and there was a dance troupe ( the Purrfect Angels ) who dressed in skimpy versions of super - heroine and sci- fi costumes and danced on a raised stage next to the lunch area .
Then there was the booth placement in the celebrity area , where a pair of 14 - year - old girls who had written a science - fiction novel were placed next to a bikini model .
Way to send the kids a message , Wizard .
Gollum vs. Uhura
Late in the day , I was walking by where a man dressed ( if you can call it that ) as Gollum was crawling around , mewling about “ My Precious ” and showing off a DVD of an independent film with that title .
This was at the corner of the celebrity area , where Nichelle Nichols was doing a signing .
He crawled into her booth , jumped up on the table , started showing everyone “ My Precious , ” then turned toward the Star Trek actress .
She yelped and started hitting him with a plastic water bottle , at which point he took a dive off the table and tumbled onto the floor , then scurried off .
He did pretty much the same thing with the judges ’ table at the costume contest that evening .
Costume Contest
The costume contest was more organized than the one at the last Wizard World LA , though nowhere near as formal as , say the Comic - Con International Masquerade .
Most contestants simply walked in one door , past the judges , and out the other .
Actually , a lot of them early on had n’t been told to pause so that the judges could see !
A few had prepared simple routines , or at least speeches — including , as I mentioned , Gollum , who made the biggest impression .
Some other stand - outs ( some for craftsmanship , some for attitude ) included Count Chocula , the Angel of Death from Hellboy II , Doctor Octopus , and Silk Spectre .
As I was going through my photos , I found it interesting that I had actually run into a lot of the winners out on the floor : Doctor Octopus , Gollum , Silk Spectre …
Food in Anaheim
Concession stands line the edges between the exhibit halls : coffee , sandwiches , tacos , etc .
I only had the coffee , which was decent , though the clerk warned us to use the swizzle sticks and not the spoons , because they might melt !
All of the hotels in the convention complex have their own restaurants ranging from casual dining to somewhat more expensive places like Morton ’s .
The Hilton also has fast food including a Starbucks , Sbarro , Baja Fresh , and a smoothie place .
Across the street you can find standard fast food like Subway .
The Ramada has an Indian restaurant with a lunch buffet .
If you walk around Disney ’s California Adventure to the west , you can get to the Downtown Disney shopping center .
If you walk east along Katella , you can get to the Anaheim Garden Walk , which has a few mid-range chain restaurants ( California Pizza Kitchen , P.F. Chang ’s , etc. ) and a food court that ’s currently running at half capacity .
Unless your name is Barry , Jay , Wally or Bart , figure on about 20 minutes to get there .
The blocks are large and the traffic signals are long .
Tip :
If you plan to cross the street , go out to Katella along the convention center first , not out to Harbor through the hotels .
It ’s just as long , but there are trees and shade .
What If…Comic - Con International ?
Assuming the other halls are about the same size as this one , I think the full convention center could probably handle something the size of the Comic - Con International exhibit floor .
The main hurdle is that only about 1/3 of the wall between each section is actually removable ( the middle section is permanent , holding the concession counters ) .
Sure , it would make it easy to divide the main floor up into themes — one section for comics , one for movies and TV , one for games , etc. — but it would also create bottlenecks .
I did n’t get a good sense of the meeting rooms , since the con only used a couple of rooms , and I do n’t remember much from the only other convention I ’ve attended since the expansion .
( It was a WorldCon , and I experienced the whole thing through the combined haze of a summer cold and Day - Quil . )
There is room to spill over into the nearby hotels , though .
There are at least four in the same complex , and I know at least two of them have a good supply of meeting rooms and ballrooms .
They ’re closer to the center than anything in San Diego other than the Marriott , and they do n’t require you to cross a busy street or railroad tracks .

Why does Google give out so much cool stuff for free ?
I have a simple theory , based on the concept of double marginalization .
Double marginalization is pretty easy to understand .
Imagine that people travel by boat down a river from point A to point B .
There is nothing useful in between these points ; the only point of going down the river is to get from A to B. Between A and B , the river is divided into two segments , each with a separate owner , each of which erects a toll booth .
People who are considering going down the river make their decision to do so on the basis of the sum of the tolls .
As a result , if the upstream owner raises his toll , it has a negative effect on the downstream owner in the form of decreased traffic and revenue .
If the downstream owner also owns the upstream segment , its profits will be more than the combined profits of the separate segment owners .
In addition , under joint ownership , the total amount of tolls will be lower , so consumers of the river will be better off .
But here is the key to understanding Google : if the downstream owner can destroy the upstream owner ’s toll booth , it has the same effect as if he owned both segments .
In either case , there is just one toll booth , and the amount of the toll is set to the profit - maximizing amount .
Think about the Internet as composed of two complementary goods , broadly defined : access and content .
Assume , quite reasonably , that Google has some market power in content monetization .
Other companies have market power in the access industry .
When most people buy a computer , they pay the Apple or Microsoft tax ( or both ) .
To get online , you pay your local ( usually monopoly ) cable company .
On your cell phone , you are locked into a two - year contract .
Content monetization is the downstream industry , and access is the upstream industry .
Google does n’t have to take over the upstream industry to increase its profits ; it just has to destroy their toll booth .
By disrupting complementary industries and making them more competitive , Google is increasing their profits in their downstream industry .
A lot of Google ’s projects make sense when viewed from this angle .
Google Docs is an attempt to reduce the Microsoft tax .
Android is an attempt to reduce the Apple tax .
Google ’s participation in the spectrum auction a couple years ago ( and lobbying of the FCC to require open access ) was an attempt to reduce phone carrier market power .
Google Voice is the next iteration of that attempt .
Ditto for selling phones without contracts .
Google Buzz is an attempt to disrupt Facebook ’s market power .
Google ’s recent plans to build a fiber network is an attempt to go after local ISP monopolies .
The point is that Google does n’t have to dominate any of these industries to be successful , provided that they dominate content monetization .
They merely have to make these industries more competitive , lowering the barriers to consuming a lot of content online .
The broader lesson is that monopolies will provide public goods in complementary industries , meaning that they are not as economically harmful as a static analysis would suggest .
This is something that policymakers and government agencies should keep in mind as they prosecute firms for antitrust violations .
" Kick - Ass , " the ultra-violent superhero flick that hits theaters Friday , was riding a wave of glowing Internet buzz — until it crashed into a cranky critic with roots in the old - school media .
Roger Ebert ( no slouch when it comes to Twitter , as TheWrap previously reported ) generated a swarm of controversy this week over his takedown of the Lionsgate film .
Beyond the film 's aesthetic and artistic merits , Ebert was especially troubled its violence , much of it coming at the hands of a potty - mouthed 11 - year - old girl .
In addition to slicing and dicing baddies , the character in question , Hit Girl ( Chloe Grace Moretz ) , is beaten to within an inch of her life and shot in the chest by her father ( Nicolas Cage ) while wearing a bullet - proof vest .
" Shall I have feelings , or should I pretend to be cool ?
Will I seem hopelessly square if I find ' Kick - Ass ' morally reprehensible and will I appear to have missed the point ? , " Ebert wrote in his one - star review this week .
Oh Roger , lighten up , say TheWrap 's Leah Rozen , and other mainstream reviewers like Rolling Stone 's Peter Travers , the Washington Post 's Ann Hornaday and Fanboy icon Harry Knowles .
But Ebert 's criticism seems to have resonated with some people , as well as irked the film 's star Christopher Mintz - Plasse .
Mintz - Plasse took to Twitter to tell the Chicago reviewer " It just is n't your kind of flick good sir .
Do n't worry about what other Chicago reviewers think .
Get passed ( sic ) it … I got passed ( sic ) your review . "
Of course , in announcing so publicly that he had gotten over Ebert 's criticism , Mintz - Plasse essentially proved the opposite .
In the midst of all the fury , TheWrap takes a look at some of the reactions to " Kick - Ass " and the Ebert controversy sprouting up across Twitter and throughout the mainstream media .
The " It 's Awful , It 's Reprehensible " Camp
" I started hating this movie around the midpoint .
And while Hit Girl 's single usage of a c-word more commonly heard in Britain than in America has generated some controversy , the more pressing issue is how stupidly relentless the gore is , from beginning to end . " — Michael Philips , The Chicago Tribune
" Yeah , it does bother me that Moretz 's character , Hit Girl , and her fellow amateur superheroes rack up a body count in the high dozens . " — Dana Stevens , Slate
" We never thought that we would say this about a movie : but Kick - Ass is too violent . " — Sci-Fi Movie Page .

But Hit Girl and ' Kick - Ass ' are so removed from reality that a viewer can appreciate the character for the clever conceit that it is .
The critics need to chill . " — Leah Rozen , TheWrap.com
" I have to say it is a little sad to see [ Ebert ] go the route you did in your KICK ASS review .
And do n't worry , while I suppose you 'll never really just get KICK - ASS … You 're no square in my book .
But you may be in danger of being a ' grown up ' . " — Harry Knowles , Ain't It Cool News
" Although Chloe Grace Moretz 's foul - mouthed portrayal of the plucky Mindy has already drawn fire in the blogosphere , Mindy 's self - reliance and confidence result in a weirdly reassuring portrait of a young girl who 's able to defend herself . " —

" Ever since audiences got a pervy taste of Kick - Ass at July 's Comic - Con , tight - asses have been nervously clenching … the movie belongs to Moretz , whose sensational performance will be talked about for years . "
— Peter Travers , Rolling Stone .

Who knew fixing the world could be so much fun ?
Threats this week by Los Angeles ’ powerful municipal utility to withhold $ 73 million from the treasury helped reveal a city that has become increasingly dependent on indirect and onetime sources of revenue to pay its bills .
Combined with the worst economic decline since the Depression , those dwindling sources of cash have forced city officials to confront a problem they have long tried to ignore -- a steady growth of the city payroll for the last decade .
The city ’s core 35,000 - member workforce increased by at least 3,000 between 2000 and 2009 .
During the same time , Los Angeles ’ yearly pension contributions more than tripled to $ 723 million , fueled by investment losses but also by the larger payroll .
When the effects of the failing economy surfaced in late 2007 , Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and the City Council approved significant raises for union workers and pressed ahead with a police force expansion even as they talked openly of a need for cutbacks and threatened layoffs .
“ It ’s a head - scratcher , ” said Jack Kyser , a Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. economist .
“ If you know that tough times are coming , you should be ultra-cautious .
You ’ve had ongoing warnings about the magnitude of the downturn and they have n’t been listening . ”
Now , the city ’s $ 4.4 - billion general fund -- which pays for police , libraries , parks and other city services -- has a $ 212 - million budget deficit that could grow to $ 1 billion in four years without drastic cuts .
Publicly , city officials have blamed the steep drop in tax revenue , but concede that the payroll increases have played a major role as well .
When he took office in 2005 , Villaraigosa promised to erase the city ’s long - recognized “ structural deficit ” -- the gap between revenue and spending .
He weeded out budget gimmicks used for years , yet , according to the city ’s chief legislative analyst , in his first budget the mayor proposed the creation of 805 positions .
Villaraigosa now acknowledges that his efforts were undermined not only by rapidly declining tax revenues but by salary increases and his vow to expand the LAPD .
“ It ’s a crisis of spending and it ’s also a revenue crisis .
It ’s a crisis of both , ” Villaraigosa said .
“ I take responsibility .
It predates my administration , but there ’s no question that it also occurred during my administration . ”
City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana said officials for years have relied on finding one - time pots of money to cover up to $ 200 - million annual budget gaps created by a growing workforce , expanded services and generous pay packages .
“ If you look in the context of our $ 4 - billion budget , this year ’s drop in revenue is not unsurmountable -- $ 184 million , ” Santana , Los Angeles ’ top financial analyst , said in a March interview .
“ But it is significant if you ’re living by the skin of your teeth . ”
To help cover the city ’s bills , elected leaders have reached beyond staple tax revenue collections ; liquidating city property , increasing parking meter and trash fees , and diverting revenue from the Department of Water and Power .
Since 1992 , the DWP has provided the city budget $ 2.7 billion collected from electric bills .
On Thursday , Controller Wendy Greuel warned that the city could run out of money by June 30 if the DWP withheld a promised $ 73 - million payment to the general fund .
Acting DWP General Manager Raman Raj favored rejecting the transfer after the council turned down a proposed increase in electric bills , which Raj said put the DWP ’s “ financial outlook in significant jeopardy . ”
Now Villaraigosa and the council have few options , with Los Angeles voters in no mood to approve a tax increase and with few other sources of revenue left .
The mayor and council already have authorized the elimination of up to 4,000 city jobs , on top of the 2,400 workers who were allowed to retire early .
Former City Controller Laura Chick said officials waited until things were so bad that they had no choice but to act .
“ That ’s an insane way of governing .
We do n’t have political leadership today that is strong , courageous and thoughtful enough to look into the future . ”
What makes things worse is that the mayor and council members had been put on notice , Chick said .
As city controller , she warned in 2007 that the reserve fund was depleted .
That same year , then - City Administrative Officer Karen Sisson projected a $ 215 - million shortfall .
Council member Bernard C. Parks urged colleagues to prepare layoff lists because of a potential “ drastic reduction ” in revenues .
Despite those warnings , the mayor and council signed off on raises for the Coalition of L.A. City Unions , which represents 22,000 civilian employees .
The projected cost of the labor contracts , which have been renegotiated as a result of the crisis , was $ 255 million over five years .
One union hailed its agreement as the “ best contract in 40 years . ”
Villaraigosa said later that he never would have supported the contracts had he known that a fiscal meltdown was on the horizon .
At the time , however , it appeared affordable : UCLA economic experts were predicting a 4 % increase in revenue .
“ They told us it was going to be bright and rosy , ” the mayor said .
Villaraigosa added that the 2007 contracts included a provision to bring the unions back to the table in the event of a fiscal crisis .
Still , those concessions took more than a year to negotiate .
That delay was , in part , because the mayor failed to promptly replace Sisson , the city ’s lead labor negotiator , after she resigned in July 2008 .
At the time , Villaraigosa also was campaigning for reelection and weighing a run for governor .
The mayor said he was not distracted .
His first choice to replace Sisson withdrew amid questions from council members about his salary demands and ties to lobbying firms .
Union leaders said , however , that the delay froze discussions over cuts to the workforce , preventing the city from saving millions of dollars much sooner .
“ In 2007 , we recognized , together with Karen Sisson , that there was a serious problem , ” said Victor Gordo , an attorney for the union coalition .
The unions started lobbying in 2007 for early retirement , saying it could take thousands of workers off the books .
Villaraigosa said labor leaders refused to consider increasing workers ’ pension contributions to cover the costs .
“ The unions were n’t ready to negotiate , ” he said .
“ Yeah , they were talking about it , but they did n’t want to pay for it . ”
A deal was not reached until six months ago .
In return , union coalition members were exempted from layoffs and furloughs until July 1 .
That provision severely limited the city ’s ability to balance the books when tax revenues recently fell more sharply than expected .
Now the mayor and council plan to tap the city ’s reserve fund , which has triggered a downgrade of the city ’s credit rating on Wall Street .
Parks , who heads the council ’s budget committee , said that even amid the current crisis , it has been difficult to persuade city leaders to find the political will to make cuts .
“ Every time there ’s a discussion about reducing the workforce , like there is now , we have elected officials looking for money to make it go away , ” he said .

Over the past 60 years , the barn owl ( tyto alba ) has been spotted on many occasions in New Zealand from Westland ( 1948 ) to Auckland ( 1985 ) , but it ’s never gained a good enough foothold to be classed as a native ( i.e breeding ) bird .
And no wonder .
Any dishevelled bird that arrives on our shores care of a rogue wind , must survive on strange foreign tucker , fend off exotic predators and hunt out a suitable mate .
Cue : stomach aches , loneliness , unanswered mating calls and scraps with unknown foes .
The odds that are stacked against them are just mind - boggling .
And yet , so many of our birds have done it , even those ones that are challenged in the wing department ( read : the pukeko , the fantail , silvereye ) .
So over the past two years , birders have been watching the coupling of two barn owls in Kaitaia with growing interest .
After a few abortive attempts to start a family , this particular couple produced three healthy chicks which effectively moves them up a rung from vagrant , to a * drum roll please !*…. native bird .
Our native birds ( no – 71 ) are n’t quite riff raff , but they ’re by no means as treasured as our endemic birds because they carry duel ( or even multiple ) citizenship .
The barn owl , for example , can now claim citizenship in around 30 countries from Samoa to the UK .
Needless to say second - class citizenship is n’t all that it ’s cracked up to be .
In short , it means they ’re protected under the wildlife act , and no - one can shoot them , but that ’s about as far as its privileges go .
Our underfunded Department of Conservation is already struggling to save our endemic tweeters ( like our kakapo and kokako ) – barn owls can’t exactly go pleading for government handouts .
They ’re firmly placed under the ‘ fend for yourself ’ category , despite the fact that they are star rat- hunters and they ’re largely welcomed by conservationists *.
Already they are facing an uphill battle with a genetic bottleneck ( re : inbreeding ) , but they ’re good breeders , and they ’ve proven that that they ’re robust enough to settle pretty much anywhere ( except Antarctica ) .
Some vagrants have even estabished themselves on small islands such as Tonga
Acres of rat and mice - filled open country lies before them in Northland , so who knows – all it might take is a few well placed nest boxes ( already in place care of the Wingspan Trust ) to help them to truly find their feet .
The only question left in my mind is – who ’s going to be their campaign manager for this year ’s Bird of the Year competition ?
Hands up please .
* They have even been shown to co-exist happily with our smaller ruru or morepork , however there are concerns they may snack on endemic birdlife if they move to different areas .
Their gut pellets ( pellets they throw up to get rid of fur balls ) have shown plenty of rats and traces of introduced birds such as yellowhammer , starling and sparrows , and native fernbird .
One of the key benefits of social media ( that ’s rarely discussed ) is its ability to resolve doubt and confusion among fence - sitters .
Yes , your prospective customers are likely confused and possibly uncertain .
During my 15 years of website strategy and usability work ( before I went all “ social media ” on you ) , I tried very hard to live by the two - click rule — answering the most common questions customers have about your business on your site within two clicks .
How about zero clicks ?
Social media makes it possible .
The key is to create meaningful content that answers prospects ’ questions , and propagate that content throughout the social web , making a visit to your site unnecessary .
Here ’s how it works :
# 1 : Become a Question Detective
First , identify which questions are most important to answer .
I recommend starting with six , because it will generate a meaningful amount of content and address the tip of your question iceberg .
You can use a few methods to determine which questions to answer .
You can survey your existing customers , although that ’s not always the best approach because the questions are not fresh in their minds .
They ’ve already made their buying decision .
You can study your web analytics to see which pages get the most traffic and which questions are likely to be in prospects ’ minds when they are on those pages .
Or you could survey website visitors , gathering data in real time .
I also like to look at search data , both the searches that people are conducting about your company on Google ( use this free keyword tool ) , and the searches conducted on your website ( assuming you have a search function ) .
I would also make a point to solicit input from customer service and sales teams , as they have more day - to - day interaction with fence - sitters .

# 2 : Become The Answer Man With Your Blog and Video
Once you ’ve identified your top six questions , answer them using new media .
Not in a “ here ’s our FAQ ” way , but in a vigorous , social media way .
I recommend answering each question with a dedicated blog post and a video , at minimum .
For B2B companies , I would add a short slide presentation that answers each question , and possibly a podcast that answers all six in aggregate .

A Bit About Video
Remember that video is 52 times more likely to show up on the first page of Google search results , so do n’t skip that part .
You do n’t need a film crew .
You do n’t need a makeup artist .
You need an inexpensive HD camera .
( I prefer the Kodak ZI - 8 over the FlipHD because it has an external microphone jack .
How did I know that ?
Because Kodak is very adept at the precise strategy we ’re discussing here . )
You need some clue about lighting , somebody in your company who ’s decent on camera and a loose script .
If possible , on - the - scene video showing demonstrations would be great .
And if possible , I ’d recommend having employees closest to the product ( designers , engineers , product marketing and customer service ) be the stars of the show , not executives or marketers .
It ’s just more authentic and believable that way .
# 3 : Become a Digital Dandelion With Your Content
Take your written and video content , and spread it as widely as possible on the social web .
Post it to your Facebook page .
Your Linked In page .
Your blog , naturally .
Put it on YouTube of course .
Even better , use TubeMogul to syndicate it to dozens of other video sites .
Certainly , link to your content from your corporate website .
But the ideal scenario is that the content performs well enough in search results that potential customers can answer their questions before they ever get to your site .
# 4 : Improve and Expand
Now that your content is posted to your various social outposts , invite your current customers to make it better .
Talk it up on Facebook and your blog .
Send it out to existing customers via email , so they can refer fence - sitters to it .
Invite current customers to comment on your answers .
Each quarter , commit to answering a few more questions .
Involve your customers , and ask them to create their own content that answers other questions ( maybe a contest for the best ones ) .
Now use social listening tools to find blog posts , tweets , forum threads and other discussions about your brand and your products , and as appropriate , direct fence - sitters to your new social media answers .
Now you ’re combining content with marketing , social media with customer service .
Now you ’re using social media to its full advantage .
Give this a try , will you ?
Have you done any of this ?

OK , so now Bill O'Reilly is just acting bizarre .
Remember how , on Tuesday , O'Reilly invited on Sen .
Tom Coburn to demand he explain his recent criticism of Fox 's health - care coverage ( particularly the claim that failure to obtain health insurance will now result in jail time ) , and then proceeded to lie blatantly about what had been said on Fox News in that regard :
O'Reilly : OK , but can you tell me one person on Fox News , just one , who has told this audience that they 'll go to jail if they do n't buy health insurance .
...
O'Reilly : Well , why then was it legitimate to bring in Fox News in the discussion , when , No. 1 , you do n't know anybody on Fox News -- because there has n't been anyone -- that said people will go to jail if they do n't buy mandatory insurance .
...
O'Reilly : Well , tell me , what -- because it does n't happen here .
And we researched to find out if anybody on Fox News had ever said you 're going to jail if you do n't buy health insurance .
Nobody 's ever said it .
Note the language : O'Reilly is clearly insisting that NO ONE at Fox had EVER said any such thing .
Not " had said it after the health - care bill had passed . "
Just EVER .
Because on his show last night , rather than admitting the error and moving along , O'Reilly instead doubled down and insisted that he was still right and Coburn was wrong -- even though we ( and many others , most notably Media Matters and MSNBC 's Countdown ) were able to show plenty of video of plenty of Fox talkers in fact saying " you 're going to jail if you do n't buy health insurance , " perhaps most notoriously Glenn Beck on O'Reilly 's own show .
Here 's what O'Reilly claimed in his opening Talking Points Memo segment :
O'Reilly : Once again -- once again !
-- NBC
News has highlighted dishonest propaganda from the far - left Media Matters outfit .
Sadly , Time Magazine also participated in the sham .
... Now Senator Coburn admitted he may have made a mistake , but to be fair , the mistake is understandable .
Because last fall , when jail time was on the table , Fox News reported it , as we should have !
Listen to these sound bites : [ Video clip : ABC News interview with President Obama , Nov. 9 , 2009 ] Jake Tapper :
Do you think it 's appropriate to have the threat of jail time for those who refuse to buy insurance ?
Obama :
You know , what I think is appropriate is that , in the same way that everybody has to get auto insurance , and if you do n't you 're subject to some penalty .
[ Video clip : Nancy Pelosi press conference , Nov. 9 , 2009 ]
Reporter : I 'm just trying to understand -- if you do n't buy health insurance , you go to jail ?
Pelosi :
Well , there is -- I think the legislation is very fair in this respect .
All right , as we all know , the prison option was taken off the when the final Obama - care bill was being debated .
And that 's what we were talking to Senator Coburn about !
The final bill debate !
Not all that stuff !
So what I said was absolutely true and nobody at Fox News reported inaccurately about the Obama - care prison situation .
Nobody !
Sure , Bill .
And your dog ate your homework , right ?
It 's a fact : O'Reilly claimed , pure and simple , that " nobody [ at Fox ] ever said " that you 'd go to jail for failing to buy health insurance -- and plenty of people at Fox in fact said just that .
Indeed , O'Reilly compounds his original lie here by lying about whether there was a " prison option " in the Obama - care bill at all in the first place :
There WAS NEVER A ' PRISON OPTION . '
Watch those clips he runs carefully : Neither Obama nor Pelosi support the concept of jail time , but instead claim that the legislation treats people fairly .
The questions asked in the clips themselves were based on a false premise :
The penalty for failure to buy insurance in that legislation , just like the final version that passed , is a not imprisonment or arrest , but simply a tax -- and failure to pay taxes is a matter for the civil courts .
The claim that " jail time " was on the table was an utterly false smear back then -- just as it was even more provably false after health - care reform passed .
Indeed , O'Reilly is simply fabricating when he tries to claim that " we all know " a " prison option " was " taken off . "
Does anyone know WTF he 's talking about ?
But that , believe it or not , is not even the most bizarre thing O'Reilly did in this segment .
He followed this up by lecturing sternly -- without even a hint of irony or self - awareness -- on the threat posed to the health of the nation by news media who blatantly and nakedly lie , without remorse .
That 's right , projection 's not just for theaters :
O'Reilly :
The importance of this is that you , the everyday American , are now being lied to on a regular basis by people working for huge corporations -- and nothing 's being done about it .
A voter - driven republic -- a voter - driven republic -- cannot survive if lies supersede the truth .
Bottom line on this story is that Senator Coburn -- again , a good man -- made an honest mistake .
But that mistake was picked up by NBC News and used to hammer Fox News , which is kicking their butt all over the place in the cable - news ratings .
The good news is that NBC News will soon be taken over by Comcast , an honest corporation , and perhaps changes will be made .
The American people deserve an honest government and an honest media , do we not ?
This is such an obvious inversion of reality that the simplest conclusion is that these people have just gone insane .
One can't help but wonder when BillO is just going to start shouting : " F&@k it !
We 'll do it live !!!! "
It reminded me of something Dan Cooper , who helped launch Fox , wrote a little while back :
Lots of people have dissected the Fox News Channel for evidence of bias .
They 're all missing the point .
Of course it 's biased .
...
This is the point : Fox News is about indoctrination , not bias .
The indoctrination was always hidden , as it is in the best advertising .
At Fox , they really do n't care if they lie , or even if they 're caught lying .
The main thing is to present a plausible narrative that will satisfy the Konservative Kool - aid Kids , preferably one that makes right - wingers out to be victims of liberal perfidy .
This one fits the bill , and then some .
Yesterday at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference , Sarah Palin shot back at President Obama for his naked diss of Sarah Palin and her highly sophisticated advice on nuclear policy :
Palin : Now , the president , with all the vast nucular experience that he acquired as a community organizer ... and as a part - time senator and as a full - time candidate , all that experience , still no accomplishment to date with North Korea and Iran .
OK , Sarah , we 'll write this very slowly and hope that you can understand :
-- See , the president can't be an expert in all things .
So he surrounds himself with the best minds he can , experts who advise him on various aspects of national policy .
-- Obama probably would admit he is not an expert in nuclear issues .
-- However , the people whose advice he 's following -- namely , Defense Secretary Robert Gates and the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon -- very much do have that expertise .
Or do you now want to stack your resume on nuclear issues up against theirs ?
Of course , it always helps if you know how to actually pronounce the word .
Students study outside Hart House at the University of Toronto in March .
The university will close its St. George campus during the G20 summit .
Photo : Andrew Wallace
Spillover from the G20 summit has spread to the white ivory towers of Toronto .
Spooked by its proximity to Queen 's Park , the G20 designated protest area , the University of Toronto decided on Friday to shutter its St. George campus during the June 26 - 27 summit .
As of 6 p.m. Wednesday , June 23 , the university will close until Sunday , June 27 , said vice - provost students Jill Matus .
" We had a series of deliberations and in light of the fact that the protest site has effectively been moved to our doorstep on the St. George campus , we took the decision to restrict access , " Matus said .
" We took this decision based on our concerns about safety .
We know that in past G20 summits , in particularly last year ’s summit in Pittsburgh , protests may be associated with violence , arrests , disruptions , tear gas and damage to property . "
Trinity Bellwoods Park on Queen St. W. was originally chosen for the summit's " designated speech area " but organizers changed their minds after residents and nearby businesses vehemently opposed the idea .
Matus says there are no classes scheduled for the Thursday and Friday prior to the summit but the closure will force some summer session exams to be rescheduled earlier in the week .
Students living in nearby residences will also be relocated and four colleges are so far affected : New College , University College , Woodsworth College and the Innis College residence at 2 Sussex Ave .
Matus said senior administration is still deciding where to move uprooted students but it 's possible some will be relocated to residences at the university 's Scarborough or Mississauga campuses .
The heads of other colleges near the protest zone -- such as Trinity College , St. Michael 's College and Victoria College -- have not yet made any decisions to relocate their residence students as well , Matus said .
Matus emphasized that the university is supportive of peaceful demonstrations but also said the school was not consulted prior to Queen 's Park being selected as the designated protest zone .
She said it is still too early to know how many students or exams will be impacted , as well as what associated costs might be for the four - day university closure .
The G20 is taking place at the Metro Convention Centre from June 26 - 27 but security preparations are expected to begin at least a week or two prior .
Update :
This afternoon , the Council of Canadians has released a statement decrying the university 's plan to shut down campus during the G20 , calling the decision " at odds with what would have been expected from a public institution committed to freedom of expression and the city itself . "
The organization says it has already sold more than 500 tickets for its June 25 " Shout Out for Global Justice Event , " which was supposed to take place at Convocation Hall and will be attended by speakers such as Maude Barlow , Vandana Shiva , Leo Girard , Amy Goodman and Naomi Klein .
" The Council of Canadians is now left scrambling for an alternate downtown location -- in a city with increasingly limited public space due to G20 security -- but will continue to sell tickets , determined that this event will not be shut down , " the statement reads .
The council 's director of organizing says the group is " disappointed " by the decision .
" We would have expected an institution that promotes the exchange of ideas and public discourse not to close its campus to an international forum at this pivotal moment in history , " stated Carleen Pickard .
The Council of Canadians says it plan to contact the mayor as well as the U of T to appeal this decision .
The Numerical Algorithms Group has released its NAG Library for SMP and Multicore .
Mathematical and statistical algorithms optimized for performance on multicore architectures have become key to progress in various aspects of technical application development and computationally - intensive problem - solving .
The NAG Library for SMP and Multicore contains over 1600 routines , including over 100 new for this release .
A complete listing of these routines can be found here .
" The NAG Library is very good for work on multiple cores because of the reliable parallel design of the algorithms , " says Dr. Hartmut Schmider of the computational support team of the High Performance Computing Virtual Laboratory at Queen 's University , adding " but it is also [ good ] because of the common interface for both serial and multicore libraries .
This enables users to speed up their code on many multiple core architectures with greatly reduced effort . "
NAG 's David Cassell adds that " most current processors are multicore , and can provide benefits when programmed with parallel techniques .
In fact , if you do not use routines tuned for multicore architectures applications are now likely to execute more slowly .
The NAG library for SMP and Multicore also has been designed to make it easy to move those applications that currently call serial routines into the parallel world , by the use of common calls and common documentation .
This means users can quickly gain the benefits of parallel performance . "

MOSCOW — Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Friday suggested merging Ukraine ’s national energy company with the Russian gas giant Gazprom , a move that , if approved in Kiev , would put Ukraine ’s strategic network of gas pipelines under Moscow ’s control .
Mr. Putin shocked many — including , apparently , his Ukrainian counterpart — by announcing the proposal at a news conference after talks in the Russian resort city of Sochi .
The Ukrainian prime minister , Mykola Azarov , said through a spokesman that the idea of a merger had not come up in their meetings , and that Mr. Putin had “ expressed it in an impromptu way . ”
Mr. Putin ’s idea is an audacious one politically , coming just two months after Ukraine elected a new president , Viktor F. Yanukovich , who vowed to increase cooperation with Russia .
Emotions are still raw in Ukraine over a deal Mr. Yanukovich negotiated with Moscow to extend the lease on a Russian naval base on the Crimean Peninsula for 25 years , and a Tuesday vote on the issue in Parliament deteriorated into a melee .
Russia is heavily dependent on Ukrainian pipelines , which carry about 80 percent of its natural gas exports to Europe , and it has long coveted a greater degree of control over them .
If the deal were to go through , Gazprom would effectively swallow the Ukrainian company , Naftogaz , said Chris Weafer , chief strategist at UralSib Capital , an investment bank .
Python is a language that gives you a lot of rope , in particular any particular encapsulation scheme is only weakly enforced and can be worked around by a sufficiently savvy hacker .
I fall into the " my compiler should stop me from doing stupid things " camp , but I 'll certainly say , dynamic capabilities sure are convenient .
But here 's the rub : the language must show you where you have done something stupid .
In this case , we 'd like to see when you have improperly gone and mutated some internal state .
You might scoff and say , " well , I know when I change my state " , but this is certainly not the case when you 're debugging an interaction between two third party libraries that you did not write .
Specifically I should be able to point at a variable ( it might be a local variable , a global variable , or a class / instance attribute ) and say to Python , " tell me when this variable changes . "
When the variable changes , Python should tell me who changed the variable ( via a backtrace ) and what the variable changed to .
I should be able to say , " tell me when this variable changed to this value . "
Well , here is a small module that does just that : mutsleuth .
Import this module and install the watcher by passing mutsleuth .
watch an expression that evaluates to the variable you 'd like to check .
Here 's an example : suppose I have the following files :
good.py :
b = " default value "
evil.py :
import good good .b = " monkey patch monkey patch ha ha ha "
test.py :
import mutsleuth mutsleuth.watch ( " good.b " ) import good import evil
When you run test.py , you 'll get the following trace :
ezyang@javelin:~/Dev/mutsleuth$ python test.py Initialized by : File " test.py " , line 5 , in < module > import evil File " /home/ezyang/Dev/mutsleuth/good.py " , line 1 , in < module > b = " good default value " Replaced by : File " test.py " , line 5 , in < module > import evil File " /home/ezyang/Dev/mutsleuth/evil.py " , line 2 , in < module > good .b = " monkey patch monkey patch ha ha ha "
There are a few caveats :
Tracing does n't start until you enter another local scope , whether by calling a function or importing a module .
For most larger applications , you will invariably get this scope , but for one - off scripts this may not be the case .
In order to keep performance tolerable , we only do a shallow comparison between instances , so you 'll need to specifically zoom in on a value to get real mutation information about it .
Bug reports , suggestions and improvements appreciated !
I went and tested this by digging up an old bug that I would have loved to have had this module for ( it involved logging code being initialized twice by two different sites ) and verified it worked , but I have n't tested it " cold " yet .
Hat tip to Bengt Richter for suggesting this tracing originally .
Natural , Natural , and Natural
A great recent talk on natural algorithms
Bernard Chazelle is one of the world experts in computational geometry , lower bounds on data structures , upper bounds on data structures , and discrepancy theory — among many other aspects of theory .
His book on the discrepancy is a classic .
If you need to know about placing points so they are “ well distributed , ” you should read his book .
Today I plan to discuss a recent presentation he gave at Georgia Tech , actually at the ARC center , on Natural Algorithms ( NA ) .
I have had the pleasure of knowing Bernard since he was a graduate student at Yale , where his advisor was David Dobkin .
After I got to Princeton in 1980 , I quickly recruited David , who then quickly recruited Bernard .
I cannot imagine Princeton without either of them .
I have one story I would like to relate about Bernard .
It concerns the PhD. examination process we used at Princeton years ago .
One year I was in charge of the graduate examination process .
We gave the students written exams , and then got the faculty together to discuss each student ’s case .
Our pass / fail decision was based on the exam and other information — for example , input from their advisor .
The written part of the exam was given over three days : one day was on systems , one on theory , and one on applications .
There was a question on the systems exam that most of the theory students failed .
This led to a pretty heated discussion about whether or not the question was fair .
It was my question , so I thought it was okay , but many did not .
Curiously , the systems faculty liked the question , but argued it was a theory question .
Bernard liked the question , thought it was fair , but still agreed it was a systems question — one theory students might not need to understand .
Finally , cooler heads prevailed and we made decisions about exam grades all the faculty could support .
After the meeting Bernard was still convinced my question was not something a theory student should know .
So I asked him to come to my office , where I pulled out an old paper on Turing Machines , and pointed to a lemma — there was my question .
He finally agreed the question was definitely a theory one .
I always thought the question was just a basic fact about data structures .
Here is the question , you judge :
Using two stacks , show you can simulate a queue so the cost of operations of the queue is bounded by .
What do you think ?
Theory or systems ?
Natural
The word “ natural ” is a wonderful word , full of positive feelings — I think good thoughts when I hear it .
This is why the word is used so often : there are natural resources , there are natural remedies , there is natural selection , there is natural history , there is the movie “ The Natural , ” and on and on .
Not surprisingly , “ natural ” is also popular in theory and in mathematics .
Here are a few uses of “ natural ” in our area of theory .
Natural Proof Systems Gerhard Gentzen created natural deduction in 1935 .
He created a set of inference rules for predicate calculus : rules with a simple clarity , rules with a certain naturalness .
For example ,
is a simple natural deduction .
You should read as meaning : if the formulas in are true , the formula follows .
The brilliance of Gentzen was creating a logic consisting only of natural rules that is still complete : this uses his famous cut elimination method .
Natural Mappings
I have never used category theory in my research , and only know the very basics .
If you are not familiar with category theory look here .
With apologies to the experts , I view category theory as a way to study functions rather than objects as the primary concern .
This shift in focus seems simple , but has remarkable consequences .
For example , category theory is indispensable in explaining why some maps are “ natural ” and others are not .
Category theory can do much more , but this is certainly one of the elementary but very powerful uses of it .
Saunders Mac
Lane once said :
“ I did n’t invent categories to study functors ; I invented them to study natural transformations . ”
An important example comes from the theory of vector spaces .
Consider , to be concrete , finite dimension vector spaces over the reals .
Every such space has a dual space of the same dimension : the dual is nothing more than all the linear functionals defined on the vector space .
A linear functional is just a linear map from to .
Since any two such vector spaces are isomorphic if they have the same dimension , the following two statements are true for any :
The space is isomorphic to .
The space is isomorphic to .
Yet , intuitively these statements are different : in ( 1 ) the map seems to depends on the basis used to define the spaces ; in ( 2 ) the map is canonical or natural .
The latter follows since there is a “ canonical map ” from to : Define by ,
where is in the vector space and is in the dual space .
This map clearly does not depend on any basis of the vector spaces — it is natural .
Category theory gives a precise way to define natural maps , and unravels why these two isomorphisms are different .
Natural Selection John Holland in the early 1970 ’s created a notion of natural selection for the creation of algorithms .
I will have to discuss this in more detail another time .
Natural Proofs
In 1994 Alexander Razborov and Steven Rudich created the notion of natural proofs .
See my earlier discussion for more details on this important notion .
Natural Algorithms
This is an area started by Chazelle in the early 2000 ’s and was the topic of his talk .
NA is an attempt to apply complexity theory to the study of natural phenomena like bird flocking .
Form of Bernard ’s Talk
Bernard gave a beautiful talk on his recent work on NA .
It was terrific on two levels : a great presentation and great results .
The presentation was so special I thought I would discuss how he did it .
It was unique .
His slides were very sparse .
Some slides had a single phrase or a single picture or a single equation .
Usually we see talks with slides full of bullets and multiple pieces of information .
Bernard ’s was the opposite — a minimalist approach to the use of powerpoint .
It flowed easily from one idea to the next , and had a beautiful rhythm .
I was very impressed with the form of his talk .
If you can have him visit and give a talk , you will be very happy you did .
Content of the Talk
In Bernard ’s talk were some quite striking results and some intriguing open problems .
One of the most surprising was an “ old ” result he has proved before on the theory of how birds flock .
This is an intriguing question , with no compelling answer .
They do flock , but we do not understand why they do , or how .
There are formal mathematical models , however , that let us try to study flocking .
One of the models Bernard studies is a variant of the model of Felipe Cucker and Steve Smale .
All models try to capture the following ideas :
Birds will try to avoid local crowding .
Birds tend to fly towards the average direction of their neighbors .
Birds tend to fly towards the average position of their neighbors .
What is surprising is Bernard proves an upper bound and a lower bound on how long it will take for the birds to achieve a steady state .
The times are immense — both the upper and the lower bound .
Theorem : A group of birds reach steady state in at most time steps .
birds reach steady state in at most time steps .
There are initial configurations of birds requiring more than time steps before steady state .
The notation with the arrows is defined by : and for ,
The proofs and the results are beautiful , but they suggest something is missing in the model , since the bounds are immense .
Birds do actually flock in reasonable amounts of time , so there must a more realistic model .
His results still are amazing .

Open Problems
One open problem is to find a model of flocking , for instance , where the bounds do not need exponential notation .
This should be possible .
The current work is beautiful , but birds do flock together faster than Bernard ’s lower bound .
He and I spoke about this after his talk and he agrees it is one of the key open problems in the area .

[ via 9 to 5 Mac and Mike Elgan ]
April 22 , 2010  -- Mark Wiegardt and Sue Cudd have each dedicated about 30 years of their lives to bringing oysters to our tables .
Now the two have found themselves in the forefront of one of the newest , most pressing environmental issues of our time : ocean acidification .
It all began with the oyster larvae at their Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery in Tilamook , Ore .
" It first started in 2007 .
We had a situation here when all of a sudden , our larvae started dying , " said Wiegardt .
" At first we started wondering , what is wrong ?
Bacterial problems ?
What are we doing wrong ? "
Cudd said .
Desperate , Wiegardt and Cudd turned to expert oceanographer Burke Hales and his team from Oregon State University to study the new and alarming enigma .
They learned that the Pacific waters piped into their hatchery from nearby Netarts Bay were the cause of the dying larvae .
Dying Larvae Depleting Oysters and Other Shellfish
Whiskey Creek 's 8,000 gallon water tanks take in water from the Pacific Ocean and Netarts Bay .
The water used in the hatchery is rough - filtered and heated , and pumped into the tanks that house roughly 48 million swimming larvae .
If the larvae stop swimming , that 's a problem .
The scientists went to work and learned that something was making the oceans too acidic and preventing the oyster larvae from growing shells .
No shells means certain death .
When winds blew the ocean 's deep carbon - rich waters onto the surface , hatcheries up and down the Northwest Pacific Coast began to suffer the same fate as Whiskey Creek .
" The chemistry is very simple .
It is 101 .
Carbon dioxide makes the water more acidic , that is irrefutable , " said Burke Hales , Oregon State University professor of oceanography .
Oceans act as sponges .
According to the Natural Resources Defense Council , the oceans soak up one - quarter to one - third of all CO2 from fossil fuels .
About 500 billion tons have been absorbed by the seas .
Close to 22 million tons of C02 a day mix with the natural carbon of the ocean .
But too much carbon and water makes the ocean too acidic .
Plants need carbon to grow , and animals exhale it with every breath .
But too much carbon creates a problem .
Where will it be stored , and how will it affect the chemistry of the planet ?
Carbon Dioxide -- CO2 -- a Mixed Blessing
" At first , scientists thought , Oh , is n't this great , the ocean 's taking up carbon dioxide that 's resulting in less greenhouse warming .
And it 's only later that scientists realize this carbon dioxide in the oceans forms carbonic acid , and that attacks the shells of marine organisms , " said Ken Caldeira , a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institute at Stanford University .
According to the NRDC , ocean acidity has increased by 30 percent since the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries .
Scientists have used mathematical models to demonstrate that if we continue to pollute , ocean acidity will double by the end of the century , compared with what it was in preindustrial times .
" While the effects are just beginning to be seen in our hatcheries , the oceans are now changing faster than they have ever changed over the last 200 million years , " said Richard Freely of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , who has been studying ocean acidification for 20 years .
" The effects can be seen in the weaker shells of oysters , clams , mussels , lobsters and shrimp .
Smaller - shelled creatures , such as those at the bottom of the food chain , which most fish eat , are also dwindling away , " said Freely .
" Corals have a hard time forming too . "
Ocean acidity , said Freely , threatens the entire $ 2 billion U.S. shellfish industry .
According to the United Nations Environmental Program , if carbon emissions continue on a path of business as usual , scientists predict vast areas of the Pacific , Arctic and Antarctic Oceans will become so corrosive that shellfish will dissolve , causing ripple effects throughout the food web .
" We 're risking something that will really change the way the oceans are for the rest of human civilization , " said Standord 's Caldeira .

So a texture is an image that is wrapped around a 3D model to add apparent detail -- but what 's a texture atlas ?
A texture atlas is an image that contains multiple textures .
For example , below you can see a character texture on the left , and a texture atlas on the right ( with four character textures ) .
Why use a texture atlas ?
There are two main reasons to use a texture atlas .
First , it can increase rendering speed by allowing you to batch more objects into a single draw call .
For example , if all the plants in the game use just one texture atlas , then you can draw them all at the same time .
Otherwise you would have to draw one group of plants , switch texture state , draw another group of plants , and so on .
Second , it allows you to use unusually - shaped textures .
Most graphics cards are designed to use textures that are square and have dimensions that are powers of two , such as 256x256 , 512x512 , and so on .
But what if you have a graphic that is 550x130 ?
You would have to put it in the middle of a 1024x1024 texture , and waste all the extra space .
Alternately , you could pack a lot of unusually - shaped textures into one square texture atlas , and hardly waste any space at all !
For both of these reasons , the Black Shades iPhone port has all the UI textures in the game on one texture atlas .
Here is a small part of it :
How do you create a texture atlas ?
To create a texture atlas you just need to combine several textures into one image , and keep track of the coordinates of each subimage .
Henry created that Black Shades atlas entirely by hand , moving subimages around and checking pixel positions .
However , since then he found an interesting online tool for creating texture atlases , called Zwoptex .
Alternately , you can create them automatically .
There are a number of tools that you can use for this , or you can write your own .
There is an algorithm with pseudocode here that you could try .
In Overgrowth , after calculating shadow maps , they are automatically combined into a texture atlas .
The shadow map atlas is created using an algorithm similar to the one linked earlier , using a greedy algorithm to fill from one corner outwards .
However , in the Overgrowth version , the textures are sorted by size .
First , it starts at the smallest textures and walks upwards to create a list of the textures that will fit in the atlas .
Then it adds the list to the atlas starting at the biggest one to make sure that there are no gaps .
Check out the post on Check out the post on two - part shadow maps if you 're wondering why they look like this .
As you can see , the biggest textures can be many times as big as the smallest ones , which is why we have to prioritize the smallest ones if we want to include as many textures as possible .
How do you use a texture atlas ?
Texture coordinates are usually relative to the size of the individual texture , with ( 0,0 ) corresponding to one corner , and ( 1,1 ) corresponding to the opposite corner .
But what happens when the texture is added to an atlas ?
Let 's consider three points on our original example , and their corresponding points in the atlas :
Each of the coordinates is scaled by ( 0.5,0.5 ) and offset by ( 0.0,0.5 ) .
When creating the atlas you have to keep track of the offset and scale for each texture so that you can access them again later .
In Overgrowth , the shadow map offset and scale is applied using the vertex shader so that the same model can be used with multiple shadow map coordinates .
Texture atlas limitations
Texture atlases will not work with tiling textures .
Instead of tiling , they will start showing other textures in the atlas , which is almost certainly not what you want .
The same is true for models that have texture coordinates outside of the range from 0 to 1 , assuming that they will wrap around .
It is also inefficient to use texture atlases if not all of the textures are used at once .
For example , if you have all your plants on one texture atlas , and the level only uses one plant , then you are wasting a lot of texture space on the graphics card .
The texture atlas should only be used if all or most of the textures are likely to be visible .
However , when used responsibly , the texture atlas is a useful tool in any graphics programmer 's toolbox .
Do you know of any good tools or algorithms for working with them that I did n't mention ?
Whats Hiding under this Imperial helmet ?
Some readers on Buzzfeed and on this blog were shocked by one of my last post about Lilo and Stich grown up .
I was accused of ” raping childhood memory ” of some ( very open minded ) people .
Why ? …
Because i was showing a different angle of a well known artist who happened to make movies for kids but who can also make cartoons with sensuality and big boobs in it ( YES BOOBS end of the world … )
So i am Happy and Proud to keep showing you some artist sexy vision of one great childhood memory : Star wars

But back to the main theme .
What has been really striking has been the eliminationist rhetoric of the G.O.P. , coming not from some radical fringe but from the party ’s leaders .
John Boehner , the House minority leader , declared that the passage of health reform was “ Armageddon . ”
The Republican National Committee put out a fund - raising appeal that included a picture of Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the House , surrounded by flames , while the committee ’s chairman declared that it was time to put Ms. Pelosi on “ the firing line . ”
And Sarah Palin put out a map literally putting Democratic lawmakers in the cross hairs of a rifle sight .
Image Paul Krugman Credit ...
Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
All of this goes far beyond politics as usual .
Democrats had a lot of harsh things to say about former President George W. Bush  but you ’ll search in vain for anything comparably menacing , anything that even hinted at an appeal to violence , from members of Congress , let alone senior party officials .
No , to find anything like what we ’re seeing now you have to go back to the last time a Democrat was president .
Like President Obama , Bill Clinton faced a G.O.P. that denied his legitimacy 
Dick Armey , the second - ranking House Republican ( and now a Tea Party leader ) referred to him as “ your president . ”
Threats were common : President Clinton , declared Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina , “ better watch out if he comes down here .
He ’d better have a bodyguard . ”
( Helms later expressed regrets over the remark  but only after a media firestorm . )
And once they controlled Congress , Republicans tried to govern as if they held the White House , too , eventually shutting down the federal government in an attempt to bully Mr. Clinton into submission .
Mr. Obama seems to have sincerely believed that he would face a different reception .
And he made a real try at bipartisanship , nearly losing his chance at health reform by frittering away months in a vain attempt to get a few Republicans on board .
At this point , however , it ’s clear that any Democratic president will face total opposition from a Republican Party that is completely dominated by right - wing extremists .
For today ’s G.O.P. is , fully and finally , the party of Ronald Reagan  not Reagan the pragmatic politician , who could and did strike deals with Democrats , but Reagan the antigovernment fanatic , who warned that Medicare would destroy American freedom .
It ’s a party that sees modest efforts to improve Americans ’ economic and health security not merely as unwise , but as monstrous .
It ’s a party in which paranoid fantasies about the other side 
Obama is a socialist , Democrats have totalitarian ambitions  are mainstream .
And , as a result , it ’s a party that fundamentally does n’t accept anyone else ’s right to govern .
As we drift further and further from the abyss of March of 2009 , there is a slow acceptance that things are getting better even though average Americans need only look at their individual household balance sheet to know this is n’t the case .
How can things not be better they ask ?
The S&P 500 is now up 74 percent in one year , the strongest run up since the Great Depression .
Yet Wall Street gets it that the longer they can stall and water down reform the more chance they have at getting away with the biggest wealth transfer in American history .
Even during the Great Depression , we actually learned lessons and enforced new rules to curb the gambling that led to the collapse .
This has yet to occur .
Let us look at some changes that occurred during the 1930s that certainly have not happened this time .
In the book by Frederick Lewis Allen the Big Change the author takes us through some of the important changes that occurred during that economic crisis :
Rule Change # 1 – Breaking up the Banks
“ In the first place it rewrote a good many of the rules of the economic game as played in America .
For instance , in order to prevent any recurrence of the financial follies of the nineteen - twenties , it divorced commercial banks from the securities business , forbade the issue of securities without exhaustive disclosure of pertinent facts , circumscribed pool operations on the stock exchanges and set up a federal agency to police these exchanges , and dismantled the more illogical holding - company structures in the utilities business .
Not only was there a new rule book , but at many points the federal government moved in as umpire to interpret and enforce rules . ”
We have actually done the opposite this time by making banks even larger :
At a time when it was obvious that too big to fail banks were causing major problems , instead of breaking them apart as we had done during the Great Depression we started merging these banks and creating the bond between investment banking and commercial banking even stronger .
This conflict of interest has skewered Americans even more now that Wall Street can gamble in the stock market with taxpayer money .
The Big Change was written in the early 1950s and the changes after the Great Depression must have seemed so obvious .
Yet here , we have JP Morgan Chase eating up Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual , you have Wells Fargo digesting Wachovia , and Bank of America purchasing Merrill Lynch all during the crisis .
Instead of breaking up the banks , we have made them even more powerful and most of their current profits come from their investment arms !
They are pulling back credit to average Americans while gambling away in the stock market .
They can borrow from the Federal Reserve at near zero percent and put that money to work in the casino .
No wonder why the 74 percent rally does n’t seem to make people feel better :
55 percent of Americans still feel that economic conditions are getting worse .
Could this be because the banking system has created a new corporatocracy that serves only their tiny purpose ?
Wall Street wants the middle class to cheer on their mega profits as if this is the true symbol of recovery .
The fact that we did not break up the banks , but merged and made them bigger tells us that we have failed to learn a primary lesson from the Great Depression .
Rule Change # 2 – Protecting the Worker
In no other time in history has the middle class in America been so ripped off with no criminal investigations as what occurred during the last decade .
During the Great Depression the government stepped in to protect workers ; this time it has stepped in to protect the banks :
“ In the second place , it intervened extensively in the economic game as protector of the underdog .
For instance , because the operations of one of the old - time rules of the game , the law of supply and demand , appeared to be doing damage to the American farmer , it stepped in to jack up and then to guarantee the prices he got .
( The anomalous result was that the farmers of the United States , as conservative a group temperamentally as were to be found in the land , became dependent for their very economic lives upon government decisions in their behalf ! ) ”
Now many of these policies did not work but it was clear on which side of the fence the government stood .
Today , even after the massive transfer of wealth to Wall Street banks are still robbing people with the zest of a criminal knowing he is getting away :
“ ( NY Times ) PHOENIX —
When the bank sued Leann Weaver for not paying her credit card balance , her reaction was typical for someone in that situation .
Personal and financial setbacks weighed her down , and she knew she owed the $ 2,470 .
So she never went to court to defend herself .
She was startled by what happened next .
When she swiped her debit card at the grocery store , it was declined .
It turned out Capital One Bank had taken $ 224.25 from her paycheck , a quarter of her wages for two weeks of work at a retail chain , and her bank account was overdrawn .
“ They ’re kicking somebody who ’s already in the dirt , ” she said . ”
Banks and collection agencies are acting like loan sharks and going after the poorest in our population .
Not only are they going after the initial debt , but with such usury rates they are doubling and tripling and sometimes going after more from those least able afford it .
The government is nowhere to be found .
In the Great Depression we learned that the banking system can suck the life out of the working class and here we are allowing the same banking system cut from the same cloth to rip off our fellow neighbors and family members .
Instead of calling foul and stepping in it seems that the government is encouraging this behavior from Wall Street and the financial industry .
Rule Change # 3 – Fiscal Stimulus went to Building
Things , not Banks
One major difference between today and the Great Depression was the first focus of many of the initiatives was getting people back to work .
The fiscal stimulus went to building things .
This time , we spent even more but it went into the pockets of banks which is the biggest crime of this fiscal disaster :
“ In the third place , it went into the active business of stimulating employment , by building dams , bridges , parkways , and playgrounds of the grand scale , and by putting even the recipients of relief to work at all manner of enterprises carefully concocted so as not to interfere with private business : and it set up the Tennessee Valley Authority to do a combined job of competing with the private electric utilities , preventing floods , and teaching farmers some of the principles of conservation . ”
In this fiscal stimulus era we got the worse of both worlds :
-$ 700 billion TARP to banks -$ 200 billion to nationalize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - $ 29 billion to bail out Bear Stearns - $ 150 billion for AIG - $ 350 billion for Citigroup - $ 87 billion to JP Morgan for bad Lehman Brothers trades - $ 200 billion in loans to banks from TAF - $ 50 billion for temporary IOUs for money market accounts - $ 500 billion to rescue other credit markets
The list goes on but how are the above massive targeted employment creating activities ?
In the end we have given or backstopped some $ 13 trillion in bailouts for the banks .
Then , we spend a few billion in job creation activities just to say we have .
This is like the one token vegetable on a plate of massive prime rib banking funds .
Is it any wonder that it has taken over two years to produce a month with 100,000 + job growth ?
And a large number of those jobs are low wage or include 40,000 + from Census hiring .
Rule Change # 4 – The New Government
During the Great Depression , whatever you may think of the policies , the government stood much closer to the people than today :
“ The result of all these interventions – the reform measures , the subsidies and guarantees , the public works , the encouragement of labor , and the attempt to steer the economy as a whole – was certainly not a socialist order , at least in the old sense of the government ’s taking over the management of business and industry .
For the management of the vast variety of concerns remained in private hands ( though it was so often hedged in by regulations , bedeviled by taxes , and opposed by unions that many an executive felt himself a prisoner of government and labor ) .
Nor was it a free economic order , at least in the old sense of an order in which everybody ’s economic fortunes were determined by the action of buyers and sellers in the open market , with the government standing aside as Herbert Hoover had tried to stand aside in 1930 - 31 .
It was something between the two : one might call it a repaired and modified form of capitalism in which – to revert to our earlier figure of speech – the government umpires were forever blowing their whistles and rushing onto the field to penalize this player or that , or to pace off a fifteen - yard gain for a hard - pressed team . ”
The government today and for the last few decades has been bought by the corporatocracy .
They are back to making their revenue in the same manner as they have always done !
Nothing has changed .
The only thing that has changed is the middle class is trillions poorer while banks somehow have trillions more in taxpayer funds .
The transfer of wealth is so obvious and many Americans are waking up to this .
We have not learned primary lessons from the Great Depression .
We are now on path to another crisis because nothing has changed .
After all , if nothing has changed then why should we expect a different result ?

Israel is blocking imports of Apple 's new iPad device until its officials can verify that the tablet computer complies with local transmitter standards and does not interfere with other wireless devices .
"
If you operate equipment in a frequency band which is different from the others that operate on that frequency band , then there will be interference , " said Nati Schubert , a senior deputy director for the country 's Communications Ministry , according to a report from the Associated Press .
He added , " We do n't care where people buy their equipment .
...
But without regulation , you would have chaos . "
Schubert noted that her department 's U.S. counterpart , the Federal Communications Commission , allows wireless devices to broadcast at higher power levels than what 's allowed in Europe and Israel .
While Israel 's wireless standards are similar to those of other European nations , no other country is blocking imports of the gadget .
The country 's iPad ban , which prevents citizens and even tourists from bringing the device into Israel , should not affect those who managed to import one before the regulations took effect last week .
As of last Thursday , custom officials in Israel had already confiscated around 10 of the Apple tablets .
Israel 's customs agency will hold those iPads for a daily storage fee and return them to their owners ( or ship the devices back to them at their expense ) when they leave the country .
While the WiFi-only edition of the iPad debuted in the U.S. on April 3rd , Apple delayed the tablet 's international launch by one month to the end of May , citing " surprisingly strong " demand for the tablet that resulted in sales of more than 450,000 units with a week after its release .
Schubert expects Israel to resolve its issues with the iPad as the international release approaches .
U.S Declaration of Independence July 04 , 1776
- When in the Course of human events , it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another , and to assume among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature 's God entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation .
- We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
-- That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed ,
-- That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
-- Prudence , indeed , will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn , that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
--
But when a long train of abuses and usurpation , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security .

And if you like that , you might also like One Bloody Thing After Another which is written by the same person , ME !
And it 's a real book that exists in real life with a pretty cover and flammable pages !
When I was a kid , I used to repeat everything I said under my breath .
I had it pretty thoroughly teased out of me in junior high , and it 's been gone since then .
I always just sort of assumed that I was going over what I said to make sure it had n't been stupid .
That 's what it was in my head anyway .
And when I stopped , well , I stopped thinking about it .
But lately I 've developed a sort of word - stutter , when I 'm talking .
I 'll repeat a word or pair of words three or four times .
Sometimes I do n't even notice I 'm doing it .
It just sort of flows .
Sometimes , though , I will catch myself , and I 'll have to change the sentence in order to get it out .
It 's not very often , but it 's new and sort of bewildering .
Someone suggested that this sounded like palilalia which it turns out it sounds EXACTLY like !
So , I guess I have a weird condition I did n't know had a name !
Simple living is reducing the clutter of life and space down to the essentials of what is important ; allowing what remains to stand out and bring value .
Reuse items —
Coffee in travel mugs instead of Styrofoam ; use rags instead of paper towels .
Reconnect —
Spend time with family , eliminate distractions , go outdoors , or go it alone .
Rethink —
Ask yourself if you need the item .
Is it worth the money you make , will it be used , will it be of value ?
Reevaluate —
Take a look at your bills and see where you can lower consumption ; add a low - flow shower - head , conserve water , lights , etc. Reduce — Live in a smaller space .
There 's less to take care of and less to worry about .
Simple living has been going on for many , many years — Hindu and Buddhist from the east and in the west with Shakers , Mennonites , Amish and Quakers .
They practice a life of moving away from wealth and technology .
Though simple living is a part of these religions , it is more a philosophy and lifestyle that could , in a sense , become its own religion .
Much like thein the US and thetaking place in parts of Europe .
People who are active in their simplicity voluntarilyand putas it relates to what they buy .
For instance :
If you make $ 100 a day at work and a sofa costs $ 500 , you just spent a week working to buy that sofa — you want to make darn sure it is worth your time and lasts you as long as possible .
Thisin our lives not only simplifies the clutter around us , but also the stress ' clutter ' in our lives .
If you are only working towards maintaining the few things of value in your life , you have a better direction as well as less stress about ' keeping up with the neighbors ' .
Withbeing able to reuse / recycle an item to make it last longer also allows you to live with a smaller ' footprint ' in the world .
I believe that there is not a religion out there that saysTechnology in the simple life is a personal decision .
If you feel removing it might be best for you , test it out and see what you can do without .
However , to only the items that bring VALUE to your life , and not distraction , might be the first step to make .
Where do you start ?
One of the biggest influences in our lives is advertising and the pressure to ' fit in ' to a certain cookie - cutter mold .
Break out and break away !

Here at Google we ’re really excited about the promise of tablet computers , which will be great for browsing the web and using apps .
We ’ve been working hard to optimize our services for the new format - larger touchscreens , increased portability , rich sensors - and we ’d like to share some information about our progress so far .
While surfing the web on your iPad , we expect many of you will want to check your Gmail .
If you go to gmail .com in your browser , you ’ll see something different than what you ’re used to on the desktop .
We ’re releasing an experimental user interface for the iPad built on the Gmail for mobile HTML5 web app that we launched last year for the iPhone and Android devices .
Those devices have large screens compared to other phones , and tablets like the iPad give us even more room to innovate .
To take advantage of the iPad ’s large display , we ’ve created a two - pane view with your list of conversations on the left and messages to the right .
To try this new interface , go to gmail .com in your browser .
We recommend adding a homescreen link for easy access .
As this interface is experimental , expect changes as we continue to develop and optimize .
Also , please let us know any ideas or feedback that you have .
You can also access Gmail on the iPad through the native Mail app using the IMAP protocol .
Additionally , the iPad ships with a number of Google services pre-installed .
As with Mac computers and the iPhone , you ’ll find Google Search in the top right corner of Safari .
The YouTube app for iPad is built - in , so you can watch HD videos and read and write comments .
The new Maps app on iPad takes advantage of high - resolution satellite and Street View imagery , includes a new terrain view , and lets you search for local businesses and get directions .
Just like on the iPhone , you can also go to the App Store to download Google Mobile App with search by voice .
Of course , Google Mobile App was originally designed for the iPhone ’s screen dimensions , but we ’ve adapted it to work on the iPad and we ’re looking into new ideas to make the app even better .
As you use Google ’s web - based applications on iPad , you ’ll notice that you sometimes see the desktop user interface and other times you see the mobile interface .
We ’ve evaluated the behavior of each Google web app using the iPad Simulator , and we are serving the interface we feel works best .
If you ’d like any help using our products on iPad , please click the ' Help ' link within the product .
We ’re particularly excited by how tablet computers create the opportunity for new kinds of user interaction .
Here on the mobile team , we often talk about how mobile devices are sensor - rich : they can sense touch through their screens , see with a camera , hear through a microphone , and they know where they are with GPS .
The same holds true for tablet computers , and we ’re just starting to work through how our products can become even better on devices like the iPad .

NEW YORK –
The workers of the world united here , literally , May 1 in a historic rally , organized by the labor and immigrants ’ rights movements .
Its aim was simple : demand government action on jobs , end harassment of immigrant workers , and “ reclaim May Day . ”
The rally was planned well before the Arizona anti-immigrant law was passed , but repeal of the law became a significant rallying cry of the demonstration .
The other main demand was for jobs for all .
May 1 – May Day – is celebrated around the world as a day honoring international solidarity and workers ’ rights , but until recently it was largely forgotten in the U.S. , though it originated in Chicago out of the fight the eight - hour workday .
Over the past several years , this date has become synonymous with the immigrant rights ’ movement as a day for large rallies in cities across the U.S .
This year in New York , labor unions came together with immigration coalitions to “ reclaim ” the holiday .
International solidarity and unity of the world ’s working class against the capitalist class have always been the main themes of May Day , so the alliance of the two overlapping movements proved a good fit : organizers estimated that 20,000 – 25,000 people turned out .
“ I ’m so proud to be here with what America is , ” Rep. Charles Rangel , who shared the stage with Rep. Nydia Velazquez , told the crowd .
“ Here we have people from Puerto Rico , people from Taiwan , people from Africa , people from Europe , people from Israel : that is the United States of America . ”
City Council Speaker Christine Quinn remarked that New York “ is and will stay an immigrant city . ”
AFL - CIO Executive Vice President Arlene Holt Baker , who is both the top African American and top woman in the nation ’s labor movement , made the case that immigrant rights are bound up with the rights of all workers .
Noting that thousands of workers have died in workplace - related injuries , Holt Baker asked , “ Is it in our nation ’s interest to have workers too scared to report hazards ?
Too frightened to stand up for their rights and basic protections on their job , like minimum wage , or the right to form a union ? ”
Second - class status , she argued , divides working people and allows working conditions to slide downwards .
“ We need an America that guarantees safe workplaces , and protects workers ’ rights – all workers ’ rights – regardless of race , regardless of gender or ethnicity or nationality or immigration status , ” she declared .
“ What has happened in Arizona is abominable , ” New York City Council member Melissa Mark Viverito told the rally .
“ We need to make sure that what happened in Arizona is the exception and not the rule in this country . ”
Viverito , co-chair of the council ’s progressive caucus , said the federal government should expedite a review of the Arizona law , so it can be rolled back as unconstitutional before it goes into effect .
Calling for a city boycott of Arizona , Viverito said , “ We must ask our officials to look at ways we can disinvest our money , our pension money , from corporations in Arizona to send a very strong message about where we stand . ”
New York is the perfect backdrop for a holiday like May Day .
The city ’s working people come from virtually all nations in the world and speak more than 800 different languages , making the city the most linguistically diverse on the planet .
In addition , New York is known for its strong labor movement : the union density is far higher than in most American cities , many tens of thousands of workers are organized , and labor routinely plays a significant role in local , state and federal elections .

Rumors last week that Google were paying carriers a portion of their revenue on in -application advertising have been strongly denied by the company , who insist that only Google search ad revenue is shared with network operators .
The rumors had been used by some as evidence for the recent proliferation of Android devices offered by carriers , but according to an official comment given to eWeek , it has no basis in fact .
“ We share revenue on search , not on mobile applications .
The same is true for non-Android devices that use Google as the default search engine ” Google spokesperson
Carrier AT&T in the US is notable for having exchanged Google search functionality for Yahoo ! on handsets like the Motorola BACKFLIP .
Google has previously said that OEMs are free to load builds of Android with their own choice of search provider , though it can then limit what Google - brand apps ( such as GMail ) are also preinstalled onto the handset .
Specific details of Google ’s search ad - revenue share deals with carriers are unknown at present .
So , look , I know my ranking in the campaign team is problematic .
But I do not see my best fucking role as playing Nick Clegg in your debate warm - ups , all right ?
It 's not seemly .
It 's not respectful .
It is , quite frankly , bullshit on an English muffin .
Plus I really think you can find someone more suited to playing Clegg .
Like a Weetabix with a Dictaphone taped to it .
Daniel Radcliffe .
Geoff Hoon if I cut out his tongue with a rusty British army field knife .
Even Nick Clegg himself would probably be pretty pleased to turn up for 40 quid and the chance to hang out with some grown - ups – although I think you might find the guy a bit unconfuckingvincing .
See , what exactly am I meant to be doing ?
You can have me outside the tent pissing in , or you can have me inside the tent pissing out , and also picking off campers with a sniper rifle .
But if you do n't give me one of those roles soon you 're going to find me over by the shower block taking a shit on the four - pack of Kronenbourg and the packet of Cathedral City cheddar in your icebox .
Frankly , I think you 're getting the wrong advice on the debates .
As you know , people who saw Nixon and Kennedy on TV thought Kennedy won , and those who heard it on the radio thought Nixon won .
But , really , we do n't give a flying wad of wet Daily Express about either of these groups .
What we need to know is : what about the people who were sitting through JFK - Nixon on the can doodling specs on cartoon - strip pictures of Daffy Duck and making themselves laugh with the sounds of their own farts ?
Who did they think won ?
Most people are not going to see these Bestivals of bore .
After all , with the 478 debate rules in place they 're going to have all the drama of three middle - aged guys fencing with limp dicks .
The only ones watching are going to be the pointless bastards who already know what they think .
We need to get to the people who only hear the rumours .
Bottom feeders who get their views via the quotes from the models in the Daily Star .
Van drivers who guard their vast ignorance with concealed Stanley knives .
Businessmen who like to expose their self - aggrandising cynicism to schoolgirls on the Thameslink .
These dumb motherfuckers are the battlefield .
Shitheels .
Dunderheads .
People who when you talk to them it's like shouting through six pieces of double glazing .
Potheads , cider drinkers , kids who do n't know who Thatcher was and think the NHS grew on a big fucking NHS tree .
Wankers .
People who count to 11 using their 10 fingers and their head and still get it wrong .
This is who we have to get to via the debates .
So we are going to have to shout extremely fucking loud .
NICs
Now , obviously everyone is finding the election incredibly exciting – barring those not directly involved in the media or campaigns : ie the electorate .
And probably the most thrilling part of the whole thing is the " battle " over national insurance which , brilliantly , no one understands .
The Tories have tried to brand NI a tax on jobs , which has the merit of being such an oversimplification that it actually makes it harder to understand what they 're talking about .
My advice on NI : move on , nothing to see here .
The Big Society
This is going to be the next battlefield , apparently .
Except , excuse me , but what the bucket - face is the Big Society ?
Is it like the Wine Society except for fat lads and lasses ?
What does it mean ?
The Cubs doing coronary bypasses ?
Tax disc with your Planet Earth DVD ?
Bono in charge of the west coast mainline ?
Cardinal O'Dodgy gets to run a kiddies home ?
The Scientologists do the RAC and the RAC run housing benefit ?
That 's what 's going to mend Broken Britain and let them cut government spending by a quarter ?
They 're using a corner - shop bag to carry Howitzer shells .
It 's going to fall apart .
Put it under the spotlight .
Until next week : Limp On , Oh Great Man of Granite !
Regards , Malcolm
PORTLAND – Four students waited quietly in the dark , lounging in a cluster of comfy leather sofas and chairs .
On the table was a digital audio recorder that they hoped would pick up the sounds of any restless spirits in the library at Portland High School .
Custodians had told them that the library was a prime location to experience paranormal activity .
Outside on the roof , dozens of seagulls suddenly raised a racket with their groaning and squawking and screeching .

“ Do you think the voices that the janitors hear are the seagulls ? ” asked Duke Newcomb , drawing a burst of laughter from the other students .
The students are members of a new - media class at Portland Arts and Technology High School .
They spent the wee hours of Thursday morning — part of their spring vacation — hunting ghosts at Portland High , with some apparent success .
Portland High , the nation ’s second - oldest continuously operating public high school , has long been rumored to be haunted by restless spirits .
PATHS is a vocational school that serves students from more than 20 high schools in the area .
When David Beane asked his students for class project ideas , Portland High seniors Jon Mikkelsen and Rocco Didonato suggested creating a video program modeled after the television series “ Ghost Hunters , ” on the Syfy Channel .
Their half - hour program will air on local cable channels in the coming weeks .
Thirteen students were at the high school from 11 p.m. Wednesday to 3:30 a.m. Thursday .
They used audio recorders , low - light cameras , hands - off laser temperature gauges and electromagnetic frequency readers to monitor paranormal activity in the auditorium , a basement music room , an art room , the science wing and the library .
In the music room , an audio recorder picked up several minutes of rustling and what sounded like music stands being moved .
“ There also was something that sounded like chimes , but that could have been ( the bells of City Hall ) , ” said Mike Cardinal , a Scarborough High senior who attends music classes at PATHS .
Beane invited Cardinal to the ghost hunt because he is familiar with modern sound equipment .
In the library , three people reported feeling the sensation of being touched .
“ It felt like someone touched my hand , ” said Andrea Brown , a junior at Bonny Eagle High School in Standish .
“ I got up and walked around a little and it happened again . ”
In the art room , two students felt similar sensations .
“ I get the heebie jeebies when I come in here , ” said Mikkelsen , who plans to attend the New England School of Communications in Bangor .
Didonato captured a glowing orb — which ghost hunters say may indicate the presence of a spirit — in a digital photograph taken in the auditorium .
Beane , a former TV news director and producer , said he does believe in the spirit world .
He grew up in the house where his great - grandmother died .
In the decades that followed , family members credited her with making rocking chairs move and walking the stairs at night .
“ I believe there ’s something out there , ” Beane said .
“ Maybe I ’m crazy , but it makes for a good class project . ”
Beane ’s students have differing opinions .
Newcomb , a South Portland High senior , said his family has experienced several paranormal events , so he jumped at the chance to participate in the ghost hunt .
Matt Peaslee , a junior at Greely High in Cumberland , said , “ I do n’t necessarily believe in this kind of stuff .
I just thought I ’d come and be a part of it . ”
When Beane ’s students return to school Monday , they will review the information they gathered , determine whether their findings are relevant and use video and audio recordings to produce a half - hour show .
Whether or not his students actually encountered any ghosts is really beside the point , Beane said .
They ’re learning to use various new - media technologies and practicing other skills such as math , literacy and teamwork .
Most of all , he said , they ’re working on a project with passion and creativity that could lead to a profession .
“ Most of these kids chose to take this class , ” Beane said .
“ More than half of them are serious about following new media as a career path . ”

UPDATE : Seagal 's lawyer , Marty Singer , responded to the lawsuit this way : " The lawsuit filed by Kayden Nguyen against Steven Seagal is a ridiculous and absurd claim by a disgruntled ex-employee who was fired for using illegal narcotics . "
Singer says the suit is a " complete fabrication without a scintilla of truth " and he 's confident it will be dismissed .
Steven Seagal is accused of trafficking women for sex , according to a lawsuit obtained by TMZ .
A 23 - year - old former model claims she interviewed with Seagal last February for the position of executive assistant .
Kayden Nguyen says she got the job , but when she showed up for work , she learned , " Mr. Seagal had been keeping two young female Russian ' Attendants ' on staff who were available for his sexual needs 24 hours a day , 7 days a week . "
Nguyen alleges in her suit , one of the ' Attendants ' had recently quit and it was this job -- not executive assistant -- Seagal intended her to fill .
Nguyen claims the very first night on the job , Seagal treated her " as his sex toy . "
Nguyen says in the lawsuit Seagal , pushed his hands under her skirt , tried fondling her breasts and forced his hand down her pants .
Nguyen says she complained the next morning -- unclear to whom -- but nothing was done .
Nguyen says the next day Seagal did it again , sexually assaulting her and forcing her to consume illegal pills .
And she says there were other sexual assaults that followed .
According to the suit , Seagal said , " My wife would n't mind if you and I had a sexual relationship . "
Nguyen is suing for more than a million bucks .
Elizabeth Warren , who is chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel investigating the banking bailouts , is now being put forward as a name for consideration to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Stevens .
The Harvard law professor has clear opinions on where the financial balance of power is to head in America , and its not in favor of the banking and financial services industries .
Today , Warren called for banks to seriously consider writing down mortgages in the pursuit of a more realistic housing market , but also placed pressure on homeowners to be honest about what they can and can't afford .
Warren is a supporter of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency , part of Sen. Chris Dodd 's financial reform bill .
Here she is talking about its importance :
Warren has stuck her neck out in defense of the proposed CFPA , saying that it needs to exist independently of the Treasury so it can have a " cop on the beat " who 's purpose is focus on the relationship between the financial industry and consumers alone .
She is an advocate for the plight of the middle class and the comparative losses they have had to endure as a result of economic change .

It is perfectly timed to feed into the current campaign by the government and corporate media to demonize the patriot movement and portray militias around the country as domestic terrorists — MSNBC ’s “ The McVeigh Tapes : Confessions of an American Terrorist ” will run on April 19 .
The real McVeigh story conflicts with the official mythology of violent patriot and militia groups .
“ In the documentary , viewers will be able to hear McVeigh ’s confession for the first time in his own words — the planning and carrying out of the attack , ” reports KTUL in Oklahoma .
On March 31 , Aitan Goelman , a member of the Department of Justice team that helped win convictions against McVeigh and Terry Nichols in the Oklahoma case , said that the great risk of America ’s growing militia movement is not necessarily in the militias themselves , but rather their capacity to spark rogue actors like Mr. McVeigh , according to the Christain Science Monitor .
“ On the edges ” of political discourse today , Goelman told the newspaper , “ you have rhetoric that carries over to extreme factions . ”
Goelman made his comment two days after the FBI raided the Hutaree group in Michigan and several days before the Guardians of the free Republics sent letters to state governors around the country suggesting they resign .
“ Anytime you have group - think and this churning of ridiculous ideas back and forth , eventually you ’ll get someone like McVeigh who ’s going to say ‘ I ’m going to take the mantle of leadership and fire the shot heard around the world and start the second American revolution , ' ” said Goelman .
The FBI said last week that while they considered the Guardians of the free Republics non-violent — the group is inspired by Mahatma Gandhi , Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King , Jr. — they believe other groups or individuals will use the call for state government officials to step down as a pretext to engage in violence .
“ A federal intelligence note is warning police that an anti-government group ’s call to remove dozens of sitting governors may encourage others to act out violently , ” the Associated Press reported on April 2 .
“ Investigators do not see threats of violence in the group ’s message , but fear the broad call for removing top state officials could inspire others to act out violently . ”
“ Neither McVeigh nor Mr. Nichols were members of any specific organization , but they were known to associate with hate groups and militias , ” notes the Christian Science Monitor .
Aitan Goelman suggests rhetoric by militia groups has the ability to “ spark rogue actors like Mr. McVeigh . ”
Salt Lake City attorney Jesse Trentadue revealed in 2007 that McVeigh was handled by the FBI .
Trentadue learned of the government ’s connection to McVeigh during a lawsuit filed to release documents in the murder of his brother while in government custody .
In the process of the lawsuit , Trentadue was given access to McVeigh ’s alleged co-conspirator , Terry Nichols .
“ Trentadue was able to discover that , according to Nichols , Attorney General ’s Ashcroft ’s office gagged Nichols from speaking to the media after it became apparent that McVeigh ’s accomplices and government ties to the bombing were in danger of leaking , ” Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones wrote on February 23 , 2007 .
“ During the process of his lawsuit , Trentadue was able to receive documents with names blacked out that show the FBI ’s OKC bombing informants were conducting armed robberies with Timothy McVeigh in order to fund the construction of the fertilizer bomb used in the attack on the federal building .
One of the informants was actually an explosives instructor who taught McVeigh how to make the bomb , according to Trentadue .
In addition , McVeigh told Nichols he was recruited for undercover missions while serving in the military , according to the Salt Lake Tribune .
18 months before the OK City bombing , McVeigh was captured on videotape at Camp Grafton , North Dakota , a military base specializing in demolitions training .
The official FBI timeline on McVeigh claims he had no military affiliations at the time .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
The Trentadue documents also show that McVeigh called Elohim City two days before the bombing asking for help .
Four months before the bombing an FBI informant told his superiors of the attack plan and said that the Alfred P. Murrah building had been scouted .
Elohim City allegedly had ties to The Covenant , The Sword and The Arm of the Lord , a paramilitary survivalist group that operated an Identity settlement near the Arkansas - Missouri border .
In addition to the FBI , the Southern Poverty Law Center was active at Elohim City .
The McCurtain Daily Gazette reported on a declassified memo sent to the OKBOMB investigation task force and a select group of FBI offices eight months after the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City .
“ One of the revelations was the involvement of civil - rights attorney Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center in an informant operation , ” WorldNetDaily reported on January 6 , 2004 .
“ According to the memo , the SPLC was involved in monitoring subjects for the FBI believed to be linked to now - executed bomber Timothy McVeigh , the neo -Nazi compound at Elohim City and the mysterious German national Andreas Carl Strassmeir . ”
According to research conducted by Nicole Nichols , Strassmeir was a member of the German military and according to sources the principal militia trainer at Elohim City .
Strassmeir , writes Nichols , “ first came to the United States because he claimed that he had hoped to work in the operations section of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency . ”
He later claimed the OK City bombing “ was a government ‘ op ’ that went wrong ” and the ATF “ had something going with McVeigh . ”
“ References to an informant working for the SPLC at Elohim City on the eve of the Oklahoma City bombing raises serious questions as to what the SPLC might know about McVeigh ’s activities during the final hours before the fuse was lit in Oklahoma City – but which the SPLC has failed to disclose publicly . ”
“ If I told you what we were doing there , I would have to kill you , ” Dees replied when asked by the media about the SPLC ’s involvement .
The FBI , SPLC , and the ATF have their fingerprints all over the OK City bombing .
However , when MSNBC runs its documentary later this month you will hear nothing about the real story behind the event because it conflicts with the official mythology of violent patriot and militia groups .
Instead you will hear McVeigh ’s “ confession ” claiming he acted alone .
Considering the fact McVeigh ’s doctor while awaiting his death sentence was none other than Dr. Louis Jolyn West , it will be difficult to believe the planned televised confession .
“ The preeminent don of the CIA ’s psychological warfare program [ MK Ultra ] was Dr. Louis Jolyn West , ” writes David Hoffman , author of The Oklahoma City Bombing and the Politics of Terror .
West was also the psychiatrist who examined Jack Ruby , the assassin of Lee Harvey Oswald , and Sirhan Sirhan , the “ controlled hypo- patsy ” who allegedly killed Robert F. Kennedy .
April 19 is not only the anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing .
It is also the anniversary of the Waco massacre .
During the latter half of the month , as Alex Jones has warned , we may witness a false flag attack that will be blamed specifically on the militias and generally on groups and individuals organized in opposition to the government .
The Hutaree raid — revealed to be an FBI spawned patsy operation — and more recently the outlandish accusations against the Guardians of the free Republics are being used as propaganda operations with the full complicity of the corporate media to set the stage for a coming false flag operation designed to take down the patriot movement in this country .

Thailand & Cambodia Argue About Thaksin & the Coup
Thailand and Cambodia Argue About Thaksin & the Coup by Richard S. Ehrlich
BANGKOK , Thailand -- Thailand and Cambodia have descended into a loud political feud about Bangkok 's 2006 coup , and Thailand 's current threat to demand the extradition of its fugitive former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra .
The rift between the two Buddhist - majority nations in the heart of Southeast Asia was expected to worsen if Mr. Thaksin accepts Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen 's surprise offer of a temporary house .
" There is an extradition process , " warned Thailand 's powerful Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban on Tuesday ( October 27 ) .
" The turmoil following Cambodian leader Hun Sen 's remarks , about ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra being welcome in his country , has thrown the government into a spin , " the Bangkok Post newspaper , which opposes Mr. Thaksin , reported on Tuesday ( October 27 ) .
Ratcheting up his rhetoric , Mr. Hun Sen compared Mr. Thaksin to Burma 's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi , a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who has languished under house arrest in Rangoon for 14 years .
" Many people are talking about Mrs. Suu Kyi of Burma .
Why can't I talk about the victim , Thaksin ? " Mr. Hun Sen said on October 23 .
" That can not be regarded as interference by Cambodia into Thai internal affairs .
Without the coup d'etat in 2006 , such a thing would not have happened , " Hun Sen said .
Soft - spoken Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva lashed out Mr. Hun Sen 's remarks .
" There are few people in the world who believe Thaksin is similar to that of Mr. Suu Kyi , " Mr. Abhisit said later that day .
" I hope Prime Minister Hun Sen will receive the right information and change his mind on the matter . "
Cambodia 's government spokesman Phay Siphan said on October 23 : " Cambodia has a right to offer Thaksin to visit Cambodia , and we have no obligation to send him back to Thailand . "
If " former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra wishes to travel to Cambodia anytime ... the Cambodian prime minister is ready to prepare a residence for [ his ] stay in Cambodia , " reported Cambodia 's government - run TVK television on October 22 , according to Agence - France Presse .
Mr. Thaksin has been an international fugitive , based mostly in Dubai , dodging a two - year prison sentence for a conflict of interest .
That conviction involved a Bangkok real estate deal -- for his now divorced wife -- which was arranged when he was prime minister .
Mr. Thaksin became prime minister in 2001 when most voters elected the billionaire telecommunications tycoon , hoping he would boost the economy and modernize Thailand .
Mr. Thaksin was removed in September 2006 by Thailand 's U.S. - trained military in a bloodless coup when they used tanks , armored personnel carriers , Humvees and other weapons to seize power .
He has unsuccessfully tried to return to power with the help of allied politicians , and get back his two billion U.S. dollars worth of assets which the coup leaders froze .
International human rights groups , however , want Mr. Thaksin investigated for his role in the alleged extrajudicial murder of more than 2,000 people during his government 's " war on drugs . "
Mr. Thaksin remains politically active in self - exile .
He helps lead a mass movement of so - called " Red Shirts " who claim to represent Thailand 's majority lower classes , especially in the countryside .
Together they demand an immediate election , expecting Mr. Thaksin 's allies to win .
They are opposed by the " Yellow Shirts " who claim to support Thailand 's urban middle class and constitutional monarchy .
Led by Sondhi Limthongkul , the Yellow Shirts blockaded Bangkok 's international and domestic airports in November 2008 for eight days , stranding more than 300,000 people worldwide .
Their blockade helped weaken a government allied to Mr. Thaksin , and paved the way for Parliament to elect Mr. Abhisit .
Mr. Abhisit 's fragile coalition government enjoys the military 's support , and much of his personal security is handled by the military .
Thailand 's wealthy elite have mostly thrown their weight behind Mr. Abhisit as well , and appear nervous about Mr. Thaksin and the Red Shirts plotting to destabilize Bangkok .
Cambodia 's prime minister has thrown a wild card into this dangerous mix , apparently hoping to attract big investments by Mr. Thaksin and weaken Bangkok 's strategy over a smoldering border dispute , according to some analysts .
" It is true that I would invite former Prime Minister Thaksin to visit Cambodia anytime , and to be my economic advisor , " Mr. Hun Sen said on October 22 .
Thailand and Cambodia are former war - time enemies -- and current investment partners -- so the stakes are high for all sides to quell their public sniping .
Occasional killings on both sides have continued in and around the ancient stone ruins of Preah Vihear , a Hindu temple on the Thai - Cambodian border .
That dispute dates back to the 1950s , and continued even after the International Court in the Hague , Netherlands , confirmed Cambodia 's ownership in 1962 .
The conflict flared again after the ruins were declared a World Heritage Site in July 2008 by the World Heritage Committee , based on Cambodia 's proposal to cash in on its tourism potential .
Thailand and Cambodia have suffered much worse relations in the past .
After Richard Nixon became president of the United States in 1969 , he used Thailand as one of several military staging areas for heavy aerial bombing raids against communists in Vietnam , Cambodia and Laos , until America 's wars ended in 1975 -- one year after Nixon 's presidency -- with the U.S. defeated in all three countries .
Washington and Bangkok later indirectly backed Cambodia 's communist Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot , when his jungle - based guerrillas were in a loose alliance with other Cambodian rebels fighting against Vietnam 's 1979 - 1989 occupation of Cambodia .
Thai and Cambodian politicians have been fleeing to each other 's country for the past 50 years , seeking sanctuary from coups , arrest warrants , and other threats .
In 1957 , when Thai dictator Field Marshall Sarit Thanarat unleashed a military coup against Prime Minister Phibun Songkram , the toppled leader fled Thailand for Cambodia in his Ford Thunderbird car .

Game 5 , if necessary is Friday April 23 , also in Abbotsford
I 'm strong at making the first pass , my shot , I have a good shot from the point , and just vision for the ice .
All those things kind of add up together , and I think they make me the player that I am .
- Flames prospect Keith Seabrook
For now , though , being the younger brother of an NHL mainstay has its perks , especially when that brother also won an Olympic gold medal .
Keith is the younger brother of Chicago Blackhawks defenseman Brent Seabrook , a former first - round draft pick who began his pro career with the AHL's Norfolk Admirals before moving to full - time duty on the Blackhawks ' blue line in 2005 - 06 .
Brent , who is three years older than Keith , earned a spot on Canada 's 2010 Olympic squad in Vancouver and faced the United States in an epic gold - medal match on Feb.
28 . Less than 24 hours before that puck drop , Keith and the Heat were wrapping up an East coast road trip in Worcester , Mass .
Keith quickly drove to New York City and caught a red - eye flight west , making it to the arena in time to see his brother and the rest of the Canadians win gold .
" It was unbelievable , definitely something I 'll never forget and my brother will never forget , " he said .
" To be able to experience that and hang out with him afterwards , it was just unbelievable .
" The Seabrook brothers grew up near Delta , British Columbia , and their father had them on skates by the time they were three or four years old .
When the time came to begin playing organized hockey , Keith -- and Brent , to a lesser extent -- started out at the forward position .
But as a result of a lineup scramble in a pee- wee tournament , Keith 's career as a defenseman was born .
"
We were in a tournament , and my team did n't have enough defensemen , so I played defense for the tournament , " he said .
" I was pretty good at it , so ever since then , since I was about seven or eight , I 've been playing defense .
" So far , the switch seems to be working out rather nicely for Seabrook , who was drafted in the second round ( No. 52 ) by the Washington Capitals in 2006 and acquired by the Calgary Flames in a trade last summer .
During the AHL regular season , which concluded Sunday , Seabrook led all Heat defensemen with 10 goals and shared first place with 28 points .
He appeared in 78 of the team 's 80 games , only missing a February game due to the flu before being given the regular - season finale off .
The first - year Heat finished third in the AHL's North Division at 39 - 29 - 5 - 7 for 90 points and will open the Calder Cup Playoffs against the Rochester Americans on Thursday night .
" ( I 'm strong at ) making the first pass , my shot , I have a good shot from the point , and just vision for the ice , " Seabrook said .
" All those things kind of add up together , and I think they make me the player that I am .
" Seabrook 's vision and shooting ability turned him into a key element of Abbotsford 's power play this season .
The 21 - year - old registered 17 ( 7 goals , 10 assists ) of his 28 total points with the man-advantage , earning him a share of the team lead in power - play points .
" He 's got a great first pass , and he sees the ice really well , " said Abbotsford head coach Jim Playfair , a former assistant and head coach with the Flames who also led Calgary 's AHL affiliate in Saint John , N.B. , to the Calder Cup title in 2001 .
" He 's learning how to move along the blue line much better and create different shooting lanes and different options , " Playfair said .
" He does n't need a whole lot off room to get his shot off and get it through .
He 's got a very deceptive , hard , quick shot , and he does a good job of getting shots through from the point .
" Seabrook has taken full advantage of his heavy workload on the power play as the season progressed .
" I 've always been an offensive guy and a power play guy , but I did n't expect to be playing this much power - play time early on ( in my career ) , " he said .
" But I 've been lucky and been thrown out there , and have had a lot of trust put in me to go to the points on power plays , so it 's been nice .
" He seems to be pretty settled now , but Seabrook took a somewhat circuitous route to the professional ranks prior to this year , at least compared to many other young players .
After a couple years playing Junior " A " hockey in British Columbia , he took his game to the University of Denver in 2006 - 07 but posted only 13 points in 37 games for the Pioneers .
Seabrook decided to leave school at the end of that one year and play major junior instead , and he spent the next two seasons with Calgary of the WHL , erupting for 55 points in 64 games during the 2008 - 09 campaign .
" I really liked Denver , liked going to school , liked the team , and I had a lot of fun there , " Seabrook said .
" But coming off the year before and then going to a 35 - game season ( at Denver ) , it was a little different and a little tougher for me .
I think making the jump back to that pro-like schedule of hockey really helped me out .
" Having experienced both the college and junior games , Seabrook knew that to make a successful jump to the American Hockey League , building up his strength was of the utmost importance .
" Everyone 's a little bit bigger and stronger , " he said .
" I worked on my strength and my speed over the summer , and I think I got a good head start on this league .
I think I 've adapted pretty well so far .
" Adjusting to the pro style of play has been an ongoing process for Seabrook this year , and Playfair is impressed with the defenseman 's commitment to improving his skills in practice and then translating that into game situations .
" He 's calm under pressure for a young player , and he's in a situation where he has three or four other young players around him , " Playfair said .
" I think his confidence and his ability to play a lot of minutes have improved .
He 's developed a mindset where he has to prepare to improve each and every day .
And his practices have improved , games have improved , and his overall physical play has improved . " " When he 's not physical , he 's an average player .
When he 's real physical , he can be an effective player .
" Naturally , Seabrook does n't have to look too far if he needs any extra drive to continue improving and eventually make it up to the NHL .
Though they often have significantly different schedules , he and his brother usually talk once a week during the season and try to give tips to each other as they go along .
While Brent is established as a full - fledged NHL defenseman , Keith is still finding his way there .
" It 's definitely motivation for me and something that that I strive to get to , " Keith said .
" Over time , his quickness and length of his strides are issues that he needs to pay attention to , and also his overall conditioning , " Playfair said .
" Once he gets those two things up to speed , I think there 's no reason why he can't be a very effective National Hockey League player . "
San Jose Sharks arrived to Calgary on the last leg of their final road trip of the regular season .
A win meant that they would clinch the Pacific Division .
On top of that , a win by the Avalanche would mean that the Flames would miss the playoffs for the first time since 2003 .
That 's exactly what happened .
Sharks got on the board first , with a power play goal by Rob Blake .
If someone on the Sharks roster benefited from the Olympic break , it is Rob Blake .
He 's no longer shooting just from the blue line , as he 's done for most of the season .
Blake is now getting closer to the net , and his offensive vision is still there , if not his slap shot .
This is how he scored another goal , as Logan Couture was screening Kipper , and Rob Blake put the shot behind the two .
Since the Sharks started winning again , Blake has 9 points in 7 games , including 2 goals .
As we praise Blake , let 's not omit Couture 's role in this goal .
We do n't see Thornton , Pavelski , Marleau or Malhotra - other centers who see power play time - screen goalies as often as we see Couture there .
Rookie center loves that spot and it is one of his main assets .
Second goal of the game was scored by Jamie McGinn as a result of the relentless fore - check by the Sharks .
I thought that goal represented everything good that Sharks did in that game .
While the Flames were more physical and outhit the Sharks 22 - 11 , the Sharks skated with more energy and determination in the first two periods , and their fore - check lead to a logical goal .
The Flames were unable to clear the puck in their zone , it got to Vlasic who shot it from the blue line , and if the first try by Couture to redirect a rebound did not find the net , McGinn made sure the puck still went in .
He picked it up as it bounced off Kipper , skated it past him and put it in the open net .
The commitment by the forwards to play defense was also the reason why none of the players from the HTML line got on the scoreboard .
They were mostly invisible tonight in the offensive zone and Thornton 's 37 % on faceoffs tonight did not help either .
But they were busy in the defensive zone .
The Flames came out in the 3rd period knowing this was likely their last chance to save the season .
The Sharks knew it too and they dropped all the way back to sit on the lead .
The Flames did score a goal at the start of the period on a power play .
Malhotra intercepted the pass , but failed to clear it , and the defense stood still watching the puck go past two Sharks players and Nabokov into the empty net .
Despite all that , the defensive effort did pay out for the Sharks .
Nabokov had another strong night , as did all the defensive units .
Nothing stopped the Sharks from earning another two points and a fifth Pacific Division championship in the club 's history .
GRAND RAPIDS , Mich . –
The national health care reform debate took a new turn this week when a northern Michigan Democrat announced her intention to challenge Rep.
Bart Stupak , D - Mich , for his seat in the upcoming Democratic primary .
Stupak , an anti-choice Democrat , is known for blocking progress on health reform by demanding strong abortion language in the final bill creating new barriers to access the medical procedure , his critics charged .
Last week on ABC ’s “ Good Morning America ” Stupak announced his intention to kill health reform if anti-abortion language he approves does n’t appear in the bill .
Stupak described the language on abortion in the health reform package already passed by the Senate last December , which leaves current prohibitions on federal funding for abortion unchanged , as “ totally unacceptable . ”
As news of a potential challenge in the Democratic primary began to leak out , however , Stupak changed his tune .
Last Monday , March 8 , he told AP , “ “ The president says he does n’t want to expand or restrict current law .
Neither do I . ”
“ That ’s never been our position , ” he said , backing off his earlier remarks .
“ So is there some language that we can agree on that hits both points – we do n’t restrict , we do n’t expand abortion rights ?
I think we can get there . ”
Tuesday , March 9 , Connie Saltonstall , a Democrat from Charlevoix , Mich. , announced her intention to run against Stupak in the Democratic primary after supporters gathered the necessary signatures to get her on the ballot .
Saltonstall is a former teacher and now runs a research firm .
She is clearly not a Washington insider and has deep ties to Michigan ’s 1st Congressional district .
In a statement , Saltonstall said that her campaign stems from the fact that Stupak has let his constituents down .
“ Bart Stupak has threatened to block health care reform unless the amendment that bears his name is included in the final bill , ” the statement said .
“ I believe that he has a right to his personal , religious views , but to deprive his constituents of needed health care reform because of those views is reprehensible . ”
Congressional leaders have offered a new round of health reform proposals in order to re-start the legislative process .
Democratic leaders are now waiting to see if these new proposals can become part of a final package or if the House will have to vote on the Senate version passed last December .
Media reports indicate that House leaders are uncertain about when a vote will be taken .
Labor and health care activists are demanding speedy passage of a reconciled bill .

The B - 52 is considered the longest lived front - line military aircraft in aviation history .
In 1948 , Boeing began designing a long range nuclear capable bomber to meet the demands of the Strategic Air Command and the first B - 52 was delivered in August 1954 .
The plane utilized four double engine pods and four twin wheel landing trucks which could be slewed to crab the aircraft in a crosswind landing .
The B - 52H aircraft used by the Air Force today are older than the pilots who fly them .
The engines have no thrust reversers , so a very long reinforced runway is needed for takeoff and landing as the maximum aircraft weight can exceed 200 tons !
Internal fuel tanks could hold over 46,000 gallons of fuel , allowing the aircraft to reach targets half - way around the world .
With air - to - air refueling , B52’s were a truly global aircraft and have flown the 12,000 mile round the world route several times .
B - 52 bombers were considered the weapon the enemy feared most in the Vietnam War .
B - 52D ’s would fly in formation too high to be seen or heard , dropping over one hundred 500 lb bombs each .
B - 52 tail gunners shot down two enemy aircraft in Viet Nam .
All flight controls are manual , making it a very tough aircraft to fly .
The BUFF ’s ( Big Ugly Fat Fellows ) have survived wars , modernization , and replacement from more than five next generation bombers , but have remained in active Air Force inventory for almost forty years .
B - 52 ’s are used today as cruise missile carriers , but during the Gulf War reverted to their original design of carrying a large number of iron bombs , earning the respect and fear of those on the receiving end .
The museum ’s B - 52D , serial number 55 - 679 , was manufactured by Boeing Aircraft , Wichita , KS , and delivered to the Air Force on June 5 , 1957 .
During the Vietnam Conflict , it served 41 months ( November 1966 to October 1973 ) in combat with 175 missions .
In 1975 , it was involved in a ground mishap at March AFB that resulted in a broken wing spar .
Our B - 52D last saw service here at the March Air Force Base with the 22nd Bombardment Wing as a weapons loading trainer .
The museum aircraft was declared surplus at March AFB when it developed weakness in the rear fuselage and was assigned to the museum .
This aircraft is on loan from the USAF .
According to the Air Force Historical Research Agency ( AFHRA / RSA ) , Maxwell AFB , AL , the museum ’s B - 52D has the following history :

For the first time , former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) appeared side by side to the raucous approval of 10,000 supporters at an April 7 Minneapolis rally .
While each took turns blasting Obama and congressional Democrats , Palin paused to praise Bachmann 's repudiation of health - care reform and called her " inspiring . "
Fox News host Sean Hannity once put it another way , describing Bachmann as “ the second - most - hated Republican woman in the country , second to Gov. Palin , which is a good position . ”
Could an alliance between the Republican stars form the " new face of the GOP " ?
( Watch Palin and Bachmann respond to speculaton that they 'll make a presidential run )
Independents would reject a Palin - Bachmann ticket : " As world - changing summit meetings go , " says Mike Madden in Salon , this did n't reach " the level of ' King Kong vs. Godzilla . ' "
Still , seeing the two women together , " you could almost start to worry " about their combined political power .
Then they launched into their derisive rhetoric , and " reality intruded again " :
These two could never attract independents .
" Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann join forces "
The pair is already invigorating the GOP : Palin " is assuming a new role as ... a charismatic leader who summons the masses to battle , " says Matthew Continetti in the Weekly Standard .
And Bachmann 's almost assured of re-election .
" If you think Palin and Bachmann drive liberals crazy now , " just wait until " Congress convenes in January 2011 , when there will be dozens of Palins and Bachmanns ... heads will explode . "
" Palin , Bachmann , and GOP enthusiasm "
Mitt Romney must be envious : I think " a clear strain of Republican feminism ... is growing in this country , " says Michael Scherer in Time , a reaction " to the historic 2008 campaign of Hillary Clinton . "
For the first time , the GOP is " captive to the charisma of women leaders . "
The " old men of the party , " including Tim Pawlenty and Mitt Romney , " would probably trade a kidney for this sort of enthusiasm . "
" Michele Bachmann and Sarah Palin stumpt together , the political universe quivers "

The memo , which was sent in 2002 , describes plant construction in terms of the Three Little Pigs fable .
BP concluded that a brick home presented a better cost -value ratio than a blast resistant home .
A BP spokesperson said to The Daily Beast that the company has
" fundamentally changed the culture of BP " since a rig explosion in 2005 .

Jerusalem ( CNN ) -- A 23 - year - old American activist stands in front of an Israeli bulldozer in Gaza .
The bulldozer drives over her , crushing her to death .
These are the facts .
Rachel Corrie , along with colleagues from the International Solidarity Movement , was trying to prevent Israel from bulldozing homes in Rafah , close to the Egyptian border .
Her activism cost her her life in March 2003 .
A colleague said at the time , " Many times the bulldozer came up to us and buried us with dirt , but they always stopped . "
Corrie 's parents want to know the truth about their daughter 's death , whether the killing was intentional and who is accountable .
Power of grief : Corrie 's fight for justice
Craig and Cindy Corrie 's civil suit against Israel 's defense ministry starts in Haifa , Israel , on Wednesday -- a court date that took years to reach .
" The more we found out , the more likely that the killing was intentional , or at least incredibly reckless , " Craig Corrie said .
" And , as a former soldier , I was even in charge of bulldozers in Vietnam ...
You 're responsible to know what 's in front of that blade , and I believe that they did . "
The Israeli military carried out a month - long investigation , which found no Israeli soldier was to blame .
" The armored bulldozer crew involved in the incident did not see Ms. Corrie , who was standing behind the mound of earth , and was unable to see her or hear her voice , " the military said .
Corrie 's parents are proud of what their daughter did , recalling how important it was to her to help Palestinian families in Gaza .
In an interview shortly before her death , Rachel Corrie , who grew up in Olympia , Washington , said , " There are just countless ways in which these children are suffering .
I want to support them . "
Her mother , Cindy Corrie , told CNN , " She deserves the attention that she 's receiving in this case .
Every human being who is assaulted and whose life is taken in this way deserves some accountability , some explanation for why this happened , particularly when it 's done by a military and particularly when it's a military supported by me and my tax dollars . "
The Corries say they cannot take the bulldozer driver to court , because the Israeli military has refused to identify him for the past seven years .
But Craig Corrie does n't necessarily want to see the driver sent to jail .
" We do n't think about the soldiers being the victims , but they are , and we ask a lot of these people .
So I 'm not full of hatred for this person , but it was a horrendous act to kill my daughter , and I hope he understands that . "

Few people may have been wanting more evidence of the ferocity of recent weather .
Nevertheless they got one from an unexpected source last week : the Big Garden Birdwatch .
Organised by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) , it involved members of the public reporting bird sightings in their gardens over the last weekend in January .
More than half a million responses were received and a count showed precisely how this year 's winter – the coldest in 30 years – has taken a toll of the nation 's small songbirds , such as the goldcrest and the coal tit .
" The problem is particularly severe for birds with small bodies , " said Graham Madge of the RSPB .
" The smaller it is , proportionally the more heat it loses when the weather gets cold and the more food it needs to retain heat .
However , food – for example , insects – is difficult to find if the ground is frozen . "
Goldcrests were particularly badly affected , the bird count found , with numbers plunging by 75 % on last year .
Long - tailed tits were down by 27 % while the coal tit was down 20 % .
It was also found that kingfishers – though technically not a songbird – have been badly affected by the freezing weather .
Numbers are noticeably down , according to most anecdotal evidence , said Madge : " Kingfishers have not just got small bodies , they have to immerse themselves in water to catch fish .
They get soaked in near - freezing water . "
The nature of the problem was also highlighted by Sarah Kelly , the survey 's co-ordinator .
" Smaller birds have to eat for more of their waking time as the temperature drops , and during hard frosts and snow cover often have to feed from dawn until dusk , " she said .
" Many smaller birds will be in trouble if they fail to find food even for a day . "
The survey also revealed that many populations , such as the redwing and the fieldfare , shifted west across Britain to avoid the worst of the cold , which has affected the east over recent months .
However , most of the birds badly affected by the cold are fairly plentiful in Britain and populations are likely to recover , though it may take several years for numbers of kingfishers and goldcrests to recover .
More worrying , says the RSPB , is the impact that the freezing weather will have on rarer birds , which are unlikely to appear in gardens and whose numbers are therefore far harder to assess .
Of particular concern are the bittern and the Dartford warbler .
" The population of the Dartford warbler was down to around 10 males in the 1960s but has made a comeback recently , " added Madge .
" However , it is now looking as if it has taken a bad hit this winter and it is quite possible some local populations will have been snuffed out . "
The bittern , whose population reached a record 82 males last year , is also likely to have been badly affected .
" It is going to be an anxious time until we can get out on reserves and start counting numbers , " added Madge .
The RSPB added that the impact had been particularly severe because the freeze had gripped the whole of the country .
In the past , drops in small bird populations caused by cold weather have typically been regional , such as the death of all the Cetti's warblers in Kent after two successive cold winters in the mid-1980s .
This year the impact has spread far wider , though the RSPB will not be able to properly assess the situation until breeding seasons for particular species have ended .
CRAWFORD , Tex . —
The first thing you see when you arrive in this minuscule town is a defunct curio store where people once bought souvenirs of their visit to President George W. Bush ’s adopted hometown .
Only one of the five shops that used to sell memorabilia to Bush admirers remains open —
The Red Bull , down the street .
Popular items include magnets and coasters that say “ The Western White House . ”
Phony dollar bills with Mr. Bush ’s face on them also sell well .
But the biggest demand has been for bumper stickers with Mr. Bush ’s likeness and the caption “ Do You Miss Me Yet ? ”
“ They are sold out , ” said Jamie Burgess , the owner ’s daughter .
“ We have n’t died , ” Ms. Burgess said of post - Bush Crawford .
“ There is still a reason for people to come in and see Crawford . ”
Yet long gone are the days when this town of 750 people played host to foreign heads of state or teemed with journalists , protesters and White House officials .
I 'm a big big baby and I always follow my mummy everywhere ... unless she puts me on my leash then I do n't move .
People keep telling me I 'm going to be a big big dog but I do n't think so .

Raubkopierern soll es dank ACTA schwerer gemacht werden .
Symbolbild : Colourbox
Die EU - Kommission hat den Entwurf für das Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) veröffentlicht .
Ende März war eine Version vom Januar aufgetaucht , doch nun liegt zum ersten Mal offiziell ein Entwurf für das Abkommen , mit dem die Länder Raubkopierer effektiver bekämpfen wollen , vor .
Die Europäische Union , die USA Japan und sechs weitere Staaten - darunter die Schweiz - hatten seit 2007 unter Ausschluss der Öffentlichkeit verhandelt , was ihnen unter anderem Rechtsprofessor Michael Geist von der Universität Ottawa vorgeworfen hatte .
Er kritisierte die Geheimhaltung als gefährlichen Präzedenzfall für die Intransparenz internationaler Verhandlungen .
Beim Treffen vergangene Woche in Neuseeland hatte man sich nun geeinigt , das Dokument für jeden zugänglich ins Netz zu stellen , um diesen Vorwurf aus der Welt zu schaffen .
Zumindest darüber gab sich Denis Simonet , Chef der Piratenpartei Schweiz , im Gespräch mit 20 Minuten Online erfreut : « Nun können wir endlich über das offizielle Dokument diskutieren , das sich aber wie ein Wunschzettel der Unterhaltungsindustrie liest . »
Simonet hat viele Punkte ausgemacht , die ihn an dem Papier stören :
Es dürften auf reinen Verdacht Geräte oder Produkte beschlagnahmt werden .
Das wäre schlimm , denn die Beweislast würde umgedreht .
Die Unschuld müsse festgestellt werden , damit man beispielsweise seinen MP3 - Player , der einem am Flughafen abgenommen wurde , zurückbekäme .
Provider für Kunden verantwortlich
Eine weitere Idee aus dem Entwurf alarmiert Simonet : « Der Rechteinhaber soll den Schaden durch die Urheberrechtsverletzungen abschätzen dürfen .
Aber nicht jeder heruntergeladene Blockbuster wäre auch gekauft worden .
So könnten beispielsweise Filmfirmen mit horrenden Schadensersatzforderungen durchkommen .
Ausserdem soll man dafür bestraft werden können , dass andere den Film weiter verbreitet haben . »
So wie Simonet den ACTA - Entwurf interpretiert , könnten die Internetprovider dafür verantwortlich gemacht werden , was ihre Kunden tun .
« Die Unternehmen sollen also aktiv Prävention betreiben , so dass die Nutzer keine Urheberrechtsverletzungen begehen .
Bekommt der Provider mit , dass jemand beispielsweise geschützte Songs hochlädt , muss er einschreiten .
Tut er dies nicht , haftet er . Three Strikes Out , also die Sperrung des Internetzugangs nach drei Vergehen , wird explizit nicht ausgeschlossen » , malt er sich aus und orakelt weiter : « Rechteinhaber sollen nur gute Gründe statt eines Beweises vorlegen müssen und schon sollen Provider Nutzerdaten herausgeben müssen .
Wo bleibt dann die Unschuldsvermutung ? »
In der Schweiz ist der reine Download geschützter Inhalte bislang nicht illegal .
Doch Simonet sieht im ACTA - Entwurf auch in diesem Punkt eine Gefahr für die Pirateninsel : « Zum reinen Download urheberrechtlich geschützter Inhalte habe ich herausgefunden , dass dessen Illegalität wohl in Artikel 2.14 verlangt wird .
Denn da steht , dass man nichts tun darf , was der Urheber nicht will .
Das beinhaltet natürlich auch den Download - sollte ich das richtig interpretieren . »
Bei den meisten Punkten stehe glücklicherweise in der Fussnote , dass ein Land dagegen ist .
Daher bleibe zu hoffen , dass die Gegner sich als standhaft erweisen .
« Das gilt auch für Vorstösse hierzulande wie den von Géraldine Savary , Ständerätin der SP , die kürzlich ein ' Gesetz gegen das illegale Herunterladen ' forderte – ein schönes Paradoxon » , schrieb Simonet in seinem Blog .
Wie die Rechteinhaber Geld verdienen können , sei ihre Sache , so Simonet .
« Wir sind überzeugt davon , dass die Privatkopie legal sein muss , um Kultur und Wissen frei verbreiten zu können .
Werke dürfen zur kommerziellen Nutzung über eine kurze Zeit geschützt sein , aber nicht so lange wie heute .
Beispielsweise reichen für ein Pop - Album fünf bis zehn Jahre . »
Die Piratenpartei fordere eine gesetzlich verankerte Netzneutralität - Provider dürften keine Inhalte filtern und müssten wie die Post jedes Packet gleich behandeln , sagte Simonet .
« Es muss ein allgemeines Kommunikationsgeheimnis geben , das das Postgeheimnis allgemein auf adressierte Informationen erweitert .
Die Informationsfreiheit ist ein Grundrecht eines jeden , welches durch die Sperrung des Internetzugangs beschnitten würde » , sagte der Chef der Schweizer Piratenpartei .
« Im Juni werden die Verhandlungen in der Schweiz fortgesetzt .
Es wird einen internationalen Protest - Tag geben » , kündigte Simonet an .
Schweizer Delegation für digitale Freiheit
Ob es diesen braucht - dies erscheint fraglich , wenn man mit Felix Addor spricht , dem stellvertretenden Direktor des Eidgenössischen Instituts für Geistiges Eigentum ( IGE ) , welches einen Vertreter zu den ACTA - Verhandlungen entsendet : « Das Mandat des Bundesrats für die Schweizer Verhandlungsdelegation ist klar :
Es soll durch den Abschluss für die Schweiz zu keinen Verpflichtungen zur Einführung neuer Schutzstandards kommen . »
Würde ACTA eine Gesetzesänderung von der Schweiz erfordern , könne die Schweiz das Abkommen kaum ratifizieren .
Laut Addor besteht « kaum ein plausibler Grund für die Durchführung eines erneuten Gesetzesänderungsverfahrens nach nur drei Jahren » .
Erst im Juli 2008 hatte es Änderungen des Urheberrechtsgesetzes in der Schweiz gegeben : Am 22 .
Juni 2007 beschloss das Parlament die gesetzlichen Grundlagen zur effektiven Bekämpfung von Fälschung und Piraterie in allen Immaterialgüterrechtsgesetzen zu ändern und am 5 .
Oktober 2007 das Urheberrechtsgesetz an die besonderen Situationen des digitalen Zeitalters anzupassen .
All diese Gesetzesänderungen traten per 1 . Juli 2008 in Kraft .
Addor stellt klar : « Die Schweizer Delegation ist gegen ein Verbot des Downloads zum Privatgebrauch , gegen iPod-Durchsuchung und gegen Three Strikes Out . »
Falls die anderen Länder entsprechende Passagen im ACTA lassen , könne man es eben nicht annehmen - oder nur mit Ergänzungen , die besagen , dass die Schweiz von einigen Bestimmungen nicht betroffen sei .
Viele Verhandlungsparteien , so auch die USA , geben sich optimistisch , dass die Verhandlungen bis Ende 2010 abgeschlossen sein werden .
« Ich bin da eher skeptisch : zu viele Unklarheiten bestehen noch , zu viele Themen müssen noch vertieft , ergründet und ausdiskutiert werden » , sagte Addor .
Filmindustrie verliert 90 Millionen Franken jährlich
Im Klartext : Vorerst wird sich hierzulande nichts ändern , dabei drängt aus Sicht der Unterhaltungsindustrie die Zeit : Die Schweizerische Vereinigung zur Bekämpfung der Piraterie ( SAFE ) schätzt , dass allein die Filmindustrie hierzulande wegen Piraterie jährlich Umsatzeinbussen von rund 90 Millionen Franken hinnehmen muss .
Die Musikbranche verliert gemäss International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) etwa 25 Millionen Franken pro Jahr .
Seit 2003 sind laut Schätzungen des Branchenverbandes hierzulande über 600 Arbeitsplätze in der Musikbranche weggefallen .
Auch die Entwickler von Applikationen für Smartphones haben mit Piraterie zu kämpfen .
Allein im vergangenen Jahr setzten alle Anbieter zusammen 2,5 Milliarden Apps ab und nahmen damit rund 4,2 Milliarden US - Dollar ein .
Davon sollen 99,4 Prozent direkt in die Kasse von Apple geflossen sein .
Die Analysten von Gartner prognostizierten kürzlich für 2013 weltweite App - Einnahmen von 29,5 Milliarden Dollar und 21,6 Milliarden Downloads .
Laut der Studie sollen 2013 rund 25 Prozent der Einnahmen durch Gratis - Apps , die mit Werbung gespickt sind , verdient werden .
Es ist also ein grosser Markt , auf dem Entwickler populärer Apps viel verdienen können .
Denn jeder erhält beispielsweise bei Apple und Google 70 Prozent der Einnahmen , die mit seiner App erzielt werden - oder gar nichts , wenn Nutzer sie so leicht stehlen können wie mit einem Android - Handy .
Wer sich allerdings beispielsweise im Download - Bereich von droidfanz.com umsieht , gewinnt den Eindruck , dass die Macher nicht allzu offensiv gegen Nutzer vorgehen , die geschützte Inhalte verbreiten .
So lassen sich problemlos mehrere Hundert Applikationen auf Android - Smartphones herunterladen .
Die ist auch unerfahrenen Nutzern ohne Weiteres möglich .
Einziger Nachteil für den User : Weil die Apps vom Android Market nicht erkannt werden , erhält man keine Updates , die beispielsweise Fehler beheben .
Schreiben Sie uns bitte Ihre Meinung im Talkback : Was halten Sie davon , dass in der Schweiz der reine Download bislang legal geblieben ist .
Hat die Unterhaltungsindustrie ihre Krise selbst verschuldet ?
Haben Spiele , Filme und Songs einen angemessenen Preis ?

Two months before 9/11 , Comedy Central aired an episode of “ South Park ” entitled “ Super Best Friends , ” in which the cartoon show ’s foul - mouthed urchins sought assistance from an unusual team of superheroes .
These particular superfriends were all religious figures : Jesus , Krishna , Buddha , Mormonism ’s Joseph Smith , Taoism ’s Lao-tse  and the Prophet Muhammad , depicted with a turban and a 5 o’clock shadow , and introduced as “ the Muslim prophet with the powers of flame . ”
That was a more permissive time .
You ca n’t portray Muhammad on American television anymore , as South Park ’s creators , Trey Parker and Matt Stone , discovered in 2006 , when they tried to parody the Danish cartoon controversy  in which unflattering caricatures of the prophet prompted worldwide riots  by scripting another animated appearance for Muhammad .
The episode aired , but the cameo itself was blacked out , replaced by an announcement that Comedy Central had refused to show an image of the prophet .
For Parker and Stone , the obvious next step was to make fun of the fact that you ca n’t broadcast an image of Muhammad .
Two weeks ago , “ South Park ” brought back the “ super best friends , ” but this time Muhammad never showed his face .
He “ appeared ” from inside a U - Haul trailer , and then from inside a mascot ’s costume .
These gimmicks then prompted a writer for the New York - based Web site revolutionmuslim.com to predict that Parker and Stone would end up like Theo van Gogh , the Dutch filmmaker murdered in 2004 for his scathing critiques of Islam .
The writer , an American convert to Islam named Abu Talhah Al - Amrikee , did n’t technically threaten to kill them himself .
His post , and the accompanying photo of van Gogh ’s corpse , was just “ a warning ... of what will likely happen to them . ”
Huge RNAi Breakthroughs !
– Once again , huge scientific news has disrupted my plans .
Last week , I put off giving you additional news on the quest for an Alzheimer ’s disease cure as well as some fascinating and related data on the health benefits of coffee .
The reason , as you know , was that two companies in our portfolio announced truly historic breakthroughs in stem cell science .
Remarkably , the same basic thing has happened again .
This last week , three major scientific developments were announced regarding progress in the field of RNA interference .
Once again , some of the companies involved are in our portfolio .
( I will refer to them as “ Company X ” and “ Company Z. ” )
As I ’ve said many times , we know that RNA interference is one of the most important areas of scientific inquiry .
The reason is that the RNAi mechanism offers us a means of controlling individual genes .
This , in turn , offers the theoretical means of curing nearly every disease suffered by humans , animals or plants .
Though scientists were aware of some of the actions involved in RNAi , it was one article published in the critically important journal Nature that put all the pieces together .
That was in 1998 , and the article was titled , “ Potent and Specific Genetic Interference by Double - stranded RNA in Caenorhabditis Elegans . ”
In 2006 , two of the authors , Craig Mello and Andrew Fire , were awarded the Nobel Prize for that critical work .
This article rocked the scientific world .
Allow me to characterize the big picture that emerged from that article .
Basically , the master genetic program in our cells , DNA , never willingly exposes itself to any outside influence .
Rather , it operates behind biological fire walls that protect it from viruses and other invaders .
It communicates , however , via messenger molecules .
These are called messenger RNA or mRNA .
The mRNA molecules , in turns , “ encode ” or synthesize proteins that actually spread the DNA ’s commands .
RNA interference , as the name implies , is a natural means of disrupting that process .
Our cells use a complex , but fascinating mechanism called RNA - induced silencing complex ( RISC ) for all kinds of natural functions .
It can be thought of as part of the immune system , as it protects from viral invaders , but it is also part of our gene regulation system .
It can also , however , be manipulated to accomplish other ends .
I find it useful to think of this process , simplistically of course , as a kind of computer virus - protection program .
Computer programs such as Symantec ’s Norton AntiVirus and Trend Micro ’s PC - cillin have large databases of “ evil code . ”
They scan your computer , incoming data and external drives looking for code sequences that are in the database of evil code .
If it finds evil code , the security program attempts to block it from interacting with your computer .
Anti-virus software periodically updates by downloading new additions to its database of evil code .
In a sense , RNAi offers scientists a way to hack those evil code updates and inject their own code sequences .
It could be exploited to send RNA sequences that would provoke the body to block the operation of particular encoded proteins .
For example , there is a protein code that enables the capillary growth that causes blindness through wet macular degeneration or tumor growth .
Scientists know what code sequence to add to the evil code database that will stop excess capillary growth .
Eventually , I believe , we will know what code blocks Parkinson ’s disease , glaucoma , kidney disease , autism and on and on and on .
By introducing the right small RNA molecules , we can provoke the body to disrupt the chain of communication that results in those conditions .
It is even possible to increase the production of proteins that increase health or reverse damage .
Hopefully , cell biologists in the audience will forgive my crude metaphors .
Regardless , when that Nature article was published , scientists began the quest to figure out just how to use RNAi to cure diseases .
Universally , they encountered one enormous obstacle .
These small RNA sequences are exceptionally fragile .
Under normal conditions , they are quickly destroyed by the immune system .
This is not dissimilar , by the way , to security and virus protection software .
The ultimate goal of the “ black hat ” hacker is to penetrate and exploit the anti-virus security programs themselves .
If a hacker could hijack the process by which these get information about new threats , the database updates , he would “ own ” the computer and could do anything he wanted .
Consequently , your anti-virus program has a level of safeguards built into it that far exceeds those of normal programs .
Because the RNAi mechanism performs similar functions , such as scanning and blocking unwanted actions , that biological system offers similar controls over the system .
It is , therefore , not only scientists who want to exploit the system .
It is logical target of sophisticated microorganisms that evolve constantly in an effort to hijack your immune system .
As a result , we have particularly strong defenses against interfering with the RNAi process .
It is extremely difficult to get small therapeutic RNA sequences past the immune system into the right cells to cure diseases .
Some scientists believed that it might be possible to deliver RNA interfering sequences locally , by injection into a tumor , for example .
The problems associated with developing a systemic delivery system that could be taken orally or injected but that would then act only on target cells seemed almost insurmountable .
In fact , many scientists believed it was impossible in higher life - forms , particularly humans .
Last week , we learned definitively that it is not impossible .
In a major scientific journal , “ Company X’s ” scientists presented peer - reviewed proof that they have done it .
Simply put , the anti-cancer drug that Company X tested is valuable .
More valuable , however , is Company X’s proprietary platform that produced the successful RNAi delivery solution .
With this successful test of a systemic RNAi cancer drug in humans , Company X ’s ability to deliver other interfering sequences to target molecules will be attracting serious attention from Big Pharma .
Every big pharmaceutical company has an ongoing RNAi delivery research program .
Merck has admitted that it has tested hundreds of methods unsuccessfully .
Company X , however , was the first to prove it could make a systemic RNAi drug for humans .
I would be astonished if Company X does not sign some sort of agreement with Big Pharma within the year .
While Company X has clearly scored a major coup , it is by no means alone in the quest for RNAi delivery methods .
In fact , “ Company Z ” announced a successful delivery mechanism last week as well .
Company Z tests involved local surgical delivery into the skin of rats , but the results indicate that it has found a way to beat the delivery problem .
I spoke with the CEO of Company Z . He is clearly confident that further tests will show the systemic effect of this technology in humans .
I think that the events of the week emphasize several crucial aspects of the field of RNA interference .
One , obviously , is that progress is being made very rapidly .
After I interviewed Craig Mello a year and a half ago , I told you this .
Still , it ’s difficult even for insiders to keep up .
This is the result partly of the fact that progress in so many related fields , such as human genomics , continues to accelerate .
Another characteristic of this field is that it appears there will be multiple winners .
The delivery mechanisms used by Company X and Company Z are quite different , but both have demonstrated efficacy .
It remains to be seen which will be more effective for which diseases .
Personally , I believe there will be multiple winners .
In fact , as I was writing this column , two more important news stories broke concerning our other RNAi companies .
Therefore , to say that developments are breaking quickly in RNA interference is an understatement .
It is extremely meaningful that all this action on the RNAi front seems to be coming from aggressive small caps , not bureaucratic Big Pharma .
Nobody knows , at this point , how everything will shake out in the next few years .
The rational investment strategy , therefore , is to own a portfolio of the most promising of these entrepreneurial companies .
It ’s possible that all these RNAi innovators in our portfolio will do well simply because the promise of RNA interference is so incredible .
As one unnamed biotech CEO recently told me , “ We ’re not going to run out of sick people to treat .
There is , unfortunately , no disease shortage . ”
We now know with certainty , because of the week ’s events , that RNAi can be delivered effectively .
There are still details to be worked out , but this is truly great news .

The Old Trafford boss has maintained his close bond with the winger who developed into the best player in the world under Ferguson ’s tutelage .
Sir Alex – who admitted being disappointed for Ronaldo ( right ) after Real Madrid went crashing out of the Champions League in midweek – said : “ Cristiano knows the value of Manchester United .
That ’s the thing .
What the players have got here is protection .
They come to training every day and there is nobody here to disturb them .
“ I do n’t think Real Madrid is an easy club to play for .
There is a circus attached to it .
There are often loads of fans and an intensive media always filming them . ”
Ronaldo has confided to friends that he misses life at Old Trafford and in particular Ferguson ’s guiding hand .
Ferguson revealed : “ You would like to think that one day he will come back , but you never know .
I do n’t think he will stay at Real Madrid for life or anything like that .
NYC Resistor was invited to exhibit our old Teletype Model 15 at Eyebeam ’s MIXER event last March .
To make life interesting , we used a small Python program to grab tweets from Twitter matching the “ eyebeam ” keyword .
Watching a 50 + year old device once used to bang out the news of the day turn to printing the trivialities of the moment seems to echo the fate of professional journalists as the world ’s attention span dwindles .
To make things more interesting , we used a sentiment analysis algorithm to parse incoming tweets for positive or negative sentiment .
The results were reflected on an old chart plotter .
Positive sentiments moved the mark left .
The middle of the paper represented neutral sentiment .
Click the image for more photos and a video awaits after the break .
Check out the video below for a brief explanation of how it works .
Two Arduino boards were used to drive the chart plotter and the Teletype .
Python with the Tweepy module and natural language toolkit was used for the interface to Twitter .
Special thanks to John Nagle for his guidance in getting the Teletype working , and to Trammel , Chris and Zach for the on - the - spot debugging .

Liverpool 's American owners are stepping up efforts to sell the club by asking Barclays to find a buyer and appoint a new chairman , a source close to the club has revealed .
Tom Hicks and George Gillett
Jr are set to appoint the British Airways chairman , Martin Broughton , next week as an interim non-executive chairman .
Broughton will oversee the sale process , the source told the Associated Press on condition of anonymity , because talks are ongoing .
For over two years , Hicks and Gillett have been trying to attract investors to reduce debt resulting from their 2007 takeover of the club , which stands at £ 237m .
In September 2009 Bank of America , Merrill Lynch and Rothschild were appointed to find investors , but Hicks and Gillett have not received an acceptable offer .
A £ 100 m offer for 40 % of the club by a New York - based private equity firm , Rhone Group , was turned down earlier this month , with Hicks apparently unhappy with the deal .
Hicks has been more keen than Gillett on retaining some control at Anfield , but now both are prepared to sanction an outright sale and they hope a buyer will be found by Barclays Capital , the investment arm of the bank that sponsors the Premier League .
Hicks blocked Gillett 's moves to sell his 50 % share to Dubai International Capital group in 2008 as the pair disagreed over plans for the club .
An outright £ 500 m takeover bid by the DIC group was also rebuffed .
The state of the club 's finances has limited the ability of the manager , Rafael Benítez , to operate in the transfer market , with the team slipping out of the top four of the Premier League and failing to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League .
News of a possible sale came as Benítez said he would need significant funds to revamp the squad in the summer .
" The cost of a top - class player is about £ 20 m .
I think we need three , " Benítez said .
" We want to keep the spine of the team , but sometimes you have to manage and you have to sell two or three players who are n't playing many games .
" I think we can improve but it depends if we can do the right signings and it is always easier to sign more players with more money .
It 's not easy for us to compete for players . "
The lack of funds at Liverpool has led to the postponement of plans to build a new stadium .
Hicks and Gillett bought Liverpool in 2007 for £ 174 m , taking on £ 44.8 m of liabilities .
Amid the global economic crisis , the pair have been shoring up their financial positions .
Gillett sold the Montreal Canadiens ice hockey team , the Gillett Entertainment Group and the Bell Centre back to the Molson family for $ 580 m ( £ 377 m ) last year .
Hicks is trying to sell the Major League Baseball team Texas Rangers .

Saturn 's moons have become a source of increasing fascination thanks to a stream of data from the Cassini - Huygens spacecraft .
Much of the excitement has focused on the atmospheric chemistry of the Saturnian moons Titan and Enceladus .
Early in its mission , Cassini - Huygens discovered a plume that fountains water vapour and ice particles above Enceladus .
Since then , scientists have found that these water products dominate Saturn 's magnetic environment and create Saturn 's huge E-ring .
At Titan , Cassini - Huygens detected extremely large negative hydrocarbon ions with masses up to 13,800 times that of hydrogen .
Researchers at UCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory led the team which designed and built the Electron Spectrometer , part of Cassini's CAPS instrument , which continues to make invaluable discoveries .
In this video PhD student Sheila Kanani takes us on a journey aboard Cassini - Huygens to Saturn and its moons , and explains why space scientists regard them as the most intriguing destinations in the Solar System .

Constance McMillen , Mississippi teen , recently caused an uproar by wanting to bring her girlfriend , a lesbian , to the prom .
Well , after much legal ballyhoo , the school district caved and invited her to prom .
Turns out , though , it mighta been fake .
Well , if it was n't fake , it was the worst attended prom since the year after Carrie White totally PMSed all over everyone .
Basically the school district canceled the prom when everyone got upset about a gay person being gay at it , but then a little bit later — after much international scrutiny and ACLU lawsuit stuff — the school district 's attorney announced that a parent - sponsored prom was being held and invited McMillen .
Constance , her girlfriend , and seven other kids were the only ones to show up to the event .
The real trouble is that there 's rumored to have been another prom held that night at a different location , one that , word has it , the parents were fully aware of , and the school district helped plan .
So , basically a bunch of grownups may have staged an elaborate ruse so the gay girl and her gay lesbian girlfriend and all their totally homo friends could stand around one place looking like chumps , while the real teens did real things like give birth in the bathroom and rape each other in limos at their own very special real prom .
Terrifically done , everyone !
Of course this could all be untrue scuttlebutt , but we find it hard to believe that all those kids really would n't go to their big dance just because one girl and her date were there , unless they had another place to party that same night .
Though , as some are pointing out , it 's kind of a tall order to ask all those kids to keep a secret prom secret , is n't it ?
No matter the case , this is the most embarrassing story ever .
People are horrible .
UPDATE : A tipster tracked down one of McMillen 's classmate 's Facebook profiles , and she had lots of nice prom photos uploaded yesterday .
So that would fit with the timeline .
And there are more than five folks in the photos , so we 're guessing that means they were n't the group that went to Constance 's prom ( the person 's " I LOVE Jesus ! " bit on her profile does n't help the case ) .
So who knows .
We 're not going to give you her name , because , well , she 's a high school student .

The Conservative Party Manifesto , published today , is a slap in the face for all those who have been claiming that there is very little difference between the two major parties when it comes to policy .
There are clearly major differences in what a Conservative government would do : for instance , they would scrap ID cards , the National Identity Register and the Contactpoint database – although we knew that already .
First off , the economy .
There is far less detail than in the Labour manifesto : a return , perhaps , to government by first principles , rather than micro-management .
However , the big principles that shine through suggest that the Tories are not afraid to follow the example of the Canadian government some 15 years back : to cut government spending drastically , return power and responsibility to businesses – and to grow our way out of recession through the power of entrepreneurial success .
Thus , their manifesto talks of the need for decentralisation and stopping " government trying to direct everything from the centre " .
There will be an emergency budget , followed by cuts to government waste now – as opposed to next year .
The aim is to eliminate the bulk of the structural current budget deficit over the life of this Parliament .
The motor for prosperity will be small business .
To that end , there will be concessions to start - ups hiring new employees in their first year , small business rate relief will be automatic , and they will aim to deliver 25 per cent of government research and procurement contracts through SMEs .
Lower spending is the name of the game , rather than higher taxes : so initially , the headline rate of corporation tax will be reduced to 25 p and the small companies ’ rate to 20 p , with far fewer complex reliefs and allowances .
Research and development tax credits will be improved and refocused on hi-tech companies , small businesses and new start - ups .
Good and bad news for the ICT sector , with a freeze on major new Information and Communications Technologies ( ICT ) spending , and immediate negotiations to achieve cost reductions from major suppliers .
However , they plan to open up the £ 200bn government procurement budget far further by publishing online all government tender documents for contracts worth over £ 10,000 , and breaking up large ICT projects into smaller components .
The hi-tech focus is further emphasised by a nod in the direction of Sir James Dyson ’s review into making Britain Europe ’s leading hi-tech exporter – with a far higher emphasis on Science , Technology , Engineering and Maths subjects in schools and a new prize for engineering .
There is praise for Silicon Valley and Japan .
An immediate start to the high - speed rail network is pencilled in : like Labour , Tories want a superfast broadband network throughout the UK – and they will scrap the 50 p phone tax .
Green credentials include an end to the third runway at Heathrow , better carbon emissions management , and a Green Investment Bank .
Back to ICT : the message is , on the one hand , an end to government intrusion into our private lives : first , as has been announced previously , there will be far fewer centralised databases .
At last count , the Tories are set to scrap around 11 major database projects – and they will scale back the vetting database project to “ common sense ” dimensions .
An interview with Fox Business recently twisted Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen ’s words concerning the release time frame of Flash 10.1 for mobile devices , or so Adobe says .
The original report indicated we would n’t be seeing full - blown Flash for Android until the second half of the year .
Adobe says that ’s just not true and Narayen ’s words were taken out of context , confirming that Flash 10.1 should be available before the end of the this year ’s second quarter .
The confusion arose over an issue of semantics , with Narayen meaning the first new devices with built in Flash support would n’t hit the market until the second half of the year , while Flash would be available for already capable handsets well before and without delay .
If the announcement of a beta is any indication , than this would seem to be the case .
Is Flash support too little , too late in combating growing support for HTML5 ?
That remains to be decided , but this at least clears up the question of release date .
Now I will hand it over to the comments where another Flash vs. HTML5 battle is sure to ensue .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Britain may soon be using global positioning satellites and advanced speed cameras with number plate recognition technology to track speeding motorists , and according to a report released by the House of Commons , the system can be installed and operated at relatively low cost .
The system , dubbed SpeedSpike , is undergoing effectiveness and accuracy trials at two locations in London and Cornwall , with the AA ( Automobile Assocation ) monitoring the tests .
The AA said they were watching the trials carefully , but do not regard the development as sinister , but a “ natural evolution ” of technologies already in use .
They said they believed the system is probably intended for residential areas , and it would cover a network of roads rather than just a straight line .
A network of the devices could monitor thousands of vehicles over big areas , with cameras communicating with each other and using GPS information to calculate the average speed of vehicles between any two network locations .
The cameras would use the same technology as is currently used in London to enforce their congestion charge , and would be similar to a system of average speed recorders used to monitor speeds around roadworks on major roads .
The system was developed by PIPS Technology Ltd. , a Texas - based company with an office in Hampshire , and is said to be easy to install and affordable .
The House of Commons report described the system as being capable of recognizing number plates in all weathers , and at any time of day or night .
It also suggested the system could cut the need for speed bumps , and might “ eliminate rat- runs ” .
Rat run is the term used for using residential side streets and other minor roads to avoid heavy traffic and traffic lights on main roads .
Doubts have been raised by civil rights groups about the ethics of the system , with Geoffrey Cox , a conservative politician from an area near the test site in Cornwall , querying whether it is necessary to spy on and film motorists .
He warned that it may become routine , and said it should never be routine for the state to spy on its citizens .
At present the system is under test , and has not yet been granted approval for use .

War and the Marine Corps : A message from Sergeant C
With all the current verbal and physical threats of violence against members of Congress who voted for the Health Reform bill , and Teabaggers carrying signs that say :
We ’re unarmed , this time .
and the talk of an open revolt against the democratically elected President of the United States , it is comforting to read an article written by a sergeant in the United States Marine Corps …
An article I wish I would never have to write – To those calling for a civil war , this Marine wants you to stop , and think …
By Sgt. C USMC
It ’s been said that the military is always preparing for war .
That is true .
We prepare for combat every day .
We ran 5 miles today to the rifle range and shot nearly 200 rounds a piece at targets and then ran back .
However , we also pray for peace .
I would love one day to be completely unnecessary .
But alas , I am a realist , and I know that day will never come .
The headlines of the last week have reminded me more of glimpsing at the S2 Daily Briefing Sheets while in theater or the Al - Jazeera than the NY Times or the Washington Post .
Think about that for a moment , let it sink in .
Before I get into the main premise of this article – I need to make two statements here .
First and foremost , when it comes to the back and forth of who did what to whom and why – I do n’t give a @ !$ %# .
It does n’t change the action .
In life we ’re judged by our actions , nothing more , nothing less .
One of the greatest things of the military is when it comes to an enemy , the politics behind the situation – do n’t matter in accomplishing that mission .
For the military , life is simple in that regard .
Secondly , Regardless of your political ideology , you ’ve earned the right as US Citizens to say your piece – no matter how wrong it may be .
That is your right , and I will give my life to protect it .
But this government of ours is a democracy .
We vote for our representatives , and they vote in our interests .
Sometimes , the votes do n’t go our way .
That ’s life , better luck next time .
Exhaust your legislative options , and then focus on gaining the required votes and / or seats to achieve your desired legislative vote next election time .
That ’s the way things work .
But the SECOND you start committing acts of violence and vandalism , then you ’ve usurped that Constitution .
You in a way have assaulted it .
And then you and I ( I being every servicemember who has sworn to defend said Constitution ) will have a MAJOR PROBLEM .
For those of you calling for a civil war , I implore you to stop and think about what you ’re saying .
Look around your neighborhood and your city .
Now imagine using that terrain to survive .
Imagine dodging semi-automatic rifle fire as you scramble from cover to cover , dragging your wounded child behind you .
Imagine the deafening report of a mortar as it strikes the ground a 150 feet in front of you , the overpressure enough to shatter your teeth and perforate an ear drum .
Try and envision a Stryker rolling through neighbor ’s front lawn or a F / A - 18 making lazy loops over your head in Close Air Support for the troops in the distance .
Now with that vision in mind , stop by your local Marine Corps base , being they will be the first military units you ’d face in an all out ‘ civil war ’ .
Look at them for a moment , examine their ‘ work environment ’ .
They ’re running the track , they ’re climbing ropes , they ’re grappelling with each other in mock hand - to - hand combat , and shooting targets while moving in raid lines on a daily basis .
Nearly everyone on that base , down to our ‘ secretaries ’ has a combat award of one type or another , they ’ve faced some of the most stressful situations on Earth where succumbing to the stress can get you killed , and they flourished .
Now ask yourselves and be honest – when is the last time you ’ve run anything other than late to work , climbed anything other than a flight of stairs , grappelled with anything other than a paper jam , and shot off anything other than your mouth ?
When ’s the last time you were in any situation more stressful than a traffic jam ?
Now I ’m not blaming you for your career choice , not in the least .
I ca n’t think of a single job that ’s not useful in some way or another .
I just want you to simply compare and contrast your work environment with ours and ask yourselves “ Who is better suited to win this battle ? ”
We both know the answer here , and if you doubt that answer , look at the results from Fallujah in 2004 .
Over 1200 of them ‘ lost ’ and we ‘ lost only 28 .
That ’s a ‘ win- ratio ’ of almost 60 - 1 , and they ’ve been fighting their whole lives .
Put this in another scenario .
You and your officemates think your local pro football team sucks , so you put together your own team of the best your company has and challenge them to a game .
Even if your team might be good , they ’re professionals .
This is their job .
Your job is to answer phones and type on a keyboard .
In short , they ’ve forgotten more than you will ever know about football .
The result , will be a slaughter for you , and a practice for them .
But at least you ’ll get a chance to sit at home , ice your wounds and say ‘ whew I never should ’ve done that !’
Not so with combat .
The results of combat are far … FAR .. more permanent .
There are no second chances , no time for regrets , and no do - overs .
This is not Call of Duty .
Now I ‘d like to disperse a myth here – many of you think that US military would not fight civilians .
I ca n’t speak for all , but in my case – the moment you declare civil war , you ’re no longer civilians .
The moment you attack the constitution , you ’re now enemies of that constitution .
And I swore to defend and support and if necessary give my life for that Constitution and utilize every tool , technique , and weapon at my disposal to do so .
And trust me , I ’m not alone .
I hope some of you heed my words and cool the rhetoric and focus on achieving your goals diplomatically instead of physically .
It would never want to receive a frag order to Maryland , or North Dakota , or Texas , but it is an order I will follow no matter how much it pains me to do so .

Tip o’ the hat to Infidel …
" We thought he was going to go straight into it .
But he just went round it - I did n't think it would be possible .
He was born blind but this therapy has given him a new lease of life . "
Martin Heidegger - Der Spiegel
Rudolf Augstein and Georg Wolff , 23 September 1966 ; published May 31 1976 .
SPIEGEL : Professor Heidegger , we have noticed again and again that your philosophical work is somewhat overshadowed by incidents in your life that , although they didnt last very long , were never clarified , either because you were too proud or because you did not find it expedient to comment on them .
HEIDEGGER : You mean 1933 ?
SPIEGEL : Yes , before and afterward .
We would like to place it in a greater context and then to move on from there to a few questions that seem important to us , such as :
What possibilities does philosophy have to influence reality , including political reality ?
Does this possibility still exist at all ?
And if so , what is it composed of ?
HEIDEGGER : Those are important questions .
Will I be able to answer them all ?
But let me start by saying that I was in no way politically active before I became rector .
In the winter of 1932 /33 , I had a leave of absence and spent most of my time up in my cabin . [ 1 ]
SPIEGEL : Then how did it come about that you became rector of the University of Freiburg ?
HEIDEGGER : In December of 1932 , my neighbor von Miillendorff , [ 2 ] professor of anatomy , was elected rector .
At the University of Freiburg , the new rector assumes his post on April 15 .
During the winter semester 1932/33 we often spoke about the situation , not only about the political situation , but also especially about the situation of the universities , about the situation of the students  which was , in some ways , hopeless .
My opinion was :
As far as I can judge things , the only possibility that remains is to try to counterbalance the coming development with those of the constructive powers that are still really vital .
SPIEGEL : So you saw a connection between the situation of the German university and the political situation in Germany in general ?
HEIDEGGER : I certainly followed the course of political events between January and March 1933 and occasionally talked about it with younger colleagues as well .
But at the time I was working on an extensive interpretation of pre-Socratic thinking , and at the beginning of the summer semester I returned to Freiburg .
In the meantime Professor von Möllendorff had assumed his office as rector on April fifteenth .
Just under two weeks later , his office was taken away from him again by the Minister of Culture in Baden at the time , Wacker .
The fact that the rector had prohibited the posting of the so - called Jewish Notice [ 3 ] at the university was , presumably , a welcome cause for the ministers decision .
SPIEGEL : Herr von Möllendorff was a Social Democrat .
What did he do after his dismissal ?
HEIDEGGER : The day of his dismissal von Möllendorff came to me and said :  Heidegger , now you must take over the rectorate . 
I said that I had no experience in administration .
The vice - rector at the time , Sauer ( theology ) , however , also urged me to run in the new rectoral election because there was a danger that otherwise a functionary would be appointed as rector .
Younger colleagues , with whom I had discussed questions of the structure of the university for many years , besieged me with requests to take over the rectorate .
I hesitated a long time .
Finally I declared myself willing to take over the office , but only in the interest of the university , and only if I could be certain of the plenums unanimous approval .
Doubts about my aptitude for the rectorate remained , however , and on the morning of the day set for the election I went to the rectors office and told my colleagues von Möllendorff ( who , although dismissed from his office as rector , was present ) and vice - rector Sauer that I could not take over the office .
Both these colleagues responded that the election had been prepared in such a way that I could no longer withdraw from my candidacy .
SPIEGEL : After that you declared yourself finally ready .
How did your relationship to the National Socialists then develop ?
HEIDEGGER : The second day after my assumption of the rectorate , the Student Leader appeared with two others in the office I had as rector and again demanded that the Jewish Notice be posted .
I refused .
The three students left with the comment that the Reich Student Leadership ( Reichsstudentenführung ) would be notified of the prohibition .
A few days later I got a telephone call from the SA Office of Higher Education in the Supreme SA Command , from SA - Group Leader Dr. Baumann .
He demanded that the said notice , which had already been put up in other universities , be posted .
If I refused , I would have to expect that I would be dismissed or even that the university would be closed .
I refused and tried to win the support of Badens Minister of Culture for my prohibition .
He explained that he could do nothing in opposition to the SA .
I still did not retract my prohibition .
SPIEGEL : This was not known in that way before .
HEIDEGGER : I had already named the fundamental motive that made me decide to take over the rectorate in my inaugural lecture  What Is Metaphysics ?  given in Freiburg in 1929 :  The areas of the sciences lie far apart .
The ways they treat their subject matter are fundamentally different .
This disintegrated multiplicity of the disciplines is only held together today by the technical organization of the universities and its faculties and only retains some meaning because of the practical purposes set for the departments .
However , the roots of the sciences in their essential ground have died .  [ 4 ]
What I attempted to do during my term in office with respect to this state of the universities ( which has , by today , become extremely deteriorated ) is explained in my rectoral address .
SPIEGEL : We are attempting to find out how and if this statement from 1929 corresponds to what you said in your inaugural address as rector in 1933 .
We are taking one sentence out of its context here :  The much - lauded academic freedom will be expelled from the German university ; for this freedom was not genuine because it was only negative .  [ 5 ]
We believe we can assume that this statement expresses at least a part of opinions that are not foreign to you even today .
HEIDEGGER : Yes , I still stand by it .
For this academic freedom was basically purely negative : the freedom from the effort of getting involved in the reflection and contemplation scholarly study demanded .
Incidentally , the sentence you picked out should not be isolated , but placed in its context .
Then it will become clear what I wanted to have understood as negative freedom . 
SPIEGEL : Fine , that s understandable .
We believe , however , that we hear a new tone in your rectoral address when you speak , four months after Hitler was named Chancellor of the Reich , about the greatness and magnificence of this new departure .  [ 6 ]
HEIDEGGER : Yes , I was convinced of that as well .
SPIEGEL : Could you explain that a bit more ?
HEIDEGGER : Gladly .
At the time I saw no other alternative .
In the general confusion of opinions and political tendencies of thirty - two parties , it was necessary to find a national , and especially a social , point of view , perhaps along the lines of Friedrich Naumanns attempt . [ 7 ]
I could refer here , to give only one example , to an essay by Eduard Spranger that goes way beyond my rectoral address . [ 8 ]
SPIEGEL : When did you begin to deal with the political conditions ?
The thirty - two parties had been there for a long time .
There were already millions of unemployed in 1930 .
HEIDEGGER : During that time , I was still completely taken up by the questions that are developed in Being and Time ( 1927 ) and in the writings and lectures of the following years .
These are fundamental questions of thinking that indirectly also concern national and social questions .
As a teacher at the university , I was directly concerned with the question of the meaning of the sciences and , therefore , the determination of the task of the university .
This effort is expressed in the title of my rectoral address ,  The Self - Assertion of the German University . 
In no other rectoral address at the time was such a title risked .
But have any of those who polemicize against this speech really read it thoroughly , thought it through , and understood it from the standpoint of the situation at the time ?
SPIEGEL : Self - assertion of the university , in such a turbulent world , does that not seem a little inappropriate ?
HEIDEGGER : Why ?
 The Self - Assertion of the University  goes against so called political science , which had already been called for by the Party and National Socialist students .
This title had a very different meaning then .
It did not mean politology ,  as it does today , but rather implied : Science as such , its meaning and its value , is appraised for its practical use for the nation ( Volk ) .
The counter position to this politicization of science is specifically expressed in the rectoral address .
SPIEGEL : Do we understand you correctly ?
In including the university in what you felt to be a new departure ,  you wanted to assert the university against perhaps overpowering trends that would not have left the university its identity ?
HEIDEGGER : Certainly , but at the same time self - assertion was to have set itself the positive task of winning back a new meaning , in the face of the merely technical organization of the university , through reflection on the tradition of Western and European thinking .
SPIEGEL : Professor , are we to understand that you thought then that a recovery of the university could be achieved with the National Socialists ?
HEIDEGGER : That is incorrectly worded .
The university was to have renewed itself through its own reflection , not with the National Socialists , and thereby gain a firm position against the danger of the politicization of science  in the sense already given .
SPIEGEL : And that is why you proclaimed these three pillars in your rectoral address : Labor Service ( Arbeitsdienst ) , Military Service ( Wehrdienst ) , Knowledge Service ( Wissensdienst ) .
Through this , you seem to have thought , Knowledge Service would be lifted up to an equal status , a status that the National Socialists had not conceded it ?
HEIDEGGER : There is no mention of pillars .
If you read carefully , you will notice that although Knowledge Service is listed in third place , it is set in first place in terms of its meaning .
One ought to consider that labor and defense are , like all human activities , grounded in knowledge and illuminated by it .
SPIEGEL : But we must ( we are almost done with this dreadful quoting ) mention one other statement here , one that we cannot imagine that you would still subscribe to today .
 Do not let theorems and ideas be the rules of your being .
The Führer himself and alone is the present and future German reality and its law .  [ 9 ]
HEIDEGGER :
These sentences are not to be found in the rectoral address , but only in the local Freiburg student newspaper , at the beginning of the winter semester 1933 / 34 .
When I took over the rectorate , it was clear to me that I would not get through it without making compromises .
Today I would no longer write the sentences you cited .
Even in 1934 , I no longer said anything of the kind .
But today , and today more resolutely than ever , I would repeat the speech on the  Self - Assertion of the German University ,  though admittedly without referring to nationalism .
Society has taken the place of the nation ( Volk ) .
However , the speech would be just as much of a waste of breath today as it was then .
SPIEGEL : May we interrupt you with a question again ?
It has be -come clear in the conversation up to now that your conduct in 1933 fluctuated between two poles .
First , you had to say a number of things ad usum Delphini ( for the use of the Dauphin ; revised for public consumption ) .
That was one pole .
The other pole was , however , more positive .
You expressed it like this : I had the feeling that here is something new , here is a new departure  the way you have said it .
HEIDEGGER : That s right .
SPIEGEL : Between these two poles  that is perfectly credible when considered from the point of view of the situation at the time ...
HEIDEGGER : Certainly .
But I must emphasize that the expression ad usum Delphini says too little .
I believed at the time that in the questioning confrontation with National Socialism a new path , the only one still possible , to a renewal might possibly open up .
SPIEGEL : You know that in this connection some accusations have been made against you that concern your cooperation with the National Socialist German Workers  Party ( NSDAP ) and its associations .
These accusations are generally thought to be uncontradicted as yet .
You have been accused , for instance , of having participated in book - burnings organized by the students or by the Hitler Youth .
HEIDEGGER : I forbade the book burning that was planned to take place in front of the main university building .
SPIEGEL : You have also been accused of having books written by Jewish authors removed from the university library or from the philosophy departments library .
HEIDEGGER : As the director of the department , I was in charge of only its library .
I did not comply with repeated demands to remove books by Jewish authors .
Former participants in my seminars can testify today that not only were no books by Jewish authors removed , but that these authors , especially Husserl , were quoted and discussed just as they were before 1933 .
SPIEGEL : We will take note of that .
But how do you explain the origin of such rumors ?
Is it maliciousness ?
HEIDEGGER : From what I know about the sources , I am inclined to believe that .
But the motives for the slander lie deeper .
Presumably my assumption of the rectorate was only a catalyst and not the determining cause .
Therefore the polemics will probably always flare up again whenever there is a catalyst .
SPIEGEL : You had Jewish students after 1933 , too .
Your relationship to some , probably not to all , of these Jewish students was supposed to have been warm .
Even after 1933 ?
HEIDEGGER : My attitude remained unchanged after 1933 .
One of my oldest and most gifted students , Helene Weiss , who later emigrated to Scotland , received her doctorate from the University of Basel ( after she was no longer able to receive it from the Freiburg faculty ) with a very important dissertation on  Causality and Chance in the Philosophy of Aristotle ,  printed in Basel in 1942 .
At the end of the foreword the author writes :  The attempt at a phenomenological interpretation , whose first part we present here , was made possible by M. Heideggers unpublished interpretations of Greek philosophy .
Here you see the copy with a handwritten dedication that the author sent me in 1948 .
I visited Dr. Weiss a number of times in Basel before her death .
SPIEGEL : You were friends with Jaspers for a long time .
This relationship began to be strained after 1933 .
Rumor has it that this strain was connected to the fact that Jaspers had a Jewish wife .
Would you like to comment on that ?
HEIDEGGER : What you mention here is a lie .
Jaspers and I had been friends since 1919 .
I visited him and his wife during the summer semester of 1933 , when I delivered a lecture in Heidelberg .
Karl Jaspers sent me all of his publications between 1934 and 1938   with warm regards .
Here , you can look at them .
SPIEGEL : It says here :  With warm regards . 
Well , the regards probably would not have been warm if there had previously been a strain in the relationship . [ 10 ]
Another similar question :
You were a student of Edmund Husserl , your Jewish predecessor in the chair of philosophy at the University of Freiburg .
He recommended you to the faculty as his successor as professor .
Your relationship to him cannot have been without gratitude .
HEIDEGGER : You know the dedication in Being and Time .
SPIEGEL : Of course .
HEIDEGGER : In 1929 I edited the festschrift for his seventieth birthday , and at the celebration in his house I gave the speech , which was also printed in the Akademische Mitteilungen in May 1929 .
SPIEGEL : Later , however , the relationship did become strained .
Can you and would you like to tell us what this could be traced back to ?
HEIDEGGER : Our differences of opinion on philosophical matters had intensified .
In the beginning of the thirties , Husserl settled accounts with Max Scheler and me in public .
The clarity of Husserls statements left nothing to be desired .
I could never find out what persuaded Husserl to set himself against my thinking in such a public manner .
SPIEGEL : On what occasion was this ?
HEIDEGGER : Husserl spoke at the University of Berlin before an audience of sixteen hundred .
Heinrich Mühsam reported in one of the big Berlin newspapers on a kind of sports - palace atmosphere . 
SPIEGEL : The argument as such is uninteresting in this context .
It is only interesting that it was not an argument that has to do with the year 1933 .
HEIDEGGER : Not in the least .
SPIEGEL : That has been our observation as well .
Is it incorrect that you later left the dedication to Husserl out of Being and Time ?
HEIDEGGER : No , that s true .
I clarified the facts in my book On the Way to Language .
The text reads :  To counter numerous , widely spread , incorrect allegations , let it be expressly stated here that the dedication to Being and Time , mentioned in the text of the dialogue on page 16 , was also placed at the beginning of the books fourth edition in 1935 .
When my publisher thought that the printing of the fifth edition in 1941 was endangered , and that the book might be banned , it was finally agreed , following Niemeyers [ 11 ] proposal and wish , that the dedication should be left out of the fifth edition .
My condition was that the footnote on page 38 , in which the reasons for the dedication are actually given , should remain .
It reads :  If the following investigation has taken any steps forward in disclosing the things themselves ,  the author must first thank E. Husserl , who , by providing his own incisive personal guidance and by freely turning over his unpublished investigations , familiarized the author with the most diverse areas of phenomenological research during his student years in Freiburg .  [ 12 ]
SPIEGEL : Then we hardly need to ask whether it is true that you , as rector of the University of Freiburg , forbade the emeritus professor Husserl to enter or to use the university library or the philosophy departments library .
HEIDEGGER : That is slander .
SPIEGEL : And there is no letter in which this prohibition against Husserl is expressed ?
How did this rumor get started ?
HEIDEGGER : I dont know either ; I dont have an explanation for it .
I can demonstrate the impossibility of this whole matter to you through the following example , something that is also unknown .
The governmental ministry had demanded that the director of the medical clinic , Professor Thannhauser , [ 13 ] and von Hevesy , [ 14 ] professor of physical chemistry and future Nobel Prize winner  both Jewish  be dismissed .
During my rectorate I was able to retain these two men by meeting with the minister .
The idea that I would retain them and simultaneously take action against Husserl , an emeritus professor and my own teacher , in the rumored fashion is absurd .
Moreover I prevented a demonstration against Professor Thannhauser that students and lecturers had planned to take place in front of his clinic .
In the obituary that the Thannhauser family published in the local newspaper , it says :  Until 1934 he was the honored director of the universitys medical clinic in Freiburg im Breisgau .
Brookline , Mass. , 12.18.1962 .
The Freiburger Universitätsblätter reported in February 1966 on Professor von Hevesy :  During the years 1926 - 1934 , von Hevesy was the head of the Physical - Chemical Institute of the University of Freiburg im Breisgau . 
After I resigned from the rectorate , both directors were removed from their offices .
At the time , there were unsalaried lecturers who had been stuck in their positions for a while and left behind , and they then thought :
Now the time has come to move up .
When these people came to talk to me , I turned them all away .
SPIEGEL : You did not attend Husserls funeral in 1938 .
Why not ?
HEIDEGGER : Let me say the following about that :
The accusation that I had broken off my relationship to Husserl is unfounded .
My wife wrote a letter in both our names to Frau Husserl in May 1933 .
In it we expressed our unchanged gratitude ,  and we sent the letter with a bouquet of flowers to their house .
Frau Husserl answered briefly in a formal " thank you " note and wrote that the relations between our families were broken off .
It was a human failure that I did not once again attest to my gratitude and my admiration at Husserls sickbed and after his death .
I apologized for it later in a letter to Frau Husserl .
SPIEGEL : Husserl died in 1938 .
You had already resigned from the rectorate in February 1934 .
How did that come about ?
HEIDEGGER : I will have to expand somewhat on that .
My intention at the time was to overcome the technical organization of the university ; that is , to renew the faculties from the inside , from the point of view of their scholarly tasks .
With this intention in mind , I proposed that younger colleagues and especially colleagues distinguished in their fields should be appointed deans of the individual faculties for the winter semester 1933 / 34 , without regard for their positions in the Party .
Thus Professor Erik
Wolf became dean of the law school , Professor Schadewaldt dean of the faculty of philosophy , Professor Soergel dean of the faculty of natural sciences , Professor von Möllendorff , who had been dismissed as rector in the spring , dean of the medical school .
But around Christmas 1933 it was already clear to me that I would not be able to carry out my intention of renewing the university against the opposition of both colleagues and the Party .
My colleagues were not pleased , for example , that I included students in responsible positions in the administration of the university  exactly as the case is today .
One day I was called to Karlsruhe , where the minister demanded , through his senior assistant and in the presence of the Gauleiter student leader , that I replace the deans of the law school and the medical school with other members of the faculty who would be acceptable to the Party .
I refused to do this , and said I would resign from the rectorate if the minister insisted on his demand .
That is what happened in February 1934 .
I resigned after only ten months in office , whereas the rectors at the time spent two or more years in office .
While the domestic and foreign press commented on the assumption of office in various ways , they were silent about my resignation .
SPIEGEL : Did you negotiate with Reich Minister of Education , Bernhard Rust at the time ?
HEIDEGGER : At what time ?
SPIEGEL : In 1933 , Rust made a trip here to Freiburg that is still talked about .
HEIDEGGER : We are dealing with two different events .
On the occasion of a commemoration at Schlageters grave [ 15 ] in his hometown , Schönau im Wiesental , I greeted the minister briefly and formally .
Otherwise the minister took no notice of me .
At that point I did not try to have a conversation with him .
Schlageter had been a student at the University of Freiburg and a member of a Catholic fraternity .
The conversation took place in November 1933 on the occasion of a rectorial conference in Berlin .
I presented my views on science and the possible structure of the faculties to the minister .
He listened so attentively to everything that I harbored the hope that what I had presented might have an effect .
But nothing happened .
I do not see why I am reproached for this discussion with the Reich Minister of Education while at the same time all the foreign governments rushed to recognize Hitler and to show him the customary international courtesies .
SPIEGEL : I - low did your relationship to the NSDAP develop after you had resigned as rector ?
HEIDEGGER : After I resigned from the rectorate , I retreated back to my task as teacher .
In the summer semester 1934 I lectured on  Logic . 
In the following semester , 1934 / 35 , I gave the first lecture on Hölderlin .
The lectures on Nietzsche began in 1936 .
All of those who could hear heard that this was a confrontation with National Socialism .
SPIEGEL : How did the transfer of office take place ?
You didnt participate in the celebration ?
HEIDEGGER : Yes , I refused to take part in the ceremony of the change of rectors .
SPIEGEL : Was your successor a committed Party member ?
HEIDEGGER : He was a member of the law school .
The Party newspaper Der Alemanne announced his appointment as rector with the banner headline :  The First National Socialist Rector of the University .  [ 16 ]
SPIEGEL : Did you have difficulties with the Party afterward , or what happened ?
HEIDEGGER : I was constantly under surveillance .
SPIEGEL : Do you have an example of that ?
HEIDEGGER : Yes , the case of Dr. Hancke .
SPIEGEL : How did you find out about that ?
HEIDEGGER : Because he came to me himself .
He had already received his doctorate and was a participant in my advanced seminar in the winter semester of 1936 / 37 and in the summer semester of 1937 .
He had been sent here to Freiburg by the SD ( Sicherheitsdienst ; Security Service ) to keep me under surveillance .
SPIEGEL : Why did he suddenly come to you ?
HEIDEGGER : Because of my seminar on Nietszche in the summer semester of 1937 and because of the way in which work was done in the seminar , he confessed to me that he could not continue with the task of surveillance assigned to him .
He wanted to inform me of this situation in view of my future activity as a teacher .
SPIEGEL : Otherwise you had no difficulties with the Party ?
HEIDEGGER : I only knew that my works were not allowed to be discussed , for example the essay  Platos Theory of Truth . 
The lecture I gave on Hölderlin in the Germanic Institute in Rome in the spring of 1936 was attacked in the Hitler Youth magazine Wille und Macht in a most unpleasant way .
Those who are interested should read the polemics against me that started up in the summer of 1934 in E. Kriecks [ 17 ] magazine Volk im Werden .
I neither belonged to the German delegation to the international philosophy conference in Prague in 1934 nor was I even invited to participate .
I was also supposed to have been excluded from the international Descartes conference in Paris in 1937 .
This seemed so strange to those in Paris that the head of the conference ( Professor Brèhier at the Sorbonne ) asked me why I did not belong to the German delegation .
I answered that the organizers of the conference should inquire at the Reich Ministry of Education about this case .
After a while , I received an invitation from Berlin to belatedly join the delegation .
I refused .
The lectures  What Is Metaphysics ?  and  On the Essence of Truth  were sold under the counter in dust jackets without titles .
Shortly after 1934 , the rectoral address was taken off the market at the instigation of the Party .
It was only allowed to be discussed in National Socialist teachers  camps [ 18 ] as a subject for the Partys political polemics .
SPIEGEL : In 1939 , when the war ...
HEIDEGGER : In the last year of the war , five hundred of the most eminent scholars and artists were exempted from any kind of military service . [ 19 ]
I was not one of those who were exempted .
On the contrary , in the summer of 1944 I was ordered to dig trenches over near the Rhine , on the Kaiserstuhl .
SPIEGEL : On the other side , the Swiss side , Karl Barth dug trenches .
HEIDEGGER : The way in which it happened is interesting .
The rector had called the entire faculty into the Lecture Hall .
He gave a short speech to the effect that what he would now say was in agreement with the National Socialist district leader and the National Socialist Gauleiter leader .
He would now divide the entire faculty into three groups : first those who were completely dispensable , second those who were partially dispensable , and third those who were indispensable .
First on the list of the completely dispensable came Heidegger , later G. Ritter . [ 20 ]
In the winter semester 1944 / 45 , after I had finished work on the trenches near the Rhine , I gave a lecture course entitled  Poetry and Thinking  ( Dichten und Denken ) , in a certain sense a continuation of my Nietzsche seminar , that is to say , of the confrontation with National Socialism .
After the second class , I was conscripted into the Volkssturm , [ 21 ] the oldest member of the faculty to be called for service .
SPIEGEL : I dont think we have to hear Professor Heidegger on the subject of the course of events until he actually , or should we say legally , received an emeritus status .
It is well known .
HEIDEGGER : Actually , the events themselves are not known .
It is not a very nice affair .
SPIEGEL : Unless you would like to say something about them .
HEIDEGGER : No .
SPIEGEL : Perhaps we might summarize .
As an un-political person , in its narrow sense , not in its broader sense , you got caught up in the politics of this supposed new departure in 1933 ...
HEIDEGGER :... by way of the university ...
SPIEGEL :... by way of the university in the politics of this supposed new departure .
After about a year , you gave up the function again that you had assumed in this process .
But in a lecture in 1935 , which was published in 1953 as  An Introduction to Meta - physics ,  you said :  The works that are being offered around today ,  today being 1935 as the philosophy of National Social - ism , but have nothing to do with the inner truth and greatness of this movement ( namely with the encounter of planetarily determined technology and modern human beings ) , are fishing for big catches in the murky waters of values and wholes .  [ 22 ]
Did you add the words in parentheses in 1953 , when it was printed  perhaps to explain to the readers of 1953 what you thought of as the inner truth and greatness of this movement ,  that is , of National Socialism , in 1935  or was this parenthetical remark already there in 1935 ?
HEIDEGGER : It was in my manuscript and corresponded exactly to my conception of technology at the time , but not yet to my later interpretation of the essence of technology as construct ( Gestell ) . [ 23 ]
The reason I did not read that passage aloud was because I was convinced my audience would understand me correctly .
The stupid ones and the spies and the snoopers understood it differently  and might as well have , too .
SPIEGEL : Surely you would classify the Communist movement in that way as well ?
HEIDEGGER : Yes , absolutely , as determined by planetary technology .
SPIEGEL : Perhaps you would classify the sum of American endeavors in that way , too ?
HEIDEGGER : I would say that as well .
During the past thirty years , it should meanwhile have become clearer that the planetary movement of modern technology is a power whose great role in determining history can hardly be overestimated .
A decisive question for me today is how a political system can be assigned to todays technological age at all , and which political system would that be ?
I have no answer to this question .
I am not convinced that it is democracy .
SPIEGEL : Democracy is merely a collective term that can encompass very different conceptions .
The question is whether a trans - formation of this political form is still possible .
After 1945 you gave your opinions on the political aspirations of the Western world and in the process you also spoke about democracy , about the political expression of the Christian worldview , and also about the constitutional state  and you called all these aspirations halves . 
HEIDEGGER : Let me first ask you where I spoke about democracy and all the other things you mentioned .
I would indeed describe them as halves because I dont think they genuinely confront the technological world .
I think that behind them there is an idea that technology is in its essence something human beings have under their control .
In my opinion , that is not possible .
Technology is in its essence something that human beings cannot master of their own accord .
SPIEGEL : Which of the political trends just outlined do you consider to be the most appropriate to our time ?
HEIDEGGER : That I dont see .
But I do see a decisive question here .
First we would have to clarify what you mean by appropriate to our time ,  what time means here .
It is even more important to ask whether appropriateness to our time is the measure for the inner truth of human actions , or whether thinking and writing poetry  ( Denken und Dichten ) , despite all censure of this phrase , are not the actions that most provide us with a measure .
SPIEGEL : It is striking that throughout time human beings have been unable to master their tools ; look at the magicians apprentice .
Is it not somewhat too pessimistic to say that we will not be able to master this certainly much greater tool of modern technology ?
HEIDEGGER : Pessimism , no .
Pessimism and optimism are positions that fall too short of the realm we are attempting to reflect upon here .
But above all modern technology is not a tool ,  and it no longer has anything to do with tools .
SPIEGEL : Why should we be so overpowered by technology ?
HEIDEGGER : I do not say overpowered .
I say we have no path that corresponds to the essence of technology as of yet .
SPIEGEL : One could naïvely object :
What do we have to come to terms with here ?
Everything functions .
More and more electric power plants are being built .
Production is flourishing .
People in the highly technological parts of the earth are well provided for .
We live in prosperity .
What is really missing here ?
HEIDEGGER : Everything functions .
That is exactly what is uncanny .
Everything functions and the functioning drives us further and further to more functioning , and technology tears people away and uproots them from the earth more and more .
I dont know if you are scared ; I was certainly scared when I recently saw the photographs of the earth taken from the moon .
We dont need an atom bomb at all ; the uprooting of human beings is already taking place .
We only have purely technological conditions left .
It is no longer an earth on which human beings live today .
I recently had a long conversation with René Char in Provence  as you know , the poet and Resistance fighter .
Rocket bases are being built in Provence , and the country is being devastated in an incredible way .
The poet , who certainly cannot be suspected of sentimentality or a glorification of the idyllic , said to me that the uprooting of human beings who is going on now is the end if thinking and poetry do not acquire nonviolent power once again .
SPIEGEL : Now , we must say that although we prefer to be here on earth , and we probably will not have to leave it during our lifetime , who knows whether it is human beings  destiny to be on this earth ?
It is conceivable that human beings have no destiny at all .
But at any rate a possibility for human beings could be seen in that they reach out from this earth to other planets .
It will certainly not happen for a long time .
But where is it written that human beings  place is here ?
HEIDEGGER : From our human experience and history , at least as far as I am informed , I know that everything essential and great has only emerged when human beings had a home and were rooted in a tradition .
Todays literature is , for instance , largely destructive .
SPIEGEL : We are bothered by the word destructive here because the word nihilistic received a very broad context of meaning precisely through you and your philosophy .
It astonishes us to hear the word destructive in connection with literature you could or ought to see as a part of this nihilism .
HEIDEGGER : I would like to say that the literature I meant is not nihilistic in the way that I defined nihilism . [ 24 ]
SPIEGEL : You apparently see , so you have expressed it , a world movement that either brings about or has already brought about the absolute technological state ?
HEIDEGGER : Yes !
But it is precisely the technological state that least corresponds to the world and society determined by the essence of technology .
The technological state would be the most obsequious and blind servant in the face of the power of technology .
SPIEGEL : Fine .
But now the question of course poses itself : " Can the individual still influence this network of inevitabilities at all , or can philosophy influence it , or can they both influence it together in that philosophy leads one individual or several individuals to a certain action ? "
HEIDEGGER : Those questions bring us back to the beginning of our conversation .
If I may answer quickly and perhaps somewhat vehemently , but from long reflection : Philosophy will not be able to bring about a direct change of the present state of the world .
This is true not only of philosophy but of all merely human meditations and endeavors .
Only a god can still save us .
I think the only possibility of salvation left to us is to prepare readiness , through thinking and poetry , for the appearance of the god or for the absence of the god during the decline ; so that we do not , simply put , die meaningless deaths , but that when we decline , we decline in the face of the absent god .
SPIEGEL : Is there a connection between your thinking and the emergence of this god ?
Is there , as you see it , a causal connection ?
Do you think we can get this god to come by thinking ?
HEIDEGGER : We can not get him to come by thinking .
At best we can prepare the readiness of expectation .
SPIEGEL : But can we help ?
HEIDEGGER : The preparation of readiness could be the first step .
The world cannot be what and how it is through human beings , but neither can it be so without human beings .
In my opinion that is connected to the fact that what I call  Being ,  using a traditional , ambiguous , and now worn - out word , needs human beings .
Being is not Being without humans being needed for its revelation , protection , and structuring .
I see the essence of technology in what I call the construct .
This name , on first hearing easily misunderstood , points , if it is properly considered , back into the innermost history of metaphysics , which still determines our existence ( Dasein ) today .
The workings of the construct mean : Human beings are caught ( gestellt ) , claimed , and challenged by a power that is revealed in the essence of technology .
The experience that humans are structured ( gestellt ) by some - thing that they are not themselves and that they cannot control themselves is precisely the experience that may show them the possibility of the insight that humans are needed by Being .
The possibility of experience , of being needed , and of being prepared for these new possibilities is concealed in what makes up what is most modern technologys own .
Thinking can do nothing more than to help humans to this insight , and philosophy is at an end .
SPIEGEL : In earlier times  and not only in earlier times  it was thought that philosophy was indirectly very effective ( seldom directly ) , that it helped new currents to emerge .
Just thinking of Germans , great names like Kant , Hegel , up to Nietzsche , not to mention Marx , it can be proved that philosophy has had , in roundabout ways , an enormous effect .
Do you think this effectiveness of philosophy is at an end ?
And when you say philosophy is dead , that it no longer exists are you including the idea that the effectiveness of philosophy ( if indeed it ever existed ) today , at least , no longer exists ?
HEIDEGGER : I just said that an indirect , but not a direct , effect is possible through another kind of thinking .
Thus thinking can , as it were , causally change the condition of the world .
SPIEGEL : Please excuse us ; we do not want to philosophize ( we are not up to that ) , but here we have the link between politics and philosophy , so please forgive us for pushing you into such a conversation .
You just said philosophy and the individual could do nothing except ...
HEIDEGGER : ... this preparation of readiness for keeping oneself open to the arrival or absence of the god .
The experience of this absence is not " nothing , " but rather a liberation of human beings from what I called the fallenness into beings in Being and Time .
A contemplation of what is today is a part of a preparation of the readiness we have been talking about .
SPIEGEL : But then there really would have to be the famous impetus from outside , from a god or whomever .
So thinking , of its own accord and self sufficiently , can no longer be effective today ?
It was , in the opinion of people in the past , and even , I believe , in our opinion .
HEIDEGGER : But not directly .
SPIEGEL : We have already named Kant , Hegel , and Marx as great movers .
But impulses came from Leibniz , too  for the development of modern physics and therefore for the origin of the modern world in general .
We believe you said just now that you do not expect such an effect today any more .
HEIDEGGER : No longer in the sense of philosophy .
The role philosophy has played up to now has been taken over by the sciences today .
To sufficiently clarify the effect of thinking , we must have a more in - depth discussion of what effect and effecting can mean here .
For this , careful differentiations need to be made between cause , impulse , support , assistance , hindrance , and cooperation .
But we can only gain the appropriate dimension to make these differentiations if we have sufficiently discussed the principle of sufficient reason .
Philosophy dissolves into the individual sciences : psychology , logic , and political science .
SPIEGEL : And what takes the place of philosophy now ?
HEIDEGGER : Cybernetics .
SPIEGEL : Or the pious one who remains open ?
HEIDEGGER : But that is no longer philosophy .
SPIEGEL : What is it then ?
HEIDEGGER : I call it the other thinking .
SPIEGEL : You call it the other thinking .
Would you like to formulate that a little more clearly ?
HEIDEGGER : Were you thinking of the sentence with which I conclude my lecture on  The Question Concerning Technology  :  For questioning is the piety of thinking  ? [ 25 ]
SPIEGEL : We found a statement in your lectures on Nietzsche that seems to us appropriate .
You say there :  Because the greatest possible bond prevails in philosophical thinking , all great thinkers think the same thing .
However this sameness is so essential and rich that no one individual can exhaust it , but rather everyone binds everyone else more rigorously . 
It appears , however , that in your opinion this philosophical structure has come to a certain end .
HEIDEGGER : Has ended but has not become for us invalid ; rather it is again present in conversation .
My whole work in lectures and seminars during the past thirty years has been mainly simply an interpretation of Western philosophy .
The way back into the historical foundations of thinking , thinking through the questions that have not been asked since Greek philosophy  this is not breaking away from tradition .
But I say that traditional meta- physics  way of thinking , which ends with Nietzsche , no longer offers us any possibility to experience the fundamental characteristics of the technological age , an age that is only beginning , through thinking .
SPIEGEL : In a conversation with a Buddhist monk approximately two years ago , you spoke about a completely new method of thinking  and said that for the time being only very few people can execute this new method of thinking .
Do you mean to say that only very few people can have the insights that are , in your opinion , possible and necessary ?
HEIDEGGER :  Have  in its very primordial sense , that they can , in a way , say them .
SPIEGEL : Yes , but in the conversation with the Buddhist , you did not clearly describe how it can be realized .
HEIDEGGER : I can not make it clear .
I know nothing about how this thinking is effective .
It could also be that the path of thinking today leads toward silence , so that thinking may be protected from being thrown out within a year .
It could also be that it takes three hundred years to become effective . 
SPIEGEL : We understand that very well .
But because we do not live three hundred years from now , but here and now , we are denied silence .
We , politicians , semi-politicians , citizens , journalists , et cetera , we constantly have to make some sort of decision or other .
We must adapt ourselves to the system under which we live , must try to change it , must watch for the narrow door to reform and for the still narrower door to revolution .
We expect help from the philosopher , even if , of course , only indirect help , help in roundabout ways .
And now we hear : I can not help you .
HEIDEGGER : I cannot .
SPIEGEL : That has to discourage the non-philosopher .
HEIDEGGER : I cannot because the questions are so difficult that it would be contrary to the meaning of this task of thinking to make public appearances , to preach , and to distribute moral grades .
Perhaps I may risk this statement :
The secret of the planetary predominance of the un- thought essence of technology corresponds to the preliminariness and inconspicuousness of the thinking that attempts to reflect upon this un - thought essence .
SPIEGEL : You do not count yourself among those who , if they would only be heard , could point out a path ?
HEIDEGGER : No !
I know of no path toward a direct change of the present state of the world , assuming that such a change is at all humanly possible .
But it seems to me that the attempted thinking could awaken , clarify , and fortify the readiness we have already mentioned .
SPIEGEL : A clear answer .
But just wait , something will occur to us in the next three hundred years ?
HEIDEGGER : It is not a matter of simply waiting until something occurs to human beings after three hundred years have gone by ; it is about thinking ahead , without prophetic claims , into the coming time from the standpoint of the fundamental characteristics of the present age , which have hardly been thought through .
Thinking is not inactivity , but in itself the action that has a dialogue with the worlds destiny .
It seems to me that the distinction , stemming from metaphysics , made between theory and praxis , and the conception of a transmission between the two , obstructs the path toward insight into what I understand to be thinking .
Perhaps I may refer here to my lectures that were published in 1954 with the title What Is Called Thinking ? [ 26 ]
This piece is the least read of all my publications , and perhaps this , too , is a sign of our times .
SPIEGEL : It has , of course , always been a misunderstanding of philosophy to think that the philosopher should have some direct effect with his philosophy .
Let us return to the beginning .
Is it not conceivable that National Socialism can be seen on the one hand as a realization of that planetary encounter  and on the other as the last , most horrible , strongest , and , at the same time , most helpless protest against this encounter of planetarily determined technology  and modern human beings ?
Apparently , you are dealing with opposites in your own person that are such that many by - products of your activities can only really be explained in that you , with different parts of your being that do not touch the philosophical core , cling to many things about which you as a philosopher know that they have no continuity  for instance to concepts like home  ( Heimat ) , rootedness ,  and similar things .
How do planetary technology and home fit together ?
HEIDEGGER : I would not say that .
It seems to me that you take technology too absolutely .
I do not think the situation of human beings in the world of planetary technology is an inextricable and inescapable disastrous fate ; rather I think that the task of thinking is precisely to help , within its bounds , human beings to attain an adequate relationship to the essence of technology at all .
Although National Socialism went in that direction , those people were much too limited in their thinking to gain a really explicit relationship to what is happening today and what has been under way for three centuries .
SPIEGEL : This explicit relationship , do the Americans have it today ?
HEIDEGGER : They do not have it either .
They are still entangled in a way of thinking ;
Pragmatism that fosters technological operating and manipulating but simultaneously blocks the path toward a contemplation of what is characteristic of modern technology .
In the meantime , attempts to break away from pragmatic - positivistic thinking are being made here and there in the USA .
And which of us can say whether one day in Russia and in China age - old traditions of a thinking  will not awaken that will assist human beings in making a free relationship to the technological world possible ?
SPIEGEL : If no one has one and the philosopher cannot give one to them ...
HEIDEGGER : It is not for me to decide how far I will get with my attempt at thinking and in which way it will be received and productively transformed in the future .
In 1957 I gave a lecture entitled  The Principle of Identity  for the anniversary of the University of Freiburg .
In it I last risked showing , in a few steps of thought , the extent to which a thinking experience of what is most characteristic of modern technology can go .
I attempted to show that it may go so far as opening up the possibility that human beings of the technological age experience the relationship to a demand that they can not only hear but to which they also belong .
My thinking has an essential connection to Hölderlins poetry .
But I do not think Hölderlin is just any poet , whose work is a subject , among many others , for literary historians .
I think Hölderlin is the poet who points toward the future , who expects the god , and who therefore cannot remain simply a subject for Hölderlin research in the literary historical imagination .
SPIEGEL : Talking about Hölderlin ( we apologize that we will quote once again ) , in your lectures on Nietzsche you said that the differently understood conflict between the Dionysian and the apollonian , the holy passion and the sober account , is a concealed stylistic law of the historical destiny of the Germans , and one day it must find us ready and prepared for its structuring .
This opposition is not a formula with the help of which we can merely describe culture .
With this conflict , Hölderlin and Nietzsche have set a question mark before the Germans task to find their essence historically .
Will we be able to understand this sign , this question mark ?
One thing is certain :
If we do not understand it , history will take its revenge on us . 
We do not know what year you wrote this .
We estimate that it was 1935 .
HEIDEGGER : The quotation probably belongs to the course on Nietzsche entitled  The Will to Power as Art in 1936 / 37 .
It could also have been said in the years that followed .
SPIEGEL : Would you like to explain that a little more ?
It leads us away from generalities to a specific destiny of the Germans .
HEIDEGGER : I could put what is said in the quotation this way : I am convinced that a change can only be prepared from the same place in the world where the modern technological world originated .
It can not come about by the adoption of Zen Buddhism or other Eastern experiences of the world .
The help of the European tradition and a new appropriation of that tradition are needed for a change in thinking .
Thinking will only be transformed by a thinking that has the same origin and destiny .
SPIEGEL : At exactly the spot where the technological world originated , it must , you think ...
HEIDEGGER :... be transcended ( aufgehoben ) in the Hegelian sense , not removed , transcended , but not by human beings alone .
SPIEGEL : Do you allocate a special task specifically to the Germans ?
HEIDEGGER : Yes , in that sense , in dialogue with Hölderlin .
SPIEGEL : Do you think that the Germans have a specific qualification for this change ?
HEIDEGGER : I am thinking of the special inner relationship between the German language and the language and thinking of the Greeks .
This has been confirmed to me again and again today by the French .
When they begin to think they speak German .
They insist that they could not get through with their own language .
SPIEGEL : Is that how you would explain the very strong effect you have had in the Romance countries , particularly in France ?
HEIDEGGER : Because they see that they cannot get through todays world with all their rationality when they are attempting to understand it in the origin of its essence .
Thinking can be translated as little as poetry can .
At best it can be paraphrased .
As soon as a literal translation is attempted , everything is transformed .
SPIEGEL : A disquieting thought .
HEIDEGGER : It would be good if this disquiet would be taken seriously on a large scale and if it would finally be considered what a momentous transformation Greek thinking suffered when it was translated into Roman Latin , an event that still bars our way today to sufficient reflection on the fundamental words of Greek thinking .
SPIEGEL : Professor , we would actually always optimistically assume that something could be communicated and even translated , because if this optimism that contents of thinking can be communicated despite language barriers ceases , then provincialism threatens .
HEIDEGGER : Would you call Greek thinking provincial in contrast to the mode of ideas of the Roman Empire ?
Business letters can be translated into all languages .
The sciences ( today science already means the natural sciences , with mathematical physics as the basic science ) can be translated into all the worlds languages .
Put more correctly , they are not translated , but rather the same mathematical language is spoken .
We are touching here on an area that is broad and hard to cover .
SPIEGEL : Perhaps this belongs to this topic , too :
At present there is , without exaggerating , a crisis of the democratic - parliamentary system .
There has been one for a long time .
There is one particularly in Germany , but not only in Germany .
There is one in the classical countries of democracy , in England and America .
In France it is not even a crisis any more .
Now , a question : Can thinkers not give advice , even as by - products of thinking , that either this system must be replaced by a new one , and what it should look like , or that reform must be possible , and advice on how reform could be possible ?
Otherwise , the philosophically unschooled person  and that will normally be the person who has things in hand ( although he does not determine them ) and who is in the hands of things  this person will keep on reaching false conclusions , perhaps even terribly rash conclusions .
So : Should the philosopher not be ready to think about how human beings can arrange living together in this world , which they have technologized themselves and which has perhaps overpowered them ?
Is it not rightly expected of the philosopher that he give advice on what he considers possible ways of living ?
Does the philosopher not fall short of a part , even if it is a small part , of his profession and his calling if he communicates nothing about it ?
HEIDEGGER : As far as I can see , an individual is incapable of comprehending the world as a whole through thinking to the extent that he could give practical instructions , particularly in the face of the task of first finding a base for thinking itself again .
As long as it takes itself seriously with view to the great tradition , thinking is overtaxed if it must prepare itself to give instructions .
On what authority could this happen ?
In the realm of thinking , there are no authoritative statements .
The only stipulation for thinking comes from the matter that is to be thought .
This is , however , what is above all worthy of questioning .
To make this state of affairs understandable , a discussion of the relationship between philosophy and the sciences , whose technical - practical successes make thinking in a philosophical sense seem more and more superfluous , is needed .
The difficult situation in which thinking is placed with view to its own task thus corresponds to an alienation , fed by the powerful position of the sciences , from a thinking that must deny itself answering practical and ideological questions demanded by the day .
SPIEGEL : Professor , in the realm of thinking there are no authoritative statements .
Thus it cannot really be surprising that modern art has a difficult time making authoritative statements , too .
Nevertheless , you call it destructive .
Modern art often thinks of itself as experimental art .
Its works are attempts ...
HEIDEGGER : I will gladly be taught .
SPIEGEL : ... attempts made out of the isolated situation of human beings and artists , and out of every one hundred attempts , there is now and then one that hits the mark .
HEIDEGGER : That is the big question .
Where does art stand ?
What place does it occupy ?
SPIEGEL : Fine , but here you are demanding something of art that you no longer demand of thinking .
HEIDEGGER : I do not demand anything of art .
I only say that it is a question of what place art occupies .
SPIEGEL : If art does not know its place , does that mean it is destructive ?
HEIDEGGER : Fine , cross it out .
I would like to state , however , that I do not think modern art points out a path , particularly as it remains unclear where it sees or at least looks for what is most characteristic of art .
SPIEGEL : The artist , too , lacks commitment to tradition .
He might find it beautiful , and he can say :
Yes , that is the way one could paint six hundred years ago or three hundred years ago or even thirty years ago .
But he can no longer do it .
Even if he wanted to , he could not .
The greatest artist would then be the ingenious forger Hans van Meegeren , who would then paint better than the others .
But it just does not work any more .
Therefore the artist , writer , poet is in a similar situation to the thinker .
How often we must say Close your eyes .
HEIDEGGER : If the culture industry  is taken as the framework for the classification of art and poetry and philosophy , then the parity is justified .
However , if not only the industry but also what is called culture becomes questionable , then the contemplation of this questionableness also belongs to thinkings realm of responsibility , and thinkings plight is barely imaginable .
But thinkings greatest affliction is that today , as far as I can see , no thinker yet speaks who is great enough to place thinking , directly and formatively , before its subject matter and therefore on its path .
The greatness of what is to be thought is too great for us today .
Perhaps we can struggle with building narrow and not very far - reaching footbridges for a crossing .
SPIEGEL : Professor Heidegger , we thank you for this conversation .

The poverty of feminism by Dominique Karamazov : discussion
admin : text removed from the library and moved to the forums .
Here is the introduction which was given to the text when it was posted by Samotnaf .
Below in the comments is the discussion with users which led us to read and remove this text .
The following text was originally published in 1977 by the French group " La Guerre Sociale " as " Misere du feminisme " by Dominique Karamazov ( translated in 1998 by Elephant Editions , London ) .
It analyses how feminism , despite its emancipatory airs , has become the guardian of traditional feminine alienation , how feminism became a falsified representation , accomplished by capital , of a real movement .
Its real and positive role , like that of ecology , is that it brings problems to light , albeit in a disguised or inverted way .
It is up to the revolutionary movement and to theoretical quest to discover their true dimension and resolution .
Endangered Phoenix republish the text here as it is the most intelligent discussion of feminism we have found ; but obviously we do not endorse it uncritically .
For example , it offers little in practical engagement with or solutions to the immediate real problems of women in this world ; it is a little abstract and absolutist , too pure in its detachment .
It remains the bearer of ultimate post - revolutionary solutions only .
So , for instance , it rightly criticises the legalistic approach of much feminism in regard to rape , which mystifies the real root of the problem ; it states its preference for the response of giving rapists a good kicking .
But presumably the author would not condemn as ‘ legalistic ’ the legal defense of those who might be prosecuted for such an act .
But the text does not really deal with these thorny contradictions of engagement with this world , or why reliance on legal methods are not a mere theoretical failure ; they often seem the only practical , if partial , solution to fearful situations - although , in practice , very few rapes get taken to court , let alone successfully prosecuted , which shows the limitations of a legalistic approach even in its own terms .
However , if recourse to the law seems to be the only solution , it 's in part due to the fact that nowadays radical solutions are very rarely on people 's minds .
In the 70s , when this was written , women often thought of other ways of dealing with the problem : in Canada , for instance , there were groups of women who , if the rapist was known , would spray - paint their houses ( an autonomous way of ' naming and shaming ' ) , possibly thump them , or have the victim confront them backed by the group , often with the rapists ' family and partners present .
In Alexandra in South Africa in the mid-80s , community meetings would try the rapist and deal with him accordingly .
One of the contradictions of the justification for imprisoning rapists not pointed out in this text is that imprisonment increases the chance of rape - on the prisoners by other prisoners , but probably most victims are understandably indifferent to such contradictions ( whilst their silence about this contradiction is indicative of a moralistic hypocrisy ) .
The dialectic between necessary reformist demands , which appear in struggles and movements that have the potential to develop further , and ultimate revolutionary solutions remains largely unexplored .
The text defines feminism in relation to capitalism , but does not deal adequately with its relation to the wider social movement of its times .
The often brilliant discussion of desire and sexual relations is limited by its heterosexual angle – the gay perspective does n’t get a look in ( though obviously gay roles are determined by this society just as much as heterosexual ones ) .
But it does deal well with many issues ignored or repressed by feminist ideology .

Iraq ’s communal , anti-democratic election
10 April 2010
In the wake of the March 7 election in Iraq , the US administration and media hailed the ballot as evidence that the 2003 US invasion had , if belatedly , brought about democracy .
A month later , bombs are tearing through the suburbs of Baghdad virtually on a daily basis and the new parliament is wracked by communal divisions .
The claims of a new democratic beginning are another attempt to blind the American and international working class to the consequences of seven years of imperialist violence and intrigue against the Iraqi people .
A democratic election is not possible under a US occupation .
The American military has suppressed every section of Iraqi society that resisted the country ’s transformation into a client state .
Tens of thousands of the most determined and vocal opponents of the occupation have been slaughtered or are rotting in prisons .
The US invasion is directly responsible for the deaths of over 1.2 million Iraqi men , women and children and turning more than 4 million more into refugees or displaced persons .
The population has been shattered , physically and psychologically .
With endemic unemployment and over 32 percent living below the poverty line , most people are preoccupied with day - to - day survival amid the economic ruin produced by years of destruction .
As a result , resistance has been largely quelled for the time being .
Under these conditions , the election contest was between the rival bourgeois factions that have collaborated with US imperialism .
Neither put forward the views of the majority of Iraqis , who overwhelmingly want an immediate withdrawal of the hated army of occupation .
Instead , the various parties and coalitions bribed , threatened and stoked sectarian and ethnic fears in order to convince layers of the population to vote for them .
US General David Petraeus , who was in charge of the brutal repression during the so - called “ surge ” in 2007 and 2008 , cynically coined the term “ Iraqcracy ” to describe the corrupt activities of those he helped elevate to power .
As a result of the election , the 325 - seat parliament is even more sharply divided along communal lines than the one formed after the 2005 election .
The Iraqiya coalition led by former Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi obtained 91 seats , with the bulk of its votes coming from Sunni Arabs , secular Shiites and small ethnic minorities such as Turkomen and Christians .
The Shiite - based State of Law coalition of outgoing Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki holds 89 seats , almost all from Baghdad and the Shiite - populated southern provinces .
The Shiite fundamentalist Iraqi National Alliance won 70 seats in similar areas .
Kurdish parties won 57 seats , all from the Kurdish - populated regions of the north .
The two frontrunners to head the next government , Allawi and Maliki , epitomise the venal and communal character of the Iraqi political establishment .
Allawi , a secular Shiite , was a former member of Saddam Hussein ’s Baath Party before going into exile in the 1970s .
He worked for decades as an agent for American and British intelligence .
Throughout the 1990s , he took part in the CIA plots to engineer “ regime change ” and replace Hussein with a more amenable dictator .
In 2002 and 2003 , he endorsed and helped disseminate the lies about “ weapons of mass destruction ” used to justify the invasion .
Allawi ’s stated position since 2003 has been “ security first , democracy second ” .
In June 2004 , he was installed by the US as the unelected “ interim prime minister ” .
His main role was to sanction the brutal suppression of a Shiite militia rebellion in Najaf and Sunni resistance in Fallujah .
He was accused of personally executing six detainees alleged to be insurgents .
His dictatorial tendencies earned him the nickname “ Saddam without the moustache ” .
To win votes , Allawi appealed to Sunni and secular grievances against Shiite fundamentalist and Kurdish domination .
Since last month ’s ballot , he has threatened that his supporters will take up arms if he is sidelined from the next government .
Maliki , an exiled leader of the Shiite fundamentalist Da’wa Party , returned to Iraq in 2003 and quickly allied himself with the US occupation .
He was elevated to prime minister in 2006 as a compromise amid bitter factional wrangling .
He has built up a base of support in the country ’s US - created military and urged on the crushing of anti-occupation Shiite militias that previously controlled much of Basra and Baghdad .
His State of Law coalition has used US backing and money to establish itself as the dominant faction in the oil - rich Shiite south , at the expense of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq and the Sadrist movement loyal to cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
In an attempt to cling to power , Maliki ’s supporters claimed that Allawi and Iraqiya were a stalking horse for the ousted Sunni - dominated Baathist regime .
Attempts were made to disqualify Iraqiya candidates for their past Baathist associations .
Allawi and his supporters denounced these moves in sectarian terms as being the machinations of Iran ’s Shiite regime .
Neither Allawi nor Maliki , however , can form a government without making deals with other ethnic and sectarian factions .
The communalism that dominates Iraqi politics has been consciously fomented by the US .
Since 2003 , American imperialism has played one faction off against another , confident that they are all utterly dependent on US patronage .
Each is competing for privileged positions in the state apparatus and a share of the country ’s only significant source of wealth — the oil industry .
Oil production makes up 75 percent of gross domestic product and close to 90 percent of government revenue .
Behind the scenes , the US embassy and military are undoubtedly pressing Allawi and Maliki to make the compromises necessary to quickly form a government suited to Washington ’s requirements .
Hinting at the pressure being brought to bear , the Iraqi newspaper Azzaman claimed on April 1 that there “ have been reports that the US might eventually support a military coup if the politicians fail to mend fences and form a national unity government ” .
The Obama administration is currently in the process of reducing US troop numbers in Iraq to 50,000 by August 31 , to free up personnel and hardware for the escalating war in Afghanistan .
Its interest in Iraq is not democracy but a puppet government that can hold the country together and prevent any disruption to the primary objectives of US imperialism — opening up the oil industry to greater foreign ownership and control , and maintaining access to the large military bases it has constructed .
The democratic will of the long - suffering Iraqi people will play no role in forming such a regime .

This blog post is a little recipe to do a Debian migration for a node using Puppet and some other good practices .
We do all the following commands as root , which on of the exceptional situation where you should have a real root session ( login through console , or su -) .
I tend to avoid using the X server while doing an upgrade , so my ' best ' setup is to have a laptop to take note and check things on the internet and a session to the computer to upgrade ( ssh + su - or login as root into console ) .
In both case , I use screen during the upgrade so that I can handle disconnection .
Create or update your admin-syscheck script
First of all , a good practice is to have a script that runs various test on the system that checks everything is ok .
This is not only for upgrade but in general .
But in the case of upgrade , it can be particularly useful .
I call this script admin-syscheck .
This is a simple bash script .
This script check various aspect of the system and serve me as my external worker to check the most advanced knowledge I have gathered about setting up a service .
For example , I know that having *. bak or *.dpkg - dist in /etc / means that something needs to be merged and a file should be deleted .
Another example is about setting up the right alias for 127.0.0.1 and ::1 ( which you can differentiate using getent ahostsv4 and getent ahosts v6 ) .
I have packaged this script and distributed it using a specific apt - get repository .
You can just distribute it using puppet .
I recommend to run it daily to track changes ( e.g. after an apt - get dist - upgrade ) and to check that my setup is aligned with my most up - to - date knowledge about setting up a service ( i.e. this is my external worker ) .
In our case we are interested in checking presence of old and new configuration files , before and after upgrading .
Here is this specific section of my script :
if !
$ IS_ROOT ; then warning " Not trying to detect dpkg leftover file in /etc / . " else LEFTOVER_FILES=( $ ( find /etc/ \ - name " *.dpkg - dist " -o \ - name " *.dpkg- old " -o \ - name " *.ucf- old " -o \ - name " *.ucf - dist " -o \ - name " *. bak " ) ) for i in " $ {LEFTOVER_FILES [ @]} " ; do if [ " $ i " = " /etc/hosts.deny.purge.bak " ] ; then continue fi if $ fix ; then BASE =$ {i %.*} cond_exec vim -d $ BASE $ i read -p " Delete $ i ( y / N ) ? " ans if [ " $ ans " = " y " ] ; then cond_exec rm $ i fi else report_error " dpkg leftover file : ' $ i '. " fi done fi
( cond_exec allows to do a dry run , you can just remove it ) .
Setting $ fix to true will spawn a vim -d old new command where you can edit and then delete the leftover file .
This is extremly handy .
Upgrading to Wheezy
I strongly recommend to read first the upgrade chapter of the release notes .
This gives you a more complete overview of the upgrade procedure .
I just go through the basic step here .
1. Update everything on the system :
$ > apt - get update $ > apt - get dist - upgrade
2. Check that the current configuration apply cleanly :
$ > puppet agent -- test
3. Run admin-syscheck :
$> admin-syscheck
And fix all the problems .
4. Disable puppet :
I use a cronjob to run puppet , so I just comment the line for the job ( /etc/cron.d/puppet-custom ) .
You should disable puppet by stopping the daemon and preventing it to run by editing / etc / default / puppet and set START=no .
4 . Fix your sources and pinning :
Change squeeze to wheezy in /etc/apt/sources.list and remove useless files in /etc/apt/sources.lists .d/.
( You may keep certain sources that refers to stable , like google - chrome.list ) .
$ > rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* # Check if this ok to do this with your system .
Although , I tend to fully purge / etc / apt / sources .
list expect for the main line ( removing backports and security is fine for a short time ) .
The first run of puppet after upgrade will anyway reset this file .
$ > rm /etc/apt/preferences.d/* # ( at least the ones that do pin some version )
You can although remove all pinning from / etc / apt / preferences .
5 . Now you start the real upgrade :
$ > apt - get update $ > apt - get dist - upgrade
6 . During the upgrade you will be asked if you want to keep old configuration files or install the newer one from the maintainer .
I have always wondered what to answer to this .
But here is the answer after a few major upgrade : always install configuration files from maintainer if the service has no ultra-specific settings that could break during the upgrade .
The only file , that I should not upgrade on my system , is /etc / sudoers .
In this very specific case , you need to make sure before the upgrade that the old and new configuration can coexist .
In the squeeze to wheezy case , I have just setup a few extra augeas rules to set the secure_path before the upgrade and it was fine .
This is typically the kind of situation where you are thankful to have a real root session .
7 . The upgrade can be long and require various fixing to remove / re-add packages to circumvent problems .
At the end you will have a set of file *.dpkg - old and *.ucf - old ( and some *.dpkg - dist and *.ucf - dist ) .
The *- old files are your old version of the file , while the corresponding files match the maintainer version of it .
The *- dist files are the maintainer version of the file and the corresponding files match your old version of it .
Starting from here you have 2 options :
This is one of the first computer you upgrade , go to ' first upgrade ' .
Your puppet configuration for wheezy is already bullet proof , go to ' further upgrade ' .
First upgrade
This is the tricky part , you 'll have to spend a little time on it :
1 . Go over all *.{ucf , dpkg} - {old , dist} and merge them with the corresponding configuration file .
Use admin-syscheck with fix=true
2 . Make a copy of your /etc directory into /etc.new :
$ > cp -rp /etc /etc.new
3 . Run puppet again :
$ > puppet agent -- test
4. Disable again the automatic run of puppet , if the previous command has re-enabled it .
5 . Make a diff between /etc and /etc.new .
Since you have a run of puppet , you know what has changed and should not have changed .
$ > diff - Nurd /etc.new /etc
Everytime you find some files that does n't match your expectation for the upgrade with puppet , change the corresponding puppet manifest to have what you expect .
For example , if this is a file :
if ( $ lsbdistcodename == ' wheezy ' ) { file { " /etc/foo " : source => " puppet:///files/foo.wheezy " } } else { file { " /etc/foo " : source => " puppet:///files/foo.squeeze " } }
People working with augeas and puppet , will appreciate the fact that they probably have 0 changes to make for this to work ( since it only does a few replacement in configuration files ) .
6 . Once you are happy with the changes , copy back / etc.new to /etc and go to step 3 until the difference is almost 0 .
7. Re-enable automatic run of puppet .
Do this procedure for a least each computer category you have ( e.g. Desktop and Server nodes ) .
Once you are fully confident your new puppet setup works , you will be able to use ' further upgrade ' for the other nodes .
Further upgrade .
This one is super easy compare to a first upgrade :
1. Re-enable puppet and have it run at least once :
$ > puppet agent -- test
2. Merge *.{dpkg , ucf} - {dist , old} with corresponding files ( you can run admin- syscheck with fix=true ) .
This is mostly a sanity check since you should have already solved most problem with the ' first upgrade ' procedure .
That 's it .
Enjoy your upgrade to Wheezy with puppet .
If you are an atheist living in a predominately religious location , chances are good that you sometimes feel alone .
This is even more likely if you are surrounded by religious fundamentalists , if you are unable to be open about your atheism , and / or if you do not have access to other atheists in your day - to - day life .
I think that most of us in these situations feel alone at times .
But it is important to recognize that we are not alone .
This is one of the reasons I 've always applauded efforts to remind those who do not believe in gods that they are not alone , whether they take the form of billboards , letters appearing in newspapers , or Internet - based campaigns .
We are not alone , and it can be helpful to remember that .
In the days before the Internet , it was easy to feel alone as an atheist living in a small town in the U.S.
I remember those feelings well , and they are not fond memories .
Far more effort and perhaps even a bit of luck was needed to obtain even a temporary reprieve from thinking I might be the only person who did n't believe in gods .
Today , active online communities of atheists are easy to find .
They provide atheists who do not have other atheists in their lives with an easy way to interact with other atheists and to learn about atheism .
Is it any surprise that the religious landscape of the U.S. is changing as a result ?
It is true that having to rely on online communities rather than real face - to - face communities is less than ideal .
To see why , we might ask ourselves what the point is of belonging to a " faith community " such as a church congregation ?
There are probably many valid answers , but I suspect that the primary one is captured in the idea of belonging itself .
Humans are social creatures , and while we vary greatly with respect to our social needs , most people seem to value belonging to a group .
Not only do these faith communities help people meet their social needs , but they meet many other needs as well .
One powerful example is that these communities reinforce members ' shared values .
Most atheists do not have communities like this .
Some atheists have crafted effective substitutes , but few can provide the sort of all - encompassing social , emotional , ideological , practical functions met by membership in a faith community .
When we hear from atheists who say they miss church , this is likely the sort of thing they are referring to .
It should not be surprising that many atheists are interested in connecting with other atheists .
And while online connections may not be ideal , they are far better than nothing .
Connecting with Atheists Online
If you are an atheist who has been feeling alone and you are interested in interacting with other atheists online , I am going to recommend two options .
There are many others , but the two I am going to recommend are free , easy to access , and so popular that you will have as many atheists at your disposal as you could want .
They make it harder to feel alone .
Reddit
The atheism subreddit you will find at Reddit is massive in size and very active .
While you will encounter some link posts , you will see far more text posts .
Users share all sorts of interesting things , and others comment on them .
If you have questions about how other atheists deal with certain situations , this is a great place to get lots of input .
And if you are the sort of person who likes to be helpful to others by sharing your experience through comments , you will have countless opportunities to do so here .
One of the things that stands out to be about this subreddit every time I visit it is how many atheists are out there struggling with strong emotions prompted by difficult situations .
It can be depressing at times because you will hear story after story of religious bigotry , intolerance , and hate .
But it can also be encouraging because you will see atheists reaching out to one another in many different ways .
It wo n't always feel like a community , but I think that 's what it ultimately is .
A very large and diverse community that will remind you that there are many atheists out there and that we do not necessarily have much in common besides our lack of god -belief .
Twitter
This may seem like a strange recommendation given all the complaints you 've probably seen about Twitter , but this is another easy route to a large global community of atheists .
Unlike Reddit where you post or comment and wait for others to chime in , Twitter requires a bit more effort initially .
After setting up your profile , you look for atheists to follow .
The #atheism hashtag is a great place to start but may be overwhelming due to the volume you will encounter .
Look for accounts focused on atheism and take a look at who they are following .
As you find people to follow , recognize that you are shaping the sort of experience you will have on Twitter .
As you use Twitter , you will discover that you have followed many people who are not worth following .
Unfollow them and add others to improve your experience .
You may have to wade through lots of garbage , but you will find inspiring atheists who are very much worth your time .
Some will be as interested in interacting with you as you are in interacting with them .

The Iron Man 2 soundtrack is going to be all AC / DC , all the time , but that still leaves the score , and that is going to be handled by none other than Tom Morello , reports Metal Insider .
Vigilant viewers will know that Morello made a cameo in the first Iron Man as a terrorist , so his Iron Man bonafides are no joke .
Morello is working with composer John Debney on the score , and presumably will be finished soon , since the movie is due out on May 7 .
They are really working hard to draw the headbangers in for this one .
At least it ’s more noble an effort than Spiderman 3 ’s effort to connect with cool people :

More details have come to light in the case of the Lower Merion School District spying on its students with covert laptop webcam software .
The school district of the affluent Philadelphia suburb issued mandatory laptops to its students , each one loaded with software that could covertly activate the laptops ' webcams , supposedly as a security measure to help recover stolen laptops ) .
Students were required to carry and use the laptops , forbidden from using their own computers in school , and prohibited from modifying the software on their machines .
The school claims that it only activated the webcam spying software on rare occasions , but this is contested by parents .
One student , Blake Robbins , was called in for a disciplinary meeting for " popping pills " while at home ( Robbins says he was eating Mike & Ike 's candies ) .
The revelation that the school had been watching him remotely resulted in a parent lawsuit .
Now , the parents ' lawyer says that " thousands " of covert photos and screenshots were taken in students ' homes .
These photos included students in various states of undress , sleeping , and partaking in other private activities .
Shown below , a photo of Blake Robbins sleeping , covertly captured by his school laptop , released by the family 's lawyer .
" Discovery to date has now revealed that thousands of webcam pictures and screen shots ( .pdf ) have been taken from numerous other students in their homes , many of which never reported their laptops lost or missing , " attorney Mark Haltzman wrote in a Thursday federal court filing …
The lawsuit said the administrator , who has been placed on paid leave , " invokes the Fifth Amendment to every question asked of her , including a question asked as to whether she had ever downloading ( sic ) pictures to her own computer , including pictures of students who were naked while in their home . "
In February , the Lower Merion School District deactivated the webcam - tracking program secretly lodged on 2,300 student laptops .

If you are really good at what you do , you have a problem .
Some of your peers are gunning for you — not to beat you by outperforming you , but by taking you down or out .
To understand why , you would be wise to know the story of Jaime Escalante .
Jaime [ HIGHmay ] Escalante died of cancer on March 30 .
If you ever saw the HBO movie , Stand and Deliver , you know who he was .
If you have not seen it , you probably do n’t know .
He was a mathematics teacher in a Los Angeles high school from 1974 to 1991 .
The school was Garfield High .
It had nothing going for it in 1974 , either athletically or academically .
It was in East Los Angeles , in what was functionally an Hispanic barrio .
When he arrived , there was no course in calculus .
The school was about to lose its accreditation .
It was arguably the worst school academically in the state , or close to it .
By the time he left , it was the # 3 school in the United States for the number of students enrolled in the Advanced Placement program for calculus .
By then , there were almost 600 students enrolled in various AP courses , not just calculus .
One man ’s presence produced that change .
This is the enormous power of one . . . for a time .
But then the law of large numbers reasserted itself : regression to the mean .
HBO broadcast the movie in 1988 .
He resigned out of frustration in 1991 .
He grew tired of the resentment of other teachers , who regarded him as a prima donna , which he surely was .
Today , there are few students enrolled in AP courses at Garfield .
It is no longer the best tax - funded high school in California to study for the AP exam in calculus .
HOW DID HE DO IT ?
He was an immigrant from Bolivia .
He had taught school in Bolivia , but he was legally unqualified to teach in the United States .
He could not speak English .
He got a job as a bus boy in a restaurant .
Within six months , he was the head cook .
He was that kind of man .
He enrolled in a local community college .
With scholarship aid and a day job with Burroughs , he graduated in mathematics from a four - year school .
He still wanted to teach .
So , he quit his job and applied for a position in the Los Angeles Unified School District .
He was sent to Garfield .
This made sense .
He spoke Spanish .
He was a new teacher .
Garfield was not on any new teacher ’s list as the preferred school .
So , he wound up in a school where there was no advanced mathematics training .
He was not content with this arrangement .
He was able to add courses on more advanced math .
He called mathematics the great equalizer .
It does not care what your social background is .
It does not care what language you speak .
It is objective .
Either you get the answer correctly or you do n’t .
He told them they could go to college .
“ I ’ll teach you math and that ’s your language .
With that you ’re going to make it .
You ’re going to college and sit in the first row , not the back , because you ’re going to know more than anybody . ”
He persuaded students that they were the best .
This comes out clearly in the movie .
He pushed them , he manipulated them , he sometimes humiliated them , but he got them to take his class .
They showed up before school began .
They stayed after school .
They came to class on Saturdays .
They came to summer school .
They worked harder than students in their peer group , and I do n’t mean just in East L.A .
I mean the whole age group .
They worked like the children of Asian immigrants .
They also scored like the children of Asian immigrants .
Year after year , more of his students passed the AP .
This was considered impossible — not genetically , but socially and culturally .
Escalante said that what students needed was desire — “ ganas , ” in Spanish .
They needed a challenge , and he was going to give it to them .
He did , year after year .
Word got out to sophomores .
( There are no freshmen in Los Angeles City schools ; it is a three - year program . )
If they wanted in to Escalante ’s AP class , they had to work like mad in the first two years of math .
They started doing this .
It was a badge of honor to get accepted into his calculus class .
He was a hard - nosed disciplinarian .
He would not tolerate second - best from known bright students .
He threw them out .
But he did whatever he could to help not - so - bright students who worked hard to pass his class .
This is the way great teachers have taught from the beginning of time .
This is the way students master the material .
To get his reputation as a great teacher , he must first become a salesman .
He must persuade students to work harder than their peers .
He must keep them motivated to persevere .
This is not easy in the early stages of a teacher ’s career .
When the buzz gets going , and students perceive that they will gain respect from peers and adults for having persevered , the dynamics change .
It is not so difficult to sell students on the benefits .
But in the early phases of a career , it is no picnic .
The teacher must persevere .
The movie shows the dynamics of the faculty .
Escalante was not welcomed with open arms .
He said later that the movie was 10 % dramatic fiction and 90 % accurate .
I suspect that the movie ’s chairwoman of the department was not so bad in real life as the movie portrays .
I hope not .
She expressed fear that the students would fail .
They did not need another failure .
Escalante countered that students will rise to a challenge .
He proved his point .
ENVY
His big institutional problem was envy .
This is the desire to pull down a high achiever .
It was a factor in the faculty .
Every institution suffers from envy .
The question is this :
How can the system be designed to restrict it ?
Here is the institutional problem .
If someone is hired who is a spectacular performer , he exposes the other members as time - serving hacks .
On the other hand , if a new employee is substandard , word may get out .
The next layer up in the system may ask : “ How did this person get through the screening process ? ”
That is a huge risk .
Officials in the next layer up may decide to interfere with the sieve - like lower level .
Every institution wants two things : ( 1 ) more autonomy ; ( 2 ) more money .
A threat to its autonomy is a major threat .
What is the reaction ?
Unofficially , the screeners opt for mediocrity .
They do n’t hire the obvious winners or losers .
If a loser gets through the barrier , the outfit does not renew his contract .
But what to do with a winner ?
That is the problem .
Fire him , and the administration may look into what is going on .
That must be avoided at all costs .
So , the goal is to get him to quit .
The pressure is informal .
It must not be traceable by the administration .
But it is real .
In 1991 , the informal pressure persuaded Escalante to quit .
His assistant also quit .
A few years later , his replacement quit .
The result was a deterioration of the overall academic program .
This is standard operating procedure .
It is true in every area of life .
The phenomenon has a name : regression to the mean .
When any institution is driven forward by what is either a random factor or a statistically unlikely factor , it must adjust .
Performance rises .
But there are inherent institutional pressures to drive performance back to the status quo ante .
What prevailed before reasserts itself .
To keep this from happening , there must be institutional factors that raise the level of performance .
These factors will be resisted by most participants .
We all want more for less .
We want our income without having to improve performance .
This is a fact of human nature .
It is a fundamental law of economics .
The problem comes when someone shows up whose goal is more , and who is willing to pay the price to get it .
He enters the market and begins raising the standard of performance .
Why should he expect applause from the existing suppliers of the service ?
Escalante got negative feedback from some parents .
This is in the movie .
This is the plight of every great teacher .
The parents do not always want to be shown up by their children .
The children may get big heads , meaning big dreams .
The students are already moving out from under parents ’ authority , if not actual control .
The children may choose not to enter the family business , which still exists in the barrio .
Escalante showed up and taught students , “ You are the best . ”
The ones who believed him moved up and out .
In interviewing his former students , several reporters said that the graduates said that his class had made them whatever they are today .
Some of them took no more math classes in college .
But he had persuaded them that they could perform at a far higher level than they had known .
They also said they never had to work that hard in college .
They got out of East L.A .
INCENTIVES
To overcome institutional lethargy there must be incentives .
If the system operates in terms of tenure , seniority , or trade union rules , the negative sanction of getting fired is removed .
At that point , only positive sanctions motivate people .
Systems that operate in terms of tenure or seniority tend to remove wage sanctions .
He who stays employed automatically gets raises .
Performance does not matter .
So , the pay system operates in parallel with the screening system .
Both reveal regression to the mean .
Then the mean declines : institutional entropy .
The tax - funded K - 12 school system is dominated by the teachers ’ union .
When Escalante taught 50 students in a class , the union objected .
The most effective teacher I had in high school taught civics .
He refused to use the time - honored technique of having all students face the blackboard .
He made us move the desks into a horseshoe layout , two desks deep .
He would often walk up and down the interior space , asking questions and lecturing .
There were 30 + students in class in my era .
He once offered the school this deal .
Hire two low - paid assistants , and he would teach 150 students in a class .
This would have meant that he would teach the entire senior class of 450 students for the equivalent of two full - time salaries , and he would do it in three hours a day .
He would then get the rest of the day off .
You can imagine what the response was .
Thanks , but no thanks .
The three - time New York City teacher of the year , and one - time state teacher of the year , John Taylor Gatto , had a similar experience to Escalante’s .
He finally gave up .
He quit .
He has been a tireless advocate of private schooling ever since .
Visit his site .
Read his free book , The Underground History of American Education .
The only way to generate increased performance is to structure the incentive system in such a way that the mean is raised .
This means abolishing tenure and seniority , thereby removing the safety net for failure .
Then find ways to give the best performers a piece of the economic action for increased productivity .
If a man can increase the institution ’s net income , give him a larger percentage of this when his output increases .
This is the reverse incentive system of the graduated income tax , which is a disincentive system .
We understand this economic incentive system when it comes to business , yet most people fail to understand it in the field of education .
They have been taught by bureaucrats in the tax - funded education system that profit - seeking schools are antithetical to education .
The University of Phoenix has 500,000 students enrolled today who think the conventional view is wrong .
What makes the difference ?
The University of Phoenix is owned by investors who profit when the school profits .
They lose when the school loses .
This raises price tag on envy .
It raises the price tag on regression to the mean .
A law of economics takes over : “ When price rises , less is demanded . ”
CONCLUSION
The story of Jaime Escalante is inspirational , 1974 to 1991 .
It is depressing thereafter .
He proved that one man can achieve enormous success in changing the lives of young people .
It also shows that the incentive system of the tax - funded educational Establishment can overcome the efforts of such a man .
In contrast is the story of Marva Collins , who quit the Chicago schools in frustration and started her own school in the upstairs of her home in 1975 .
There was a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie about her amazing success : The Marva Collins Story ( 1981 ) .
It starred Cicely Tyson and the then - unknown Morgan Freeman .
It is every bit as inspirational as Stand and Deliver .
The difference is , her school , in the ghetto of Chicago , is still flourishing .
Garfield High School is not .
The Wikipedia entry for her reveals the following .
“ During the 2006 — 2007 school year , Collins ’ school charged $ 5,500 for tuition , and parents said the school did a much better job than the Chicago public school system .
Meanwhile , during the 2007 — 2008 year , Chicago public school officials claimed that their budget of $ 11,300 per student was not enough . ”
Incentives matter .
Ownership matters .
There will always be regression to the mean .
The # 1 goal should be to raise the mean .
That ’s the nice thing to do . . . for consumers .

Cicero tells a story about a raggedy and no doubt vicious pirate who was dragged before Alexander the Great .
The conqueror asked the pirate by what right or warrant he infested the seas with his little ship .
The pirate was something of a philosopher , says Cicero , and an uninhibitedly insolent philosopher ( a type too rare in modern times ) .
As St Augustine later retold Cicero ’s story , the pirate replied , " The same right as yours , in infesting the earth !
But because I do it with a tiny craft , I ’m called a pirate : because you have a mighty navy , you ’re called an emperor . "
St Augustine used the story of the pirate and the conqueror to ask , " Remove justice , and what are kingdoms but gangs of criminals on a large scale ? " .
If a villainous gang can acquire enough territory and subdue enough people , the gang is given the title of state and the status of impunity .
If the head of a criminal gang can somehow acquire the title of ruler , his actions become immune to prosecution .
The doctrine of sovereign immunity to which the pirate was alluding has , however , been greatly eroded since its high point in the theory and practice of the medieval papacy .
As applied to states , the doctrine has also been subject to serious challenges in the last 60 years in terms of international law and human rights protections .
The heart of what justice now protects is not the standing and privileges of the rulers of the world , but the dignity of the human person .
That states and their officials and their citizens continue to engage in widespread violation of that dignity would , of course , only be denied by a fool .
But there are very few people now who will openly and publicly praise such acts , least of all when they are directed at the weakest and most vulnerable , such as children .
There are many more people , however , who offer excuses for these acts , or seek to cover up their commission .
Allegations have been made and evidence has been offered that among those people is Pope Benedict XVI .
It is against this background that Geoffrey Robertson has suggested that the Pope could be prosecuted in the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) for crimes against humanity .
Robertson notes that the ICC statute counts rape as a crime against humanity , along with other forms of grave sexual violation .
Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins have instructed a team of lawyers , which reportedly includes Robertson , to prepare a case for when the Pope visits England later this year .
Hitchens and Dawkins separately point to Benedict ’s role in the cover - up of abuse , as well as his having institutional responsibility as head of the Catholic Church .
There is some dispute as to whether the Pope may claim immunity to prosecution or civil suit in these matters , whether in terms of sovereign or head of state immunity .
In which forums such immunity might apply is not settled either .
What is not in dispute , however , is the legitimacy of making a case for those proceedings .
To ridicule the making of such a case as a " stunt " or " undignified " is but one more attempt to deny justice to what has been established by both perpetrators and victims as terrible instances of violation , which flout civil as well as religious law .
Those who claim a wrong has been done , and on the basis of largely undisputed evidence , have a right to be heard at law , and to apply for redress — just as those who are accused of the wrong also have a right to due process of law .
When those claims are heard , however , it is important to be clear about what counts as a relevant explanation , or an excuse .
Much has been made of the connection of the rule of celibacy with the commission of acts of violation of children by priests .
In a widely circulated article in the New York Review of Books , for example , Hans Küng has argued that " the rule that Catholic priests must be celibate is responsible for the crisis in the Church " .
Küng is a prominent Catholic priest whose authority to teach theology has been rescinded .
He argues that " free and open discussion of the rule of celibacy " should now be permitted in the Church as " reparation for the abuse that has taken place " .
There is certainly a discussion to be held on the causes of the sexual violation of children , and of the reasons for its institutional cover - up .
But the idea that the rule of celibacy has responsibility here , in the sense that its discussion should form part of a reparation for abuse , is nonsense .
It is commonly repeated nonsense , however , even at the highest levels of law and justice .
Take for example the case of Vincent Gerard Ryan , who pleaded guilty to many acts of sexual assault against young boys over a long period when he was a priest in Newcastle .
Ryan appealed his sentence as it did not take into account evidence of his " character , reputation , positive works and achievements " .
Ryan appeared to claim that his holding and discharge of a position of trust was a defence to his abuse of that position .
When Ryan sought leave to appeal at the High Court , Justice Kirby raised the question of whether Ryan was " a situational paedophile " , given that " he was in a situation where he was denied marriage , denied ordinary human contact and he then committed impermissible and criminal acts " .
Such considerations about the rule of celibacy have no place in explaining or assessing the wrong of sexual violation by priests .
And if Geoffrey Robertson ’s case goes forward , such considerations about celibacy should be seen as simply one more pathetic excuse .
Nuns also submitted to the rule of celibacy , and whatever other wrongs might have been committed by them , there is no suggestion that there was widespread paedophilia among nuns , situational or otherwise .
Indeed , perhaps it is the travails of masculinity , not the rule of celibacy , that should be acknowledged at any process that seeks to understand the sexual violation of children .

AS 2009 came to an end , the world 's most powerful governments demonstrated their determination to ignore the issue of climate change with their actions at the United Nations summit in Copenhagen -- even as we daily see further confirmation of impending climate chaos .
There is a growing body of literature addressing ways to confront this crisis -- from the decidedly tepid promotion of individual acts ( think Al Gore and calculating your individual carbon footprint ) to more radical and even revolutionary critiques .
John Bellamy Foster , editor of the socialist journal Monthly Review , released a book last year that compiles much of his writings on the environmental crisis from the past decade .
He includes essays outlining a Marxist approach to the environment , addressing the twin crises of the economy , and all the while illuminating the best climate science we have .
Foster argues that " the split between natural - physical science and social science ... has been one of the main alienated intellectual products of bourgeois society . "
By contrast , he says :
A region of melting permafrost north of the Hudson Bay in Canada ( Steve Jurvetson )
The ultimate strength of Marxist analysis has never resided chiefly in its economic crisis theory , nor even in its analysis of class struggle as such , but lies much deeper in its materialist conception of history , both human and natural -- understood , as this only truly can be , as a dialectical and endlessly contingent process .
Foster 's book does just this , combining the best in scientific thought with the necessary understanding of the social system we live under and its connection to our natural history .
He begins by laying out in broad strokes the havoc humanity is imparting on the planet , and thus our future .
Global climate change is n't the whole story , but rather one of the largest and all - encompassing challenges we face -- from the contamination of water and destruction of fisheries to nutrient degradation of the soil and extinction of species .
That said , Foster addresses the latest findings in climate science .
For instance , with arctic temperatures rising , new sources of climate - changing gases are entering the atmosphere .
The release of methane from the warming and melting of the permafrost in Arctic regions will speed up the process of global warming , as the temperatures rise and engage in a positive feedback cycle , with no clear end in sight .
Review : Books John Bellamy Foster , The Ecological Revolution : Making Peace with the Planet .
Monthly Review Press , 2009 , 328 pages , $ 17.95 .
Daily , we get further confirmation of this process -- for example , the journal Science reported last month that methane releases from the Arctic soils under the Siberian Sea are at higher levels than previously thought .
From the opening pages in which Foster argues that technology will be helpful in solving our environmental crisis , he also argues that technology alone can do no such thing .
Instead , we need a transformative social approach to the climate crisis .
He argues against those who would say capitalism can be " greened " : " Aside from technology , virtually nothing in the social organization of society will change in this vision .
The commitment to unlimited accumulation of capital and to an order that places artificially generated private wants over individual and social needs is unaltered . "
In order to begin developing new technology that is n't driven by the market and the profit motive , but rather by the need to create a sustainable world , people must first be freed by a social revolution that can harness humanity 's potential for just such a task .
THIS COLLECTION is a great introduction to eco-socialist ideas .
Readers will find a streamlined version of Foster 's argument , made in his previous book , Marx 's Ecology , that at the heart of Marx 's analysis and writings on capitalism is an understanding of the interconnected relationship between human civilization and the environment .
Foster shines a light on the origins of Marx 's ecological thinking from his doctoral writings on Epicurus .
Also included are essays arguing that the fight for socialism and environmental sustainability cannot be separated , and his writings on the origins of the environmental movement in the U.S. with the publishing of Rachel Carson 's Silent Spring .
The most compelling part of Foster 's historical work is how he illuminates the roots of " ecological thought " in unlikely places .
We are given a glimpse of the flourishing of scientific understanding in early Soviet history -- for example , in 1919 , the first nature preserve aimed at the scientific study of nature was established in the southern Urals of the USSR .
Foster also provides fascinating re-readings of iconic environmentalist figures .
Foster 's analysis of Rachel Carson takes as its starting point that she is " better understood if we recognize that she was not simply an isolated figure ... but was part of a larger revolt among scientists and left thinkers in the 1950s and 1960s arising initially from concerns over the effects of nuclear radiation . "
The environmental catastrophe that is war -- specifically for the control of oil -- is also covered in this book .
Readers are taken back to the " oil crisis " of 1970 and reminded that as of 2001 , U.S. oil production had fallen by 39 percent from the peak 1970 level .
Foster takes us through a basic lesson on the " peak oil " debate and leaves us with a clear understanding that the heart of the problem lies with U.S. imperialism , and its struggle to maintain its role as sole world superpower .
Similarly , an entire chapter is dedicated to the Pentagon 's climate change report , which confirms environmentalist and socialist views that the U.S. empire is n't concerned about human and ecological well - being so much as " The narrow objective ... to safeguard Fortress America at all costs . "
In this sense , the Pentagon is " concerned " about climate change because it will benefit them to be able to project " which countries are likely to be hit hardest ecologically , economically and socially , and thus will be propelled in the direction of war " in order to better prepare the U.S. war machine .
FOSTER MAKES the case , as he has done elsewhere , that environmental exploitation is a central part of Marx and Engels ' thinking on the contradictions of capitalism -- and that with the dawn of capitalism , there developed a " metabolic rift " between the nutrients being taken from the earth in the countryside and the dumping of great amounts of " waste " in the industrializing cities , where the working class was becoming concentrated in great numbers .
In an example relevant for anyone living in the U.S. today , Foster notes that the agricultural chemist Justus von Liebig , whose work Marx was familiar with , " observed that there were hundreds , sometimes thousands , of miles in the United States between the centers of grain production and their markets .
The constituent elements of the soil were , thus , shipped to locations far removed from their points of origin , making the reproduction of soil fertility that much more difficult . "
As Foster points out , " All life is based on metabolic processes between organisms and their environment , " so when this relationship is broken , ecological catastrophe ensues .
In relation to this argument , Foster makes a compelling case that Marx was a promoter of " sustainability . "
He quotes a letter from Marx , writing about what a sustainable world would look like : " [ S ] ocialized man , the associated producers , govern the human metabolism with nature in a rational way , bringing it under their collective control . "
Importantly , Foster addresses the debates within the Marxist tradition on whether environmental destruction will inherently cause economic crisis , and exactly how much ecological destruction figured into Marx and Engels ' analysis .
Foster explains the work of James O'Connor , a Marxist economist who pioneered the idea of " the second contradiction of capitalism . "
The idea is that the " first contradiction " is the economic contradiction arising from class inequality and the economic crisis generated by overproduction and " underconsumption . "
The " second contradiction " is that the pillaging of environmental inputs -- which in part generates capital , and thus profits -- ultimately destroys the very natural world on which capitalism depends for survival .
As Foster explains , " Capitalism as a world economy ... embodies a logic that accepts no boundaries on its own expansion and its exploitation of its environment .
The earth as a planet ... is by definition limited .
This is an absolute contradiction from which there is no earthly escape . "
O'Connor suggests that there is a natural limit past which capitalism cannot or will not pass .
Foster takes a different view -- as he writes :
We should not underestimate capitalism 's capacity to accumulate in the midst of the most blatant ecological destruction , to profit from environmental degradation and to continue to destroy the earth at the point of no return - - both for human society and for most of the worlds living species .
In other words , the dangers of a deepening ecological problem are all the more serious because the system does not have an internal ( or external ) regulatory mechanism that causes it to reorganize .
There is no ecological counterpart to the business cycle .
In other words , capitalism as a system of unpaid costs will lead to barbarism in the form of ecological collapse , unless there 's a movement for a different kind of system .
READERS WILL find interesting perspectives on these debates in eco-socialist circles around Marx 's understanding of environmental crisis and its relation to the contradictions and crises of capitalism .
Foster argues that Marx believed that a socialist society will need to regulate for sustainability .
He writes :
There is simply no indication anywhere in Marx 's writings that he believed a sustainable relation to the earth would come automatically with the transition to socialism .
Rather , he emphasized the need for planning in this area .
This brings us to the last section of his book , which is both the least developed and the least convincing .
While Foster ends by noting that " only through fundamental change at the center of the system [ can there be ] any genuine possibility of avoiding ultimate ecological destruction , " his focus of this last chapter is " alternatives " to the capitalist model , primarily in Latin America .
The alternatives he presents , though , including for Venezuela and Cuba , are very short on specifics .
One has to wonder how an economy based on oil wealth , as Venezuela 's is , can be a model for a sustainable society .
This is n't to say that the changes in Chávez 's Venezuela are n't to be applauded and understood as reforms .
But pointing to the model of state - run capitalism as genuine socialism -- instead of socialism from below , in which working people run society -- makes little sense after he spends the preceding 250 pages indicting the unplanned capitalist system .
It is a real problem for socialists today that there has been nearly a century of distorted ideas about what socialism is .
Foster makes this point in one paragraph , but unfortunately , that 's it .
There 's no attempt to expand on the need to begin a fight for a different kind of world , and an idea of socialism that 's different from the top - down version .
Foster 's book also has too few connections to actual struggles .
A better starting place might have been the fighting union traditions in much of Europe that won their share of environmental reforms .
One concrete example he raises that is worth considering is the case of the extensive urban agricultural programs in Cuba .
The necessity of feeding a society when oil is out of reach is no easy problem to solve .
Foster provides a glimpse of an urban agriculture system that does sustain Cuban society and that seems to bridge the gap between town and country .
But he does n't explore these questions in depth , and thus leaves unanswered the question of whether this can be a model for the rest of the world .
Ultimately , the book 's message is that we need to put an end to the profit system if we are to heal the " metabolic rift " that has been a product of capitalism .
Foster rightly argues :
Much of what we take as natural is the product of capitalism .
Indeed , we are brought up believing that capitalist market relations are more natural , more incontrovertible , than anything within nature .
It is this way of thinking that we have to break with , if we are to restore our relation to the earth .
That 's an argument for revolution - - a socialist and an ecological revolution on a worldwide scale .

At the moment , the lucky country is luckier than most .
With the Aussie dollar around the US$ 0.93 mark , its buying power is greater than the days before the Hawke / Keating government floated the dollar .
However , our friendly overseas IT suppliers must think that the currency is around US $ 0.63 , or are bashing Australia with the greed stick .
Let ’s look at the poster child of overprices : Apple .
A 21 ″ iMac has a base iPrice of A$ 1599 .
The US price for the same computer is US $ 1190 ( or A $ 1,285.91 , based on conversion rate from xe.com yesterday ) .
Ok , there is GST , which works out at A $ 145.37 ) .
And there are other compliance costs like superannuation , payroll tax , withholding tax et al .
However , the Australian price without GST still adds up to A$ 1453.63 , A$ 167.72 more than the equivalent US price in Australian dollars .
Now , Delimiter has also ranted previously on the price of Adobe Creative Suite 5 .
Here is another breakdown based on the exchange rate yesterday , 27 April .
US Price A$ 756.00
GST ( 10 percent ) A$ 86.94
Total A$ 842.94
Aust RRP A$ 1168.00
Aussie premium $ 325.06
Ouch !
Remember , the prices I am quoting are US retail pricing , which already has a profit margin built in .
Even being generous and granting half of the Australian premium to cover compliance , shipping , staff and marketing costs in Australia , there can be little argument supporting the overcharging that the Australians are paying .
So what is to prevent you buying overseas ?
With software , almost nothing .
Amazon will ship CS5 here for US $ 29.99 , making it a total cost as priced yesterday of A$ 787.77 ( a saving of A$ 380.23 ) .
When you add to this the fact there is no import duty payable on software , overseas buying becomes very attractive .
For hardware , it is more difficult .
Australia uses 240v alternating current or AC ( technically 230v with a +/- varience of 10 percent ) and has a national standard plug that only Argentina and New Zealand also use ( to see the wide plethora of electrical plugs , check out this Wikipedia article ) .
Anything that plugs into a USB port ( for example , an iPad ) will work fine out of the box .
But otherwise , some money will have to be spent getting power converters and plugs .
Finding a retailer willing to ship overseas may also be an issue .
Can companies charge an Aussie technology tax ?
Yes .
There is nothing illegal setting a high price here .
However , companies need to be aware that we are approaching a global market via the internet , global / bilateral trade agreements and common markets ( Europe , NAAFTA and AUS / NZ for examples ) .
Soon it will be harder to justify gouging for software , as competition from Amazon and online software retailers compete with Australian sellers with a better rate , and the age of digital downloads makes location meaningless .
Importing hardware will be harder , but not impossible .
An easy example is that someone goes to the US , buys 10 computers and ship them home via freight / post .
Assume a A$ 200 premium on each computer .
Looking at Flight Centre , the cheapest Sydney to Los Angeles flight is A$ 1034 ( plus taxes and charges ) .
So you could still save approximately $ 100 on each computer .
This will be even more attractive if Apple goes Aussie iGouging ™ and makes the price of the iPad stupidly high compared to US prices .
Another unintended consequence of an Aussie premium will be piracy .
When you can see a product being sold cheaper in another market , people may be less willing to pay the Aussie price .
So piracy in this case acts as a market correction , supplying the demand not being satisfied by the market price .
This , of course , will add to the cost of software ( and despite what software manufacturers say , a pirate copy does not equal one sale .
There will always be people unwilling to pay for software , and people willing to purchase software at lower prices who chose not to pay the price set by sellers .
This is first year economics ) .
What is your view on the Aussie technology tax ?
Have you found a way around it ?
Or do you pay it without any issues ?
Post your comments below , it will be interesting to see your thoughts on this matter .

BERLIN — An election on May 9 in Germany 's most populous state is complicating Europe 's attempt to resolve the Greek debt crisis quickly .
The election in the state of North Rhine - Westphalia could shift the balance of power in German politics , hampering the domestic political goals of Chancellor Angela Merkel 's center - right coalition .
Defeat ...
57 cents :
Total tax on a pack of cigarettes in Idaho , where the cost per pack is less than $ 5 .
$ 3 : Total tax on a pack of cigarettes in Washington state , an increase of $ 1 , which raises the cost per pack to about $ 8 .
Cigarettes soon will cost about $ 8 a pack as Washington legislators add another $ 1 in taxes .
The higher state taxes – which brings the total on every pack to $ 3 – is part of the recently adopted plan to raise $ 800 million and close the budget gap without cutting more programs and state jobs .
Some Spokane smokers say the legislation may turn them into scofflaws .
“ I just might have to start driving to Idaho , ” said Anna , who works in finance at a downtown Spokane business and asked that her last name not be disclosed .
She is miffed by the higher taxes on something she says she enjoys as a recreational activity .
“ The state is n’t interested in protecting my health , ” she said .
“ They just want my money .
It ’s unfair . ”
Other smokers say the latest sales tax hike unfairly targets the poor and minorities .
Data from the Spokane Regional Health District notes that while the adult smoking rates have dropped , the proportion of those who continue to light up is higher among the poor and less educated .
And despite years of education and thousands of dollars spent trying to curb youth smoking , the rate of young smokers had risen to 13 percent between 2004 and 2008 .
For Candice Lyons , cigarettes are a better vice than alcohol and drugs .
Lyons , who is in her 30s , is a recovering addict , homeless and unemployed .
“ I ’d like to quit , but right now , smoking helps me cope with the stress of just trying to get by , ” she said .
“ I already donate plasma just so we can get cigarettes . ”
Smokers have been banned from bars and restaurants , turned out of office buildings and now ca n’t puff within 25 feet of a door .
It ’s turned them into social pariahs , Lyons said .
Businesses that shun state rules are investigated , warned and ultimately fined .
The health district last month announced plans to add a part - time employee in anticipation of investigating an extra 40 complaints against businesses a month .
The law against smoking in public places has been in effect for five years and has dropped the number of workers exposed to secondhand smoke by 44 percent in Spokane County .
Anti-smoking laws and the higher taxes are part of the state ’s concerted effort to get people to stop smoking .
The legislation raising cigarette taxes has been sent to Gov. Chris Gregoire .
The bill would increase taxes on other goods such as cigars and chewing tobacco .
Democrats say the higher taxes may force people to quit smoking .
Republicans contend the bill may send people to other states to get their nicotine fix .
Just across the state line in Idaho , where the cigarette tax is about 57 cents a pack , stores offer cigarettes for less than $ 5 a pack .
Cigarettes brought into Washington from Idaho are considered contraband according to state law .
Outside a downtown Spokane bank building , an employee who did n’t want his name used because he said his wife does n’t know he smokes , wanted to know if smokers should be rewarded state privileges for their role in balancing the state budget and saving jobs .
“ We ’re waiting to hear , ” he said with a smile as he extinguished a cigarette on a wet sidewalk and then threw the butt into a trash can .
Which of these things is not like the others ?
McCain has never been a big proponent of gay marriages , gays in the military , gay adoptions or really anything gay .
But the one thing he does seem to be a fan of is the amateur gay site : Guys With iPhones .
So much so that he wanted to be a part of it .
The site features men , dressed and undressed , taking self portraits with one hand and often their cock in the other .
Unsurprisingly , McCain went with a more conservative approach – a rather serious looking suit .
That ’s ok McCain , sometimes baby steps are the way to go .
McCain ’s reps are already covering it up stating that the picture was actually one he posted on Twitter .
McCain ’s rep said :
“ As I ’m sure you are aware , once something is posted [ on the Internet ] we no longer have control of how the photo is used . ”
Seeing John McCain on Guys With iPhones just made our day .
Whether it was McCain or not , we applaud whoever posted the picture .

ARGUES IN KERCHNER VS .
OBAMA APPELLEE BRIEF THAT U.S. CONSTITUTION IS NOT THE LAW OF THE LAND
Legal Analysis by John Charlton
( March 9 , 2010 ) — Many U.S. Citizens have not awakened to the fact that the U.S.A. is no longer a Constitutional Republic , but a tyrannical state , overthrown from the very day Chief Justice Roberts administered the oath of office to the ineligible candidate , Barack Hussein Obama II .
Those in denial of this bitter political reality need look no further for the evidence of the paradigm shift in the minds of lawyers for the U.S. Department of Justice than the opposition brief filed by Tony West , Assistant Attorney General , Paul J. Fishman , U.S. Attorney , and Mark B. Stern and Eric Fleisig - Green , of the Appellate Staff Division of the DoJ , before the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Kerchner et al. vs. Obama & Congress .
The core of the Department of Justice ’s argument manifests in the clearest terms that they no longer hold the U.S. Constitution as the Supreme Law of the Land , but rather consider it merely as a theoretical construct , the violation of which harms no one in particular , on pp. 9 -10 ( Bold Face added ) :
Plaintiffs suggest that their injuries are analogous to those of states affected by global warming or individuals injured by government displays of religion .
See Pl. Br. 39 ( citing cases ) .
But none of plaintiffs ’ cited cases suggests that a mere interest in the proper application of the law , unaccompanied by more concrete consequences particular to a plaintiff , can serve as the basis of Article III standing .
See , e.g. , Massachusetts v. EPA , 549 U.S. 497 , 517 ( 2007 ) ( reinforcing that under Article III “ a litigant must demonstrate that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is either actual or imminent ” ) ; Suhre v. Haywood County , 131 F.3d 1083 , 1086 ( 4th Cir. 1997 ) ( “ [ A ] mere abstract objection to unconstitutional conduct is not sufficient to confer standing . ” ) ( cited at Pl. Br. 39 ) .
As a sworn upholder of the Constitution , Commander Kerchner is no longer a private citizen - per-se , but a Constitutional officer who is bound to uphold the Supreme Law of the Land against all enemies , foreign and domestic .
Considering that Obama holds foreign citizenship and has used his claim to U.S. Citizenship to enter into an office for which he is not eligible by the mere fact of holding British Citizenship from birth ( cf. our article , 4 Supreme Court Cases define “ natural born citizen ” ) , he is rightly considered both a foreign and a domestic enemy of the U.S. Constitution .
Considering that Commander Kerchner is duty - bound to defend the Constitution against such an enemy , his case and his appeal are perfectly lawful , right , and just , and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has a constitutional duty to hear the appeal and overturn the anarchical decision of Judge Jerome B. Simandle , who dismissed the case .
Furthermore , Kerchner , in being forced to accept an ineligible Commander - in - Chief by the action of the Joint Session of Congress on January 8 , 2009 when they selected an ineligible candidate to be U.S. President , is harmed directly and most intimately in his adhesion to the very Armed Forces which is duty - bound to uphold that Constitution .
If the violation of the U.S. Constitution ’s explicit , facial obligations for holding the office of the U.S. President is a crime which harms no one in particular and which thus presents no basis for a judicial review , then the Republic has been overthrown by the Chicago Mob , and there is no recourse left but ballots and armed counter - revolution .
By claiming such violation is no grounds for a case in Federal Court , the Department of Justice has publicly admitted that it accepts a political theory of usurpation and tyranny whereby a small coterie of individuals , controlling both parties , can overthrow the constitutional order of our Republic and nullify any constitutional restriction as long as they , and they alone , are unanimous in their action .
In other words , the Department of Justice has just confessed and admitted a theory of dictatorship of the few over the democratic rule by the People .
And that is the Politics of Tyrants .
The Third Circuit Court would be well - advised to consider that without a U.S. Armed Forces bound to a constitutionally eligible and respectful Commander - in - Chief , once they refuse to uphold the rights of members of the U.S. Military to contest the claims of such an illegitimate commander , they expose themselves to become the next victims of the use of such military force against the other branches of government : for if you render the military oath of no force or value before your court , you have declared that the armed forces are no longer are bound to uphold the U.S. Constitution in any term or obligation which that document declares .
It ’s a simple choice then : the Constitution or tyranny ; liberty or death !
Weird Binary
Imagine you are in charge of humanities search for extra terrestrials program .
One day , after scanning the skies , you find a signal .
The signal consists of a series of pulses , and after a little bit of work , you discover that they form an image 197×199 in size .
The image contains what looks like simple arithmetic .
However , no normal number - system seems to work .
101110 + 100100 = 100010
Welcome to the world of " weird binary " .
So what exactly is going on ?
It turns out that even though a number system can be based on two different symbols , it does n't have to be the traditional binary system we all know and love .
These new binary number systems have differing properties , and come with their own strengths and weaknesses .
So what defines a binary number system ?
Firstly we require two symbols .
Let us use " 0 " and " 1 " for simplicity .
We also require a place - based number system , which we will assume operates in the normal right - to - left increasing powers of a single base .
Note that we could imagine a left - to - right system , but that just corresponds to using the inverse of a right - to - left base , so does n't add anything new .
Once we have this , we can define a simple multiplication table ; anything multiplied by zero is zero , and 1×1=1 .
Similarly , addition by zero is idempotent .
Thus only 1+1=2 needs to be defined , since " 2 " does n't fit in our binary system .
By choosing different representations of the number 2 , we can define different binary number systems .
Thus by enumerating these choices we can see which weird binary systems exist .
Before we will proceed , it is nice to define a format for such numbers .
Unfortunately , the complexity of the addition operation will be quite large .
This is due to the carries being unlike those of normal binary numbers .
Thus , to simplify the carry calculation , we will provide an integer per bit .
Such a layout would look like the following in C : static void print_wb ( unsigned * x , int num_size ) { int i ; char c [ 2 ] = {' ' , ' 1'} ; for ( i = num_size - 1 ; i > 0 ; i--) { printf ( " %c " , c [ x [ i ] ] ) ; if ( x [ i ] == 1 ) c [ 0 ] = ' 0 ' ; } printf ( " %
c
" , x [ 0 ] + ' 0 ' ) ; } static void clear_wb ( unsigned * x , int num_size ) { memset( x , 0 , num_size * sizeof ( unsigned ) ) ; } static void copy_wb ( unsigned * x , unsigned *y , int num_size ) { memcpy (y , x , num_size * sizeof ( unsigned ) ) ; } static void carry_wb ( unsigned *x , int num_size , unsigned * add_spec , int add_spec_size ) { int i , j ; unsigned c ; for ( i = 0 ; i < num_size ; i++ ) { if ( x [ i ] <= 1 ) continue ; c = x [ i ] / 2 ; x [ i ] &= 1 ; for ( j = 0 ; ( j < add_spec_size ) && ( j < num_size - 1 - i ) ; j ++ ) { x[j + i + 1 ] += c * add_spec[j ] ; } } } static void add_wb ( unsigned *x , unsigned *y , int num_size , unsigned * add_spec , int add_spec_size ) { int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < num_size ; i++ ) { x [ i ] += y[ i ] ; } carry_wb( x , num_size , add_spec , add_spec_size ) ; } static void mult ( unsigned *x , unsigned *y , int num_size , unsigned * add_spec , int add_spec_size ) { int i , j ; unsigned t[ num_size ] ; for ( i = 0 ; i < num_size ; i++ ) { t[ i ] = x[ i ] ; x[ i ] = 0 ; } for ( i = 0 ; i < num_size ; i++) { if ( t [i ] ) { for ( j = 0 ; j < num_size ; j++ ) { if ( j + i > num_size ) break ; x[j + i ] += y[j ] ; } } } carry_wb( x , num_size , add_spec , add_spec_size ) ; }
The above has the form of the weird binary encoded in the value of the number 2 .
This specification is stored within the add_spec array , of size add_spec_size .
So long as the numbers are n't so large that the carries do n't overflow an unsigned integer , the above can be used to add and multiply arbitrary precision weird binary numbers .
To create weird binary numbers , we can use induction .
We know the value of one , and can then add it multiple times to obtain any natural number we require .
static void create_wb_natural ( unsigned *x , int num_size , unsigned * add_spec , int add_spec_size , int n ) { unsigned temp [ num_size ] ; unsigned temp2 [ num_size ] ; /* Clear values */ clear_wb( x , num_size ) ; clear_wb ( temp , num_size ) ; temp [ 0 ] = 1 ; /* Log2 ( n ) steps */ while ( n ) { /*
Is the current bit set ? */ if ( n & 1 ) add_wb( x , temp , num_size , add_spec , add_spec_size ) ; /*
Move to the next bit */ n = n / 2 ; /* Double the size of the thing to add */ copy_wb( temp , temp2 , num_size ) ; add_wb( temp , temp2 , num_size , add_spec , add_spec_size ) ; } } These C functions assume that the symbolic representation for the number two lies solely to the left of the radix point .
This means that carries only propagate to the left .
Allowing carries to propagate to the left and right simultaneously makes it rather difficult to construct an addition routine .
( In effect it is possible to make a linear cellular automata this way , and such things are subject to the halting problem . )
Of course , some cases are solvable .
i.e.
The case where 1+1=10.1 yields b+1/b=2 , and thus b=1 .
This base - one solution also appears in other situations , see the 1+1=11 case below .
1+1=0
The first possibility results in a rather boring number system .
In this system , addition works like the xor operator .
Multiplication still mixes number places together .
However , no carries take place , so all number positions operate as if they are alone with the " addition " step .
This system is somewhat useful in cryptography , and Intel has added the PCLMULQDQ instruction to perform this operation .
1+1=1
This number system is even less interesting , with addition acting like a logical - or .
Once you have a 1 , you can never remove it .
This means that negative numbers cannot exist in this system , since you can never add two non -zero numbers to get zero .
1+1=10 This is the traditional binary number system used in computers .
By using twos - complement arithmetic , we can represent negative numbers .
All normal mathematical operations work as you would expect in this system , ( unlike the previous two systems ) .
However , as you can see , this is n't the end of the story , as several more interesting binary systems exist .
1+1=x1
Any other binary system that defines two as ending with a 1 is problematic .
In such systems , you cannot form minus one .
( In other words , the equation 1 + y = 0 has no solution . )
This severely restricts the usefulness of such systems .
However , there is one system which is of note .
1+1=11 describes the " stick counting " system of natural numbers .
The more sticks you have , the larger the number .
The total number of sticks exactly corresponds to the number you have .
Another way of looking at this system , is saying that it is " base 1 " .
Unfortunately , working in base 1 is extremely inefficient , as the exponential savings in symbol compression do n't happen .
i.e. 999 only requires three symbols to write in decimal ... but would require 999 symbols in base 1 .
Since all the interesting systems will define two ending with a zero symbol , we can now evaluate what negative numbers are .
This can be done by first calculating what minus one is , and then multiplying that by the correct natural number .
static void find_m1 ( unsigned * m1 , int num_size , unsigned * add_spec , int add_spec_size ) { int i , j ; unsigned t[ num_size ] ; clear_wb ( m1 , num_size ) ; clear_wb(t , num_size ) ; x [ 0 ] = 1 ; for ( i = 0 ; i < add_spec_size ; i++) { if ( i + 1 > num_size ) break ; t[i + 1 ] = add_spec[i ] ; } for ( j = 1 ; j < num_size ; j++ ) { if ( ! t[j ] ) continue ; m 1 [ j ] = 1 ; for ( i = 0 ; i < add_spec_size ; i++) { if ( i + 1 + j > num_size ) break ; t[i + j + 1 ] += add_spec[i ] ; } carry_wb(t , num_size , add_spec , add_spec_size ) ; } } static void create_wb_integer ( unsigned *x , int num_size , unsigned * add_spec , int add_spec_size , int n , unsigned * m1 ) { /*
Are we a natural number ? */ if ( n >= 0 ) return create_wb_natural(x , num_size , add_spec , add_spec_size , n ) ; /* Negative number */ create_wb_natural(x , num_size , add_spec , add_spec_size , -n ) ; /* Multiply by minus one */ mult( x , m1 , num_size , add_spec , add_spec_size ) ; } 1+1=100 Using the above , we have b2=2 , where b is the base .
Thus , we find that the bases that satisfy this system are ± √2 .
This system thus can exactly store values proportional to the square root of two .
This comes at a cost , numbers written in this form are twice as large as in normal binary .
Normal binary can approximate the square root of two by including digits below the radix point .
By using enough digits , the error can be made as small as needed .
This means that this system is only really useful if exact calculations are required , and is n't really useful .
1+1=110
This system is defined by b2+b=2 , and thus b=1 , or b= - 2 .
It turns out that the b=1 solution is spurious , leaving the base = - 2 , or " negabinary " number system .
This number system is fairly well known .
See Knuth 's Art of Computer Programming , Seminumerical Algorithms for a discussion of its properties .
Since this case is very similar to normal binary , ( it is only the odd positions that vary ) , there exist some fast algorithms to convert from binary to negabinary and back .
There are also fast ways to add , multiply and divide these numbers .
Such numbers are more uniform than normal binary .
No twos - complement trick is required to represent negative numbers .
Thus there is no longer a difference between signed and unsigned multiplication .
A table of the representation of such numbers is : - 16 : 110000 - 15 : 110001 - 14 : 110110 - 13 : 110111 - 12 : 110100 - 11 : 110101 - 10 : 1010 - 9 : 1011 - 8 : 1000 - 7 : 1001 - 6 : 1110 - 5 : 1111 - 4 : 1100 - 3 : 1101 - 2 : 10 -1 : 11 0 : 0 1 : 1 2 : 110 3 : 111 4 : 100 5 : 101 6 : 11010 7 : 11011 8 : 11000 9 : 11001 10 : 11110 11 : 11111 12 : 11100 13 : 11101 14 : 10010 15 : 10011 16 : 10000 1+1=1000
This system is somewhat similar to the case where 1+1=100 .
It is a " fat binary " system , where there are multiple representations for the same numbers .
In this case , the base is the cubic root of two , instead of the square root .
The result is that numbers take three times as much space as normal .
Such a system is only useful if you need exact arithmetic with such numbers .
1+1=1010
This case has b3+b=2 , and has the following three solutions b=1 , b= ( - 1±i√7 ) / 2 .
The first base - one case is again spurious , leaving the two bases that are complex conjugates of each other .
These bases allow one to calculate complex arithmetic using a single binary string .
( The previous case also allowed complex solutions , but symmetry prevented them from being usefully different from the real case . )
Integers in this representation look like : - 16 : 101110000 - 15 : 101110001 - 14 : 101111010 - 13 : 101111011 - 12 : 101010100 - 11 : 101010101 - 10 : 101011110 - 9 : 101011111 - 8 : 101011000 - 7 : 101011001 - 6 : 100010 - 5 : 100011 - 4 : 111100 - 3 : 111101 - 2 : 110 -1 : 111 0 : 0 1 : 1 2 : 1010 3 : 1011 4 : 11100100 5 : 11100101 6 : 11101110 7 : 11101111 8 : 11101000 9 : 11101001 10 : 11100110010 11 : 11100110011 12 : 11001100 13 : 11001101 14 : 11100010110 15 : 11100010111 16 : 11100010000
Notice how the length of the numbers does n't increase monotonically as they increase away from zero .
This is due to the fact that the boundary of numbers of a given symbol length in this system is a fractal on the complex number plane : 1+1=1100
This case has b3+b2=2 , resulting in b = 1 , - 1±i .
Again , the base one solution is spurious .
The resulting systems are quite well known , and are often presumed as the only complex binary ones .
As can be seen by the previous case , this is n't so .
See the book " Hacker 's Delight " for a description , and the inverse problem of solving for the number two in these systems .
Integers in this representation are : - 16 : 1110100000000 - 15 : 1110100000001 - 14 : 1110100001100 - 13 : 1110100001101 - 12 : 11010000 - 11 : 11010001 - 10 : 11011100 - 9 : 11011101 - 8 : 11000000 - 7 : 11000001 - 6 : 11001100 - 5 : 11001101 - 4 : 10000 - 3 : 10001 - 2 : 11100 -1 : 11101 0 : 0 1 : 1 2 : 1100 3 : 1101 4 : 111010000 5 : 111010001 6 : 111011100 7 : 111011101 8 : 111000000 9 : 111000001 10 : 111001100 11 : 111001101 12 : 100010000 13 : 100010001 14 : 100011100 15 : 100011101 16 : 100000000
The symbol lengths for numbers in this system are increasing more rapidly than in the previous case .
This is due to the fact that the previous system in effect de-weights imaginary numbers by a factor of the square root of seven .
This weighting means that the previous system cannot exactly represent numbers such as the imaginary unit , i .
In exchange for the larger verbosity , the current system does n't suffer this problem .
Again , it turns out that the symbol lengths do not increase monotonically away from zero .
The numbers of a given length form a " Dragon Fractal " : 1+1=1110
This final case where the number two is represented by four symbols is n't particularly interesting .
The cubic equation for the base produces horribly messy solutions .
Only when you would like exact arithmetic with such a base would this system be better than others already discussed .
1+1=10000
This is yet another fat - binary case , where the base is the fourth root of two .
Other than that , it is uninteresting .
1+1=10010
This yields a quartic equation , which unfortunately produces messy solutions just like the 1+1=1110 case .
It is n't useful .
1+1=10100
This gives the equation b4+b2=2 , having the solution b= ±1 , ±i√2 .
Ignoring the non-imaginary solutions yields the interesting case of a pure - imaginary base .
( Which one of the two we choose does n't matter due to symmetry under complex conjugates . )
This number system is also mentioned in Knuth 's Art of Computer Programming , in where he states that its disadvantage over the - 1+i system is the fact that the complex unit is represented by an infinitely long non-repeating string .
However , if we use floating - point , then the small error introduced is usually ignorable .
This is especially true because this system has no trouble exactly representing integers : - 16 : 10100000000 - 15 : 10100000001 - 14 : 10100010100 - 13 : 10100010101 - 12 : 10100010000 - 11 : 10100010001 - 10 : 1000100 - 9 : 1000101 - 8 : 1000000 - 7 : 1000001 - 6 : 1010100 - 5 : 1010101 - 4 : 1010000 - 3 : 1010001 - 2 : 100 - 1 : 101 0 : 0 1 : 1 2 : 10100 3 : 10101 4 : 10000 5 : 10001 6 : 101000100 7 : 101000101 8 : 101000000 9 : 101000001 10 : 101010100 11 : 101010101 12 : 101010000 13 : 101010001 14 : 100000100 15 : 100000101 16 : 100000000
This complex number system technically is also fractal , but the system of nested rectangles is n't particularly complicated : 1+1=10110 ...
1+1=100010
These systems are again like 1110 and 10010 , except with quartic and quintic equations needing to be solved .
The resulting solutions are complex functions containing several nested roots , and as as result do not make very interesting bases .
1+1=101110
This case has b5+b3+b2+b=2 , which amongst its solutions has b= ( 1±i√7 ) / 2 .
Thus this case is very similar to that of 1+1=1010 , and has the integer table : - 16 : 110110000 - 15 : 110110001 - 14 : 101011110 - 13 : 101011111 - 12 : 101010100 - 11 : 101010101 - 10 : 101010010 - 9 : 101010011 - 8 : 101101000 - 7 : 101101001 - 6 : 101110110 - 5 : 101110111 - 4 : 1100 - 3 : 1101 - 2 : 1010 - 1 : 1011 0 : 0 1 : 1 2 : 101110 3 : 101111 4 : 100100 5 : 100101 6 : 100010 7 : 100011 8 : 1111000 9 : 1111001 10 : 10111000110 11 : 10111000111 12 : 101100011100 13 : 101100011101 14 : 101100011010 15 : 101100011011 16 : 101100010000

This is the base used by the aliens described in the introduction .
Their crazy mathematical statement is simply showing that 2+4=6 .
Creating complex numbers in weird binary
As was shown in the beginning , creating natural numbers is easy , induction can be used to create any number once we have the definition of the number two .
Integers can be created once we can evaluate what minus one is , which again only depends on the definition of the number two .
Unfortunately , complex numbers are n't so simple .
There , we need to know which of the possibly many solutions for the base we are using in order to obtain a value for the imaginary unit , i .
It turns out that the last number system described contains the identity i√7=1+b+ b2 , when b = ( 1+i√7 ) / 2 .
Thus we can simply divide by the square root of seven , and use induction again to evaluate any pure imaginary integer .
There is one other case though , the fact that the base includes the factor of 1 /2 means that this system also has half - integer complex numbers .
These can be created by adding or subtracting the base , and simplifying the problem into the integer case .
A C function which does this is : static void b_to_wb ( unsigned *x , int num_size , unsigned * add_spec , int add_spec_size , complex double n , unsigned * m1 ) { double r = creal ( n ) ; double im = cimag ( n ) ; double eps = 1e - 8 ; unsigned temp [ num_size ] ; unsigned imval [ num_size ] ; /* Clear output */ clear_wb( x , num_size ) ; clear_wb ( imval , num_size ) ; /*
Are we not an integer ? */ if ( fabs ( floor ( r + eps ) - r ) > eps ) { r += 0.5 ; im += 0.5 * sqrt ( 7.0 ) ; x [ 1 ] = 1 ; } /* Create real part */ create_wb_integer( temp , num_size , add_spec , add_spec_size , ( int ) r , m1 ) ; add_wb( x , temp , num_size , add_spec , add_spec_size ) ; /* Scale imaginary part */ im /= sqrt ( 7.0 ) ; imval [ 0 ] = 1 ; imval [ 1 ] = 1 ; imval [ 2 ] = 1 ; /* Create imaginary part */ create_wb_integer( temp , num_size , add_spec , add_spec_size , ( int ) im , m 1 ) ; mult ( temp , imval , num_size , add_spec , add_spec_size ) ; /* Combine real and imaginary parts */ add_wb( x , temp , num_size , add_spec , add_spec_size ) ; } For other weird binary bases , such as b= - 1+i , the procedure is somewhat different , especially in that case , where i can be represented exactly .
The reverse process , of converting a weird binary number back to binary is relatively simple .
We just add the relevant powers of the base .
C code that does this is : static complex double wb_to_b ( unsigned * x , int num_size , complex double base ) { int i ; complex double b = base ; complex double out = x [ 0 ] ; for ( i = 1 ; i < num_size ; i++) { out += b * x[ i ] ; b *= base ; } return out ; } Conclusion
Are there any other interesting bases for weird binary ?
It turns out that no , there are n't .
For a base to be interesting , its complex squared norm must be equal to two .
A pure imaginary base with this is the b=±i√2 , discussed above .
Similarly , there is the pure real case b=±√2 also described .
This leaves complex cases .
Normalizing , we have : b = [ ±1±i√ ( 2n2 - 1 ) ] / n
If we evaluate b2 , we have : b2=±[1-n2±i√ ( 2n2 -1 ) ] × 2/n2
We need 2 /n2 to be in lowest common terms to be a multiple of 1/n .
If this is n't the case , then we can never build a terminating expression that evaluates to be the number two .
The denominators will increase without limit as we increase the powers of the base , and no cancellation will occur .
To prevent that , n needs to be 1 or 2 .
If n is one , then we get b = ± 1 ±i , and if n is two , we obtain the other pure complex solutions ; b = ( ±1±i √ 7 ) / 2 .
So binary number systems can be quite complicated .
However , they unfortunately cannot represent quaternions or ocotonions due to the roots of polynomials being closed under the complex numbers .
But still , as can be seen , there are several complex binary number systems , some more well known than others .

Weird Binary
Shredder Chess for the iPad is a strong Chess program , capable of grandmaster play .
It has many nice features , but lacks just a little bit of UI refinement compared to , say , tChess Pro — previously reviewed .
The modern Chess playing engines have come a long way , helped considerably by three decades of tournament play and ever faster CPUs - which allow deeper ply searches .
As a result , the goal is no longer simply to play a strong game of Chess .
Instead , the goal is to provide a pleasing Chess environment in which the user can also tailor the strength of the Chess program to taste .
The Best Looking Board and Pieces
For example , if you ’re a very strong player , even a USCF Expert ( ELO = 2000 to 2200 ) , and you set the ELO rating of Shredder to 2600 , you ’ll have a tough time ever winning .
Whether you can learn from the loss depends on your Chess insight and skill at analyzing various continuations .
Accordingly , for the rest of us casual players , we want other things in a Chess program for the iPad in addition to being able to set the strength .
Are the board and pieces pleasing to the eye ?
Is the user interface ( UI ) aesthetically pleasing ?
Is good use of the screen space made ?
Can the computer provide hints and coaching ?
Can the game score in Portable Game Notation ( PGN ) be saved and e-mailed ?
( Also displayed during the game . )
As a result , the evaluation of a Chess program can boil down to criteria set by the reviewer , admittedly a subjective process .
Also , many of the UI features are constrained by the iPad / iPhone SDK , so some UI features will be common .
The superiority of one program may be in the details of the execution and the information supplied .
Features
Shredder Chess for the iPad has lots of features , so I ’ll list the notable ones :
Portrait or Landscape mode
Adjustable ELO from 850 ( beginner ) to 2600 ( Grandmaster )
Auto adjust of computer ’s playing strength after a game ( optional )
Several playing styles : normal , solid , passive , aggressive .
Coaching option
Options for the board and piece designs
Real - time evaluation of the position
Corral of captured pieces
Sound effects
Manual input ( called “ Enter Moves ” ) to play and study a game from a book or magazine .
Flip the board ( black on the bottom )
Play a Chess Problem / puzzle
Chart of the user ’s rating over time
Most of the controls for managing the game play are in the upper right bar above the board .
I ’ll call them , left to right , settings , file , and actions .
The settings popover defines things like playing strength , coaching on / off , playing style , the board and piece designs and whether the board coordinates are displayed .
Settings Popover
What I Did and Did n’t Like
Right away , there were some things I liked and did n’t like here .
I really liked the annotation under the ELO rating that defines the strength : beginner , advanced , club player , expert , Master , etc .
In fact , the entire settings popover is prettier and more informative than tChess .
What I did n’t like was the selections for board and piece design and the way the options inside <…> do n’t wrap around .
( The developer differs , and does n’t like wrap arounds .
You do n’t know where it ends , and you wonder if you ’re seeing a repeat . )
As for piece design , only one looked clear and traditional : the style shown in my screenshots .
The rest are rather hyper - modernish and faddish , and I do n’t think they ’ll appeal to many players .
In contrast , tChess has a meticulously designed classic Staunton choice — which I showcased in the review of tChess .
Actions Popover
Another thing I did n’t like was the utilization of the display .
The coordinates are placed on the square rather that outside and along the edge of the Chess board .
This is a design subject to taste , but I ’ll argue that keeping the squares clean and the pieces legible and traditional is a better design philosophy .
Just as with tChess , one can save and load a game .
Shredder displays a lot more information ( metadata ) about the game in the log file than tChess — which merely allows a string of characters .
Saved game log
Another thing that Shredder lacks compared to tChess is the ability , when playing back a saved game , to bring up the PGN score and select where you want to start .
That allows you to either analyze the game from the end backward or play the game from the beginning very easily .
With Shredder Chess , the only choice is to step backwards .
The developer , Eiko Bleicher pointed out to me that if you hold down the back arrow , the game will progress to the beginning very fast .
Still , I ’d prefer to simply touch the score where I ’d like to start playing — as in tChess .
When e-mailing a game , the PGN listing is sent as an attachment instead of in the body of the e-mail .
I can see how this might be advantageous because Shredder is available in three different versions for the Mac , and the extension of the listing is .pgn .
If you double click such a file with Mac OS X , and Shredder is installed , it will automatically load the game .
Game listing , standard PGN Form ( BBEdit )
I liked the coaching mode .
If you make a really bad move , Shredder Chess will ( optionally ) alert you and give you a chance to take it back .
While you ca n’t take back moves in official play , this can be a useful tool when learning against the computer .
In contrast to tChess , there is no way that I could find to bring up the entire score of the game during the game .
Shredder is limited to a two line display of the score at any one time .
With all that wasted real estate on the display , this is a grave oversight .
Finally , I was n’t pleased with the utilization of the screen space , especially in landscape mode .
There is a vast gray area that ’s distracting and exhibits , in my opinion , questionable design aesthetics .
tChess solved that problem by restricting to portrait mode .
Landscape Mode
The End Game
Shredder Chess sells for exactly the same price as tChess Pro , US $ 7.99 .
It ’s in the same class as tChess Pro , and I think either program would offer any Chess player , novice or experienced Master looking for a challenge , a fun and productive playing experience .
Shredder Chess , however , does n’t have that look of visual refinement ( except in the popovers ) and does n’t offer 3D views , essential for some player ’s pattern recognition .
That is , some players have a particular kind of Chess blindness in 2D that they do not have in a 3D view ( or a real , physical chess board and pieces . )
So my original reaction stands .
tChess is the best overall Chess experience I ’ve seen to date on the iPad.
Shredder Chess comes in a very close second .
Shredder Chess is available for the Mac in three versions , and there is a 30 day free trial .
Just south of Rome lie the Pontine Marshes , a vexed part of the Italian countryside .
In ancient times , Roman emperors tried unsuccessfully to drain the marshes , something only achieved in the 1930s through a system of massive pumps and canals that removed enough water to turn the area into productive farmland .
Yet today those canals have become heavily polluted , endangering the area ’s agriculture and the health of its residents .
The conventional way of tackling the problem would be to build a series of large water - treatment plants in the area , which covers about 300 square miles .
But Alan Berger , an associate professor of urban design and landscape architecture at MIT , has another idea .
Because some plants absorb pollutants as water flows by them , carefully designed wetlands can clean up the countryside while preserving its natural feel and providing public park space .
Berger realized this notion could apply to the Pontine Marshes while on a fellowship at the American Academy in Rome in 2007 - 2008 .
He then began trying to persuade officials of the Italian region of Lazio , in the province of Latina , where the marshes are located , to consider the notion .
Now , after performing innovative interdisciplinary testing with researchers in MIT ’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , Berger believes he knows how to make the concept work best .
Regional officials have since become enthusiastic about the idea :
In September 2009 , Lazio ’s government received a grant for 4.5 million euros as part of the European Union ’s “ Life + ” program for environmental works , specifically to clean up the area using natural processes .
That represents a reversal , Berger claims , from the response he usually got when he started floating the idea in Italy .
“ People said I was insane , ” recalls Berger , who has designed several large - scale environmental cleanup projects in his career .
“ But if you do good research , you can change the type of project that is done . ”
As Lazio ’s planning director , Carlo Perotto , said of Berger in 2008 : “ He opened a new way of thinking .
” As the waterways of the Pontine Marshes move from inland hills to the sea , they accumulate excess nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizer used on the adjacent farmland .
That affects the crops and livestock using the water further downstream , creating potential hazards throughout the food chain .
However , water polluted in this way can be cleansed after coming into contact with the right kind of vegetation .
Marsh grasses absorb toxins and effectively remove them from circulation in the ecosystem .
The wetlands Berger wants to build in the Pontine Marshes would direct polluted canal water into a twisting channel with vegetation , from which the water would emerge clean .
The precise amount of pollution in the marshes varies by area and season , but in some areas near the sea , notes Berger , the canals almost wholly contain waste water .
Wetlands can reduce pollution levels by over 90 percent , if wetlands provide a large enough area for the water to flow through .
Berger would like to initiate the project by building an extremely large wetlands — 2.3 square kilometers — intended to clean a central artery in the Pontine canal system .
But the Pontine Marshes project constitutes an engineering problem with two key challenges .
First , the water flowing through the wetlands must move slowly enough so that the plants can absorb the pollutants ; second , the pattern of the water flow must give all water molecules equal opportunity to encounter the vegetation .
Berger ’s solution is to have the water move through an S - shaped course that slows it down to a speed well under one mile per hour .
The Italian engineers of the 1930s built perfectly straight canals , since they were simply concerned with transporting water efficiently .
But forcing water to meander through winding channels in a wetlands gives more water molecules the best chance of being purified .
” Inefficiency is how environmental systems work , ” says Berger .
Since Berger is not an engineer , he joined forces with Heidi Nepf , a professor in MIT ’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering ( CEE ) who specializes in analyzing fluid dynamics , to test his designs .
Nepf , CEE graduate student Jeff Rominger , and a Harvard graduate student , Gena Wirth , who was working for Berger ’s design group , the Project for Reclamation Excellence ( P - REX ) , built multiple models from Berger ’s plans , featuring variations of S - shapes and alterations in the density and placement of the wetlands vegetation .
To scrutinize the designs , the researchers sent water injected with an fluorescent dye called Rhodamine WT through the models and used a fluorometer to measure the intensity of the light as the water exited , which indicated how broadly the water had spread .
Test results indicated that the optimum design was one featuring relatively wide S - shaped channels with lots of vegetation underneath and small “ islands ” of earth to help the water disperse evenly .
“ Heidi ’s and Jeff ’s work gave us a scientific understanding of how these plans functioned , and allowed us to push the design envelope , ” says Berger .
And while a few pollution - removing wetlands exist in the United States , Nepf says , they use identical rectangular templates plunked down regardless of the surrounding landscape ’s features .
“ What ’s novel is Alan seeing that water treatment can be made attractive , “ says Nepf .
“ In the wetlands treatment community , you would never go to this step . ”
Since the Italian countryside is a tourist attraction , she notes , eliminating stretches of concrete canals ( and the need for treatment plants ) “ lets Italy find cultural or economic value ” while improving the environment .
Berger ’s designs would also include park space built adjacent to the wetlands , in order to give the public better access to the countryside .
Berger ’s approach to the Pontine Marshes acknowledges “ that in many cases the landscape can't be returned to its original state , ” says Tom Avermaete , a professor of architecture and public building at Delft University of Technology , in the Netherlands .
Instead , Avermaete believes , designers should seek new ways of mending damaged landscapes : “ These processes of reclamation are one of the main challenges for future architecture and urban planning .
” The collaboration between Berger and Nepf thus expands the way treatment wetlands can be built , by finding a new form for the function .
Berger is currently part of a group filing plans in Italy this spring that could allow his designs to be implemented , which would require further government approval .
Up to 102 wetlands modules of varying size could be placed in the region , he thinks , although the full extent of the project will depend on the Italian government ’s ability to acquire additional land rights from some of the local property owners .
But the fact that local officials have secured EU funding and now seem intent on implementing a natural cleanup of the marshes strikes Berger as progress in its own right .
In planning , he says , “ Most of the time we design what we ’ve already built .
But now , whatever happens in Italy , it wo n’t be the same old stuff . ”

What my bloody , newly mangled face taught me about our litigious society

I have been commuting to New York for the past few weeks and so I am now one of the train people .
Amtrak is my tribe .
On Monday night I made a mad dash from the edit bay to Penn Station in New York to make the 9:05 train to Trenton .
I got to the station at 9:01 .
“ The train is on the right , ” the Amtrak lady said at the top of the escalator that descends to the tracks .
[ SIGNUP ]
I made it .
But there was something wrong .
I was on a ghost train .
There was no one from the tribe on board , just a bartender in the café car who may or may not have been real .
I felt like Jack Nicholson in The Shining .
“ Is this the 9:05 ? ” I said as my mysterious friend wiped off the counter top .
She smiled and said , “ No , it ’s across the platform , but you better hurry . ”
I turned from Jack Nicholson to O.J. Simpson .
Not the bad O.J. Simpson who we know from the court room , the good O.J. , who jumped suitcases to catch a plane in Hertz Commercials .
( But I did just give myself a chill as I was forced to think of the comparison between The Shining ’s Jack Torrance and the bad O.J. Simpson .
It was unintended , but I ’ll leave it in so you can share the chill . )
So now I am running with dress shoes across a slippery platform .
( If you think I am already trying to make excuses for what is about to happen next — you ’re right . )
I tried to turn in full run when my face got a closer look at the slippery platform .
My face met the platform hard .
If NFL Films had a parabolic mike nearby , the announcers would have paused for the sound of the crack .
I turned once again , this time from O.J. Simpson to Chevy Chase .
Being a good TV anchor , I checked my teeth first .
They were all there and un-chipped .
But when I stood up blood shot from my nose like I was the dessert fountain in True Blood .
( Finally , a pop reference from this century . )
I made the train .
But when I tried to hand my blood - stained ticket to the conductor he said , “ I do n’t want to touch that .
You are going to have to throw that out . ”
He never even looked at the ticket and did not mark my seat with a receipt .
He just stared at me .
At this point I did n’t realize that my nose looked like a foot .
He said , “ Do you want the first aid kit ? ”
That may have been the dumbest question I heard since a Philadelphia anchor asked an expert on the Catholic Church , during the coverage of the death of Pope John Paul II , if anyone has ever been canonized a saint after they died .
He answered , “ That ’s kind of a prerequisite . ”
I was n’t in the position to make any sarcastic comments .
I just said , “ Yes , please . ”
After I cleaned myself up and put a band aid over a gash on my nose .
I walked out of the train restroom to find four conductors in a huddle outside the door .
Two hundred years ago they would have had torches and pitch forks .
The biggest of the conductors asked , “ What is your stop ? ”
When I told him Trenton , he looked at the other conductors and said , “ Two stops . ”
I then realized that had I been going any further I may have been tossed from the train .
“ Do you need an ambulance ? ” the big conductor asked me .
“ No , I may need a couple of stitches , but if I broke it , I think it would hurt a lot more . ”
The next day I got 15 stitches on my nose , which was broken .
The nose straightening process is something that would have made Dick Cheney very happy .
And now after reading the details of this entire ordeal , you are thinking , “ ” He ’s got a great lawsuit . ” Congratulations .
You have joined the majority of the people who have heard this story .
One person I told even said , “ Oh man , you are so lucky . ”
This is as he is looking at the bandaged foot on my face where my nose used to be .
“ You are going to make a fortune . ”
Even my health insurance provider asked if I was going to sue .
When I said , “ I do n’t think so , ” the woman on the phone said , “ Well , we might sue on your behalf . ”
It was then that I realized how lawsuit crazy we have become .
( Sorry it took so long to get to the point , but I had to set this all up with my hilarious turning my nose into a foot story . )
So many people brought up suing , so matter - of - factly , that I started to think there was something wrong with me .
My answer went from an indignant “ No ! ” to an “ I do n’t think so ” to “ I just do n’t know . ”
People think I should sue Penn Station , Amtrak and the makers of my shoes .
All of this because I slipped and fell .
I just do n’t think I can do it .
Maybe that foot on my face is supposed to come with a Golden Slipper , but I just ca n’t pull the trigger .
If I do , then I am part of the problem .
We live in a society of people who seem to take everything but responsibility .
Maybe my thinking is as old - fashioned as my references , but I am not going to look at my misfortune as a possible payday .
All of us end up paying because of that kind of thinking .
I think my tribe of train people will be proud of me .
I ’ll find out later today .
I ’m going to New York to do a national commentary on our litigious society complete with my broken nose .
Why do I think that most who watch are going to say , “ What a shame !
That guy with the foot face could have made a fortune . ”

It has been a shibboleth of healthy living for decades : eat more fruit and vegetables to beat cancer .
Now , scientists have found that the anti-carcinogenic properties of such a diet are weak at best .
In one of the largest and longest studies into the link between diet and the killer disease , scientists surveyed the fruit and vegetable consumption of almost 400,000 men and women in 10 European countries including the UK over almost nine years , during which they developed 30,000 cancers .
They found that eating an extra 200g of fruit and vegetables each day , equivalent to two servings , reduced the incidence of cancer by about 4 per cent .
The finding confirms the pessimistic view of a growing body of scientists over the last decade : that the protective effect of fruit and vegetables against cancer is very limited .
It represents a dramatic reversal from 20 years ago , when as high as 50 per cent potential reductions in cancer risk were suggested .
The World Health Organisation in 1990 recommended five servings of fruit and vegetables a day .
Is that recommendation now history ?
No .
The latest finding is undoubtedly a serious blow , demolishing one of the pillars of the cancer - protective lifestyle .
But there is still good evidence that fruit and vegetables protect against heart disease and stroke .
In the same population of men and women which showed virtually no effect of fruit and vegetable consumption on cancer , there was a 30 per cent lower incidence of heart disease and stroke among those eating five servings a day compared with those eating less than one and a half servings .
Separate studies have shown that increasing fruit and vegetable consumption reduces blood pressure , a major cause of heart disease .
But how were researchers misled over the decades ?
Paolo Boffeta of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York , who led the study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute ( JNCI ) , said other factors linked with a high fruit and vegetable consumption , such as lower alcohol intake , not smoking and having higher levels of physical activity " may have contributed to a lower cancer risk " .
The over - emphasis on fruit and vegetables may also have come from the way the early research was conducted .
" Case control " studies formed the basis of the evidence , in which the diet of a person with cancer was compared with that of someone who did not have cancer but who was matched in age , sex and other factors .
These studies rely on people 's memories of what they ate , and depend on people volunteering to be controls who have a strong interest in health .
Thus , the tendency to exaggerate the benefits of the diet is built in from the start .
Later in the 1990s , case control studies were replaced by prospective studies in which participants were asked about what they were eating at the time , thus avoiding the problems of recall , and followed to see who developed cancer in the ensuing years .
Results from these studies were consistently less impressive than the earlier ones .
Now , one of the biggest studies has confirmed the disappointing conclusion that an apple a day is unlikely to save you from cancer .
It remains possible that specific foods have preventive effects against specific cancers , and that the overall effect of a diet high in fruit and vegetables is greater in younger people .
In an accompanying editorial in the JNCI , Walter Willett of the Harvard School of Public Health singles out lycopene , a constituent of tomatoes , for which there is " considerable evidence " of a protective effect against prostate cancer .
Many other foods including blueberries , broccoli and strawberries are also said to have anti-cancer properties .
" The findings add further evidence that a broad effort to increase consumption of fruit and vegetables will not have a major effect on cancer incidence , " Professor Willett concludes .
" Such efforts are still worthwhile because they will reduce risks of cardiovascular disease , and a small benefit for cancer remains possible .
Research should focus more sharply on specific fruits and vegetables and their constituents and on earlier periods of life . "
Dr Rachel Thompson , science programme manager for the World Cancer Research Fund , said : " This study suggests that if we all ate an extra two portions of fruits and vegetables a day ( about 150g ) , about 2.5 per cent of cancers could be prevented .
" Given the fact that there are many types of cancer where there is no evidence eating fruits and vegetables affects risk , it is not surprising that the overall percentage is quite low .
But for the UK , this works out at about 7,000 cases a year ... a significant number . "
Super foods :
The produce now under the microscope
Red and orange peppers
An excellent source of vitamin C. Half a red pepper provides all the vitamin C an adult needs in one day .
They also contain anti-oxidant flavenoids and beta- carotene .
Strawberries
As well as vitamin C and flavenoids , they contain the phytochemical ellagic acid , which research has shown can help inhibit the growth of cancers .
Carrots
Good source of beta - carotene , which the body converts to vitamin A .
This keeps skin healthy and helps the immune system .
Tomatoes
The antioxidant lycopene is what makes them red .
Studies have linked tomatoes , especially when cooked , canned or in pastes and sauces , with a lower risk of prostate cancer .
Onions
Contain allium compounds and are rich in quercetin , a phytochemical .
Both of these are thought to reduce cancer as well as improving circulation and blood pressure .
Broccoli , cabbage , sprouts
Members of the brassicas family , linked with lower rates of cancers of the digestive system .
Garlic
Contains allylic sulphides , garlic has long been used as a natural medicine .
May help ward off cell damage .
Blueberries
Full of vitamin C and a good source of the antioxidant anthocyanin , believed to boost the immune system , help keep the heart and skin healthy .

Windows / Mac / Linux : Free virtualization tool VirtualBox , technically Oracle VM VirtualBox now , has quietly added " experimental support for Mac OS X guests " to a beta release .
That 's good news — at least for Mac owners , and those willing to dig into serious Hackintosh tweaks .
Mac owners looking to try out buggy software or keep entire other OS X installations handy will see the main benefit from having OS X as a guest on their Mac hardware .
VirtualBox wo n't do much to make Apple 's operating system work on non-Apple hardware , but from what we 've seen around the net , we 'd bet VirtualBox 's opening of this can of worms will lead to some nifty , Hackintosh - style work - arounds that will get a Mac running on Windows / Intel hardware .

BOSTON , Massachusetts , USA -- Monday , April 19th , 2010 -- The Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) today announced the online release of the documentary film " Patent Absurdity : how software patents broke the system " by independent filmmaker Luca Lucarini .
http://patentabsurdity.com/
The film , funded with a grant from the FSF , explores the case of software patents , the history of judicial activism that led to their rise , and the harm being done to software developers and the wider economy .
The film is based on a series of interviews conducted during the Supreme Court 's review of in re Bilski , a case that could have profound implications for the patenting of software .
" The Bilski case before the Supreme Court is really the story of the judicial activism of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit , who during the 80s and 90s became dominated by patent lawyers who wanted an expansive reading of patent law .
They opened the floodgates to the patenting of software ideas and business methods , previously held by the Supreme Court to be unpatentable subject matter .
The price of that activism is being paid by today 's programmers , who find it increasingly difficult to write software without risking being sued , and by businesses who have to face increased litigation and lega fees .
Software patents block compatibility and standards , make programmers remove useful features , and are the cause of unknown amounts of frustration in the daily life of many individuals , " said Ciaran O'Riordan , the director of the End Software Patents campaign , and a technical adviser to the filmmakers .
Dr. Robert Shafer , associate professor of medicine at Stanford University , who created a free , publicly available HIV Drug Resistance Database to interpret HIV drug resistance tests and develop new HIV drugs ( located at http://hivdb.stanford.edu/), described the film in light of the way software patents have hampered his work : " I 'm glad to see a film that can explain the harm of software patents .
I 'm also looking forward to a favorable outcome in the * Bilski* case .
However , biomedical researchers , medical care providers , and their patients cannot afford to wait the many years it will take before any Supreme Court decision has a practical effect on existing patents .
There is a hardcore group of special interests who profit from the system the way it is now -- the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit , patent examiners who essentially receive credit for their work only when they issue or uphold patents , and the patent bar which benefits from cross-licensing and patent litigation regardless of how ridiculous a patent is .
One of the saddest aspects of my experience has been to learn that the influence of the patent bar is expanding rapidly within universities through their offices of technology licensing . "
Featured interviewees in the film include economists Ben Klemens and James Bessen , and legal scholars Dan Ravicher , Eben Moglen and Karen Sandler .
The film also includes footage of the press conference at the Supreme Court organized on behalf of plaintiffs Bernard Bilski and Rand Warsaw , and their lawyer J. Michael Jakes .
Speaking about the release of the film , Luca Lucarini said , " I hope that my film can bring to light the harm that the US patent system is inflicting on our society through software patents .
The goal of the documentary is to increase the number of informed citizens educated to take action , and so it has been licensed to allow everyone to share and distribute copies of the film . "
" Patent Absurdity " is available under the Creative Commons BY - ND ( Attribution - No Derivative Works ) license , which encourages sharing and widespread redistribution by all who receive a copy .
The film was made entirely with free software , in the Ogg Theora format .
Because anyone can show the film , the web site is compiling a list of screenings , including a premiere at the Connecticut Film Festival http://www.ctfilmfest.com.
Highlighted Early Reviews
" ... probably the best introduction to a complex area for non-technical users " -- Glyn Moody , ComputerWorld
" It ’s well worth watching , both for the opportunity to see so many of the people who are influential in software freedom philosophy and law and for the great explanations of the issues around the * Bilski * case and the mission creep which has led to software patents .
Share it with friends , as this issue is only going to get more important as the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) promotes criminalization of patent infringement . "
-- Simon Phipps , board member of Open Source for America and the Open Source Initiative
" It 's a 30 - minute movie , mostly of interviews .
There 's a great Beethoven symphony at the end that starts to degrade as music patents spring up ...
In short , it 's priceless . "
-- Pamela Jones , Groklaw

About Free Software and Open Source
The free software movement 's goal is freedom for computer users .
Some , especially corporations , advocate a different viewpoint , known as " open source , " which cites only practical goals such as making software powerful and reliable , focuses on development models , and avoids discussion of ethics and freedom .
These two viewpoints are different at the deepest level .

Florida legislators pass an mandatory ultrasound bill , asking rape victims to provide proof to opt out .
The Florida House passed a bill requiring that all women seeking an abortion must show proof of rape or pay for an ultrasound before the procedure , despite the efforts of Democrats to block the bill from reaching the floor .
The bill , which many characterized as a “ sneak attack ” at the tail end of the legislative session , caused a great deal of division and vitriol in the House .
The abortion restriction , unveiled in the closing days of the 2010 legislative session , opened raw and emotional divisions among legislators as they prepared to leave Tallahassee for the summer .
The debate was so heated and , at times , graphic , House Republican leaders ordered teenage pages off the House floor and cleared the public galleries of children .
Two Democrats wept as they spoke against the ultrasound mandate .
Largely along party lines , the Republican - controlled House approved the abortion bill 76 - 44 Friday .
The Senate had voted for the measure a day earlier , 23 - 16 .

Opponents called the ultrasound mandate a government intrusion on a decision that should be left to women .
“ Stand down if you do n’t have ovaries , ” said Rep. Janet Long , D - Tampa .
The bill requires ultrasounds for women seeking abortions in their first trimester , when more than 90 percent of the procedures occur .
Doctors or nurses also are ordered to describe the images on the sonogram and the stage of fetal develoment .
Women must sign a form if they refuse to view the images .
Unlike the recently passed Oklahoma law , women who have been raped can opt out of the ultrasound if they can prove their attack , causing some to refer to it as the “ proof of rape ” bill .
It is now up to Governor Charlie Crist to decide to sign or veto the legislation .
Crist is currently running for the Republican nomination for the open Florida senate seat .

A Montreal study finds heterotrophic bacteria counts , in more than 70 percent of bottled water samples , exceed the recommended limits specified by the United States Pharmacopeia ( USP ) .
Researchers from Ccrest laboratories report their results today at the 110th General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology in San Diego .
" Despite having the cleanest tap water a large number of urban Canadians are switching over to bottled water for their daily hydration requirements .
Unsurprisingly , the consumer assumes that since bottled water carries a price tag , it is purer and safer than most tap water , " says Sonish Azam , a researcher on the study .
Regulatory bodies such as Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and Health Canada have not set a limit for the heterotrophic bacteria counts in bottled drinking water .
However , according to the USP not more than 500 colony forming units ( cfu ) per milliliter should be present in drinking water .
The study was initiated in response to a Ccrest employee 's complaint of fowl taste and sickness after consumption of bottled water at the company .
Azam and her colleagues Ali Khamessan and Massimo Marino randomly purchased several brands of bottled water from a local marketplace and subjected them to microbiological analysis .
They discovered more than 70 percent of famous brands tested did not meet the USP specifications for drinking water .
" Heterotrophic bacteria counts in some of the bottles were found to be in revolting figures of one hundred times more than the permitted limit , " says Azam .
In comparison the average microbial count for different tap water samples was 170 cfu / mL .
Azam stresses that these bacteria most likely do not cause disease and they have not confirmed the presence of disease - causing bacteria , but the high levels of bacteria in bottled water could pose a risk for vulnerable populations such as pregnant women , infants , immunocompromised patients and the elderly .
" Bottled water is not expected to be free from microorganisms but the cfu observed in this study is surprisingly very high .
Therefore , it is strongly recommended to establish a limit for the heterotrophic bacteria count as well as to identify the nature of microorganisms present in the bottled water , " says Azam .

A live interview with Azam and her colleagues will be webcast Tuesday , May 25 , 2010 at 10:00 a.m. PDT , over the ASM Live uStream channel ( http://www. ustream .

Nursing Assistant Suspended for Being Pantsless in a Resident 's Room
The Washington State Department of Health has immediately suspended Douglas B. McGregor from practicing as a nursing assistant after he was charged with sexual misconduct involving a resident at the King County assisted living facility where he worked .
Charging documents state ( found here ) that McGregor was discovered pantsless in the room of a vulnerable female patient — a 70 - year - old woman with late stage Alzheimer's .
Her legs were in the air and her genitals were exposed .
According to the charging documents , he told a law enforcement officer that " his penis had slipped between Resident A's labia by accident . "
McGregor also faces criminal charges .
The suspension means McGregor can't be employed as a nursing assistant in Washington pending the outcome of a hearing .
He has twenty days to request such a hearing .
Well , well -- what 's this ?
We just got our hands on what looks like an internal HP Slate presentation given to cool down some of the iPad hype amongst HP employees , and it just happens to have specs and pricing details on the elusive Windows 7 tablet .
As we'd heard , the Slate will run $ 549 in its base configuration , which has a 8.9 - inch 1024 x 600 capacitive multitouch display , a 1.6GHz Atom Z530 processor with UMA graphics and an accelerator for 1080 p video playback ( we 're assuming it 's a Broadcom Crystal HD chip ) , 32 GB of flash storage and 1GB of non-upgradeable RAM .
There 's also a $ 599 version with 64GB of storage , and both models will have a five - hour battery , an SDHC slot , two camera , a USB port , a SIM card slot for the optional 3G modem , and a dock connector for power , audio , and HDMI out .
Of course , what this spec list does n't cover is software , and we still have n't seen much of how HP plans to make Windows 7 on a full slate device with netbook - class internals perform as smoothly or as intuitively as its demo videos .
That 's not a small challenge , especially since the iPad is out now and setting some pretty high expectations for how this new breed of tablets should work .
We 've got our fingers crossed -- show us something good , HP .
BAGHDAD —
The torture of Iraqi detainees at a secret prison in Baghdad was far more systematic and brutal than initially reported , Human Rights Watch reported on Tuesday .
The existence of the prison , which housed mostly Sunni Arab prisoners , has created a political furor in Iraq , prompted government denials and fanned sectarian tensions .
“ Abu Ghraib was a picnic ” compared with the secret prison , said Sheik Abdullah Humedi Ajeel al - Yawar , one of the most influential Sunni Arab tribal leaders in the northern province of Nineveh , where the detainees were rounded up by Iraqi soldiers based on suspicions that they had links to the insurgency and brought to Baghdad with little due process .
Abu Ghraib is the prison at which American guards tortured Iraqi prisoners , severely damaging Iraqis ’ trust in the United States .
Human Rights
Watch gained access on Monday to about 300 male detainees transferred from the once secret prison at the Old Muthanna military airfield to the Rusafa prison in Baghdad and documented its findings , which it described as “ credible and consistent , ” in a draft report provided to The New York Times on Tuesday by the rights group .
He said : '' You can tell when a rabbit is under because his back legs completely relax .
The creature is unable to move , in a trance like state , sometimes for up to ten minutes .

In 1993 , Laszlo Nagy began organizing monthly tournaments in Budapest that give players a chance to earn the norms needed to gain the grandmaster and international master titles .
Called the First Saturday tournaments , the events have attracted many of the world ’s best players .
Five years ago , a Chicago man created a similar tournament series , the North American Masters , to help American players .
The man , Sevan A. Muradian , organized the first one in April 2005 .
The 25th tournament ended March 24 , and two players , Mackenzie Molner and Siddharth Ravichandran , each earned the third norm needed to become international masters , Muradian said in an e-mail message .
Six players have now earned their final international master norms at his tournaments , Muradian said , and Pascal Charbonneau of Canada earned his final grandmaster norm at one .
Altogether , he wrote , 16 players have earned norms at the competitions .
Do you know the tale of Icarus ?
Icarus was a figure in Greek mythology who fashioned some wings out of feathers and beeswax to escape an island .
So enamored of his newfound ability to fly , Icarus ignored warnings not to fly too close to the sun .
Upon getting close to the sun , the beeswax melted , his wings fell off , and he plummeted to his death .
This tale forms the Icarus Paradox :
The same thing that had made Icarus successful is what led to his downfall .
In his overconfidence he had become blind to the dangers of flying too close to the sun .
And this is what we often see very successful companies do too : they become successful doing something but this makes them overconfident and blind to the dangers that other developments pose to them .
This behavior often leads to their downfall .
It is a common phenomenon .
Did you know , for example , that when you take the list of Fortune 100 companies in 1966 and compare it with the Fortune 100 in 2006 , 66 of those companies do n’t even exist anymore ?
Another 15 still exist but are n’t on the list any longer , while only 19 of them are still there .
Similarly , ample research and statistics show that for a variety of industries very successful firms have trouble staying successful .
You could call it arrogance or , more kindly , naivete but there is a certain blindness at play ; blindness to the dangers of continuing a previously successful course of action for too long .
How does it happen ?
Over the years , companies begin to focus on the thing that made them successful ( a particular product , service , production method , etc. ) .
Initially that serves them well and they become even better at it .
It will also come at the expense of other products , processes , and viewpoints that the company considers less important and off the mark , that are discarded or brushed aside .
As a result , firms are too late to adapt to fundamental changes in their business environments such as new competitors , different customer demand , radical new technologies , or business models .
The historical examples of Laura Ashley , Atari , Digital Equipment , Tupperware , or Revlon come to mind .
It also causes organizations to carry on activities too long and too far , despite the presence of some fundamental design or organizational flaws .
The historical examples of the space shuttle Challenger , Merrill Lynch , Royal Bank of Scotland , AIG , Citibank , Lehman Brothers , and so and so on …
They form the tales of once dominant companies that at some point lost the plot .
Some of them recovered but some of them went under , arrogantly assuming that what they always did – and what had brought them so much success – would always work just fine .
Only to find out the hard way that they were wrong , and the world had no use for them any longer .

The open source SproutCore framework — which Apple invested in to create its suite of MobileMe apps — has been cross-pollinating with HTML5 features to develop in new directions , including a new interface builder , rich support for multitouch , and a packaging system for sharing JavaScript code between projects .
At this weekend 's JSConf event in Washington DC , a variety of new JavaScript - related tools were demonstrated , providing new competition to the incumbent Adobe Flash in the area of creating rich web apps , but entirely within HTML5 without needing a proprietary browser plugin .
JavaScript frameworks like SproutCore are used to ease the development of full blown web apps .
Unlike Adobe 's Flash , which is often used just to add interactive animations , videos or advertisements to a web page , SproutCore is intended to create rich Internet applications based entirely upon web standards , with no need for an external plugin architecture .
Apple demonstrated what could be done with SproutCore in its MobileMe apps , which debuted in mid 2008 .
SproutCore was used to create the highly interactive front end that users see ; the web apps work within modern browsers and talk to Apple 's backend servers to present mail , calendars , contacts , photo galleries , remote discovery and wipe features for iPhones , and other MobileMe features .
SproutCore is evolving as a product of Apple engineers and others who contribute to the open project .
It was founded by Charles Jolley , who originated Sprout Systems in 2005 and who was subsequently hired by Apple to serve as the senior architect for its HTML5 Web Apps and MobileMe , starting in late 2006 .
SproutCore Touch
At JSConf , the team presented a series of new tools leveraging HTML5 .
SproutCore Touch includes support for touch events and hardware acceleration on the iPhone and iPad .
It is also planned to extend support to Android and Palm 's webOS .
The new framework makes it easy to incorporate touch , drag , and pinch to resize features into standard HTML5 web pages within Safari , Chrome and Firefox , with bugs still being worked out for Internet Explorer .
The group demonstrated a version of the native NPR app for iPad created entirely within SproutCore Touch as a web application .
A demonstration of SproutCore Touch is available at http://touch.sproutcore.com/hedwig which presents example source code and functional examples of using multitouch gestures , scrolling lists with momentum and bounce , touch - enabled graphics resizing and scaling , and support for iPad orientation - aware navigation , which works similar to Mail when shifting from portrait to landscape .
Seeds.js : a package manager for JavaScript
The SproutCore team is also working to solve the issue of how JavaScript developers can share packages of code as a library , something that is common and easy to do in other languages such as Ruby or Python .
Installing and integrating updated versions of a shared library are easy to do in other environments thanks to package manager tools , but that 's are area for JavaScript that is n't well fleshed out .
That 's a problem for web developers , where JavaScript serves as the language for client side code that runs in the browser .
SproutCore 's solution is called Seed.js .
It builds upon the existing CommonJS module pattern , but adds a flexible package manager that serves as a universal CommonJS module runtime , a tool for installing , updating , removing and forking JavaScript packages , and a JavaScript - runner that can load code in a variety of different runtimes .
SproutCore reports that it has been working with Mozilla 's Bespin team on the Seed CommonJS runtime for several months now , and " we 're really happy with it . "
Bespin is Mozilla 's web - based code editor project built using HTML5 and in particular the Canvas tag .
Greenhouse : an interface builder for the web
The SproutCore team is also working on a graphical interface builder for SproutCore development .
Details on the new environment are sparse , but a report by Ajaxian notes that " SproutCore was actually written with tooling in mind .
For example , the tool can load up your SproutCore app and suppress the main loop , and get access to your custom views . "
Progress on SproutCore mutes a primary argument of users invested in Flash , that HTML5 offers no tools to help them create content .
While there are few " Creative Suite " style applications for creating presentation - oriented content in HTML5 , the real intent of HTML5 is not to create self contained animations , but rather to build real web content focused on semantic page markup .
This original intent of the web allows browsers to interpret pages as needed to suit optimized environments ranging from mobile devices to equipment accessible to different audiences with special needs .
Last week , the American Family Association ’s Bryan Fischer followed - up his call from last year to purge all Muslims from the US military with a call to purge all Muslims from the United States in general .
Today , Fischer has returned to defend his call for all Muslims in the United States to be deported immediately by claiming that every Muslim has a “ solemn , sacred obligation to kill as many of their hosts as possible ” and it is therefore “ a form of suicidal insanity ” to allow them to stay in the US .
Fischer admits that while not every single Muslim is out to destroy the US , since we ca n’t know which ones are ahead of time , it only makes sense to view “ every new Muslim immigrant [ as a ] potential threat to the safety and security of the United States ” and to treat all Muslims citizens as traitors :
Bottom line : every Muslim who enters the United States carries within his bosom the seeds of sedition .
It is dangerously foolish for the United States to invite folks inside our borders whose god orders them , through his holy prophet , to murder American infidels .
According to the latest Easter polling data , infidels comprise about 80 percent of our population , the 80 percent who believe that Jesus is the Son of God , came to earth to die for our sins , and rose from the grave .
Each of these beliefs is regarded in Islam as a heresy which ultimately merits the death penalty .
And if the government wo n’t impose this death penalty on the infidels , the Muslims themselves will be happy to impose it on their own initiative , as 9/11 and Fort Hood amply illustrate .
If we separate ourselves for a moment from the rampant and mindless political correctness and multiculturalism which controls the thinking of the elites , and the ordinary Americans who allow the elite to do their thinking for them , it is obviously and plainly nuts to throw out the welcome mat to those who have a religious obligation to obliterate us .
It is beyond comprehension that we have become so brain - addled that we regard it a positive virtue to blindly embrace our own destroyers .
Muslims who have become naturalized citizens , of course , would need to commit an act of treason to forfeit their citizenship and become eligible for repatriation .
Based on the Constitution ’s definition of treason in Article III Section 3 [ “ adhering to ( the ) Enemies ( of the United States ) , ( or ) giving them Aid and Comfort ” ] treasonous acts are likely committed on virtually a weekly basis here in the U.S. in many mosques and Islamic organizations .
Fischer concludes that the goal of every Muslim is to “ establish a virtual Islamic homeland in our midst ” and that instead of spending money on eventually incarcerating them , we should use that money to deport them :
NEW YORK — Investors sold risky assets , including emerging - market debt and stocks , as fears over the fiscal health of euro - zone countries increased the appeal of safer haven German and U.S. government bonds .
Standard & Poor 's Corp. sparked the selloff by cutting Greece 's debt rating to " junk " territory and lowering Portugal 's debt ranking two notches .
With other concerns , such as the looming overhaul of U.S. financial regulation and Wednesday 's interest - rate decision from the Federal Reserve , adding to the uncertainty , investors fled risky investments .
The extra yield that investors charge on traditionally riskier emerging - market debt grew by the widest margin since October 2009 , while U.S. stocks tumbled , sending the Standard & Poor 's 500 index back below 1200 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average below 11000 .
The euro fell more than 1.5 % against the dollar and more than 2 % against the yen .
The dollar dipped below 93 yen as the Japanese currency gained strongly .
Other currencies closely tied investor appetite for risk dropped sharply , with the Canadian dollar losing more than 1.6 % against the U.S. dollar , and the Australian dollar slipping more than 1 % .
Latin American currencies like the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso , too , suffered .
A collection of 14 Graeco - Roman tombs , artefacts and a mummy dating to the third century BC have been discovered in a cemetery in the Ain El - Zawya area of Bawiti , a town in the Bahariya Oasis , Egypt .
The find is early evidence of a large Graeco - Roman necropolis at the site .
The tombs were found during excavation works ahead of the building of a local youth centre in the area , about 260 miles southwest of Cairo .
Dr. Mahmoud Affifi , director of Cairo and Giza antiquities , said that the Supreme Council of Antiquities ( SCA ) has halted construction and has started legal procedures to bring the area under SCA control .
Affifi adds that the tombs have a unique interior design consisting of a long stairway leading to a corridor which ends in a hall containing mastabas at its corners that were used in burning burying the dead .
Dr. Zahi Hawass , Secretary General of the SCA , said the newly discovered tombs are rock - hewn , and that early investigations have unearthed four anthropoid masks made of plaster , a gold fragment decorated with a scene of the four sons of the god Horus , and a collection of coins , as well as clay and glass vessels .
The excavation has also unearthed the mummy of a 97 cm - tall woman , covered with coloured plaster featuring her in Roman dress and wearing some of her jewellery .
The Bahariya Oasis – known in ancient times as ‘ the Northern Oasis ’ – is also where in 1996 Hawass ’ team discovered the Valley of the Golden Mummies , where an impressive collection of 17 tombs with 254 mummies have been unearthed .
With a constant water supply and metal deposits nearby , the oasis has been a centre of activity since the Paleolithic period .
During Alexander the Great ‘s rule in Egypt a temple in his honour was constructed at the site – at that point an important trade location .
The oasis community prospered during the reign of Alexander , and counted many Greeks among its ranks .
The original Game Boy will forever hold a special place in our hearts , but spend a few minutes squinting at an original model and you 'll quickly realize that even nostalgia can't make up for that horrible green screen .
That 's been banished in this custom version , courtesy of modder CRTdrone , which features GBA SP internals housed in an original GB chassis .
This gives it compatibility with Game Boy , Game Boy Color , and of course GBA games , along with a rechargeable battery and even working shoulder buttons inserted into the sides .
All we have to go on at the moment is this picture plus a few comments from the man himself , but CRTdrone is promising full details of the mod are to come , which entails " just removing parts and re-wiring basically . "
They always make it sound so simple .
After years of serving as your faithful companion to ball games and keeping the brewskies frosty at backyard barbecues , your trusty beer cooler now has a new assignment -- cooking up a gourmet meal , sous - vide style .
For those of you who do n't keep up with high - tech cookery , sous - vide is a method of cooking where food is heated for an extended period at relatively low temperatures .
Unlike a slow cooker or Crock pot , the sous - vide process uses airtight plastic bags placed in hot water well below boiling point ( usually around 140 Fahrenheit ) .
The idea is to maintain the integrity and flavor of the food without overcooking it ( but while still killing any bacteria that may be present ) .
Normally , a sous - vide cooker like the Sous - Vide Supreme would set you back hundreds of dollars , but chef J. Kenzi Lopez - Alt shows us how to use a beer cooler to cook a perfect piece of meat .
All you have to do is fill up your beer cooler with water a couple of degrees higher than the temperature you 'd like to cook your food at ( to account for temperature loss when you add cold food to it ) , seal your food in a simple plastic Ziplock bag , drop it in , and close your cooler until you food is cooked , writes Chef Kenzi on the blog Serious Eats .
It 's really as simple as that .
So how does it work ?
Chef Kenzi explains that a beer cooler keeps things cool because it has a two - walled plastic chamber with an airspace in between ; this airspace acts as an insulator , preventing outside heat from reaching the cold beer inside .
Because insulators work both ways , the cooler can be used to keep things hot , too .
For his experiment , Chef Kenzi cooked steak at 125 Fahrenheit for one hour and chicken at 140 Fahrenheit for 2.5 hours in both the beer cooler and in the Sous - Vide Supreme .
If you looked at the picture below , you really can't tell which steak got the beer cooler treatment .
Both pieces look equally done from edge to center , and Chef Kenzi says the beer cooler kept the food hot till served .
And there 's yet another benefit .
A beer cooler is easily transportable and does not need an electric outlet , writes Chef Kenzi :
That means that the other night , for example , I was able to start cooking a two - pound dry - aged ribeye in my kitchen , carry the whole beer cooler out to my deck two hours later , slap the beef on a blazing hot grill for 30 seconds just to mark them and brown the exterior , then enjoy the most perfectly cooked meat that 's ever come off my Weber .

On April 19 , 2010 , the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Christian Legal Society v. Martinez , a case that will determine whether a public institution can refuse to officially recognize a religiously based organization that prevents those who do not share its religious and moral values from becoming voting members .
The case arose in 2004 when a chapter of the Christian Legal Society ( CLS ) , expressed a desire to register as an official student group at the University of California ’s Hastings College of Law .
Groups that are officially recognized by the school enjoy certain privileges , including public funding .
But CLS requirements effectively bar non-Christians and non-celibate gays and lesbians from becoming voting members or assuming leadership positions , which is in direct conflict with the law school ’s non-discrimination policy .
After six years of litigation in lower courts , the case is now before the Supreme Court .
The high court ’s decision could be narrowly tailored and impact only educational institutions , or could be broad and sweeping , affecting the rules governing a wide array of groups that accept government funding .
How did this case arise and how did it reach the U.S. Supreme Court ?
The Christian Legal Society is a nationwide , non-denominational organization of Christian lawyers , judges and law students with chapters at 165 law schools throughout the U.S. , including the University of California ’s Hastings College of Law .
Although anyone is allowed to attend CLS meetings , voting members and those in a chapter ’s leadership positions must sign and adhere to a Statement of Faith affirming their commitment to the group ’s Christian beliefs and values .
In addition , the group ’s bylaws state that members and officers are expected to live according to certain principles , including refraining from sexual activity of any kind outside of heterosexual marriage .
In the fall of 2004 , the local CLS chapter at Hastings applied to register as a student organization at the law school .
Groups that are officially registered at Hastings benefit from certain privileges .
For example registered organizations are given priority access to university facilities , such as rooms for meetings , and are entitled to apply for funds for specific activities , such as travel to professional conferences .
Unregistered groups are allowed to operate on campus , but without school funding and other privileges .
After reviewing the CLS ’s bylaws , Hastings officials questioned whether the organization could comply with the school ’s open membership or anti-discrimination policy .
Hastings ’ non-discrimination policy states that the university and affiliated groups “ shall not discriminate unlawfully on the basis of race , color , religion , national origin , ancestry , disability , age , sex or sexual orientation . ”
CLS agreed that its requirements that members be Christians and that they only be intimate with an opposite - sex spouse were not in line with two parts of the school ’s non-discrimination policy : those concerning religion and sexual orientation .
The group asked to be exempt from these two parts of the policy and allowed to register .
When the law school refused this request , CLS sued Hastings in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California , arguing that the school had violated its First Amendment rights to speech , assembly and the free exercise of religion .
In April , 2006 , the district court ruled that Hastings did not violate CLS ’s rights when it enforced its non-discrimination policy .
Specifically , the district court judge stated that by denying official recognition to the group , the law school had done nothing to significantly “ impair ” the group ’s ability to function or even express itself on campus .
CLS then filed an appeal with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , which in March 2009 affirmed the district court ’s ruling .
After these two lower federal courts ruled in favor of Hastings College of Law , the Supreme Court agreed to review the case .
What arguments does the Christian Legal Society make in its brief to the Supreme Court to explain why the law school should be required to officially recognize it ?
In its brief to the Supreme Court , the CLS acknowledges that Hastings ’ decision not to officially recognize the group does not deny it the right to exist or function on campus in a limited way .
However , the Society contends that denial of recognition does burden the group ’s First Amendment rights because it limits access to university rooms and denies access to communications resources and financial support available to other , registered groups .
The group argues that by creating a system whereby student groups register and are then given access to university resources , Hastings has created what courts have called a “ public forum . ”
In other words , the university has created an environment on campus where groups can express themselves .
As a result , CLS says , any group that is denied access to this public forum will not have the same ability as other groups to get its message out to the campus community .
According to the CLS , this explains why courts have generally maintained that once a public forum is established , it can not be limited to groups or individuals with certain beliefs .
Next , CLS argues that by making official recognition subject to acceptance of the university ’s non-discrimination policy , Hastings is limiting access to the school ’s public forum , and is therefore violating the group ’s First Amendment right to what courts have called “ expressive association . ”
The right to expressive association , which arises from both the freedoms of speech and assembly under the First Amendment , protects the right of an organization to control its mission , message and policies , and to choose members and leaders to carry out its objectives .
According to CLS , Hastings ’ non-discrimination policy would require the group to take anyone into its voting membership , and potentially into its leadership ranks , regardless of whether the person shares the group ’s beliefs .
CLS contends that courts have long recognized that the First Amendment right of expressive association includes the right to exclude those who are not committed to the group ’s cause .
Indeed , CLS points out that many other organizations that have registered at Hastings have statements in their bylaws allowing them to confine membership and leadership to individuals who believe in the group ’s mission and objectives .
And in most cases , CLS says , groups at the law school can and do regulate membership .
For instance , an environmental group could legally keep climate change skeptics from leadership positions without running afoul of the Hastings anti-discrimination policy .
But because Hastings ’ policy prohibits bias based on religion and sexual orientation ( rather than say , environmental views ) CLS , unlike other groups , could conceivably be forced to allow into its leadership ranks those who do not share its religious or moral beliefs .
In doing this , they say , Hastings is overtly discriminating against religious groups and thus violating the guarantee of religious liberty in the First Amendment ’s free exercise clause .
Protecting the right to ensure that a group ’s members share its basic beliefs is important for all organizations , CLS contends .
The Society further argues that it is particularly important for smaller groups or those with broadly unpopular agendas – which , the Christian Legal Society says , is the case with their group on the Hastings campus – because these types of organizations are more vulnerable to being controlled or harassed by outsiders .
In this case , they say , CLS could easily be compromised and even effectively shut down if large numbers of people hostile to the group were allowed to become voting members and eventually assume leadership positions .
What arguments does Hastings College of Law make in response to the Christian Legal Society ?
In its brief before the Supreme Court , the Hastings College of Law contends that its non-discrimination policy does not violate the Christian Legal Society ’s or any individual ’s First Amendment rights .
To begin with , the law school argues , it is settled law that government entities are allowed to set conditions when offering public subsidies to groups , as long as those conditions 1 ) do not favor certain views over others ( a requirement known as “ viewpoint neutrality ” ) , 2 ) are reasonable in light of the purposes of the program and 3 ) are not coercive .
In this case , Hastings argues that its registration policy does not favor certain viewpoints over others since all officially registered groups on the campus are entitled to set their own policies and to openly express their views .
Indeed , they say , other religious groups have long been registered at the law school without incident .
The only thing registered groups cannot do , the law school points out , is to exclude students from membership .
More specifically , Hastings rejects the claim that its non-discrimination policy imposes a special burden on religious groups ( like CLS ) because of the possibility that religious organizations could be overwhelmed by new members who do not share the group ’s beliefs or mission .
The law school also points out that courts have consistently upheld similar laws banning discrimination , including discrimination based on religion and sexual orientation .
In addition , Hastings says , courts generally recognize that these laws do not run afoul of the First Amendment because they regulate conduct ( in this case , discriminatory conduct ) and not speech .
Hastings also claims that , in addition to being fair and neutral , its non-discrimination policy is reasonable in light of its purpose , which is to ensure “ that the leadership , educational , and social opportunities afforded by registered student organizations are available to all students . ”
The policy is reinforced by the fact that much of the money used to assist officially registered groups comes from the activity fees paid by all students .
“ It is reasonable for Hastings to conclude that students should not have to subsidize group activities that they are formally excluded from participating in , ” the law school ’s brief states .
In addition , Hastings maintains , the non-discrimination policy is required by California state law , which provides that groups receiving funds from the state , including registered student groups , must comply with its anti-discrimination laws .
This includes bans on discrimination based on religion and sexual orientation .
The law school also argues that the conditions it sets for registration , including its non-discrimination policy , are not coercive .
“ A group may abide by the School ’s viewpoint neutral open - membership policy and obtain the modest funding and benefits that go with school recognition or forgo recognition and do as it wishes , ” Hastings states in its brief .
Moreover , they say , the benefits that come with recognition are so modest ( primarily small amounts of funding and priority in reservations for rooms ) that it is hard to argue ( as CLS does ) that loss of these benefits amounts to a significant burden on First Amendment rights of speech or association .
Indeed , the university states that the group can still operate on campus without restriction and can even use rooms at the law school for meetings .
And if CLS were to register , Hastings says , the open membership policy would not , as the group claims , force it to accept leaders who do not share its beliefs .
Instead , according to the law school , the policy only requires that all students be allowed to become members and that they be eligible for leadership positions .
The university asserts , moreover , that the Society ’s fear that their opponents might take over the group ’s leadership positions is at best hypothetical and is not supported by concrete examples of similar incidents at Hastings or other schools .
Finally , Hastings argues that the Supreme Court has long held that just because the state subsidizes groups that do not discriminate , it is not required to subsidize groups that do engage in discrimination .
Furthermore , they say , allowing CLS to register and receive benefits while it discriminates on the basis of religion and sexual orientation would inevitably lead to similar cases .
Indeed , the state could be forced to subsidize groups that discriminate in other ways – against , say , the disabled or those in the military .
Under CLS ’s logic , the law school contends , “ the official Hastings Outdoor Club could refuse to let student [ military ] reservists participate in a school - subsidized hiking trip because the student leaders of that group disagree with the military ’s conduct of the war on terror .
And Hastings not only would be constitutionally precluded from doing anything about it , it would have to subsidize the group ’s activities and let it use the School ’s name . ”
What might be the significance of Christian Legal Society v. Martinez ?
If the justices rule in favor of Hastings and determine that its anti-discrimination provision does not burden CLS ’s First Amendment right to expressive association , the decision is likely to have a limited impact outside of educational settings .
At publicly funded educational institutions of all kinds , however , a ruling in favor of Hastings might embolden some schools to enact tighter restrictions on eligibility for student activity funding and resources .
At these institutions , a decision for Hastings might give officials greater confidence that when they set conditions on groups that accept public money , they will not be violating their First Amendment freedoms .
If , however , the court finds that the non-discrimination rules impermissibly burden CLS ’s rights , then the decision could have a broad impact that extends beyond educational institutions .
Not only would this ruling protect the right of religiously based groups , like the Christian Legal Society , to receive support at places like Hastings , it might also allow groups that discriminate based on other criteria , such as race or gender , to gain equal access to public forums .
Furthermore , if the court extends the reach of this decision to all government funding programs ( as opposed to only those , like the one at Hastings , that concern public forums for speech ) then its potential impact would be very significant .
Such a ruling could lead to dramatic changes in this area of law by inviting courts to much more thoroughly scrutinize the conditions that accompany government aid programs , ranging from public welfare funding to higher education scholarships .

New York state and city are drowning in red ink , but do n’t waste your breath telling it to government unions .
They got theirs , and they ’ll do anything and everything to keep it .
Gov. Paterson ’s plan to delay 4 percent raises so the state does n’t run out of cash is met with threats of lawsuits .
Mayor Bloomberg ’s call for relatively modest spending cuts provokes warnings that the city will sink into the Hudson if a penny is subtracted from bloated budgets .
The way organized labor sees it , sacrifice is for suckers .
Let somebody else pay .
There once was a time when public - employee unions were responsible citizens .
They saw their members ’ well - being directly tied to the well - being of the people and institutions they served .
The movement was probably more militant 40 years ago , but it famously did its part to help the city out of the fiscal crisis of the ’70s .
That is ancient history .
The modern movement has seceded from reality .
Instead of recognizing it needs a healthy New York to survive , it aims to bleed the public dry , then demand a bailout .
Or maybe it thinks it can just move on to another “ host ” until it , too , runs out of money .
Have n’t the bosses heard ?
Greed is no longer good .
Oblivious to the pain inflicted on taxpayers less well off than they are , the state teachers union is sticking to its predictions of doomsday if education spending is touched .
The union newspaper , New York Teacher , reports President Dick Iannuzzi warned that Paterson ’s plan to cut $ 1.7 billion “ will devastate New York ’s schools and colleges and derail any hope for economic recovery . ”
This is hooey , a ritualistic scaremongering that calls into question the ability of teachers to actually teach if they have no regard for facts .
“ Albany , do right by our kids , ” the newspaper de mands on Page 1 .
Here ’s a novel thought :
How about unions do right by our kids ?
If they care about New York stu dents , they ’ll step up to the plate and help minimize the impact of sensible reductions .
The fat is easy to find .
Educrats are spreading like poison ivy at the city ’s Department of Education .
In the last decade , the payroll has swelled by more than 21,000 teachers and other “ pedagogical ” employees , pushing the total from 90,000 to 112,000 .
Meanwhile , student enrollment has declined by about 50,000 , to 1.04 million , according to the city ’s Independent Budget Office .
We know where hundreds of these phantom teachers are — in the rubber rooms , perfecting their napping skills .
Thank ironclad union rules for that giant rip - off .
The ranks of other aides are also soaring .
From about 15,000 in 2003 , there are now nearly 25,000 full - time equivalents on the payroll , the IBO says .
The pension debacle is well known , with the city ’s costs for all employees going from $ 1.4 billion eight years ago to $ 7.1 billion next year .
None of this would have happened had a succession of politicians not caved in to labor ’s demands .
But mayors and governors , council members and legislators have feathered their nests by buying off the unions .
And now the bill is busting New York .
Paterson proclaims himself surprised workers wo n’t give back in the emergency .
“ I am just shocked and amazed that every time you ask the special interests or the unions for some kind of sacrifice that the answer is either ‘ no ’ or ‘ I ’m going to sue you , ’ ” he said .
The shock is that he ’s shocked .
True sense of the word

Obama ’s anti-Israel impulses
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly canceled his trip to Washington because he feared an Arab “ ambush . ”
Maybe so , but it ’s more likely he feared an ambush by President Obama .
That Arabs and Muslims want to bury Israel is n’t new .
The change is that the United States is providing the shovel .
Netanyahu does n’t have to be paranoid to see Obama ’s nuclear conference as a set - up .
Israel almost certainly has a nuke or three , yet wo n’t say and has n’t signed the nonproliferation pact .
Arab states say they want the truth about Israel ’s arsenal and want to use the conference to push for details .
Notice none of them , including Washington , is doing much to stop Iran , however .
Netanyahu had another reason to unpack his bags , after reports surfaced that Obama is developing his own plan for an Israeli - Palestinian deal and intends to impose it on both sides .
One report said he wants to force Israel to remove 133,000 Israelis from parts of Jerusalem and the West Bank .
It ’s a risky move for the US to get so deeply involved , with Henry Kissinger warning in a recent forum that “ if you impose it , you own it . ”
And the timing could n’t be worse , with Obama already revealing his anti-Israel impulses .
The humiliating tongue - lashing he and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivered to Netanyahu left most Israelis distrustful of him and the Israeli government far less inclined to bend to his wishes , especially because he seems ready to accept a nuclear Iran .
Meanwhile , Palestinians see the same beatdown and believe they do n’t have to make concessions because Obama will force them all from Israel .
The result is that Obama has taken a bad situation and made it worse .
Heckuva job , Mr. President .
More from the ‘ spinster ’ gray lady
Oops , they did it again .
The New York Times ’ article about the Qatari diplomat ’s suspicious behavior on an airplane reveals more about the newspaper than the dopey diplo .
“ Few Worry About Overreaction When Man Smokes on a Plane , ” the above - the - fold Page 1 headline blared .
Declaring the response , which included air marshals guarding the Qatari and fighter jets escorting the plane to Denver , an “ overreaction ” is typical of the paper ’s uber - left politics .
What was n’t typical was that in finding that “ Few Worry , ” the Times was conceding that its own bias was n’t shared by many Americans .
Here ’s a safe bet about the process .
An editor or a reporter looked at initial reports and decided officials grossly overreacted .
That ’s how the Times often works these days — get facts that fit the opinion .
But they could n’t find any , so they sneakily stuck to their conclusion by writing in an incredulous tone about the national shrug of shoulders .
See , the Times is outraged , and it is outraged more Americans are n’t outraged .
Oh , I ’m outraged , all right .
I ’m outraged the Qatari was using diplomatic immunity to visit a convicted al Qaeda agent in a maximum - security prison .
The agent pleaded guilty to terror charges and admitted Khalid Sheik Mohammed , who planned the 9/11 attacks , sent him to the US in 2001 .
And I ’m outraged that when he was confronted about smoking , the Qatari made a joke about trying to light his shoe , like the shoe bomber .
All of this behavior the Times finds “ routine . ”
That ’s the real outrage .
Good riddance !
Michigan Democrat Bart Stupak , who faced a hometown revolt over his vote for the health - care monstrosity , wo n’t seek re-election .
You know what that is ?
A good start .
BOSTON — Father Clancy Donahue of St. Michael Catholic Church told reporters Wednesday that while he believed in blindly adhering to the dogma and ceremonies of his faith , he tried not to get too bogged down by actual spirituality .
“ I ’m not so much into having a relationship with God as I am into mechanically conducting various rituals , ” Donahue said .
“ To me , it just feels empty to contemplate a higher power without blindly obeying canon law and protecting the church as an institution . ”
Donahue emphasized that although he did not personally agree with those who pondered the eternal , he had nothing against them .

A proposed Utah law that would open women who suffer a miscarriage to possible criminal prosecution and life imprisonment has enraged feminists and civil rights activists across the United States .
Adopted overwhelmingly by both sides of the state legislature in Salt Lake City earlier this month , the draft bill is now awaiting the signature of the state 's Republican Governor , Gary Herbert .
It is not clear if the growing national controversy surrounding the proposed law will slow or even stay his pen .
While the main thrust of the law is to enable prosecutors in the majority - Mormon state to pursue women who seek illegal , unsupervised forms of abortion , it includes a provision that could trigger murder charges against women found guilty of an " intentional , knowing or reckless act " that leads to a miscarriage .
Some say this could include drinking one glass of wine too many , walking on an icy pavement or skiing .
Lawmakers were responding to the case of a 17 - year - old pregnant Utah woman who paid a man $ 150 to assault her physically in the hope that the beating would cause her to miscarry .
The child was born anyway and put up for adoption .
And while the man involved is currently behind bars , prosecutors found they had no basis in state law to prosecute the young woman .
She was in her seventh month when she tried to terminate her pregnancy .
Last - minute efforts to remove reference in the bill to " reckless " acts failed , feeding the uproar about a law that some people say would be impossible to implement and threatens basic freedoms of women .
Statistics suggest that 15 to 20 per cent of recognized pregnancies end in miscarriage .
" This creates a law that makes any pregnant woman who has a miscarriage potentially criminally liable for murder , " said Missy Bird , director of Planned Parenthood Action Fund of Utah , part of the national organization that champions abortion rights .
Critics also note that the bill has no exemptions for women who suffer domestic abuse or who have addiction problems .
They wonder , for example , about the putative case of a woman remaining with an abusive partner and suffering a miscarriage after an episode of violence .
Would remaining in that relationship constitute " reckless " behavior , they ask ?
Abortion remains deeply contentious in the United States , where , with some restrictions , it has been legal under the terms of the landmark Roe v Wade ruling by the Supreme Court of 1973 .
The issue returned to the front pages last month when Scott Roeder was tried and convicted for the murder in Kansas last August of one of the few doctors legally providing late - term abortions in the country .
The reaction to Utah 's new initiative has verged in most quarters on disbelief , however .
" For all these years the anti-choice movement has said ' we want to outlaw abortion , not put women in jail ' , but what this law says is ' no , we really want to put women in jail ' , " Lynn Paltrow , executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women , wrote in a blog .
Similarly astonished is the syndicated columnist Dan Savage .
" Where will this insanity end ? " he wrote .
" If every miscarriage is a potential homicide , how does Utah avoid launching a criminal investigation every time a woman has a miscarriage ?
And how is Utah supposed to know when a pregnant woman has had a miscarriage ?
You 're going to have to create some sort of pregnancy registry to keep track of all those fetuses .
Perhaps you could start issuing ' conception certificates ' to women who get pregnant .
And then , if there is n't a baby within nine months of the issuance of a conception certificate , the woman could be hauled in for questioning . "
Utah is used to criticism from some of its more liberal neighbors for its socially conservative ways that range from allowing concealed guns on its state university campus to strict limits on alcohol sales .
It has not gone unnoticed that consideration of the bill , with the potentially high costs it would entail , has coincided with a debate on canceling the last year of school for Utah children to help to save the state money .
They were three young boys who nearly a lifetime ago spent their spare hours scavenging for the treasures that seemed to sprout from the desert all around their small , isolated Utah town .
Jim Redd often led the way in the hunt for centuries - old arrowheads and ancient pots littering the ground in Blanding and beyond .
Then he would return to compare and swap his finds with his close friends , Austin Lyman and Winston Hurst .
" That was our way of life , " said Lyman , now 62 .
" You could find it just everywhere .
You can go any direction from Blanding and there 'll be mounds and dwellings and arrowheads and pottery and artefacts . "
In the 1950s , collecting pre-Columbian antiquities was already a local tradition and the three boys , like most people in the town , gave little thought to the native Americans who had lived on the same land a millennium before them .
The children mostly favoured arrowheads .
Their parents lined mantelpieces with finely decorated pottery snatched from the soil , and hung the ancient jewellery on their walls .
" It was a treasure hunt , " said Hurst .
" It was fun to trade with each other .
That 's what we did .
We hunted rabbits , we dug in ruins .
Who knew ? "
But decades later , the three friends ' old pastime has wrought bitterness and tragedy .
They fell out badly after Hurst became an archaeologist and came to see the town 's obsession with collecting ancient artefacts as a desecration .
Then last year , 150 FBI agents swooped on Blanding , arresting some of the town 's most prominent citizens , including Redd , Lyman 's three older brothers and the brother of the county sheriff , on charges of dealing in antiquities plundered from state land .
Redd , by then a popular local doctor , killed himself the next day .
Two other people caught up in the case , including the FBI 's principal informer , also took their lives in the following months .
Meanwhile Lyman 's brothers , along with 23 other people , are expected to go on trial within weeks .
" They 're calling us all here lifelong criminals , " said Lyman .
" I 'm sure there 's been money made but there 's no multimillion network here that I 'm aware of .
It 's surely not my three brothers , who are all on social security . "
Blanding was founded in 1905 by Walter C Lyman , a sometime Mormon missionary , drawn by what was also likely to have attracted the Anasazi people to the area more than a thousand years earlier – the breathtaking location next to the snow - tipped Abajo mountains , canyons and sprawling wilderness , much of which is now national park land .
From the day the first white settlers arrived they noticed the remains of the Anasazi artefacts .
" The pottery was so commonplace that kids would use them for target practice , they would throw rocks at them , " said Blanding 's mayor , Toni Turk .
" There was nothing particularly special about them .
Some people started seeing in them some art value for themselves and they 'd start collecting .
I know [ where ] one part of the family would collect the pottery and the other part of the family would collect arrow heads .
They became specialists but it was primarily for personal collection . "
By the 1960s much of what was readily visible on the ground had been collected and some residents took to digging in to the ancient dwellings and burial sites .
" Some people went in with heavy machinery , " said Turk .
" It took a lot of the labour off the effort to dig up the graves .
They dug down to get to the treasures .
There are those who stepped across lines of propriety .
They got into looting of graves and grave goods . "
By then Hurst had become an archaeologist and questioned the popular view that collecting artefacts was innocent fun .
He fell out with Redd who remained an enthusiastic collector .
Hurst said : " Anybody can walk out there , find the stuff , plunder it , take it home and almost no one understands the implications of what they 're doing .
They do n't understand how the stripping of what 's out there , how you might as well walk in to the library and start cutting the words out of the pages of the Dead Sea Scrolls .
It 's the primary record of the human experience and they 're beating the crap out of it .
" I 've been physically sick , truly nauseated by things I 've seen walking in to these sites .
One day you 've got a relatively intact site that 's been sitting there for 12,000 years and the next day it 's a bombed - out crater , a landscape of craters and human bones strewn all over the place .
It can never be put back together again and you never know what was taken away . "
Hurst says that of the 28,000 documented ancient sites in the local county he has not seen one not damaged by looting .
" But there 's also quite a bit left .
That 's why it 's still a fight , " he said .
The laws against removing artefacts from state - owned land have been in place almost as long as Blanding has existed , even if residents gave them little thought .
But theygot a wake - up call with an FBI raid in 1986 which led to the seizure of artefacts that ended up in the hands of the local museum , including 900 - year - old baskets and pottery almost as pristine as the day it was made .
After the raid the consensus in the town was that even if the collecting had to stop what was already taken was safe .
But a few years later a thriving market in ancient artefacts emerged on the internet .
Again , the FBI took notice as some of Blanding 's residents started to cash in on what they kept at home .
An FBI informant , Ted Gardiner , over many months secretly recorded the Lyman brothers , Redd and others offering their collections for sale .
Gardiner , a troubled man with a long history of alcohol abuse , said he volunteered to cooperate with the FBI and the authorities and denied he was coerced into being an informant .
But his critics in Blanding questioned his motives by noting that Gardiner was himself a collector and dealer in ancient artefacts , and was paid at least $ 224,000 ( £ 150,000 ) for working with the FBI , according to court papers .
The town 's residents began to suspect government entrapment when it became known that Gardiner paid $ 11,000 alone to one prominent Blanding resident , David Lacy , a high - school maths teacher and brother of the county sheriff , for an ancient turkey feather blanket , sandals taken from a burial chamber and several other items .
Turk says that kind of money had many local people rushing to sell collections they had kept for years .
" You 've got these pots that have been passed down to you by your grandfather and maybe you need a little money , " he said .
Hurst is sceptical , and the FBI says Gardiner hooked in to an existing network that was already getting rich off illegal dealings in ancient artefacts .
But there is near universal agreement in Blanding that the FBI handled the case badly , particularly the arrest raid .
The mayor says it pushed Redd to kill himself .
" I think locally there 's an awful lot of feeling that the way the arrests went down , the shackling of old men in their pyjamas had a significant impact on Dr Redd 's decision [ to take his life ] .
He had been previously arrested on similar charges .
The way that it was handled he probably thought , ' I 'm gonna lose everything I have .
I 'm gonna lose my licence , I 'm gonna lose my guns .
Life 's not worth living anymore ' .
So he hooks the exhaust up to his Jeep and asphyxiates himself , " said Turk .
A quarter of the town turned out for the doctor 's funeral .
Two months later , Redd 's wife and daughter were convicted of illegal trafficking in antiquities .
Lyman , who is a case worker at Blanding 's day - care centre for the elderly , has a picture of Redd in his office .
" We went to school together , we grew up together .
That 's just like cutting off half my body , losing Dr Redd .
He was just like a brother since we were both born .
I still miss him every day , " he said .
Another of those detained , a dealer in neighbouring New Mexico , shot himself a week later .
Then , in March , Gardiner also took his own life .
His family said he had become highly unstable as the burden of the other suicides and the prospect of giving evidence weighed on him .
Lyman said : " I just hoped that maybe things would turn out a little better .
Maybe there wo n't be a trial after all . "
• This article was amended on 16 and 27 April 2010 .
The original said that the FBI " arrested and turned " Ted Gardiner .
( His arrest was unconnected with the artefacts case , and was by the police . )
A sub -heading in the original suggested that all three deaths mentioned took place in Blanding .
A typographical error had the town " founded in 1950 " .
This has been corrected .

It ’s another extra -large cartoon on a 3 ″ x 5 ″ sticky note – I ’ve been drawing a bunch of big cartoons like this for the book .
Here are some more alternate endings .
So , uh , the Tea Party Express rolled into Boston today .
Sarah Palin spoke , but I was too late to catch that .
Predictably , lots of middle - aged white people who love flags showed up to rally against perceived threats of socialism in a public park .
Of course , it would n't be Boston without a sizable number of creative counter - protests .
Without further adieu , picspam .
ONE INCIDENT IS REAL , ONE IS NOT ….
Arguably this week ’s most dangerous instance of Tea Party extremism involves Rep. Tom Perriello ( D - Va. ) .
Right - wing activists posted what they thought was the congressman ’s home address , but it turned out to be the address of his brother ’s house .
That detail did n’t stop someone from going to the home and , according to the FBI , deliberately severing a gas line .
Today , however , the Washington Post editorial page drew a parallel between the Perriello incident and “ the bullet fired through a window of Mr. Cantor ’s campaign office . ”
And this is why the Washington Post editorial board makes me sad .
To be sure , I can understand why the Post might be confused .
Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) , the House Minority Whip , told reporters in a nationally televised news conference yesterday :
“ I ’ve received threats since I assumed elected office — not only because of my position , but also because I ’m Jewish .
I ’ve never blamed anyone in this body for that .
“ Just recently I have been directly threatened : A bullet was shot through the window of my campaign office in Richmond this week . ”
The remarks generated some strikingly irresponsible “ journalism . ”
Fox News told viewers about the incident in which a “ gunman shoots up ” the office of the Republican House leader .
At this point , here ’s what we know about Cantor ’s tall tale ( details that were available yesterday , and which the WaPo editorial board should have considered before publishing ) :
1. Cantor was never threatened .
In fact , local police believe the bullet had been fired in the air , and ended up hitting a window at random .
2 . It was n’t Cantor ’s campaign office .
3 . The office was not “ shot up . ”
According to a statement from the Richmond Police Department , “ The round struck with enough force to break the windowpane but did not penetrate the window blinds .
There was no other damage to the room . ”
Taken together , what Cantor told reporters — and the entire country — was clearly false .
When he said he was “ directly threatened , ” Cantor was either shamelessly , blatantly lying , or he was popping off about a harmless incident without getting his facts straight .
It ’s a credibility - killing moment for the Minority Whip , or at least it would be if major media outlets were willing to consider the veracity of his claim .
At this point , Cantor has a responsibility to apologize and / or retract his bogus claim .

Greece put itself and the EU in uncharted waters this week by becoming the first eurozone country to ask for a loan lifeline involving the IMF as its economy risked running aground .
Athens on Friday called on the EU and the IMF to activate a rescue plan worth € 45 - billion ( $ 60 - billion ) to keep its head above water as the Greek prime minister described the country as a “ ship about to sink ” .
“ All of us … inherited a ship that is about to sink , ” Premier George Papandreou told Greeks on Friday from the tiny Aegean island of Kastellorizo as he lambasted his conservative predecessors for their handling of the economy .
“ We are on a difficult course , a new Odyssey for Hellenism , ” he said , referring to the Greek hero ’s great voyage home from the Trojan War of antiquity .
The government said its hand was forced after the European Commission on Friday issued a sharp revision on its 2009 public deficit , followed by a new downgrade on its debt by ratings agency Moody ’s , the latest in recent weeks .
“ As the Greek saying goes , five in the hand is preferable to the hope of ten , ” said political analyst George Sefertzis .
“ The IMF has been linked to anti-social policies [ in return for aid ] but ensuring that the country does not go bankrupt is a much better overall defense of the poorer classes , ” he said .
As the Greek finance minister headed to Washington for a scheduled International Monetary Fund meeting and his staff brokered the emergency loan terms with a mission of EU , ECB and IMF officials in Athens , Greeks wondered where their future lay .
Quality of life
“ This will change basic facts about our quality of life , ” said Vassilis Korkidis , head of the Greek traders confederation .
“ Nobody can say what the final outcome of this choice will be , ” he added .
The government on Friday admitted that its efforts to win over sceptical markets with tough crisis policies had failed and that those very efforts risked being nullified by the additional cost of Greece ’s steeply rising loan rates .
The country has overall public debt of about € 300 - billion ( $ 400 - billion ) and the return it must pay to secure new loans has skyrocketed in recent weeks as investors feared Greece may be heading for a default .
The rate on Greek 10 - year bonds — a benchmark instrument — has risen from about 5 % last year to over 8 % this week .
“ Today , the market situation threatens to undermine not only the sacrifices of the Greek people but also the normal progress of the economy , ” Papandreou said .
But after being hit with a barrage of spending cuts and tax hikes worth around € 16 - billion this year , many Greeks — and especially labour unions — are saying enough is enough .
Repercussions
“ The question is who will decide on policies and how ? ” Korkidis said .
“ Are we giving up central functions and responsibilities to a group a technocrats , and what repercussions will these decisions have on the social state ? ” he said .
So far the bulk of cuts have hit the Greek civil service , a haven of fiscal waste that successive governments had not dared to touch .
A source of envy and resentment for many Greeks — particularly those not employed in it — it was padded for decades with political appointees and became a byword for sloth .
But while Greeks concede the end of the civil service bonanza was long overdue , there are fears that the EU and IMF will demand further austerity measures such as broader wage cuts that will plunge the country into a recession even deeper than the one it currently faces .
The economy is expected to shrink by two percent this year according to the Bank of Greece .
But there are those who see no other way out given Greece ’s troubles .
“ Personally I do n’t have a problem with the IMF , ” said Dionysis , a 50 - year - old cafeteria owner .
“ I mean , who else is going to lend us money anyway ?
Have you seen today ’s spreads ? ” he asks , pointing to a TV screen on his counter .
“ It just may be what Greece needs to clean up its act and maybe get rid of a couple of hundred thousand civil servants , ” he said .
Ending Saturday ’s meeting of the IMF ’s 186 members , managing director Dominique Strauss - Kahn addressed the Greek public ’s opposition to the bail - out .
“ Greek citizens should n’t fear the IMF .
We are there to try to help them , ” he said .
Strauss - Kahn had earlier promised that the Fund will “ move expeditiously ” in response to Greece ’s appeal for help .

Sheriff Joe Arpaio will not run for governor , announcing Monday that he will remain Maricopa County 's top cop for at least two more years .
The decision ends months of speculation , much of it fueled by Arpaio himself , that he would resign from the Sheriff 's Office to run for the state 's top elective office .
Arpaio 's decision to remain sheriff was heavily influenced by the role the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors would play in naming his successor , potentially reshaping the Sheriff 's Office .
Arpaio said he was being loyal to the office 's longtime employees .
" I feel that I owe it to the people of Maricopa County , my hard - working employees and others who believe in my office 's policies to continue as their Sheriff , " Arpaio said in a statement .
" To leave this office open to appointment by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors of an interim Sheriff may very well put us on a path that would be extremely displeasing to the voters of this county . "
Had Arpaio resigned , county supervisors would have had to appoint a successor , just as they did when Rick Romley was named interim county attorney to fill former Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas ' seat when Thomas resigned to run for attorney general .
The prospect of supervisors appointing Arpaio 's successor , and the personnel changes that would follow in the Sheriff 's Office , was too much for Arpaio to risk if he were to run for governor .
Arpaio has battled the supervisors and county administrators for the better part of two years over budget issues , and launched criminal investigations into two members of the Board of Supervisors , Don Stapley and Mary Rose Wilcox .
Arpaio said at a Monday afternoon news conference that he would have been more likely to run for governor if he could have a say in who would replace him as sheriff .
Thomas tried that and failed with his Maricopa County Attorney post when he resigned to run for Arizona attorney general .
" This is tough this time around , " Arpaio said of his decision , adding that he feels relieved to have made a decision .
" It 's almost like being elected today as Sheriff . "
Instead of running for governor , Arpaio will finish out his fifth term in office and begin preparing for a sixth sheriff 's campaign in 2012 .
Arpaio already has more than $ 2 million in campaign contributions , according to his political consultant .
Why China 's exchange rate is a red herring
Avinash Persaud
The US obsession with the Chinese exchange rate is a classic example of blaming foreigners for domestic woes .
This column argues that we ’ve been here before .
In the 1980s , the US government – reacting to political pressure from ailing US manufacturers – engineered a massive yen appreciation .
That did as little to save US manufacturing jobs then as a rise in the yuan would do today .
“ Blame foreigners for domestic woe ” is the sad but unsurprising cardinal rule of politics , followed by even the most ardent internationalist .
After seven years of a consumption binge in the US , evidenced by a negative personal savings rates , excessive leverage , historically high employment levels and record international deficits , commentators in the world 's largest economy did not conclude what every macroeconomic model indicated – that US fiscal and monetary policy were too loose .
Instead , in a manner reminiscent of the Dreyfus Affair , China is being convicted of manipulating its exchange rate and Asia for saving too much .
Doing the math
A favourite , if annoying , American business phrase during the boom years was " do the math " .
Doing the math reveals that changing China 's exchange rate would change very little .
Let us imagine that as a result of a jump in the value of the yuan , China 's $ 175 bn trade surplus were to disappear .
( Incidentally it is far from clear that this would be the result given that this by itself will not shift savings - investment imbalances . )
If China were no longer to run a trade surplus , how much would that boost global GDP ?
By not much more than a rounding error or 0.25 % of global GDP .
In market prices , the Chinese economy is one quarter of the US economy and at the peak of the US trade deficit , China 's surplus was less than a third of it .
David may have toppled Goliath , but he could not carry him .
Fixed and floating manipulation
China held to the same exchange rate peg to the dollar for ten years up to 2005 .
Under a fixed exchange rate , a country only develops increasing trade surpluses as a result of improving price competitiveness .
Of course , for your average American voter familiar with floating currencies , the whole idea of a fixed exchange rate smells of manipulation , but in fact it is easier to " manipulate " a floating exchange rate than a fixed one .
The US will deliberately pursue a policy of a loose monetary policy , partly in order for the dollar to weaken and US exports to grow at the expense of others .
Many Europeans would like their central banks to follow a similar path .
This US policy was precisely the kind of beggar - thy - neighbour currency manipulation the IMF was set up to avoid .
Instead the IMF is questioning whether a pegged exchange rate is manipulative .
Welcome to doublespeak .
Symptoms of a manipulated currency
The principal way to " manipulate " a fixed exchange rate is to use high interest rates and fiscal policy to depress the non-tradeables sector to such an extent that currency inflows from the export surplus do not feed domestic inflation .
This would be a form of economic cannibalism that few countries would wish on their citizens – sacrificing the domestic service sector in order to feed the export sector .
It would be associated with high interest rates , low inflation , and a domestic service sector in depression as the export sector grew .
Instead China boasts moderate to rising interest rates , rising goods inflation and potential asset price inflation , overheating , and record economic growth that is not confined to the export sector .
China was pushed off its fixed exchange rate in 2005 by pressure from the US Congress and has pursued a crawling appreciation since , but this has only served to worsen financial imbalances by attracting an additional US $ 100bn of hot money inflows per year as investors have become convinced the Chinese currency is a one - way bet .
The " savings glut " myth
The notion that the world was suffering from a savings glut , that would have pulled us all into recession were it not for America 's selfless consumption , is also as deficient in arithmetic as it is self - serving .
You can not save yourself into boom .
There is no economic model where excess savings trigger a period of the most rapid and widespread economic growth the world economy has seen .
Repressed consumption would lead to a period of slump , at best offset by US deficits .
But all it would take to deliver precisely the kind of boom - bust cycle we did live through would be loose fiscal , monetary and regulatory policy in the US and elsewhere , fueling a consumption boom in the world 's largest economy that would necessarily lead to surpluses in a swathe of consumer goods and commodity exporters , irrespective of their currency regime , like Germany and Chile .
Economics and politics
We have been here before .
Back in the mid-1980s , Detroit blamed its woes not on the inferior quality of American cars , their gas guzzling , or the fact that the Japanese prefer not to carry all their belongings in the back or to have the steering wheel on the left .
They blamed the yen - dollar exchange rate .
Political pressure pushed the yen up by more than the 27 % being sought today by the US Congress for the yuan .
It did as little to save Detroit then as a rise in the yuan would do today .
China 's exchange rate has far more to do with national politics than international economics , which is one of the reasons why the US Treasury 's assessment of whether China is guilty of currency manipulation may be postponed as a quid pro quo for progress in areas of mutual diplomatic concern between the two countries .
I have no idea what will happen on December 21 , 2012 when the Mayan Calendar ends *.
Maybe the world will end .
Maybe it wo n’t .
Maybe the poles will shift ?
Maybe the Earth ’s axis will wobble ?
Maybe we ’ll all wake up as usual and go to bed as usual .
Maybe .
I do know there are lots of people making money out of 2012 and the shelves in bookstores are filling up with tomes on the end of the world as we know it .
On the corner of a major intersection in Victoria , BC where I live , a bedraggled guy holds a sign warning of the wages of sin and the end of times .
Funny , I thought I saw the same guy holding the same sign in Vancouver in 1970 .
I am not going to be fooled again .
Back on December 31 , 1999 , I remember counting down the minutes to midnight with friends and family , waiting for the grid to go down as Y2 k ticked closer .
I had stocked up on mushroom soup and toilet paper .
I might still have some of those soup cans .
Last month , Associated Press writer Mark Stevenson reported that Mayan Apolinario Chile Pixtun is weary of questions about the Mayan calendar supposedly ending on December 21 , 2012 .
“ I came back from England last year and , man , they had me fed up with this stuff , ” said the Mayan elder .
Now , not myth
Here ’s what bugs me — the world as we know it is ending .
We do n’t need to wait for 2012 .
Change is definitely happening and it ’s hard to deny it .
Some things that were , are no more .
Some things that are , will soon be gone .
It ’s called climate change , or global warming .
Yet instead of really focusing on what we must do to slow climate change , our mass media focuses on Mayan myths and last year ’s release of the profit - focused 2012 starring John Cusack .
Here ’s what we know for sure is not movie myth :
The snows of Kilimanjaro are melting .
Polar bears wander the arctic , hungry , as their traditional hunting territory literally melts .
Warming waters in the shallow oceans have contributed to the death of about a quarter of the world ’s coral reefs in the last few decades alone .
Greenland ’s ice sheet is melting .
The amount of ice melt during the summer of 2007 was the largest since scientists first started making satellite measurements of the ice in 1979 .
According to climate scientist Konrad Steffen , the amount of ice lost in 2007 was “ the equivalent of two times all the ice in the Alps , or a layer of water more than one - half mile deep covering Washington , D.C. ”
An oxygen - depleted dead zone the size of New Jersey is starving sea life off the coast of Oregon and Washington , reports Kim Murphy of the LA Times .
It will probably appear there each summer as a resu lt of “ evolving wind conditions likely brought on by a changing climate , rather than pollution , ” according to Jack Barth , professor of physical oceanography at Oregon State University .
On his site Global Issues , Anup Shah has dedicated significant time and resources to providing a comprehensive overview of climate change and other issues affecting our Earth .
His message — we ca n’t wait to act .
He is not alone in his opinion .
“ We have to do it this year .
Not next year – this year , ” said Al Gore at the World Business Summit on Climate Change in Copenhagen .
“ The clock is ticking , because Mother Nature does not do bailouts . ”
Is climate change real ?
Ask the people of the archipelago nation of Maldives .
Eighty percent of its chain of 1,200 islands is no more than 1 m above sea level .
The United Nations ’ Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change is forecasting a rise in sea levels of at least 7.1 inches ( 18 cm ) by the end of the century .
That would mean the people of the Maldives , all of 396,000 of them , will have no home , no country .
Climate change will claim it and the sea will bury it .
Recently , Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed and his cabinet donned scuba gear for an underwater meeting to focus global attention on the threat of climate change .
The cabinet signed a declaration calling for global cuts in carbon emissions .
The declaration will be presented before the UN climate summit in Copenhagen , Denmark in December .
“ We are trying to send our message to let the world know what is happening and what will happen to the Maldives if climate change is n’t checked , ” Nasheed said .
If urgent action is n’t taken according to Nasheed , “ We are all going to die . ”
It ’s not the kind of thing you usually hear from a president of a nation .
It ’s not the kind of thing you want to hear .
Indeed , denial is easier and so human — an effective but self - defeating shield against fear and despair .
I believe we turn to denial because we really do n’t know how to cope with a problem of this scale and few people with power seem to be offering real leadership .
Certainly Canadian Prime Minister Steven Harper is n’t , but then he has oil to think about , right ?
He was an embarrassment at Copenhagen .
Oh , he dropped by for a little gratuitous visit but avoided doing the real work .
Less predictably , US President Barack Obama was a disappointment when it came to effecting any change at Copenhagen .
Frankly , I expected better of him than I did of Harper , but alas …
Sometimes I think global warming is akin to a fever whose purpose is to fight off infection in a body .
Have we polluted the body of the Earth to the point of infection ?
I do believe this planet we call Earth will survive .
Will the polar bears ?
Will the whales and fish ?
Will the coral reefs ?
Will we ?
The ancient prophesies have n’t been very definitive on this point .
Stay tuned .
* It may be more accurate to say when the current cycle of the Mayan Calendar ends ; many experts state that the Mayans had a circular rather than linear notion of time .

YouTube has begun deleting satirical videos based on the 2004 Hitler movie Downfall after a copyright claim from a German studio .
The subtitled videos , which take a current event – such as DC Comics ' talk of a Watchmen sequel ( above ) – and overlay der Führer 's over - the - top reaction to the news , have turned into a genuine internet meme .
TechCrunch reports that the purge began with a Hitler / iPhone 4G video , which was taken down with the following notice : " This video contains content from Constantin Film , who has blocked it on copyright grounds . "
Plenty of the Downfall videos remain , but who knows for how long .

Jon Callas , who as co-founder and chief technologist of PGP helped bring strong encryption to the masses , has taken a job with Apple working on operating - system security .
His move around the beginning of the year was confirmed by two of his long - time friends and this brief bio , which says Callas remains on PGP 's technical advisory board .
He previously served as CTO and CISO of PGP Corporation since its founding in 2002 .
Callas is the latest celebrity researcher to join Apple 's security team .
Last month , former Mozilla security boss Window Snyder , credited with making Firefox 's security response more professional , took a job in Cupertino 's security department .
And in May 2009 , One Laptop Per Child 's top security architect , Ivan Krstic , signed on to Apple , with the title of " Security Samurai , Core OS . "
Callas did n't respond to an email and phone call seeking details .
His Linked profile lists his position as " Cryptographer at I Could Tell You But Then I 'd Have To Kill You and Associates . "
His move marks the second time he 's been employed at Apple , having worked as a " software developer and researcher focused on new networking and collaboration products " from 1995 to 1997 , according to his resume ( PDF ) .
The new gig is the latest stop on a 25 - year journey that 's also included engineering and software architect positions at the now - defunct Digital Equipment , Counterpane Internet Security ( now owned by BT ) , and Wave Systems .
His biggest claim to fame was his involvement at PGP , which successfully marketed one of the first publicly available implementations of public key encryption , written by Phil Zimmermann .
In the 1990s , Callas served as chief scientist of PGP Inc. , which was purchased in 1997 by Network Associates .
In 2002 , as PGP floundered under its new owners , he was instrumental in regaining the rights to the PGP technology and forming PGP Corporation , along with Phil Dunkelberger , who remains the company 's CEO .
" He 's quite a valuable guy , " Zimmermann told The Register .
" He has good people skills and good perspectives on his craft , which is cryptography . "
During much of his tenure , Zimmermann added , Callas focused on the generation , exchange and safe storage of cryptographic keys , a highly complex procedure generally referred to as key management .
Zimmermann and Bruce Schneier , founder of Counterpane , both confirmed Callas 's new job .
Callas 's precise responsibilities at Apple are unknown .
Given his expertise in cryptography and his focus on OS security , it 's tempting to speculate he 's perfecting FileVault .
The security feature built into Mac OS X encrypts only a user 's home directory , a shortcoming that allows snoops easy access to many sensitive files that by default are stored elsewhere .
While at PGP , Callas oversaw development of software that encrypted Macs ' entire hard drive , according to this 2008 article from CNET 's Declan McCullagh .
But Callas has stressed that his work is by no means limited to encryption .
" I 'm known primary these days as a cryptographer , but I did operating system security for a long time before I did cryptography , " he wrote in a 2009 blog post congratulating Apple on the hire of Krstic .
" In my own mind , I 'm an OS guy who has had a successful side project in crypto . "
He went on to share a bit about his approach for safely engineering new software features that ought to serve Apple well as it continues to bring new classes of devices to market .
" The classic problem with designing new OS concepts is ignoring what went before , " he wrote .
" Any designer of new features and systems needs to answer the question , ' What did MULTICS and VMS do ? '
The best security of the past is rarely met by the present . " ®
THE Anglican Archbishop of Sydney has privately lobbied the Premier , Kristina Keneally , against the permanent introduction of secular ethics classes in public schools , saying they would jeopardise the future of religious education .
Archbishop Peter Jensen said Ms Keneally had promised the Anglican Church would have input into the trial , which would be subject to an independent review .
Cathy Wilcox illustration Credit : Cathy Wilcox
Dr Jensen met Ms Keneally in February to voice his concern that the limited trial of ethics classes , which begins on Monday , could lead to scripture classes being abolished .
He sought the Premier 's assurance that the trial would be genuine , not just a ' ' showpiece which heralds the beginning of classes anyway - in other words a fait accompli' ' .
How very Old Testament of them :
The American Family Association , a religious right group , is urging that Tilikum ( Tilly ) , the killer whale that killed a trainer at SeaWorld Orlando , be put down , preferably by stoning .
Citing Tilly 's history of violent altercations , the group is slamming SeaWorld for not listening to Scripture in how to deal with the animal :
Says the ancient civil code of Israel , " When an ox gores a man or woman to death , the ox shall be stoned , and its flesh shall not be eaten , but the owner shall not be liable . "
( Exodus 21:28 )
I 'm still wrapping my head around how exactly this stoning would go .
Setting aside the strange analogy to an ox , do they trap Tilly in some small tank , so he can't swim out of the way ?
Just how heavy are these stones that could kill an orca ?
Should SeaWorld sell tickets to this ?
Will just one really prolific rock thrower do , or do we need an army ( after all this is a whale we 're talking about ) ?
Would it be Tilly 's trainers that are supposed to do the stoning or is the American Family Association offering to help ?
The mind reels .
In fact , AFA has chastised SeaWorld for ignoring their Biblical responsibility to have destroyed Tilly earlier , as ThinkProgress points out :
The American Family Association , the powerful right - wing Christian political organization , blogged that , “ If the counsel of the Judeo - Christian tradition had been followed , ” Beancheau would have never died .
AFA blogger Bryan Fischer reasoned that according to Exodus , an animal like Tilikum should have been stoned back in 1991 , and if biblical law were to be followed , the owners of Tilikum should be put to death : Chalk another death up to animal rights insanity and to the ongoing failure of the West to take counsel on practical matters from the Scripture . [...]
So , your animal kills somebody , your moral responsibility is to put that animal to death .
You have no moral culpability in the death , because you did n’t know the animal was going to go postal on somebody .
But , the Scripture soberly warns , if one of your animals kills a second time because you did n’t kill it after it claimed its first human victim , this time you die right along with your animal .
To use the example from Exodus , if your ox kills a second time , “ the ox shall be stoned , and its owner also shall be put to death . ” ( Exodus 21:29 )
Oh dear .
How on earth do you reason with someone who pulls out the Old Testament to say that you should be killed for not destroying an orca ?
For an antidote , the folks at Orca Network have a more reason - based perspective .
A security expert that build his career on identifying vulnerabilities in Microsoft software now says that the company has come a long way .
Marc Maiffret , a former hacker turned legitimate security researcher , and now chief security architect at FireEye , told InSecurity Complex that Apple ’s software was inferior to Microsoft ’s in terms of security and the capacity of protecting end users , despite claims to the contrary by the Cupertino - based hardware company .
In fact , Maiffret put Apple on the spot for marketing its software as more secure than Microsoft products , noting that it was just marketing and nothing more .
Still , the former hacker indicated that he had witnessed Apple starting to change its ways , and care more about security .
“ It 's even a little scarier with them because they try to market themselves as more secure than the PC , that you do n't have to worry about viruses , etc .
Anytime there 's been a hacking contest , within a few hours someone 's found a new Apple vulnerability .
If they were taking it seriously , they would n't claim to be more secure than Microsoft because they are very much not .
And the Apple community is pretty ignorant to the risks that are out there as it relates to Apple .
The reason we do n't see more attacks out there compared to Microsoft is because their market share is n't near what Microsoft 's is , ” he stated .
According to Maiffret , before Apple only recently , in the past six months , started caring more about securing its products , it was at the same level as Microsoft before the January 2002 Trustworthy Computing memo from Bill Gates .
But while he slapped Apple over the wrist , Maiffret praised Microsoft not only for the progress it had done over the better part of the past decade , but also because of the Security Development Lifecycle .
“ Now when you look at Microsoft today they do more to secure their software than anyone .
They 're the model for how to do it .
They 're not perfect ; there 's room for improvement .
But they are definitely doing more than anybody else in the industry , I would say , ” he underlined . “ [ … ]
From an internal process in how they go about auditing their code and securing software from a technical perspective , they do have one of the best models .
The area they still have room for improvement is around time lines of how long it takes for them to fix things . ”
The Security Development Lifecycle is a model deployed by Microsoft internally , designed to secure software as much as possible by doing extensive testing to filter out vulnerabilities , and also ensure that when flaws do exist , mitigations are in place to make exploits extremely difficult , if not impossible .
Windows Vista , the first Windows client to be produced in accordance with the best practices of the SDL , was also the company ’s most secure operating system in history .
Windows 7 was built on Vista ’s legacy , and is bound to be just as , if not even more , secure compared with its predecessor .
In the first week of April 2010 , Microsoft published the Security Development Lifecycle ( SDL ) Version 5 for all third - party software developers to leverage in their products .

This may seriously be my favorite picture ever taken from space : the view from inside the International Space Station as it heads toward the aurora at 28,000 kilometers per hour :
This picture was taken by Soichi Noguchi looking out of the newly installed ISS cupola , which provides dramatic vistas of space from inside the station .
You can see the Soyuz module that carried astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson on board -- incidentally , with Discovery on its way to the ISS carrying three women , this will be the first time four women will have been in space simultaneously .
[ Update : According to commenter Ben Honey , that 's actually a Progress capsule , and not the Soyuz .
The profile does match a Progress , so I assume he 's right .
I stand corrected . ]
This image is simply fantastic .
The aurora , commonly called the northern lights , are caused by subatomic particles slamming into our atmosphere and ionizing the oxygen and nitrogen atoms there like shrapnel from bullets hitting a target .
Guided by the Earth 's magnetic field , these particles tend to hit at high latitudes .
The glow itself is similar to that of a neon sign : when the wayward electrons recombine with the atoms , they give off light .
The colors are characteristic of the atom in question , and can be used to identify the atmospheric constituents .
The green glow is actually much lower than the ISS ; that part of the aurora is usually at a height of 100 or so kilometers ( 60 miles ) , while ISS is at 400 km ( 240 miles ) .
The red glow can reach higher , to more than 500 km ( 300 miles ) , so when Soichi says he is flying through the aurora he is literally correct .
The fantastic speed of the ISS is apparent in the trailing of the stars in the image , and the streaking of the purple clouds below .
Astonishing , lovely , poetic , beautiful ... and Holy Haleakala , real .
When we humans want and choose to , we can fly through the northern lights .
What else can we accomplish when we set our minds to it ?
Like everyone else , I too struggle to comprehend the meaning of life and my place in the “ Grand Scheme of Things ” .
As the years pass and experiences accumulate into a collection of blurry images all strangely framed by Polaroid paper , I ca n’t help but come to the conclusion that it ’s all a bit pointless .
Religion that is .
Now I could blame Richard Dawkins and his zealously anti-religious campaign or maybe it ’s the hilarious muppet show put on my al - Mouhajiroun / Islam4Uk .
But however much vocal media personalities may sway your opinion , ultimately the question of “ who am I ” can only be answered by ourselves .
As a dashingly handsome young Muslim man living in one of the greatest cities on Earth it is not hard to have your resolutely held beliefs smashed to pieces one by one .
Look around your office – can you honestly say they are all going to hell ?
And if so just what did they do to warrant such condemnation ?
Do you as a Muslim have the confidence in your belief to walk up to any one of your non-Muslim co-workers and tell them they are destined for eternal condemnation because they showed too much skin ?
Or rather do you , like the majority of the billion plus Muslims on Earth put your head down , splutter under your breath and proceed to collect your pay packet on Friday .
The question is – have you made a mockery of your faith or has your faith made a mockery of you ?
I ca n’t help but think it ’s the latter .
That is one of the central debates Mr. Obama must resolve in the next few weeks , his aides say .
Many elements of the new strategy have already been completed , according to senior administration and military officials who have been involved in more than a half - dozen Situation Room debates about it , and outside strategists consulted by the White House .
As described by those officials , the new strategy commits the United States to developing no new nuclear weapons , including the nuclear bunker - busters advocated by the Bush administration .
But Mr. Obama has already announced that he will spend billions of dollars more on updating America ’s weapons laboratories to assure the reliability of what he intends to be a much smaller arsenal .
Increased confidence in the reliability of American weapons , Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in a speech in February , would make elimination of “ redundant ” nuclear weapons possible .
“ It will be clear in the document that there will be very dramatic reductions — in the thousands — as relates to the stockpile , ” according to one senior administration official whom the White House authorized to discuss the issue this weekend .
Much of that would come from the retirement of large numbers of weapons now kept in storage .
Other officials , not officially allowed to speak on the issue , say that in back - channel discussions with allies , the administration has also been quietly broaching the question of whether to withdraw American tactical nuclear weapons from Europe , where they provide more political reassurance than actual defense .
Those weapons are now believed to be in Germany , Italy , Belgium , Turkey and the Netherlands .
At the same time , the new document will steer the United States toward more non-nuclear defenses .
It relies more heavily on missile defense , much of it arrayed within striking distance of the Persian Gulf , focused on the emerging threat from Iran .
Mr. Obama ’s recently published Quadrennial Defense Review also includes support for a new class of non-nuclear weapons , called “ Prompt Global Strike , ” that could be fired from the United States and hit a target anywhere in less than an hour .
I 've never understood the hysteria around Perl 6 .
Which is to say , I do n't get why sooooo many people like poking at it as if it's a " weakness " of the Perl community , that it 's vapourware or it 's being done wrong and so forth .
I 've skimmed the Perl 6 design notes meetings since chromatic started publishing them .
I 've repeated peeked at how many spec tests Rakudo is passing .
I 've perused moritz 's excellent Perl 5 to 6 posts which were awesome .
I have n't gotten deep into Perl 6 though because I just do n't have the time at this point in my life .
But I will .
Hopefully on Rakudo * as that 's about when my life should slow down a notch .
Because I know it 's coming .
Because I know there are great people like Patrick working on it .
Because it 's interesting .
Because I can .
At the same time I know Perl 5 is n't going anywhere for a while either ... and I like the new stuff perl5porters have been doing there .
I 'll happily hack at Perl 5 for years to come .
So , thank you Patrick , particularly in this difficult time for you .
Thank you for your work .
Thank you for your time .
Thank you for caring about doing something right .
People need to stop worrying about Perl 6 and let these folk do what they need to .
NOT having Perl 6 right now hurts no one .
If you really have an issue with how it 's being done , get involved .
I think " Anonymous Monk " does serve a purpose but I 'm always sad when it 's used as a shield so someone can pass judgment or be unreasonable or just plain rude .
Be constructive and be helpful .

This is a good point to also add my personal thanks to you for the well - reasoned responses to the FUD both here and in other forums like Ars Technica .
I do really enjoy it when you and others are also shining lights through the smoke screens that some authors keep throwing up ( although not as much as I would enjoy not having any smoke in the first place ) .
Thanks .

Here 's another anonymous monk , are n't those guys annoying ?
Anyway no disrespect to anyone , and I wish Patrick and his family all the best .
I 'd like to say that I think the Perl 6 team is doing a great job , it 's a difficult task with few people people working on it .
But " the hysteria around Perl 6 " is basically the following :
We got Perl 5 in 1994 , around 2000 we got the Perl 6 announcement and initially had a submission process for new ideas .
If you read some of these you 'll see that people mostly did n't want to turn Perl 6 into the total rewrite it has become .
Most of the suggestions were along the lines of fixing the return value of chomp , giving us a better object system , or fixing path handling .
How about having a built - in way to slurp a file ?
In short , Perl 6 might have been basically a re-iteration of Perl 5 in the same way that Perl 5 was for Perl 4 .
Only this time we could break backwards compatibility to fix some of the hairier bits .
Had this been done we might have gotten something in 2 - 4 years that was production ready ( ran all of CPAN ) and cleaned up the worst warts .
Had we cleaned up the worst parser edge cases you might be running jPerl on your JVM now instead of jRuby .
Instead Perl 6 took the form of creating Carl Sagan 's apple pie .
Before it could be created they were going to invent the universe .
Parrot was to be created from scratch not only to run Perl 6 , but to run everything .
Perl 6 was going to change everything .
We were n't going to use CPAN , but a all new CPAN6 ( still no sign of it ) etc .
The rationale for Parrot in particular seems a bit suspect in retrospect .
It was claimed that there was no existing VM that could run a lot of dynamic languages , now it turns out that the JVM / .
Net can do that just fine ( the VM is n't static , it was just Java that was ) , and of course there were already Lisp / Scheme VMs ( Guile is now running multiple languages ) .
10 years later we still do n't have our apple pie .
I 'm not contributing ( much ) so I 'm not complaining .
But it 's interesting to speculate on what could have happened differently .
Maybe we'd have a Perl 6 for 6 years already by now , Ruby would have never taken off as it did , and some of the Pythonists would have come back .
Maybe I 'd get something else than " Oh Perl , that ugly old crap " and " Perl 6 ?
Are n't they writing DNF in that ? " from people at ( non - Perl ) conferences , but alas .
Perl 6 is really neat .
But even if Rakudo steams on ahead we 're probably 2 - 3 years away from anything approaching a feature complete and usable compiler for Perl 6 with a basic module library .
We 're probably going to need another 5 or so to get decent Perl 5 <->
Perl 6 integration and uptake .
In short , Perl 6 might have been basically a re-iteration of Perl 5 in the same way that Perl 5 was for Perl 4 .
Only this time we could break backwards compatibility to fix some of the hairier bits .
The problem is that -- with that process -- it still takes eight years to build Python 3 , and then you do n't get an object system like Moose , you probably do n't get pervasive laziness , you do n't get pervasive closures , you might get hypotheticals , you do n't get grammars , you might get continuations , you probably do n't get custom operators , you might get multi dispatch , and you probably do n't get a rethinking of context and the type system .
You might get multiple implementations cooperating around a canonical specification .
You almost definitely do n't get a self - hosted grammar as part of that specification .
You do n't get roles .
You get Perl 5 with some of the worst bits of Perl 1 - 4 removed .
Yippee .
Also you 're very , very wrong about the JVM .
Invokedynamic is only the start , unless you want to throw away partial binding , multiple dispatch , continuations , coroutines , lightweight concurrency ... or spend the rest of your life writing trampolines .

Here we go again , a post that is almost entirely filled with speculation divorced from reality ... ( see how many " might haves " and " maybes " there are in the post ) .
If you read some of [ Perl 6 RFCs ] you 'll see that people mostly did n't want to turn Perl 6 into the total rewrite it has become .
Most of the suggestions were along the lines of fixing the return value of chomp , giving us a better object system , or fixing path handling .
First , I claim that " giving us a better object system " ( i.e. , Moose ) would not have happened without having first having had the opportunity to see what would be done by a total rewrite .
( In particular : multimethod dispatch , function signatures , strong typing , invariant sigils on variables , and twigils . )
Second , I think that what Larry and the cabal eventually discovered ( I was n't there at the time ) was that you could n't incorporate most of the new suggestions into Perl without first going through a total rewrite .
Yes , some of the ideas from Perl 6 are now making it into Perl 5 , but I claim that this is possible only because the ideas were discoverable as part of the exercise of creating a total rewrite .
Even if you claim the new concepts would 've been achieved via a simple re-iteration , I 'll still contend that the evidence shows that the timeframe would n't have been significantly shorter than what we have now ( see below ) .
In short , Perl 6 might have been basically a re-iteration of Perl 5 in the same way that Perl 5 was for Perl 4 .
Only this time we could break backwards compatibility to fix some of the hairier bits .
I was n't involved at the time of the RFCs , but my understanding is that the issues involved in bringing these new features to Perl were ( and still are ) far greater than simply dealing with backward compatibility .
A number of Perl 5 experts have told me that the other reason for " total rewrite " with Perl 5 is that fixing Perl 5's core codebase would also take a huge amount of work and have uncertain chances of success .
And guess what , those experts were correct -- it took 7.5 years to get from Perl 5.6 to Perl 5.10 .
Thanks to the heroic efforts of a number of pumpkings and core hackers , the Perl 5 codebase of today is orders of magnitude improved over what existed in 2000 .
But I also believe ( from what others have told me ) that many of the fundamental problems are also still present .
( Anticipating those who will say " Perl 5.10 would 've arrived much quicker if we had n't gotten distracted by Perl 6 " , please ( 1 ) cite your evidence for such a claim , and ( 2 ) note that many well - known Perl 5 experts and insiders , including pumpkings , strongly disagree with the notion that work on Perl 6 has impeded Perl 5 development in any significant way . )
Had this been done we might have gotten something in 2 - 4 years that was production ready ( ran all of CPAN ) and cleaned up the worst warts .
Had we cleaned up the worst parser edge cases you might be running jPerl on your JVM now instead of jRuby .
I think this is even more speculation contradicted by available evidence .
I do n't know of any Perl 5 core hacker who seriously contemplates making significant changes to the Perl 5 parser , or that such changes could reasonably happen in just a few years .
And I certainly have plenty of evidence available to indicate that even minor changes to the Perl 5 parser have taken years for evaluation , testing , and being incorporated into an actual release .
Several Perl 5 experts ( again , including former and current pumpkings ) have told me that Rakudo and Perl 6 remain Perl 's best ( and some say only ) chance for Perl ( both 5 and 6 ) ever making it to the JVM or .
Net virtual machines .
And anyone who wants to port Perl 5 to other virtual machines would certainly want a better parsing engine than what is currently available , which brings us back to needing a new grammar engine , which brings us back to needing Perl 6 .
It was claimed that there was no existing VM that could run a lot of dynamic languages , now it turns out that the JVM / .
Net can do that just fine ...
Okay , you 're essentially accusing the Perl leaders of 2000 of having imperfect foresight .
And you 're omitting the fact that JVM and .
Net were n't at all " open platforms " then ( and in many ways they still are n't ) , so if " the new Perl " needed something not available through those VMs at the time , there was little chance of having that something added in a timely manner .
Regardless , the debate about whether Perl should have pursued a new VM is ultimately a red herring in my book .
My other points still stand -- even using Perl 5 as the underlying VM it has taken Larry a couple of years to write up a parser for our new language .
And from an early date that parser has required Perl 5.10 and Moose , neither of which were available in any sort of usable form until 2007 at the earliest .
( I grant that it 's entirely plausible that Larry could 've created his standard grammar implementation using 5.8 and without Moose .
But my speculation is that Larry would 've instead taken the time to design something like Moose and the additional features he would need in 5.8 to support the grammar .
Which , if you think about it , is in fact exactly what has happened . :-) 10 years later we still do n't have our apple pie .
Answer 1 : I have an apple pie , and a new and better tasting apple pie shows up at my doorstep each month .
Perhaps the apple pies I 'm receiving are n't sufficiently cooked to your culinary standards ( yet ) , or are n't the type of pie you 're looking for , but it 's wrong to claim there are n't any apple pies being produced .
Answer 2 : Maybe you do n't have your apple pie yet , but I guarantee that your Perl 5 pie is now much tastier and better for you because of the work that has gone into making the Perl 6 apple pie .
But it 's interesting to speculate on what could have happened differently .
Maybe we'd have a Perl 6 for 6 years already by now ...
No , you 'd likely have a Perl 5.10 that would be called " Perl 6 " .
And you would have only had it for two years ( Perl 5.10.0 was released in December 2007 ) .
It would probably be seen as having the same level of " incremental improvements " over Perl 5.6 that Python 3 does over Python 2 , and with a similar ( slow ) adoption rate .
It probably would n't have had the ~~ smart match operator , cited as " the most exciting change " in Perl 5.10 over Perl 5.8 .
It would still be considered ugly ( many people find Perl 6 much less ugly by comparison ) .
And Ruby and Python would still be where they are today .
If the speculations being offered were being used to improve on what is happening today , then I might agree that it's " interesting to speculate " .
But much of what I see is speculation used to justify FUD like " 10 years later we still do n't have our apple pie " and " We 'd have Perl running on the JVM by now " , i.e. , statements that I find to be totally unsupported or contradicted by the available evidence .

Thank you this was the best anonymous post in a while expressing much of my thoughts much better than I could .
I wholeheartedly support the " Rakudo / Parrot / Pugs / Ponie / whatever ... " team but IMHO most of the problems and tensions are the result of a communication tragedy .
Honestly , Perl6 should be renamed into something like Perl ++.
It 's much more than the next evolutionary step of Perl5 , it 's incorporating revolutionary concepts which can't be achieved in normal release steps ..
But at the same time we are living in a marketing world , where the crowd measures the quality of a product at the release numbers .
Releasing a Perl5 compatible successor , maybe just bundling Moose for OOP and Coro for multithreading and maybe some syntax cosmetics and restriction³ to contradict the " write only language " complaint would easily cannibalize the Ruby spectra like they are actually cannibalizing the Python spectra . ¹
But sadly such a successor can't be named Perl6 , because this name slot is already taken .
And at the same time the " Perl ++ team " has to cope with the burden and pressure of the whole community impatiently waiting for a answer to the contemporary needs .
They are constantly forced to justify why they are making gold , where the market just needs iron to be turned into steel .
²
Thats a marketing desaster !
Perl5 is somehow in the situation of Neanderthals who are told by the gods that further evolution is useless because Sapiens Sapiens will arrive in Europe and wipe them out .
Actually it took thousands of years to replace them ... Cheers Rolf UPDATE : added links and to title and improved language Footnotes : ¹)
It 's so paradox to see how a beautified syntax on Perl semantics plus Smalltalk object model named Ruby easily takes steadily growing market shares .... ² ) and let me be clear Perl+ +
IS gold , but meanwhile our customers live in the stone age and are going to other jewelers to buy gems made of iron ... ³ ) perl critic but anal !

If it 's further consolation , my reply — Re^2 : How to Implement Perl 6 in Ten Years — to the paragraph you quote originally began , " Really , really stupid . "
I swapped it for " naïve " as a concession to civility and part of my court ordered community service .
I think you guys are amazing and I feel so lucky to be a Perl hacker ; the only career that matches my personality and pays more than janitorial work .
I have many thoughtful , patient , creative , caring persons like you to thank for my situation .

When I first read your reply in the other thread ( long before I finished my response here ) , I felt that " naïve " was in fact stunningly appropriate .
I 'm glad you chose it instead of " stupid " .

Perl 5 is enjoying a renaissance , Perl 6 is rocketing along , and people are complaining ?
pmichaud and others are out there having a crack at building something truly revolutionary .
Cheer them - the Perl community would be a lesser place without them .
I wish you and your family the best !
Take care !

You are right no body really understands the complexity behind what you are trying to build .
But ask yourself this question , How are they to understand when you have n't told it to them ?
The biggest problem in communication is to assume that its already done .
When people hear about Perl 6 initially , they probably read the FAQ or some other feature list .
And they assume this a feature rich but Just - Another - Compiler .
No body really understands what it means to have a mutable grammar , or some of the cool stuff that Perl 6 has !
But how do we expect them to understand when they do n't know about it ?
Chromatic 's post clarified a lot of misgivings people had about the decade long history about Perl 6 .
If there was one similar post regarding how difficult it is to build this kind of a compiler it will be great , And that post must be communicated to some Open Source news forums where hackers hang out frequently .
People will then get a clear Idea and stop criticizing you for the wrong reasons .
People who criticize you are not your enemies but your friends , indirectly they give you a temperature check of whats brimming in the community .
We fight so passionately with people whom we love not our enemies .
Lastly think about those who do n't complain but just give up and leave , From past few years Ruby and Python scored some undeserved points because of all this FUD .
All the best to you and Rakudo team , we are eagerly waiting for " The Release " .
Perl 6 and Parrot links is a comprehensive link collection about everything Perl 6 and Parrot VM .
Yes you are writing about Perl 6 , Speaking about Perl 6 etc .
My point was not about that .
But rather about explaining people why building a Grammar engine for Perl 6 is so difficult , as I understand that has roots in the mutable aspects of Perl 6 Grammar .
You are doing a great job , absolutely no doubts about that .
But in this world you have to blow your own trumpet .
Giving people a feel of ( Technical matters of the compiler , not features of the language ) will do a lot of help .

> IMO , this is more FUD ( " Nobody is talking about Perl 6 " ) .
Here 's an off - the - cuff and horribly incomplete list for 2009 , in no particular order : Sorry , but how many of these posts are talking about the complexity behind Perl 6 ?
I know some of the people and read a lot from them , I also read Dan Sugalski 's blog from start till burnout .
I suppose most of these posts have the aim to keep people interested and get them involved and NOT to lower expectations or criticizing the complexity .
This is for sure a fantastic project , but we should start getting realistic about it .
The Perl community could have massive boost just by making a big release with " boring features " Â¹ but could then easily challenge the " sex appeal " from Ruby and Python .
Just like a plane is followed regularly by a bigger plane to keep the market interested and not by a rocket .
And I 'm sure this major release would a ) put lots of pressure away from your team and b ) build a bridge to your project by incorporating concepts c ) therefore push the further development of it !
Cheers Rolf Â¹ ) Nota bene : I do n't say YOU are to implement these boring features !

if you want to never finish something you will do as much press conferences and presentations and articles as you 'd like .
and let chromatic write entire shelves and fill up a library of Alexandria with his books .
on the other hand when you 're determined to get some stuff done , you will pull the damn ethernet plug from your computer , or close your wifi connection and go dark and just hack .
pmichaud , I must admit that I 'm ashamed at the utter lack of respect from some of the immature monks .
I certainly appreciate / applaud your efforts and all of the Perl 6 team , and I recognize that you all could be doing anything else , but somehow manage to ignore the petty noise .
Thank you all for your collective efforts .
My conspiracy theory is that anonymous monk is not even a Perl programmer , but merely a troll trying to move his pet language up the TIOBE chart by denegrating all things for which he knows nothing about .
Great jobs , troll (s ) .
Now that you 've distracted them , can you please let them get back to work ?

Personally , I think that you would do well to stick by your original self - admonition : Responding to garbage being spouted by anonymous person (s ) probably ought to not even be anywhere on my radar .
You are right .
It should n't .
All of us , throughout the greater Perl community , are tremendously in debt to the senior developers and computer scientists such as yourself who have collectively done so much for the various versions of Perl ; including those yet to come .
Your work stands for itself .
I use a very simple scheme to generate my CHANGELOG .
I just ask darcs for it and include it in the extra - files section of my package 's .cabal file .
Though , this seems too simplistic for what you are asking . =)
That said , you can go quite a bit farther and use a custom cabal Setup . ( hs|lhs ) that builds the CHANGELOG during cabal sdist out of your darcs or git repository 's commit info ( or out of whatever system you decide to use to track it )

The first time I heard anything about people living in the sewers in Colombia was back at the beginning of the '90s .
The sewage system running under Bogota 's streets was filled with packs of kids living waist - deep in human waste and taking in copious amounts of glue and crack in order to cope .
This was at the height of Colombia 's Dirty War , and the whole reason street kids had moved into the sewers in the first place was to get away from the violence above ground .
But then the paramilitary death squads who had chased them off the street started coming into the pipes and shooting them or dousing them in gasoline or raping them .
The sewer kids became a fairly big humanitarian story in the media for a while , with networks in America and Europe sending in TV crews to cover it and folks setting up charities abroad .
Then , as happens with news stories , it fell off the radar , and I guess people kind of thought the problem had been resolved , if they thought of it at all .
But what had actually happened was , about six months after all the stories aired , the death squads went in , armed with the whereabouts of the sewer - kid hot spots , and carried out massive reprisal killings .
There was some talk in the government about cracking down on the death squads , but by all accounts , soldiers and off - duty cops made up a good part of most squads .
So the situation just stagnated while the world turned its attention elsewhere .
See the rest of Sewers of Bogota at VBS.TV
When we went into the sewers and started talking to people , nobody wanted to be anywhere near our camera .
Having heard stories about the last time cameras came down , they were all sure that the police would figure out where they were hiding from our footage and come in to beat the ( expletive ) out of them ( the fact that they were all cracked out of their skulls probably did n't help with the paranoia either ) .
We took great pains to obscure the locations of their homes , but the only reason any of them talked with us was because we went down with Jaime Jaramillo .
We had mixed feelings about Jaime , or " Papa Jaime " as he prefers to be called , when we met him .
He was constantly mugging for the camera and repeating the same well - rehearsed speeches about the kids ' living conditions ( " Their only food is trash , their only music the honking of the city bus ... " ) , calling us at our hotel when he's on the local news , etc .
The thing is , though , he is seriously one of the only people in the country who 's done anything about the situation in the sewers .
We all snickered at the meditation tapes and the Evel Knievel jumpsuit , but once we got down into the pipes , not only did all the kids know and trust him , they ran to him like he was made out of crack .

Desmond Tutu and four Kalahari Desert bushmen from Africa have become the first indigenous people in the world to have had their genetic codes , or genomes , sequenced .
A Sydney researcher , Vanessa Hayes , initiated and co-led the project , which is expected to provide important insights into the origins and treatment of complex human diseases , including cancer .
Dr Vanessa Hayes and Archbishop Tutu .
Dr Hayes , of the University of NSW and Children 's Cancer Institute Australia , said Africa was the birthplace of modern humans , making its people among the most genetically diverse in the world .
Her team 's research shows that the hunter - gather bushmen of southern Africa have remained isolated from other populations for about 100,000 years .

A radical Muslim website is taking on the TV cartoon " South Park " , after an episode that aired last week depicted the Prophet Mohammed dressed in a bear suit .
Those who run Revolutionmuslim.com , based in New York , issued a warning on the website on Sunday to the “ South Park ” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone .
" They will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show .
This is not a threat , but a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them , " the posting said .
Van Gogh , a Dutch filmmaker , was stabbed to death on a street in Amsterdam by a Muslim extremist in 2004 .
He became the target of radical Muslims after releasing a short documentary depicting the oppression of Muslim women in Europe .
Revolutionmuslim.com included a graphic photo of van Gogh at the time of his death in the posting .
Over the photo of van Gogh , Parker , Stone and others you hear the audio of a sermon by the radical U.S. - born preacher Anwar al - Awlaki , who is thought to be hiding in Yemen .
The sermon , recorded some time ago , talks about assassinating those who have " defamed " the Prophet Mohammed .
Tonight on the program , Anderson will talk with Ayaan Hirsi Ali .
She was working with van Gogh on the controversial movie that led to his assassination six year ago .
Hear what she has to say about this latest controversy .
Also tonight , the son of actor Michael Douglas faces five years in prison for dealing methamphetamine and cocaine .
Cameron Douglas , 31 , pleaded guilty to the charges in January .
Before being sentencing today in a New York courtroom , his father and his stepmother Catherine Zeta - Jones wrote personal pleas to the judge asking for leniency and revealing the private pain of a famous family .
We ’ll have those details .
Join us for these stories and much more starting at 10 p.m. ET .
See you then .
Homi Bhabha is a famously incomprehensible writer in the field of postcolonial studies .
He is regarded as the second most unreadable academic in the world , after Judith Butler .
In this article I ’ll tell you how to interpret his work and make yourself look really smart in your postcolonial grad papers .
The 1980s - era theoretical writings of Homi Bhabha should not be read like a typical academic paper .
There is no criticism , thesis , or conclusion .
He is not attempting to make any political point or support any belief system .
Instead , they are written as works of poetry .
They are intended to make readers pay close attention to how he is playing with his subjects , and develop some insight from that which can be applied to their own works .
Also , and importantly , he is completely unconcerned with agency .
Many of his block - quoted examples seem confusing from a postcolonial perspective–they do not describe the colonized in “ empowering ” or flattering ways , and one might wonder whether he has any sympathy for them at all .
In fact , Bhabha is unattached to any desire to assign blame or credit to anyone .
He does not want to pat the natives on the back , but only to describe what is going on .
Bhabha , of course , operates in the tradition of Jacques Derrida , and many of his artistic gimmicks , like repeating the same statements over and over in different contexts , come from Derrida .
Operating fully within the tradition of deconstruction , he views the individuals he ’s quoting as fellow observers , who had equal rational capacity , rather than objects of criticism .
He is not trying to discover some fault in their analysis , but to discover the processes that gave rise to their mode of thinking .
In short , Bhabha does not assume the preexistence of a colonizer and colonized .
His primary interest is in understanding the complex ways of speaking , writing , and thinking that arose out of the mere act of establishing a colony .
Questions like “ What is Indian ? ” or “ What is English ? ” can only be answered by a discourse that separates them .
Here we can see why a colonial discourse is different from discussions about the internal problems of a country .
Everyone in England is English , but the natives of colonial India cannot be fully British , even though they are subjects of the Queen !
This colonial discourse , in Bhabha ’s writing , has several important characteristics .
First , colonialism is anti-Enlightenment , because it denies egalitarianism .
The colonized as a constructed group are asked to achieve a certain standard of civilization , but they cannot actually achieve it , or else they would cease to be a colony of a mother nation .
This gives rise to hybridity , a process where the discourse of the colonists becomes a discourse of the colonized via their responses of acceptance , rejection , or misunderstanding ( the last of these three categories is particularly important to Bhabha , since he considers it influential and unacknowledged ) .
Whether they intend it to or not , the natives ’ hybridity undermines the colonial discourse and confuses or angers the colonists .
Thus , the colonists ’ message must be proclaimed again and again , as long as they care about their civilizing project .
Bhabha acknowledges that some natives inevitably feel comfortable being in a colony , an imagined world with a secure leadership .
But as above , hybridity is a force that upsets , whether people want it to or not .
In the form of mimicry , the futile if well - meaning attempt to achieve full citizenship or humanity within the discursive borders of the colony , the native response becomes “ civil disobedience within the discipline of civility ” .
Their actions upset colonial power , since a colony ruled by its native inhabitants without interference is not really a colony at all , nor are the natives really colonized .
Mimicry is therefore “ the sign of the inappropriate ” , meaning that it is undesirable to the colonist rulers as well as demonstrating the impossibility of fully appropriating the colonists ’ power .
( This is an obnoxious Derridean pun . )
It appears to me that hybridity includes any disavowal of colonial domination , including resistance , misunderstanding , and an acceptance of rule that denies the negative effects of that rule .
Mimicry is more specifically a misreading of the meanings given to institutions by the colonists , and an embrace of those misreadings .
It appears in Bhabha ’s block - quoted examples as an accident which neither illiterates nor intelligentsia really understand the origin of .
But this does not mean that conscious resistance is better for the world than mimicry , because that assumes that the colonist reading is in fact the correct reading .
Mimicry , too , is a legitimate , creative act which disrupts the colonists ’ intentions .
Perhaps the name “ mimicry ” marginalizes that important process .
This is as far as I ’ve got so far .
I think that if you take this cheat sheet with you , then you may be able to make some sense out of Homi Bhabha ’s gobbledy - gook .
Whether his theory has useful application to real - world disputes is a subject for another day entirely .

Bart Stupak .
Dear Bart Stupak ,
Welcome to the club .
I ran an abortion clinic for nine years and have defended clinics across the nation .
I ’ve worn a bullet - proof vest just to go to work .
My car was routinely vandalized .
My house was firebombed .
I was stalked .
I received so many telephone death threats — including one delivered to my kid when I could n’t come to the phone — that I considered them routine .
And it was n’t just me who was threatened .
My son was shot at .
My husband was routinely targeted .
My kids grew up never opening or even touching any packages that came in the mail , dealing with harassment at Sunday school and elsewhere , and always watching their backs .
Now , Bart , you and other anti-abortion Democratic members of Congress have joined this club .
You are on the receiving end of the thrown rocks , telephoned threats and ominous personal visits from people who , oddly enough , share your anti-abortion sentiments — they ’re just mad about your vote for health care reform .
So I thought I ’d put my schadenfreude aside and offer you some advice .
First off , do n’t expect anyone to get punished for their actions against you unless someone gets murdered .
Sure , being a member of Congress means that law enforcement paid attention to the threats , and fast .
That ’s a definite bonus .
Thanks to a wonderful woman on the local police force , I had some unofficial protection myself .
But it took me years and a Democratic administration to get the federal government to respond .
So having Obama in charge of the FBI and not McCain is definitely in your favor .
But when push comes to shove , I would be shocked if anyone was ever arrested , tried and convicted of carrying out a threat .
All anyone has to claim is that the attack was really about free speech , and then you can kiss any legal protections goodbye .
And do n’t expect the people who created the lynch mobs to show remorse or change their ways .
There will initially be some quasi-apologies — Rep. John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) says he was speaking metaphorically when he called an anti-abortion Democrat who voted for the bill “ a dead man ” — but soon the leaders will claim that they had nothing to do with the poisonous atmosphere because you caused it .
( Republican Whip Eric Cantor claims Democrats were “ dangerously fanning the flames ” by demanding his party condemn the violence and threats . )
In fact , you and I both know our only crimes were exercising our constitutional rights .
Yes , Bart , you are in the same boat as many abortion providers throughout the nation — under brutal attack and threats simply for doing what you thought was the right thing .
So I have to ask you :
How does it feel ?
How does it feel to have your life and the lives of those you love in danger from a band of filthy - mouthed , holier - than - thou thugs ?
How does it feel to know that nothing will make these bullies think twice about attacking you ?
How does it feel to know these people — people with whom you share beliefs — may stalk you forever ?
Most of all , how does it feel to know you helped create them through your leadership against women in favor of the bishops , your support of the anti-abortion movement and your discounting of women ’s lives and women ’s choices ?
You stood silent while women were attacked and doctors were murdered ; now they are coming for you .
You should have spoken out , but you did n’t .
So welcome to the club and good luck , Bart Stupak .
Let me know if you need tips on wearing a bulletproof vest .
Jeanne
P.S. I read a recent interview in which you said you suspected groups such as the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , the National Right to Life and others were actually “ just using the life issue to try to bring down health - care reform . ”
Gee , ya think ?

Is there a German word for " the feeling you get when something is so ridiculous that you want to laugh , yet is simultaneously jaw - droppingly horrible " ?
Can we make one up ?
I ask , because I recently discovered Fox -Tossing , a 17th / 18th century European pastime that is exactly what it sounds like .
People would go out in a field and set up a little fenced - in court .
Then high - society types would stand , in pairs , holding slack ropes .
Then a bunch of foxes would be released into the court .
When the foxes ran over the ropes , the players pulled the ropes tight , launching the foxes up into the air .
Repeat until all foxes are dead .
Are n't you glad we can rot our brains with TV now , instead ?
According to the Ptak Science Books blog :
Fleming 's Deutsche Jaeger ( published in 1719 ) produced this ( above ) image , and commented on it : " Skilled male tossers could toss a fox 24 ft. high
…
At a famous fox - tossing in Dresden there were tossed some 687 foxes , 533 hares , 34 badgers , 21 wild cats , and at the end 34 young wild boar and 3 wolves … . "
And a partridge in a pear tree .
10:00 am is n't too early to start drinking , right ?
UPDATE : Resident German commenter Tillwe has offered a couple of possibilities : First , " fürchterliche Witzigkeit " ( lit. frighteningly funnyness ) .
He / she says that captures the mood best , but , to pack it all into one word , we could use " GrausamkeitsspäÃŸe " ( lit. " funny cruelties " ) .

Team US F1's Formula 1 hopes appeared to be over on Tuesday , with high level sources revealing to AUTOSPORT that the outfit has now effectively closed down .
Against the backdrop of weeks of uncertainty about the future of the American team , which had been struggling to get a car ready for the start of the season , sources have revealed team personnel have now been informed they are no longer required as the operation could not continue in its present guise .
AUTOSPORT understands that shortly before lunchtime , production manager Dave Skog informed those staff who had remained at the team during its recent troubles that they were being put on unpaid leave - even though they remain technically employed .
That move , which has not yet been officially confirmed , effectively brings an end to the F1 dreams of team principal Ken Anderson and sporting director Peter Windsor who had hoped to create a genuine American grand prix team unless a fresh cash injection can be found .
It is understood that neither Anderson nor Windsor were present at the factory while the announcement was made , and neither was available for comment about the latest situation .
Calls to the factory switchboard have also gone unanswered , with a message stating that the number is temporarily not working .
The failure of Team US F1 to make it onto the grid means that there is now a vacancy for the Serbian outfit Stefan Grand Prix , which has been sitting on the sidelines for several months .
US F1 will need to be officially withdrawn from the championship if Stefan GP is going to have a chance of getting a late entry - although such a situation may be possible if FIA technical delegate Charlie Whiting 's inspection visit to the American team 's factory last week showed that the outfit was not capable of competing .
It is also not clear what US F1 investor Chad Hurley will now do .
The American YouTube co-founder , who had invested in the team , has been linked with potential deals with both Stefan GP and Campos Meta in recent weeks - and it is possible he may choose to remain in F1 through involvement with another team .
Il nuovo cavallo di battaglia HTC per il 2010 è lo smartphone HTC Evo 4G , il primo telefono cellulare compatibile con la nuova rete di quarta generazione che assicura , con Google Android ed un'entusiasmante dotazione hardware , prestazioni e multimedialità mozzafiato .
E ' da tempo che si cerca di eleggere uno smartphone " iPhone killer " , ma spesso le simpatie di alcuni verso taluni produttori ( hardware e software ) finiscono con l'alterare un giudizio oggettivo ed obiettivo .
Probabilmente sarà HTC a fare da giudice in questa disputa che sembra non aver fine , proponendo una nuova alternativa al Melafonino .
Parliamo di HTC
Evo 4G , il nuovissimo smartphone di fascia ultra - alta che l'azienda taiwanese ha da poco annunciato ufficialmente ed in anteprima in una conferenza stampa .
Probabilmente sarà un dispositivo che farà davvero la differenza nel mondo Android .
Si , perchè
Evo 4G si basa sull ' ultima versione di Android , la 2.1 , ma è alquanto lungimirante in quanto viene dato per certo che supporterà la next release del Google OS non appena questa verrà resa disponibile .
Ma procediamo per gradi .
Cosa offre in particolare Evo 4G ?
Partiamo innanzitutto dal nome .
In molti l'avevano battezzato Supersonic , ma HTC ha smentito ufficialmente questa nomenclatura .
In realtà il telefono è davvero super , perchè è il primo al mondo a supportare la rete 4G , che promette velocità fino a 10 volte maggiori della convenzionale 3G .
Performance eccezionali anche relativamente al lato prettamente hardware del device : Android ( attualmente in versione 2.1 , come già detto ) è stato integrato con la consueta interfaccia Sense UI proprietaria di HTC , che ne arricchisce ulteriormente l'esperienza utente e proietta lo smartphone verso nuovi livelli di interazione con social networking e multimedialità .
Evo 4G si interfaccia con l'utente tramite un ampio display LCD da ben 4.3 pollici che supporta il multitouch ( almeno due tocchi in contemporanea ) .
Sul retro del display pulsa la CPU Qualcomm Snapdragon da 1GHz , ormai un must su terminali Android di fascia alta .
La CPU è tuttavia una versione revisionata ed aggiornata , coadiuvata stavolta da ben 512MB di memoria RAM ( un vero record nel settore ) e 1GB di memoria ROM interna ( " di massa " ) espandibile tranquillamente con schede microSD fino a 32GB .
Nella confezione troveremo comunque una microSD da 8GB .
Immancabili i sensori di prossimità , luminosità , accelerometro e bussola digitale .
Oltre alla connettività 4G , Evo resta retrocompatibile col 3G ed offre Wi-Fi , GPS , A - GPS nonchè Bluetooth 2.1 , radio FM e due eclatanti feature : camera frontale da 1,3 Megapixel ed uscita HDMI .
La prima è una vera novità per Android , poichè a causa di alcune limitazioni software finora i produttori di smartphone Android - based avevano spesso deciso di evitare l'integrazione di una cam per la videochiamata .
Non meno importante l'uscita HDMI , che permette di riprodurre flussi video in alta definizione sul plasmaTV da salotto : da prove effettuate , il prodotto supporta tranquillamente la riproduzione di video su televisori da 85 pollici ....
E ' intuibile che questa integrazione non è presente a caso : il terminale vanta infatti una fotovideocamera posteriore da ben 8 Megapixel che è anche in grado di girare video in alta definizione ( HD @ 720 p ) .
Cotanta multimedialità richiede non solo una basetta d'appoggio ( che Evo 4G integra al suo interno , sulla scocca posteriore ) ma anche un utilizzo intensivo della batteria : è per questo motivo che Evo 4G include una batteria da ben 1500MAh , che finora soltanto Sony Ericsson è riuscita ad integrare nel suo Xperia X10 .
Il device pesa complessivamente 170 grammi ed è grande 12,2 x 6,6 x 1,3 cm circa .
Dovrebbe essere disponibile a partire da questa estate , presumibilmente tra giugno e luglio , ad un prezzo ancora incognito ( ma sicuramente superiore ai 500 € ) .
HTC Evo 4G nasce per il mercato Americano , ma probabilmente potrebbe venire importato in Europa .
Non sono disponibili ulteriori dettagli in merito alla commercializzazione , ma di sicuro NON è questo il Nexus
Two di cui si vociferava fino a qualche tempo fa .
A dire il vero , un piccolo update c'è , ma è molto vago e da prendere con le pinze : secondo infatti un post comparso sulla pagina ufficiale Facebook di Sprint , il carrier americano che proporrà per primo lo smartphone sul mercato , Evo 4G potrebbe già essere disponibile dal 16 Aprile .
Chissà ...
HTC ha fatto immediatamente seguire all ' annuncio ufficiale un video promozionale sul prodotto .
Eccolo di seguito , subito seguito da un secondo che mostra , in slide , alcune foto del terminale :
Interest in Rare Earths is starting to heat up in a dramatic fashion , and it something you should keep on your radar .
So named because they were hard to get in the 18th and 19th century , these once obscure elements have suddenly become the focus of several converging trends in the global economy , as they are the key ingredient of magnets .
There are 17 in all , divided into light ( cerium , Ce , lanthanum , La , and neodymium , Nd ) and heavy ( dysprosium , Dy , terbium , Tb , and europium , Eu ) .
It turns out that you ca n’t build a hybrid or electric car , a wind turbine , thin film solar , LED ’s , high performance batteries , or a cell phone without these elements .
One Prius uses 25 kilograms of the stuff .
You also ca n’t fight a modern war without rare earths , being essential for radar , missile guidance systems , navigation , and night vision goggles .
That ’s where things get interesting .
China now produces 97 % of the world ’s rare earth supplies , much of it coming from small mines operating by criminal gangs where it is safe to say , concerns about environmental considerations are nil .
Last year China announced that it may start restricting rare earth exports , possibly banning several , it is thought , in order to force foreigners to buy more of their downstream electronic products .
Such a ban could begin as early as 2012 .
The world market for rare earths is tiny now , amounting to only $ 1.4 billion a year .
But Toyota intends on doubling its production of Prius ’s from one million to 2 million units in the near future , while China and South Korea want to boost their combined electric and hybrid production by 1 million units by the end of next year .
Demand for wind turbines is going off the charts , thanks to massive government subsidies in Europe and the US .
America was once the world ’s largest producer of these elements , until it was undercut on prices by China ( see chart below ) , and all US production ceased .
The threatened Chinese export ban has prompted a group of investors to reopen Molycorp ’s Mountain Pass California mine , a jackrabbit ridden , rattlesnake infested pit an hour southwest of Las Vegas .
The mine was the world ’s largest producer of cerium and neodymium , and provided the europium that was used to produce the first color televisions .
The group has filed with the SEC for an IPO that seeks to raise $ 500 million to reopen the mine and a nearby refinery .
Now congress wants to get involved , proposing a rare earths strategic stockpile for the military , and offering subsidized loans to fund it .
Remember what that did for oil ?
Every peak in oil prices in the last 30 years coincided with the government topping up its strategic petroleum reserve .
Rare earth prices have already started to move , with cerium doubling to $ 4 / pound since 2007 , and neodymium up 500 % to $ 23 / pound during the same period .
Rare earths do n’t have any futures or ETF ’s to trade that I know of , so the only way to get involved is through the miners themselves , which involves an added element of risk .
Take a look at the established players , which include Avalon Rare Metals ( AVARF.PK ) , Great Western Minerals Group ( GWMGF.PK ) , Rare Earth Metals ( RAREF.PK ) , Lynas Corp ( LYSCF ) , and Molycorp , after it goes public .

Google Apps Script + Spreadsheets = Mashup Hub
I ’ve been playing around with Google Apps Script .
It has great library support for calling out to restful Web APIs .
This makes it a great mashup platform .
Also :
It uses web -native Javascript .
The documentation is clear .
It ’s ridiculously easy to write a small script and then try it out and continuously refine it by running it in a spreadsheet .
Spreadsheets are a great hub to pull together data from disparate sources and slice - and - dice it .
The key is the UrlFetchApp module , which lets you make HTTP GET and POST calls .
For example , this is how you would call out to the bit.ly API to shorten a URL :
function shortenUrl(longUrl ) { var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch ( " http://api.bit.ly/shorten?version=2.0.1 " + " &longUrl= " + longUrl + " &login= < YOUR BIT.LY USERNAME > " + " &apiKey = < YOUR BIT.LY API KEY >&format=xml " ) ; var parsedXml = Xml.parse(response.getContentText ( ) ) ; var shortUrl = parsedXml.getElement ().getElement ( " results " ) .getElement (" nodeKeyVal " ).getElement (" shortUrl " ).getText ( ) ; return shortUrl ; }
Substitute your own bit.ly username and API key in there .
You can now use “ shortenUrl ” like any other function in a spreadsheet formula :
Press “ Enter ” , and you get the shortened URL :
Here ’s another example .
This code snippet will tweet its argument .
It shows how to issue an HTTP POST .
Note the advanced arguments to the fetch method .
function tweet ( status ) { var advancedArgs = { method : " post " , payload : " status= " + status , headers : { " Authorization " : " Basic < base64 encoding of your username : passwd " }} ; var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch ( " http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/update.xml " , advancedArgs ) ; var parsedXml = Xml.parse(response.getContentText ( ) ) ; var created At = parsedXml.getElement ( ) .getElement ( " created_at " ) .getText ( ) ; return created At ; }
With these two functions , you could use a Google spreadsheet as your Twitter client .
Mazda Motor Corp. said Tuesday its annual loss shrank to 6.5 billion yen ( $ 69 million ) from 71.5 billion yen the year before thanks to cost - cutting efforts .
Japan's No. 4 carmaker made a profit in the last quarter of the fiscal year through March 2010 and said it expects a net profit of 5 billion yen for the current fiscal year through March 2011 .
Hit by the yen 's appreciation and weaker demand in all major markets save China , Mazda 's annual sales fell 15 percent to 2.164 trillion yen .
" The recovery of automotive industry demand still lacks momentum , except in China and other emerging markets . "
Sales in China jumped 46 percent to 196,000 units for the year , helped by sales of the Mazda6 .
Globally , Mazda sold 1.193 million vehicles during the year , down 5 percent from the previous year .
Annual sales in North America slid 12 percent to 307,000 units , those in Europe dropped 26 percent to 239,000 , while in Japan sales edged up 1 percent to 221,000 units .
Faced with a " challenging " business environment , Mazda said it worked hard to optimize inventory levels and accelerated cuts to fixed costs by over 100 billion yen , even though its domestic plants were operating at 80 percent utilization .
Those efforts helped Mazda turn in a net profit of 9.9 billion yen for the fiscal fourth quarter from January through March .
The former owner of half a dozen L.A. - area medical marijuana dispensaries was sentenced Monday to six years in federal prison for conspiring to sell the drug , officials said .
Virgil Edward Grant II , 42 , of Carson pleaded guilty last June to a single conspiracy count after federal agents raided the dispensaries , which authorities claimed were operated like retail pot stores .
The federal investigation began after a driver who was high on marijuana crashed his pickup truck into a car that had been stopped by a CHP officer , authorities said .
The crash resulted in the death of the driver of the stopped vehicle and left the CHP officer paralyzed , officials said .
Investigators later determined that the driver of the pickup had purchased marijuana and “ marijuana edibles ” from one of Grant ’s dispensaries , Holistic Caregivers , in Compton .
At Monday ’s hearing , U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson labeled as “ not credible ” Grant ’s explanation that he was operating his multiple marijuana dispensaries as nonprofit cooperatives .
According to federal prosecutors , Grants ’ facilities generated more than $ 1.3 million in revenue during more than two years in business .
Grant has been in federal custody since December , when authorities shut down the dispensaries he was continuing to operate , said a spokesman for the U.S. attorney ’s office .
His six - year sentence is to be followed by three years of supervised release .
Federal authorities dropped charges against his wife , Psytra Monique Grant , 33 .
A former employee , Stanley Jerome Cole , received probation in the case .

Calif .
pot clinic owner sentenced in profit scheme
by The Associated Press
The former owner of six Los Angeles - area medical marijuana dispensaries , including one store linked to an accident that killed a motorist and paralyzed an officer , was sentenced Monday to six years in federal prison for selling pot for profit .
U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson said he did n’t believe Virgil Grant III ’s claim that his dispensaries were n’t for profit .
Grant used the clinics to shield for - profit marijuana sales , the judge said .
California ’s medical marijuana law prohibits the cultivation and sale of marijuana for profit .
Marijuana use is illegal under federal law , which does n’t recognize the medical marijuana laws in California and other states .
Grant , 42 , was arrested in May 2008 on a host of federal charges , including operating three dispensaries within 1,000 feet of schools and money laundering .
The Carson resident pleaded guilty in June to conspiracy to possess and distribute marijuana
Grant ’s business dealings became known when a customer of his Compton store , Jeremy White , drove his truck into a car stopped by a California Highway Patrol officer on the shoulder of Highway 101 in Ventura County in December 2007 .
The driver of the parked car was killed .
The officer , Anthony Pedeferri , was critically injured .
White acknowledged driving under the influence of marijuana , and investigators found marijuana and edible marijuana products in his car from The Holistic Caregivers in Compton , one of Grant ’s dispensaries .
White pleaded guilty to gross vehicular manslaughter and was sentenced to 15 years in prison .
After a number of undercover buys at several of Grant ’s dispensaries , including a $ 5,700 , 1 - pound transaction with one of Grant ’s employees , Grant was indicted and arrested .
Grant was arrested again in December when he tried to open two of his pot dispensaries in violation of his bond , which mandated that he stay away from marijuana clinics .

Bacteria found in the soil activated a group of neurons that produce the brain chemical serotonin .
Treatment of mice with a ' friendly ' bacteria , normally found in the soil , altered their behavior in a way similar to that produced by antidepressant drugs , reports research published in the latest issue of Neuroscience .
These findings , identified by researchers at the University of Bristol and colleagues at University College London , aid the understanding of why an imbalance in the immune system leaves some individuals vulnerable to mood disorders like depression .
Dr Chris Lowry , lead author on the paper from Bristol University , said : " These studies help us understand how the body communicates with the brain and why a healthy immune system is important for maintaining mental health .
They also leave us wondering if we should n't all be spending more time playing in the dirt . "
Interest in the project arose after human cancer patients being treated with the bacteria Mycobacterium vaccae unexpectedly reported increases in their quality of life .
Lowry and his colleagues reasoned that this effect could be caused by activation of neurons in the brain that contained serotonin .
When the team looked closely at the brains of mice , they found that treatment with M. vaccae activated a group of neurons that produce the brain chemical serotonin .
The lack of serotonin in the brain is thought to cause depression in people , thus M. vaccae 's effects on the behavior of mice may be due to increasing the release of serotonin in parts of the brain that regulate mood .
The new research supports this hypothesis , but future studies will be designed to determine if M. vaccae , other bacteria , or pharmaceutical compounds have antidepressant properties through activation of this group of serotonin neurons .
NEW ORLEANS —
Oil continued to pour into the Gulf of Mexico on Monday as the authorities waited to see if the quickest possible method of stopping the leaks would bring an end to what was threatening to become an environmental disaster .
Remote - controlled robots operating 5,000 feet under the ocean ’s surface were more than a full day into efforts to seal off the oil well , which has been belching crude through leaks in a pipe at the rate of 42,000 gallons a day .
The leaks were found on Saturday , days after an oil rig to which the pipe was attached exploded , caught on fire and sank in the gulf about 50 miles from the Louisiana coast .
The robots were trying to activate a device known as a blowout preventer , a 450 - ton valve at the wellhead that is designed to shut off a well in the event of a sudden pressure release .
Officials had initially said that the operation , which began Sunday morning , would take 24 to 36 hours .
But on Monday a Coast Guard spokesman said officials would keep trying as long as the efforts were feasible because “ it ’s the best option . ”
The other options — collecting the oil in a dome and routing it to the surface or drilling one or more relief wells — would take weeks or even several months to execute .
The Catholic church in Ireland has been rocked by the abuse scandal Pope Benedict XVI has accepted the resignation of the Bishop of Kildare .
Bishop James Moriarty offered to resign in December following publication of the Murphy Report into sexual abuse in the Catholic Church .
Bishop Moriarty , who was auxiliary bishop in Dublin from 1991 - 2002 , was barely criticised in the Murphy Report .
He said , however , that he " should have challenged the prevailing culture " .
The Pope announced he had accepted the resignation in Rome on Thursday .
New beginning Bishop Moriarty had told the Irish Catholic newspaper he did not anticipate resigning when he first read the Murphy Report because he was not directly criticised .
" However , renewal must begin with accepting responsibility for the past , " he said .
" Ultimately , I came to the conclusion that we needed a new beginning and that I could play my part in opening the way ' ' .
His departure leaves Bishops Eamonn Walsh and Raymond Field , who resigned on Christmas Eve , awaiting a decision on whether their resignations will be accepted .
The Bishop of Limerick , Dr Donal Murray , resigned in December following criticism of him in the report .
It found that during Dr Murray 's time as an auxiliary bishop in Dublin from 1982 to 1996 , he was dismissive of complaints about a priest who went on to abuse again .
Galway 's Bishop Martin Drennan , who was also named in the Murphy Report though not criticised , has refused to resign , insisting it " would be an injustice " .

CANNABIS CULTURE – Hawaii ’s THC Ministry and the homes of several medical cannabis growers were raided Wednesday by federal agents from the United States DEA and IRS .
Roger Christie , founder of the THC Ministry , said he was visited Wednesday morning by federal agents and local police who presented search warrants for his Wainaku home and popular Hawaii Cannabis Ministry in Hilo .
“ It was a surprise raid , ” Christie told Cannabis Culture .
“ Apparently they were looking for evidence of a crime or fraud . ”
Agents searched Christie ’s properties for seven hours , confiscating holy anointing oil containing cannabis and seizing files , but made no arrests and laid no charges .
“ They were 100 % professional and 100 % courteous and did n’t prevent us from operating , ” Christie said .
“ They just confiscated a little cash , a little stash , some records , and our iPhones . ”
Christie said that at least six , and possibly up to a dozen other people he knows were also raided in a Federal sweep across Hawaii ’s Big Island .
“ Some people were held in handcuffs on their knees with guns to their head , ” the Minister told CC .
“ They had their grow equipment confiscated .
Other people were treated kindly with no confiscations .
A couple of people were fully legitimate medical marijuana patients within the limits of their certificates .
One guy was an Iraqi war veteran with cancer . ”
The Hawaii Tribune - Herald reported that a police log for Wednesday “ showed 12 report numbers indicating police assistance to outside law enforcement agencies between 4 a.m. and just past 3 p.m .
Five incidents occurred in Puna , four in South Hilo , and one each in North Hilo , Hamakua and Ka’u . ”
Police and other authorities are n’t talking , but Christie says the “ common denominator ” seems to be associations with his Ministry .
“ Not everybody was an official member of the Ministry but I knew them all , ” he said .
“ And some of them I ’ve been 420 - friendly with . ”
Christie , who is part of the Native American Church and licensed uniquely as a cannabis sacrament Minister by the state of Hawaii , says he has always had a great relationship with local and state authorities .
“ I ’m administering the services and sacraments of the Ministry here and I ’ve been operating openly for 10 years and have had nothing but good relationships with law enforcement on all levels , ” he said .
“ I ’ve had vice squad people here before but they said they understood our legitimacy and we were free to operate .
So it has always been green lights from law enforcement until now . ”
Christie says he will meet with others who were raided to discuss future plans and assess the damage , and is considering legal action to make sure he and his members are protected .
“ Some harm was done to me and some harm was done to my ministry , ” he said .
“ I ’d like our property returned .
I ’m looking at the option of going into federal court early next week and filing for an injunction and a declaratory relief to see if a court will enjoin the federal government from taking any more action against the Ministry . ”
Founded in 2000 in Hawaii , THC Ministry has expanded across the globe with chapters in the UK , Australia , The Netherlands , Canada , and at least 15 US states .
Members consider cannabis a holy sacrament , and believe that “ cultivation and enjoyment of cannabis sacrament is a fundamental human right provided by God and protected by the Constitution . ”
The Ministry recently gained international fame in a court case involving one of its members , Trevor Douglas , a Colorado man who was convicted of marijuana possession and used a religious freedoms argument and his membership in the THC Ministry as a defense .
The move from Feds comes amid legislative efforts by Hawaiian state lawmakers to make life a little easier for marijuana users .
A bill to allow medical marijuana dispensaries to operate , which has already passed the state Senate , would tax marijuana sales and bring in an estimated $ 50 million dollars a year .
Another bill would decriminalize pot in the state , and a third would increase amounts of plants and product for med patients .
Christie is a board member of a marijuana advocacy group called the Peaceful Sky Alliance , which drafted an initiative passed last November making use of marijuana on private property the lowest police priority on Hawaii ’s Big Island .
“ I do n’t have secrets things going on here , ” Christie said .
“ We are a ministry that provides services and sacrament on a daily basis to people in need .
We also provide counseling and education , weddings , funerals and baptisms .
We do n’t have major amounts of cash or stash , ever .
We operate with a certain level of transparency and legitimacy . ”
Christie said he is ultimately positive about the outcome of the raid , and thinks it will help his Ministry and members gain further acceptance .
“ I feel like they were searching for the limits of my legitimacy , ” he said .
“ If we get a clean bill of health from the IRS and the DEA , I think we can start the tractors and start plowing the fields and really grow this thing to a higher level . ”

Nature has returned to the subject of climatology for its latest editorial and I 'm pleased to say that they have made a welcome rediscovery of their former considered tone , with not a mention of the word " denier " to be seen .
In fact they are positively critical of the noisier sections of the media , particularly the new media , and their perceived lack of good manners and good science :
Civility , honesty , fact and perspective are irrelevant .
This sentence might have been the cue for some cheap retaliatory shots at Nature , but I shall resist .

The update to Nehalem - based cores , as well as a die shrink to 32nm , gives these Core i3 , Core i5 , and Core i7 mobile processors clear performance advantages over the Core 2 Duo that Apple retained for the 13 " MacBook Pro .
So why did n't Apple give the 13 " MacBook Pro some Arrandale love ?
It turns out that there are several reasons that factored into Apple 's decision , including cost , graphics performance , battery life — and the laws of physics .
First , consider the basic architecture of the previous MacBook Pro models , first launched in October of 2008 .
All of them were equipped with a Core 2 Duo processor , a NVIDIA GeForce 9400 M controller with integrated graphics , and , in the case of the 15 " and 17 " models , a second discrete GPU .
The 16 - core integrated GPU in the 9400 M far exceeded the capability of the integrated Intel GMA950 or X3100 graphics in the Intel controllers used in previous Mac models .
The 9400 M also had the benefit of being CUDA - compatible , which was more important down the line when Apple rolled support for the CUDA - like OpenCL into Mac OS X 10.6 .
In designing the Arrandale mobile processor family , Intel moved the memory controller , PCIe bus controller , and integrated graphics onto a separate , on - package die right next to the CPU .
That means that these processors still require an additional , though less - capable and power - hungry , controller chip to handle the traditional southbridge functions , like USB and FIreWire I/O .
And if you want something besides the integrated Intel HD graphics — a major improvement over the older IGPs Intel offered , but still not quite as good as the 9400 M at certain tasks — you 'll also need a discrete GPU .
For the 15 " and 17 " MacBook Pros , Apple did just that .
Those models come with an NVIDIA GeForce GT 330 M mobile GPU in addition to either a Core i5 or Core i7 processor mated with an Intel HM55 controller .
( If you want to know why the new MacBook Pros do n't support USB 3.0 , blame Intel — the Arrandale chipsets do n't include USB 3.0 support . )
For the 13 " MacBook Pro , Apple faced a tough choice .
The 13 " MacBook Pro is the smallest " professional " portable that Apple makes , so it 's both light and affordable ( relative to larger MacBook Pros ) .
Still , users also have an expectation of performance — not just from the CPU , but also from the GPU .
Apple might have opted for the Core i5 , but that likely would have bumped the cost higher than Apple was willing to go .
Or , Apple could have opted for the less expensive Core i3 processors , which skip on the Turbo Boost feature included in the Core i5 and i7 processors .
( Turbo Boost lets one of the two cores bump up the clock speed while shutting down the other core on an as - needed basis , great for certain kinds of processing tasks that do n't work well or are n't optimized for multiple cores . )
The Core i3 still retains hyper - threading , which lets each core run two threads simultaneously , so it can offer a speed boost for multicore - aware and multi- threaded tasks .
So the Core i3 might seem like a good fit , but for reasons we 'll outline in a moment , it was n't .
The faster 2.4GHz and 2.66GHz Core 2 Duo that Apple is using is cheaper than both the i3 and i5 since it's an older architecture , and we are confident that Intel was willing to cut Apple a killer deal to clear out inventories .
Apple claims that these older processors also offer as much at 90 percent of the performance of the comparable Core i3s , but of course this is highly dependent on the workload , and it comes at the cost of more power draw ( the older parts are at 45nm and are clocked higher than the 32nm i3 ) .
Graphics performance would have taken a significant step backwards if Apple opted to rely solely on the Intel HD IGP that comes with Core i3 or i5 , so Apple would have also had to include a discrete GPU like that used on the 15 " and 17 " models .
Besides the added cost , there 's simply no room on the 13 " MacBook Pro logic board to include an additional discrete GPU .
Compare the photos below :

The similar , but much larger , logic boards for the 15 " and 17 " MacBook Pros ( 2009 ) .
Highlighted are the Intel CPU ( red ) , NVIDIA 9400M ( green ) , and discete NVIDIA GPU ( blue ) .
It does n't take a computer or electrical engineer to see there 's just no room on the 13 " MacBook Pro logic board for a discrete GPU in addition to a Core i3 and HM55 .
If Apple wanted to modify the logic board to include one , it would have meant carving out space used by the battery , both for the GPU and possibly additional thermal routing to keep the machine from bursting into flames .
Doing so would have been a double whammy on runtime — more power would be used by the GPU , and there would be less battery to power it .
At best , Apple may have been able to keep the stated seven hour battery life of the previous model , but it certainly would n't have come close to the 10 - hour battery life claim of the new one .
So , we already know that Apple did n't want to move backwards in graphics performance by relying solely on the Intel HD IGP , and did n't want to compromise on battery life by trying to cram in a discrete GPU .
A solution like the NVIDIA 9400 M , which combines a controller with an integrated GPU , was Apple 's only other option given these constraints .
Unfortunately , the licensing spat between Intel and NVIDIA prevents NVIDIA from making a solution like this for the Arrandale family of processors ( or really , any Intel processor with an integrated memory controller ) .
There 's no telling what the end result will be of the lawsuits the companies filed against each other , and Apple can't afford to sit idly by and wait for them to settle their differences .
Fortunately for Apple , NVIDIA made several improvements to the graphics capabilities in its integrated controllers , including moving them down to a 40nm process and building an improved low - end core ( GT216 ) to base them on .
Apple had NVIDIA build a special 48 - core variant of its GeForce 310 M mated to an improved version of the controller in the 9400M .
Called the GeForce 320 M , it gives the new 13 " MacBook Pro as much as an 80 percent boost in graphics performance when pushed to its limits ( and NVIDIA says the 16 - core 310 M is 10 x faster than the Intel HD IGP ) .
At the same time , it still offers as much as a 40 percent power savings when performing more mundane computing tasks ( this likely outweighs the power penalty for sticking with Core 2 Duo ) .
In addition , it gives Mac OS X's Grand Central Dispatch three times the resources to tap for GPGPU processing .
Clearly , Apple was n't actively trying to cripple the 13 " MacBook Pro by leaving it " stuck " with yesterday 's Core 2 Duo technology .
Instead , an Apple spokesperson told Ars that the company wanted to maintain the 13 " MacBook Pro's unique combination of performance , portability , and extended battery life , as well as its $ 1,200 starting price .
The combination of a faster Core 2 Duo processor and the NVIDIA 320 M allowed Apple to do that .
Of course , it 's easy to find notebooks from other manufacturers that offer comparable performance , comparable portability , possibly comparable battery life , and as good or better pricing .
However , you 're unlikely to find a comparable notebook that offers all four , and ( depending on your personal taste ) with as much style as the 13 " MacBook Pro .
As Steve Jobs recently explained in one of his increasingly frequent , succinct e-mails to customers : " We chose killer graphics plus 10 hour battery life over a very small CPU speed increase .
Users will see far more performance boost from the speedy graphics . "
In a Q&A session following the platform keynote address at GDC 2006 this morning , Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios President Phil Harrison confirmed what was heavily demanded for import gamers all over the world , and yet previously thought unthinkable for a major corporation : the PS3 will be region - free for gaming .
The move was not unexpected , as SCE had previously mentioned considering the possibility of opening up the region structure for PS3 software ( the newly - released PSP system does n't use a region code for games already , but that 's more of a standard for portable titles than a new development ) .
This system is , amongst other things , hoped to combat piracy -- many import fans " chip " their consoles with region - free mods to play import games , and while that desire has some legitimacy , it also opens the doors for pirates to release illegal copies of games .
( Funnily enough , it 's most often easier to run illegal games on a console than it is to run legit games from other countries due to the way most mod chips work , leading to a slippery slope for importers hoping to stay legit but finding the road difficult to maneuver . )
Region - free gaming also allows publishers to release titles across the globe simultaneously , either through e-distribution or on disc .
The capacity of Blu - Ray had previously been mentioned to allow for multiple languages of a game to be encoded onto the same massive - capacity disc .
The one caveat of this new region - free structure is that games made for specific regions ' electrical and TV standards may have problems on your TV set .
A PAL PS3 game , for instance , will have difficulty running on an NTSC TV , unless the developers have thought ahead and planned for that issue .
It is currently unknown how the PS3 will cope with this problem ( whether there will be a warning when you run an import about possible TV incompatibility , or if there might be a no-play screen for incompatible games depending on your PS3's TV settings . )
Luckily , modern HDTV standards go a long way towards making that problem moot .
Also , games made in other countries will naturally only have the text and dialog it is programmed with -- so do n't pre-order all of those Japanese RPGs and Dragon Ball Z games too fast if you do n't know a lick of kanji ( English will only be in if the developers have planned for it , though it 's unknown if there will be any type of " patching " system for multi-language releases , although that might be possible on supported games post - release now that the PS3 is carrying its massive HDD and flash memory support . )
We 'll have more details on how this impacts publishers and importers as soon as we know more about SCE 's plans for region - free PS3 gaming .
