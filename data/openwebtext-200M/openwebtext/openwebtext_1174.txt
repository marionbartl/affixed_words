Hamid Dabashi says Katie Couric 's lapse allowed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to score points in his interview .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
One of the most memorable episodes of the U.S. presidential election of 2008 was the much - publicized September 2008 interview that CBS Evening News anchor Katie Couric did with Republican vice presidential candidate and then - Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
Quite a number of embarrassing revelations dawned on the American presidential election scene after that interview , including the fact that the person potentially a heartbeat away from U.S. presidency could not name a single newspaper or magazine that she regularly read .
The interview turned out to be so crucial a piece in the course of the presidential campaign that it garnered for Couric the much coveted Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Television Political Journalism , with the judges considering that interview a " defining moment in the 2008 presidential campaign . "
As fate would have it exactly a year after that fateful interview , Katie Couric was destined to have an embarrassing Sarah Palin moment of her own .
In the course of a much anticipated interview with the belligerent Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Couric raised the all - important murder of Neda Aqa Soltan while discussing post-election violence in Iran -- which Ahmadinejad dismissed as an unfortunate event that he said occurred because of chaos instigated by the United States and United Kingdom .
Faced with Couric 's follow - up question , and obviously performing a well - rehearsed move , Ahmadinejad then produced a picture , showed it to Couric and asked her point blank : " Do you know [ the woman in ] this picture ? "
Couric looked at that picture for a second and said " No . "
Ahmadinejad knew at that moment he had his interlocutor where he wanted and drove the point even further and repeated his question , now producing a second picture , " Do you know this woman ? "
Couric again said , " No . "
Then , Ahmadinejad immediately went for the kill .
" Well , you can't be blamed for not knowing her . "
American politicians did n't want her to know about that woman , while they had helped turn Neda Aqa Soltan into a cause célèbre to instigate world opposition to the Islamic Republic , Ahmadinejad said .
Neda Aqa Soltan was killed in the course of a riot in Iran , he concluded , but the woman in those pictures was murdered in a German court of law .
How come she did not know about that woman , while grilling him on Neda Aqa Soltan ?
He scored a point not just against a leading American journalist , but against reason , sanity and decency .
There are more holes in Ahmadinejad 's point than in that proverbial Swiss cheese , none of which seemed to have occurred to Couric , including the fact that the woman in that picture , Marwa Ali El - Sherbini , was the victim of a singularly vicious act of a neo - Nazi racist , while Neda Aqa Soltan was one among many other victims of violence at the hands of the security apparatus of the Islamic Republic .
We might pause for a moment and ask why it is that she did not know who El - Sherbini was and how she was murdered .
Hopefully the answer is not because she has a scarf in that picture and Couric can't tell one scarved woman from another .
The case cannot be dismissed as one of an uninformed journalist ill - prepared for an interview with a master of diversionary tactics -- Couric is a superbly competent , courageous and tenacious journalist .
So the question is what happened to all those fine qualities , perfectly on display when interviewing Sarah Palin , when Couric interviewed Ahmadinejad ?
The tragic case of Marwa Ali El - Sherbini has been in the news all over the world and of course throughout the Arab and Muslim world , and particularly , in Europe .
The Iranian state - controlled media has been citing the case of Marwa Ali El - Sherbini ever since Neda Aqa Soltan was killed and the world began to pay attention to her murder to show " the hypocrisy of the Western media . "
And lo and behold a star of " the Western media , " sitting on the seat where once Walter Cronkite sat , was sitting there a perfect case in point .
Compared to this moment , Couric was in much better shape confronting Ahmadinejad about his denial of the Holocaust with a picture of the victims of a German concentration camp , asking him if this photo she showed him was a fabrication .
Ahmadinejad wanted to dodge the question by yet another rhetorical question , that many atrocities have happened and " why is this one in particular so important to you , " Couric retorted back with a quick jab , " because you are denying it . "
Ahmadinejad 's running - for - cover argument that he cares for all the 60 million people killed during the World War II was by virtue of that single staccato interjection now completely silly and futile .
The successful case Couric made for the reality of the Holocaust makes her failure about Marwa Ali El - Sherbini even more striking .
The answer to the puzzle of Katie Couric 's Sarah Palin moment is neither in any conspiracy of the " Western media " to cover up the case of Marwa Ali El - Sherbini nor the incompetence of an inexperienced journalist unprepared for an important interview .
The answer is in an endemic provincialism that still very much defines American journalism .
There is often a fundamental analytic split between issues that have domestic importance , such as the conduct of the Iranian regime in handling the election protests , and those which Americans tend to view as purely foreign issues , such as the German courtroom killing .
Until we eliminate that split , in a shrunken world no longer divisible into domestic or foreign categories , we wo n't see that world more clearly .
The enduring lesson for the professional journalist of the next generation is to not just be familiar with the internal affairs of a country whose head of state is being interviewed but also to have a comparative and trans- regional perspective to fend off diversionary tactics .
For personifying that lesson and letting Ahmadinejad score points , Couric 's failure can affect the future of American journalism in a far more enduring way than her stellar success when she interviewed Palin .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi .
All About Mahmoud Ahmadinejad • Katie Couric
Here 's the official story :
On the morning of 9/11 Obama , his wife and defence scretary Gates along with about 500 others were at a ceremony at the pentagon .
At 8:46 , the exact time the first plane hit the WTC , they had a moment of silence .
On their way back over the I 395 Memorial bridge the Coast Guard were having a routine river exercise in confronting a suspicious vessel on the river .
It 's not clear who overheard the Guards ' radio transmission but CNN , Fox and others broke into their broadcasts of the ceremony to announce shots fired on the river .
The Guard says it was all a routine drill , no shots were fired and white house spokesman Robert Gibbs chided CNN by saying " Before we report things like this , checking would be good .
" That 's the story all the major MSM players are peddling .
But as usual when something odd goes down the government has to have everything their way and tells us " nothing to see here , just move along .
" First and foremost when bad things happen , there 's always a drill or training exercise in progress .
Sometimes multiple exercises like on 9/11 .
Whether there are or not it 's true that 's the story we 're always told .
Now the questions that beg to be answered .
Why was the Guard pulling a mock emergency at the very instant the presidential motorcade was crossing the river , right next to the bridge it was going over ?
" Coast Guard officials said such training exercises , intended to improve boat - driving skills and to practice for encounters with hostile vessels , took place several times a week , often in the open water near Memorial Bridge , where the presidential motorcade passed .
" OK , shit happens , at the very least it means various departments have poor communication skills .
But if this was routine maneuvering then the secret service , FBI and other agencies would have known beforehand and all hell would n't have broken loose .
" The report on CNN sent FBI agents scrambling to the scene .
Coast Guard Vice Admiral John Currier said that , due to press reports , the FAA temporarily grounded a number of planes at Reagan National Airport until they could sort out the situation .
"
The official story had people monitoring Guard radio when they became alarmed enough to think it was a real emergency .
However the Guard maintains this is how they do their mock emergency drill " Rather than fire blanks , he said , crew members simply described mock gunfire in communications on Channel 81 , an unencrypted marine radio frequency often monitored by hobbyists , saying “ bang , bang ’ ’ and giving the number of nonexistent rounds fired .
" Some guy saying " bang bang " caused all this ?
Protocol dictates all transmissions have to start with someone saying " exercise , exercise " also .
First news accounts actually had an unauthorised craft very near the bridge the motorcade was going over , exactly when they were on it " The incident took place between the Memorial and 14th Street bridges , in a zone that had been blocked off because of the ceremonies .
The timing of the incident was not immediately clear , but President Obama had departed the Pentagon shortly after 10 a.m. ET .
Reports of the incident came in shortly after 10 a.m. ET .
" Apparently when CNN hurriedly contacted the Coast Guard , the offices they called had n't gotten briefed about the cover story they were supposed to claim , because CNN was told the Guard would be idle that day , contradicting the later story about a drill Meaning no exercise .
"
The network said the staffers contacted a Coast Guard spokeswoman , who " said she was . "
" After hearing a further radio transmission about 10 rounds being expended , and after reviewing video of rapid movement by Coast Guard vessels as the President 's motorcade crossed the Memorial Bridge , CNN reported the story , " the network said .
" Simultaneously , during a second phone call , the Coast Guard spokeswoman informed us that itsNothing to see here , just move along .
" Russian Intelligence Analysts are reporting to Prime Minister Putin today that rogue US “ intelligence ” forces have failed in attempting to assassinate President Obama while his motorcade was in route to the White House from the Pentagon where he had joined with top American Military Officers in remembering the events of September 11 , 2001 , and is being called the “ Panic on the Potomac ” affair .
Making this horrendous plot against Obama even more abominable was the propaganda American news media “ immediately ” censoring this attack against their President so as not to alarm their citizens , an action eerily reminiscent of the Nazi German news media who , likewise , censored the many assassination plots against Chancellor Hitler , especially those occurring in 1933 which even today remain illegal in Germany to publish accounts of .
According to a report on this plot prepared for Putin by General Shlyakhturov of the Main Intelligence Directorate ( GRU ) of the Russian General Staff , Obama ’s motorcade was targeted by a “ disguised ” pleasure boat on the Potomac River which was being remotely controlled and set to explode under the I -395 bridge the American President and his security personnel were crossing in route back to the White House .
Upon this boat nearing the I -395 Bridge however it was “ challenged ” by United States Coast Guard and Secret Service crafts and upon its “ failure to respond or alter its course ” was immediately fired upon while at the same time US Marine EA - 18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft protecting Obama ’s motorcade blocked all radio frequencies resulting in the failure of the explosives to detonate . "
Torture is not torture , according to former Vice President Dick Cheney , and to refer it to as such should be considered libelous .
Even if it does n’t actually qualify as libel .
The Washington Times ‘ Amanda Carpenter reports , “ Maintaining his stature as one of the most forceful defenders of the Bush Administration ’s defense policies former Vice President Dick Cheney accused President Obama of committing ‘ libel ’ against CIA interrogators on Wednesday ” during a speech at the Center for Security Policy .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ In the speech , Mr. Cheney charged that President Obama has ‘ filled the air with vague and useless platitude ’ when talking about torture and by calling enhanced interrogation techniques ‘ torture ” he has committed ‘ libel ’ against CIA interrogators whom Mr. Cheney described as ‘ dedicated professionals who acted honorably and well , in our country ’s name and in our country ’s cause , ' ” Carpenter adds .
Cheney ’s full comments Wednesday :
In short , to call enhanced interrogation a program of torture is not only to disregard the program ’s legal underpinnings and safeguards .
Such accusations are a libel against dedicated professionals who acted honorably and well , in our country ’s name and in our country ’s cause .
What ’s more , to completely rule out enhanced interrogation in the future , in favor of half - measures , is unwise in the extreme .
In the fight against terrorism , there is no middle ground , and half - measures keep you half exposed .
As Salon ’s Glenn Greenwald noted last June , “ The U.S. has prosecuted those acts as torture in the past .
Multiple media outlets and even the U.S. Government have routinely described those acts as “ torture ” when used against Americans , rather than by Americans .
The tactics are ones we copied from manuals designed to inure our own troops to the torture techniques used by some of the world ’s worst tyrants .
They resulted in numerous deaths .
Until the Bush administration decided to call it something other than ‘ torture ’ so that they could do it , nobody had any questions about whether this was ‘ torture . ' ”
Dick is n’t the first Cheney to pull the L card on the torture debate .
In May , Elizabeth Cheney said on MSNBC that her father felt “ very strongly that he has an obligation to defend the brave men and women that carried out the program who have been really libeled by the current administration when they call it torture and say we somehow are not upholding American values . ”

Mother Jones ‘ legal adviser James Chadwick later dismissed the charge .
Liz Cheney ’s been reading too much George Orwell and not enough first amendment .
You ca n’t libel the government , and statements of opinion ca n’t be libelous .
I think Liz Cheney would be particularly interested in defending the idea that what constitutes torture is a matter of opinion because if not , her father might be in a lot of trouble .
She ’s not talking about specific allegations about specific people .
She ’s talking about people saying what the US government did … was torture .
One of the reasons the founding fathers established the first amendment was to do away with the idea of seditious libel – libeling the king .
You can not be sued for saying bad things about the government , period .
As Politics Daily ’s David Sessions notes , “ The word ‘ libel ’ typically refers to printed accusations , or those spoken in a broadcast medium , while ‘ slander ’ refers to words spoken in a public setting . ”

Friday Q&A 2009 - 08 - 28 : Intro to Grand Central Dispatch , Part I : Basics and Dispatch Queues
Welcome back to Friday Q&A .
This week 's edition lines up with Apple 's release of Snow Leopard , so I 'm going to take this opportunity to open up the discussion on previously NDA 'd technologies and talk about some of the cool stuff now available in Snow Leopard .
For this week I 'm going to start what I plan to be an ongoing series on Grand Central Dispatch , a topic suggested by Chris Liscio .
What Is It ?
Grand Central Dispatch , or GCD for short , is a low level API which introduces a new way to perform concurrent programming .
For basic functionality it's a bit like NSOperationQueue , in that it allows a program 's work to be divided up into individual tasks which are then submitted to work queues to run concurrently or serially .
It 's lower level and higher performance than NSOperationQueue , and is not part of the Cocoa frameworks .
In addition to the facilities for parallel execution of code , GCD also provides a fully integrated event handling system .
Handlers can be set up to respond to events on file descriptors , mach ports , and processes , to timers and signals , and to user - generated events .
These handlers are executed through the GCD facilities for concurrent execution .
GCD 's API is heavily based around blocks , which I talked about in previous Friday Q&A 's , first to introduce the basics of blocks and then to discuss the practical aspects of using blocks in real - world code .
While GCD can be used without blocks , by using the traditional C mechanism of providing a function pointer and a context pointer , it 's vastly easier to use and ultimately more capable , from a practical standpoint , when used with blocks .
For documentation on GCD , start with man dispatch on a Snow Leopard machine .
Why Use It ?
GCD offers many advantages over traditional multi- threaded programming :
Ease of use : GCD is much easier to work with than threads .
Because it 's based around work units rather than threads of computation , it can take care of common tasks such as waiting for work to finish , monitoring file descriptors , executing code periodically , and suspending work .
The blocks - based APIs make it extremely easy to pass context between different sections of code .
Efficiency : GCD is implemented in a lightweight manner which makes it practical and fast to use GCD in many places where creating dedicated threads is too costly .
This ties into ease of use : part of what makes GCD so easy to use is that for the most part you can just use it , and not worry too much about using it efficiently .
Performance : GCD automatically scales its use of threads according to system load , which in turn leads to fewer context switches and more computational efficiency .
dispatch_retain
dispatch_release
Although pure C , GCD is built in an object - oriented style .
GCD objects are called dispatch objects .
Dispatch objects are reference counted , much like Cocoa objects .
Theandfunctions can be used to manipulate the reference count of dispatch objects for the purposes of memory management .
Note that unlike Cocoa objects , dispatch objects doparticipate in garbage collection , so you will have to manage GCD objects manually even if you have GC enabled .
Dispatch queues and dispatch sources ( more on what these are later ) can be suspended and resumed , can have an arbitrary context pointer associated with them , and can have a finalizer function associated with them .
For more information on these facilities , see man dispatch_object .
Dispatch Queues
A fundamental concept in GCD is that of the dispatch queue .
A dispatch queue is an object which accepts jobs and which executes them in the order in which they arrive .
A dispatch queue can either be concurrent or serial .
A concurrent queue will execute many jobs simultaneously , as appropriate for system load , much like NSOperationQueue .
A serial queue will only execute a single job at a time .
There are three main types of queues in GCD :
The main queue : Analogous to the main thread .
In fact , jobs submitted to the main queue execute on the main thread of the process .
The main queue can be obtained by calling dispatch_get_main_queue ( ) .
Since the main queue is inherently tied to the main thread , it is a serial queue .
Global queues : Global queues are concurrent queues shared through the entire process .
Three global queues exist : a high , a default , and a low priority queue .
Global queues can be accessed by calling dispatch_get_global_queue and telling it which priority you want .
Custom queues : Custom queues ( GCD does not call them this , but does n't have a specific name for these , so I call them " custom " ) are queues created with the dispatch_queue_create function .
These are serial queues which only execute one job at a time .
Because of this , they can be used as a synchronization mechanism , much like a mutex in a traditional threaded program .
dispatch_queue_create
" com.yourcompany.subsystem.task "
NULL
If you want to use a custom queue , you 'll have to create one .
To do this , just call .
The first parameter is a label , which is purely for debugging purposes .
Apple recommends using reverse - DNS naming to give the queue a unique name , like .
These names show up in crash logs and can be queried from the debugger and will help a lot when trying to see where things went wrong .
The second argument is an attribute argument which is currently unsupported , so pass
Submitting Jobs
Submitting a job to a queue is easy : call the dispatch_async function , and pass it a queue and a block .
The queue will then execute that block when it's that block 's turn to execute .
Here is an example of executing some long - running job in the background using a global queue :
dispatch_async ( dispatch_get_global_queue ( DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT
, 0 ) , ^ { [ self goDoSomethingLongAndInvolved ] ; NSLog ( @ " Done doing something long and involved " ) ; } ) ;
dispatch_async
returns immediately , and then the block will execute asynchronously in the background .
Of course , it 's not really very useful to perform an NSLog when the work is done .
In a typical Cocoa application , you probably want to update a part of your GUI , and that in turn means running code on the main thread .
You can easily accomplish this by using nested dispatches , with the outer one performing the background work , and then from within the background block dispatching onto the main queue , like this :
dispatch_async ( dispatch_get_global_queue ( DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT
, 0 ) , ^ { [ self goDoSomethingLongAndInvolved ] ; dispatch_async ( dispatch_get_main_queue ( ) , ^ { [ text Field setStringValue : @ " Done doing something long and involved " ] ; } ) ; } ) ;
dispatch_sync
__block
dispatch_sync
dispatch_get_main_queue
__block NSString * stringValue ; dispatch_sync ( dispatch_get_main_queue ( ) , ^ { // __block variables are n't automatically retained // so we 'd better make sure we have a reference we can keep stringValue = [ [ textField stringValue ] copy ] ; } ) ; [ stringValue autorelease ] ; // use stringValue in the background now
dispatch_queue_t bgQueue = myQueue ; dispatch_async ( dispatch_get_main_queue ( ) , ^ { NSString * stringValue = [ [ [ text
Field stringValue ] copy ] autorelease ] ; dispatch_async ( bgQueue , ^ { // use stringValue in the background now } ) ; } ) ;
myQueue
There is also afunction , which does the same thing but which waits for the block to complete before returning .
In conjunction with thetype qualifier , this can be used to get a value back from the executing block .
For example , you may have some code running on a background thread ( or better yet , a non-main dispatch queue ) which needs to get a value from a GUI control .
You can do this easily by usingand
It can be better to use a more asynchronous programming style , however .
Rather than block background processing to fetch the GUI value , you can use nested blocks to terminate background processing , execute your fetch on the main thread , and then simply submit further processing back in the background .
You can write code like this instead : Depending on your needs , could be a custom queue or it could just be one of the global queues .
Replacing Locks
Custom queues can be used as a synchronization mechanism in place of locks .
In traditional multi - threaded programming , you might have an object which is designed to be usable from multiple threads .
In order to accomplish this , it protects all accesses to shared data using a lock , which you might find in an instance variable :
NSLock * lock ;
- ( id ) something { id localSomething ; [ lock lock ] ; localSomething = [ [ something retain ] autorelease ] ; [ lock unlock ] ; return localSomething ; } - ( void ) setSomething :( id ) newSomething { [ lock lock ] ; if ( newSomething != something ) { [ something release ] ; something = [ newSomething retain ] ; [ self updateSomethingCaches ] ; } [ lock unlock ] ; }
dispatch_queue_t queue ;
dispatch_queue_create
dispatch_async
dispatch_sync
- ( id ) something { __block id localSomething ; dispatch_sync ( queue , ^ { localSomething = [ something retain ] ; } ) ; return [ localSomething autorelease ] ; } - ( void ) setSomething :( id ) newSomething { dispatch_async ( queue , ^ { if ( newSomething != something ) { [ something release ] ; something = [ newSomething retain ] ; [ self updateSomethingCaches ] ; } } ) ; }
Then accesses look like this : Using GCD , you can replace the instance variable with a queue :
In order to be used as a synchronization mechanism , the queue must be a custom queue , not a global queue , so you would initialize it using .
You would then wrap all code accessing shared data inorNote that dispatch queues are extremely lightweight so it 's entirely reasonable to use them just as often as you would use a lock .
At this point you may be asking , this is all well and good , but what 's the point ?
I just switched code from one mechanism to another mechanism that looks pretty much the same .
Why would you do this ?
There are actually several advantages to the GCD approach :
Parallelism : Notice how - setSomething : uses dispatch_async in the second version of the code .
This means that the call to - setSomething : will return right away , and then the bulk of the work will happen in the background .
This could be a significant win if updateSomethingCaches is a costly operation and the caller will be doing something processor intensive as well .
Safety :
It 's impossible to accidentally write a code path that does n't unlock the lock using GCD .
In normal locked code it's not unusual to inadvertently put a return statement in the middle of the lock , or conditionalize the exit , or something equally unfortunate .
With GCD , the queue always continues to run and you can't help but return control to it normally .
Control :
It 's possible to suspend and resume dispatch queues at will , which cannot easily be done with a locks - based approach .
It 's also possible to point a custom queue at another dispatch queue , making it inherit the attributes of that other dispatch queue .
Using this , the priority of the queue can be adjusted by making it point to the different global queues , and the queue can even be made to execute code on the main thread if this were required for some reason .
Integration : The GCD event system integrates with dispatch queues .
Any events or timers that the object needs to use can be pointed at the object 's queue , causing the handlers to automatically run on that queue , making them automatically synchronized with the object .
Conclusion
Now you know the basics of Grand Central Dispatch , how to create dispatch queues , how to submit jobs to dispatch queues , and how to use queues as a substitute for locks in multithreaded programs .
Next week I 'll show you techniques for using GCD to write code which performs parallel processing to extract more performance out of multi-core systems .
And in the coming weeks , I 'll discuss more of GCD in depth , including the event system and queue targeting .
That wraps up this week 's Friday Q&A .
Come back next week for more GCD goodness .
And just because I have a subject mapped out for a few weeks does n't mean I do n't need your suggestions .
Quite the contrary : Friday Q&A is driven by your suggestions , and the more I have , the better posts I 'll be able to make when I get to the end of this series .

Here ’s something everybody should understand about journalism .
The reporters , columnists and news anchors you follow almost all have opinions about the subjects they cover .
There is nothing wrong with this .
In fact , it is a good thing , because any person who immersed him or herself in a vital , contentious subject all day and formed no opinion about it whatsoever would be an idiot , and you do not want to get your news from idiots .
Some journalists ( like me ) are paid to express opinions .
Others are paid to report news without regard to their opinions–and many , though not all , do an excellent job of this .
And many more are required to hide their opinions by their bosses , in the belief that it builds reader confidence to maintain the illusion that the news is produced by people without opinions , i.e. , idiots .
That is the spirit behind a new policy at the Washington Post about staffers using Twitter , which manages to get both social media and journalism wrong at the same time , and suggests that the newspaper is working hard to make itself as irrelevant as possible .
The Post drew up its policy after one of its managing editors , Raju Narisetti , posted tweets to his Twitter account that touched on a couple of political issues :
We can incur all sorts of federal deficits for wars and what not .
But we have to promise not to increase it by $ 1 for healthcare reform ?
Sad. and Sen Byrd ( 91 ) in hospital after he falls from “ standing up too quickly . ”
How about term limits .
Or retirement age .
Or commonsense to prevail .
There you have it : a man whose sole job is to focus on news and issues has opinions on health care , deficits and term limits .
Shocking .
It was shocking to Narisetti ’s bosses , anyway , who quickly instituted rules for staff Twitter and other social - networking activity that included the following : “ When using these networks , nothing we do must call into question the impartiality of our news judgment …
Post journalists must refrain from writing , tweeting or posting anything – including photographs or video – that could be perceived as reflecting political racial , sexist , religious or other bias or favoritism that could be used to tarnish our journalistic credibility . ”
See , obviously you and I know a guy like Narisetti , not being an idiot , has opinions .
That ’s fine .
As long as he treats them like a shameful secret and hides them from us like a fat kid reinventing himself on a piece of awful home exercise equipment .
Then we can all have trust in the media !
Sigh .
I ’ve expounded before on why it ’s a bogus idea that repressing opinions makes journalists fairer or more trustworthy .
In short : by having policies like these , newspapers only reinforce an inaccurate idea of their own profession .
Objectivity does not mean having no opinions .
( Having no opinions more likely is a sign of apathy or stupidity . )
Nor does it mean having opinions but hiding them .
It means having opinions — as intelligent , informed people do — but not subordinating your work to them .
It means being truthful and fair about your area of coverage , even if doing so hurts the causes you support .
If you slant your coverage , hiding your beliefs does not make your work better .
If your work is fair , sharing your beliefs does not make it less so ( on the contrary , it provides your reader more information to keep you honest ) .
But by perpetuating a fiction no one believes anyway , newspapers do n’t make themselves trustworthy ; they just seem phony .
What ’s more , as I wrote when the Wall Street Journal adopted a similarly hamhanded policy earlier this year , this kind of policy sabotages the kind of intimate connection with readers that Twitter and other services make possible , and that newspapers desperately need .
( As do their writers , for the day that newspaper lays them off and they ’re on their own ; the Post ’s policy should make any journo with options think twice about taking a job there . )
I get why : to successfully use Twitter et al. , you have to give up control , and that scraes scares the hell out of institutions like the Post .
Their old way of doing business is to make sure that ( except for a few stars like Bob Woodward ) their staff remain anonymous drones who subordinate themselves to the paper ’s brand .
But that day is over , and the Post only hurts its brand by handcuffing its writers on Twitter .
Its policy amounts to : just do n’t say anything interesting , and things will be fine .
Now , there actually is some common sense in the Post ’s new dictates .
For instance , the reminder that you should treat anything you post to Twitter , Facebook , etc. , as if it can and will be widely read .
But these common - sense guidelines should be left to just that : common sense ( without which , why would you have a job at the Post in the first place ? ) .
There are plenty of reasons to avoid oversharing online — for instance , not antagonizing a source you might need information from .
But that decision should be left to the writers , and the writers judged on their work .
As for Narisetti ’s tweets , restricting them has nothing to do with serving the reader better ; it ’s all about avoiding embarrassment for the Post .
And needlessly .
I do n’t agree with all that he posted .
( For what it ’s worth , I ’m glad to raise deficits for healthcare reform if it drives down costs in the long term , but I think all term limits are antidemocratic . )
But I do n’t think any less of him for posting them .
Thanks to its new policy , though , I do think less of the Post .
Or rather — because it believes that we have to be protected from information about its staff ’s opinions — I now know how much less it thinks of us .
YOUR Majesties , Your Royal Highnesses , Excellencies , honorable members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee , ladies and gentlemen 
This is awkward .
This is really awkward .
Wow .
You know , two months ago , when Thorbjorn Jagland announced that I had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , I said that I was “ humbled . ”
Today I have several other words : “ Baffled . ” “ Incredulous . ” “ Slightly - very - irritated . ”
But ultimately , conventional adjectives fail to convey the powerful rush of emotions one experiences at receiving such a surprising and politically tone - deaf honor .
And so I have invented a new word : it ’s called “ thorbjorn . ”
As in , “ Wow , those Scandinavians completely thorbjorned my hard - earned political capital . ”
I know , it ’s not the best name .
In fact , I had hoped that Philip Roth would help me out on this one , but for some reason he could n’t make it .
And so , ladies and gentlemen , I am humbled , humbled and thorbjorned to be here .
I am reminded of another great day in my life  July 14  when I had the distinction of throwing out the first pitch at the All - Star Game .
Who could have guessed that three months later , I would be awarded the American League Cy Young award ?
That ’s a joke , ladies and gentlemen .
Seriously , it was just one pitch .
Have you ever thought you had a really great idea for a Simpsons character ?
Well , this is your chance to shine .
And potentially brag to your friends ...
FOX have announced a new contest called " Best. Character .

Fans 18 years of age and older will have an opportunity to produce the newest Springfield resident and create the character 's traits , including name / nickname , age , appearance , occupation and catchphrases , at TheSimpsons.com .
The deadline for submissions is 11:59 PM ET on October 24 , 2009 .
It 's been a busy couple of weeks for animated series announcing big contests - South Park just began their own contest in which the winner will be animated into the show Wondering why you do n't see anything about The Simpsons contest at the official website yet ?
We were too .
We contacted FOX who apologized and promised the contest details will be up later today .
statistics , vaccines , and viral evolution
Researchers recommend a flu shot even in years when it 's not very effective .
Why ?
Because it slows the spread of the virus .
How many times have you heard people tell you that flu vaccines are a waste of time because they still end up getting the flu anyways ?
And considering that about 5 % to 20 % of people in the U.S. could get the flu every year , depending on the severity of the strain , the number of vaccinations and exposure to the contagion in large and concentrated populations , flu shots do seem like a relatively fruitless effort at first .
However , there ’s a caveat to the anecdotal tales of people getting their annual vaccinations , then coming down with the flu anyway .
Rather then getting the full blown flu , they ’re much more likely to get a really bad cold or a respiratory virus for which a flu shot provides no defense , self - diagnose themselves as having the flu , then refuse a flu shot and really get lab - confirmed influenza during the next season , which only further reinforces their conclusions about the shot .
Now , it ’s well known that there are plenty of people who really do get a flu shot and still come down with a fully legitimate case of influenza .
According to the CDC , the vaccine is about 86 % effective in healthy adults under 65 and is obviously less effective for people with compromised immune systems .
The referenced study in the fact sheet is n’t just a survey of who got the shot and whether they got the disease or not .
It actually tests how well a vaccine does against the virus itself and concluded that when there ’s a good match between the strain of influenza in force and the strain in the vaccine , healthy adults stand an almost 9 in 10 chance of not getting sick .
If you start including other influenza - like infections and airborne viruses that produce similar symptoms , but are not caused by the influenza virus itself , the efficacy rates plummet but you end up measuring viruses outside the vaccine ’s scope and skewing your results .
It ’s true that there are years where major mismatches between the vaccine and wild strains do occur , but even then , you ’re looking at a 60 % effectiveness rate , which means you ’ll be able to fight the virus 6 times out of 10 .
So even in a bad year , you get a measurable benefit from the flu shot .
The problem is that it might not feel like it because many respiratory viruses have very similar symptoms .
Rhinoviruses are so often confused for fully fledged influenza without a laboratory test that even doctors can frequently get the diagnosis wrong and there are symptom guides to help determine which one you may have .
Unfortunately , real diseases do n’t follow any of those guides and severe colds can feel just as bad as the flu .
The point however , is that you ’ve been able to help prevent yourself from contracting full blown influenza infections and just because you feel terrible does n’t mean that you have the flu and your shot was worthless .
You simply would n’t know that without a lab test .
Another interesting bit of science is a recent experiment done by NIH scientists which shows that vaccines can actually help steer influenza ’s evolution in a direction favorable for us .
Our immune systems recognize the proteins of the virion ’s capsid ( the part of the virus that contains its genetic material ) and attack .
Mutations that change the way the proteins are arranged can confuse our immune cells and let the infection take place and when our immune cells have been tempered with a vaccine , the selective pressures in our body change how the protein coat of the influenza virus is shaped .
And while it sounds as if we ’re making it more potent , it ’s not really what ’s happening .
Instead , the virus becomes harder to transmit .
It ’s less infections .
When the mutated virions were injected back into unvaccinated mice used by the researchers , they quickly evolved back to more spreadable forms .
The only variable between the groups of mice being studied was the vaccine .
In a write - up for Discovery News , lead researcher Jonathan Yewdell summed up his results thusly …
‘ We want to box flu in as much as we can .
With more antibody pressure from vaccinated people , it ’s got to bind tighter , and the virus is not so happy . ’
So now the big question .
If the vaccines really do help against influenza , why not create one for colds and end the respiratory misery of flu and cold season ?
Well , unfortunately for us , there are so many rhinovirus variants , a vaccine for the common cold would be highly inefficient .
Sadly , suffering from bad colds is going to continue for the foreseeable future .
And while on the surface of things , you may wonder what ’s the point if you may still have to endure misery anyway , keep in mind that influenza can trigger pneumonia and pose a lethal threat to people with compromised or weak immune systems while worsening existing heart conditions .
That ’s what you ’re really defending against when you get a flu shot , not from having a lousy week or two every winter .
And , of course , to make the virus less of a menace over the long term with selective pressure from our trained and tempered immune systems primed with vaccine induced antibodies .

I have just finished reading Confederacy of Dunces .
At 41 years old , I have no heistation - not a moment 's - in shouting as loudly as possible that this is , quite simply , the worst piece of utter cr*p I have ever read .
I am open - mouthed in complete astonishment that anyone can say this is anywhere near approaching `good ' or even `readable ' .
It is just cr*p .
There is no alternative but to resort to the vernacular .
So , the author committed suicide because no - one would publish it ?
Really , you do n't say ?
If I 'd have been around , I would have shot him and saved him the bother .
God in Heaven , I was ready to commit suicide within 50 pages !
There is not an ounce of skill in this ; no rhyme nor reason .
What is the point of this book ?
It starts nowhere , it goes nowhere , it ends nowhere .
The lead character , Ignatius J Reilly , is as unlikeable and unbelievable as he is fat .
Other characters just drift in and out like ... I do n't know what .
I am lost for words to describe how turgid this waste of paper is .
The dialogue is just ridiculous .
It does n't make sense .
At the start , Ignatius and his mother have the most nonsensical conversation that alternates , line by line , between togetherness , hatred , stupidity ...
And then much later in the book , Ignatius has some seemingly drug - induced psycho- babble between himself and an effete Dorian Greene .
It is IMPOSSIBLE to even follow this dialogue , let alone make sense of it .
It is the sort of stuff you 'd expect a 12 - year - old to write , it really is .
One reviewer on Amazon says he farted he laughed so much .
I sat frowning at how such rubbish ever made it into print .
I had the Penguin version with the striped box of popcorn on the front .
If you have yet to buy this book ( declare bankruptcy to avoid the prospect ) , flick to page 271 and read from the top to the end of the chapter on page 283 , or as far as you can get before the bookshop staff get restless .
If you have n't been put off by these pages , then , OK , this book is for you .
God help you .
I admit that I raised my personal rating from one - out - of - ten to two , purely because I thought : there must be a point to this , there must be something at the end that will make me think this was worth my time .
But no .
Nothing .
Clearly the author John Kennedy
Toole was a closet gay , but he conveys his baggage ( understandable for the era ) in the Ignatius character in the most revolting ways .
Do n't ever , ever , ever waste time or money on this piece of cr*p .
As the Dow Jones Industrial Average celebrates its triumphant return to 10,000 and Wall Street ’s infamous , massive bonuses return , The Los Angeles Times was left wondering Thursday morning : “ Where ’s the outrage ? ”
As if to answer their question , filmmaker Michael Moore made an appearance on NBC ’s Today Show , explaining to interviewer Matt Lauer that such numbers are echoing from America ’s financial sector because bankers are being rewarded for “ burning down our economy . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Michael , let me make sure people understand this , ” began Lauer .
“ A Wall Street Journal report says that Wall Street firms are going to pay out about $ 140 billion in bonuses this year .
A year before the economic meltdown , 2007 , they paid out about $ 130 billion .
So , it ’s gone up .
How ’s this news going to go over with people like in your home state , Michigan , that just found out unemployment is at 15.3 percent in that state ? ”
“ Eventually , people are n’t going to take it , ” Moore deadpanned .
“ I do n’t know how many gated communities these people — who are taking this $ 140 billion in bonuses — I do n’t know how many castles with moats around them they can build , but I ’ll tell ya something .
There ’s an anger that ’s building out there .
“ I mean , Matt , these people , they burned down our economy .
They completely crashed it .
And now , they ’re getting rewarded for it .
Look , if I burned down your house today , and then tomorrow you sent me a check , thanking me … I mean , it ’s absolutely insane that we allow this to happen .
But , not surprising , because that ’s our capitalist system .
They can get away with it , ’ cause it ’s legal , they can make whatever they want to make , they can take whatever they want to take . ”
The Journal ‘s report ( subscriber content ) studied securities filings for the first half of 2009 and revenue estimates through year - end .
Total compensation and benefits at publicly traded firms that the Journal analyzed were on track to increase 20 percent from last year ’s 117 billion dollars , and to top 2007 ’s 130 billion dollar payout .
ADVERTISEMENT
This year , employees at the companies will earn an estimated 143,400 dollars on average , up almost 2,000 dollars from 2007 levels , it said .
Financial firms have been boosted by a stronger stock market , thawing credit market , a resurgence in deal making and the continuing effects of various government aid programs , even though the economy remains sluggish and unemployment is near double digit levels .
The rebound also reflected growing confidence by some Wall Street firms that they can again pay top dollar for top talent , especially once they have repaid the taxpayer - funded capital infusions they received at the height of the crisis , the Journal said .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Okay , let ’s see , ” said Moore .
“ Let ’s pay the best people — these people , who helped to wreck and ruin our economy — let ’s pay them for what they did .
This is absolutely crazy logic .
There are 14,000 people every day that lose their health insurance .
As you said in your report , there ’s 15 million people out of work .
There ’s a home that ’s foreclosed in this country every seven and a half seconds .
Now , sooner or later people are going to say , ‘ That ’s it .
That ’s enough . ' ”
He continued : “ You said that Bank of America is going to hand out $ 30 billion in bonuses ?
You know how much TARP money — bailout money , our money — they got ?
$ 30 billion .
That ’s our money !
This , I … If people just sit by and let this happen , then we deserve everything we get . ”

Because of the growing alienation of young Iranians , family dynamics could be complex , particularly among the families of elite government officials .
“ These children are more affected by society and even Facebook and Twitter on the Internet than their families , ” said Alireza Haghighi , an Iranian political analyst at the University of Toronto .
“ The younger generation has been very frustrated with the political situation . ”

In Ms. Kalhor ’s case , her parents ’ religious and political conservatism did not extend to daily life .
Her father , who has been an adviser to Mr. Ahmadinejad since 2005 , helped and encouraged Ms. Kalhor to become a graphic designer and a filmmaker .
Mr. Kalhor embodied other contradictions , having appeared as a campaigner for Mr. Ahmadinejad on national television in 2005 wearing his long hair in a ponytail  something that is frowned upon by conservatives  and saying that all Iranians in exile , including the son of the shah , would be allowed to return to the country if Mr. Ahmadinejad were elected .
Ms. Kalhor said that through it all she remained close to her father until a year ago , when he moved out after separating from her mother .
But she was also developing her own political views , she said .
“ My generation wants its most basic needs such as freedom of expression and personal freedoms , ” she said .
“ We want to live , we do not want to face persecution for expressing our political opinion ; as women , we do n’t want to walk on the street with the constant horror that we could be intimidated for showing an inch of hair . ”
She said she began participating in the rallies in favor of Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s leading opponent , Mir Hussein Moussavi , before the elections and voted for him in hope of real change .
Infuriated by Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s re-election , which she called a “ gross lie , ” she joined the protests , during which , she said , she was beaten by the police and tear - gassed .
“ This was an explosion of 30 years of suppression and intimidations of my generation , ” she said of the protests .
“ I am happy that we finally found the courage to speak up . ”

Update from Pam :
It does n’t matter why this behavior is occurring , really .
What one has to take away from this message , naturally not attributed to anyone at the WH — cowards — is that bloggers are messing up their playbooks .
And the answer is to diminish what influence we have — it ’s limited at best .
You have to ask why is this paranoid , juvenile message getting tossed out there .
All those big brains in the White House and the best they can do is to bring up the hoary pajama game ?
…..
So which Barack Obama is it — the one who said to challenge him , or a fragile flower that panders to LGBTs then has a coward source backstab ?
To me the WH has just declared war on us after a wine and dine with the right kind of LGBTs that do n’t make trouble for them .
Someone has to answer to this .
Or do I just need to fold my hands in my pajama - clad , Cheetos - stained lap like a good homo ?
And let me just add that if we ’re all insignificant children who do n’t understand politics , and who the White House does n’t worry about , then why did a White House official feel the need to lash out at us via the NBC Nightly news ?
I ’m not feeling very insignificant at the moment , are you ?

NBC just did a piece about today ’s gay rights march in Washington .
For the political context of the gay community ’s ire , NBC went to Chief Washington Correspondent John Harwood .
Harwood was asked if the White House was worried about “ the left as a whole , ” and concerns they have that the White House is n’t doing things that “ the left ” expected them to do .
Harwood said the following :
Barack Obama is doing well with 90 % or more of Democrats so the White House views this opposition as really part of the Internet left fringe .
Harwood then went on to say :
For a sign of how seriously the White House does or does n’t take this opposition , one adviser told me those bloggers need to take off the pajamas , get dressed , and realize that governing a closely divided country is complicated and difficult .
So the gay community , and its concerns about President Obama ’s inaction , and backtracking , on DADT and DOMA , are now , according to President Obama ’s White House , part of a larger “ fringe ” that acts like small children who play in their pajamas and need to grow up .
( And a note to our readers : The White House just included all of you in that loony “ left fringe . ” )
I wonder how the Human Rights Campaign is going to explain how the White House just knifed our community less than 24 hours after he went to their dinner and claimed he was our friend .
Someone in that White House needs to be fired .
Here ’s the video :
And another thing .
The country is “ closely divided ” ?
Barack Obama won the election by 192 electoral votes , Democrats control both Houses of Congress , have a filibuster proof majority in the Senate , and the opposition Republicans have been utterly decimated , and are floundering in the polls .
This is closely divided ?
This is an environment in which Democrats are going to have to recognize that the president is going to have to break his promises ?
Maybe it ’s time for some White House advisers to get out of their pajamas and read a newspaper once in a while .
They might find out that we actually won the election ( and that the blogs – and the gay community – played a key role in that victory ) .
This governing from a position of weakness and fear “ thing ” is getting old , fast .
Today is Ride To Work Day and the Federal Government has announced a $ 40 million funding package for bikeways around the country .
The joint launch of the program with the Australian Greens will see funding matched by local governments nationwide .
Infrastructure Minister Anthony Albanese says the projects will target areas with high levels of unemployment .
" It will fund more than 170 bike paths right around the country , more than 1,900 jobs will be created directly as a result of this funding , " he said .
Mr Albanese says there are benefits for the environment and the economy .
" One - thousand - nine - hundred jobs will be created as a result of this cycling infrastructure program , " he said .
" So helping to insulate Australia from the impact of the global financial crisis , supporting jobs for the short term but creating infrastructure and benefit for local communities in the long term . "
View Patterns as Pattern Matching for Records
I ’ve learned a lot in the last day about record systems for Haskell built as libraries .
I came up with what seemed like an obvious answer , and indeed it was essentially the same as two existing packages on Hackage — fclabels and data - accessor — the second of which is among the more popular downloads out there .
That ’s always a good sign , that a significant number of people needed the same thing , and liked the same answer .
But there are some things , still , that are provided by the built - in package system , either as standard features or GHC extensions , that it ’s unclear how to accomplish as a library .
The one that ’s intriguing me most right now is pattern matching , because I think it almost got inadvertently solved a couple years ago .
Right now , I can write this for a record type in Haskell .
foo :: MyRecord ->
Int foo ( MyRecord { field1 = Just k , field2 = 4 , field3 = ( x : _ ) } ) = 4*k - x
That ’s a pattern match that disassembles the record , by named fields , and matches each field using the full variety of patterns available in any other context .
Pretty powerful stuff .
Unfortunately , it ’s built in to Haskell ’s rather limited record system , and is among the casualties incurred when switching to a different system .
One needs to fall back to the underlying “ native ” record .
In the case of the fclabels and data - accessor packages , for example , this means using a whole separate set of names involving underscores , further polluting the namespace with symbols related only by similarity of name .
Not a purely practical disadvantage , perhaps , but one that I ’m sure grates against the nerves of anyone looking for neat , elegant answers .
Fortunately , as I mentioned briefly in my last post , the answer already exists , and has already been added to GHC .
The answer here is view patterns .
In data - accessor package language , one can actually write the following to express part of the above .
foo ( ( ^. field1 ) ->
Just k ) = k
( Admittedly , one does obtain a warning about pattern matching overlaps when doing this .
I ’m unsure why . )
Unfortunately , this very nice approach does n’t appear to currently extend as nicely to pattern matching on several fields at the same time .
A view pattern has one view , which matches an argument ; a second view pattern matches a second argument , which is n’t what we want .
The best we can do is to define a view that selects several fields …
foo ( ( ^. field1 ) &&& ( ^. field3 ) ->
( Just k , ( x : _ ) ) ) = 4 *
k
Barely passable for two fields … but add a third field , and suddenly you have to know about the associativity of &&& ( which , by the way , we took from the Control .
Arrow package ) .
Besides , the distance and way that conditions on different fields are mixed together is n’t terribly appealing .
We ’d really like to just be able to pattern match the same argument multiple times , requiring that all of them succeed .
Ironically , this is hardly a new problem .
It ’s actually the same thing encountered in @ -patterns .
One wants to pattern match twice there , too — once to bind a name to the entire value , and again to deconstruct it and bind names or match pieces .
Without view patterns , that was the only situation in which one might want to pattern match the same value in several ways ; the only choice was to either open up a data constructor and match on it , or else do n’t .
With view patterns , though , the possibility arises any number of ways .
( Data .
FingerTree contains both the functions viewl and viewr , for instance ; I ’m not personally aware of an application that would like to pattern match on both at once , but it does n’t seem terribly hard to imagine that it might occur . )
It makes sense to propose , in lieu of trying to invent a way to extend record pattern - matching syntax to a new kind of records , to simply provide a mechanism for simultaneously pattern - matching the same argument in several ways .
What we would obtain from this is to generalize the problems solved by @ - patterns and record syntax at once , as well as potential future as - yet - unidentified problems .
In other words , the real feature we want is simultaneous patterns — multiple patterns that are matched side - by - side with a single value .
The semantics are that the pattern match succeeds only if all of them do , in which case all of the variables occurring in the pattern are appropriately bound .
In my last post , I proposed using a semicolon to separate the patterns .
Here ’s the previous example in this form , using data - accessor syntax .
foo :: MyRecord ->
Int foo ( ( ^.field1 ) ->
Just k ; ( ^.field2 ) -> 4 ; ( ^.field3 ) -> ( x : _ ) ) = 4*k - x
With that , we ’d have solved one of the outstanding issues in building a library replacement for Haskell ’s distinguished record syntax .
Essentially , there ’d just be no more need for a “ special ” record syntax for pattern matching .
We ’d have done it not by adding a new distinguished record syntax , but rather by opening up the existing pattern matching features ( including view patterns , of course ) to accomodate a rather straight - forward extension .
If I do n’t see an obvious reason not to pursue this , I may try to determine how difficult it would be to implement this as a GHC extension .
The subsequent history of the Baltic and Volga Finns , however , was quite different .
Having migrated , via Upper Volga and its tributaries , far to the west to the shores of the Baltic Sea , The above - mentioned shift is usually dated by linguists at about the fifth century BCE , whereas the culture of the Stone Kurgans with box coffins ( Steinkistengraber ) -- unmistakably Scandinavian in origin -- began to appear in mass on the shores of Estonia starting from the first century of the first millennium BCE .
Supposed Proto - Germans or Pre-Germans were culturally and linguistically assimilated , adding to present - day Finns and Estonians a considerable element of the lightly pigmented North Atlantic phenotype ( Napolskih 1997: 6 - 7 ) .
Migration from Estonia to Finland and Karelia put an end to the short period of existence of the common Volga - Baltic Finn proto- language and began the formation of the Northern and Southern linguistic groups of the Baltic Finn language sub -sub - family .
The Karelians , Veps , and Ingrians , unlike the Lutheran Estonians , Livs , and the majority of the Latvians , belonged to the Russian Orthodox Church for their entire Christian history , as Northern Russian ( Novgorod ) missionaries were the first to baptize them .
The Estonians , Livs , and Votes belong to the Southern group . ( Pimenov 1994:124 ) .
The Ingrians ( one of their self - names is Karjalain , the same as among the Karelians ) split from the rest of the Karelians in the late first to early second millennium CE .
After settling in the Karelian Isthmus and the Neva and Izhora river basins , they started their southwestward movement in the eleventh century , reaching the Luga and Narova rivers in the twelfth century .

Berlusconi : « Non darò le dimissioni ,
sono il miglior premier di sempre »
Il premier : « Sono stato sempre assolto , la prescrizione non è una condanna .
I processi di Milano sono farse »
ROMA - « Non darò le dimissioni sono il miglior premier di sempre .
Sono stato sempre assolto , la prescrizione non è una condanna .
I processi di Milano sono autentiche farse .
Andrò in tv e lo spiegherò agli italiani .
Io sono un argine alla sinistra e vogliono sovvertire il voto degli elettori .
Sono in assoluto il maggior perseguitato dalla magistratura di tutta la storia di tutte le epoche del mondo » .
Silvio Berlusconi conclude alla sua maniera le polemiche politiche susseguenti alla bocciatura da parte della Consulta del Lodo Alfano la legge che prevedeva l'immunità per le 4 principali cariche dello Stato .
GAFFE SULLA MAGISTRATURA -
Poi nella sua dura critica alla magistratura di sinistra il premier cade anche in una gaffe involontaria : « Sono un perseguitato dalla magistratura .
Il più grande perseguitato della storia , visto che sono stato sempre assolto , con due prescrizioni .
Ho speso 200 milioni di euro per i giudici ... scusate , per gli avvocati » .
RAPPORTO CON NAPOLITANO - Poi Berlusconi ne ha anche per Napolitano : « Non bisogna essere ipocriti .
Io sono di destra , Napolitano è di sinistra .
Non si deve offendere » .
Accuse anche contro la Consulta , che , per il premier : « E ' stata sleale con il Parlamento » .
E dire che dopo gli attacchi dei giorni scorsi contro Corte Costituzionale e Quirinale , Berlusconi aveva tentato in mattinata di smorzare i toni .
Il premier affermava che è ancora possibile una « leale collaborazione » con il Colle .
All ' indomani della nota diffusa dopo l'incontro tra Giorgio Napolitano e i presidenti di Camera e Senato , Fini e Schifani ( « Napolitano rispetta la Costituzione » ) , dunque , il premier aveva tentato un riavvicinamento con il Presidente della Repubblica .
A proposito delle frasi degli ultimi giorni ( « si sa da che parte sta Napolitano » ) , Berlusconi però ribadiva la sua idea : « È chiaro a tutti che in Italia non c'è nessuno che si può considerare super partes .
Bisogna sgombrare il campo dalle troppe ipocrisie perché la coabitazione tra due parti politiche non è mai facile » .
Nessuna marcia indietro , insomma , sulle critiche rivolte al Capo dello Stato : « È un fatto che il presidente è sempre stato un protagonista della sinistra e nulla può cambiare la sua storia politica » .
Berlusconi conclude tuttavia : « Per il futuro sono convinto che sia possibile una leale dialettica tra Quirinale e Governo e sono certo che non ci sarà nessun ostacolo al nostro programma di riforme per cambiare l'Italia » .
CONSENSO - E a proposito dell ' idea di lanciare una manifestazione di piazza , Berlusconi affermava che non è necessaria .
« Siamo al governo - dice il presidente del Consiglio al Tg5 - abbiamo il consenso popolare , un consenso che è aumentato .
Se c'è un governo legittimato dal sostegno degli elettori è il nostro .
È chiaro che siamo maggioranza e governeremo per cinque anni » .
ATTACCO AL CORRIERE DELLA SERA - Poi il premier ha attaccato anche il nostro giornale .
« Il Corriere della Sera per nostra sfortuna » è passato da essere « un foglio della borghesia conservatrice a un foglio di sinistra » .
Questo « ci dispiace molto : sentiamo la mancanza del Corriere che fu » .

Turns out that these same sleazeballs also monitor your kids '
IM sessions and sell the info to market - research companies that want to fine - tune how they sell sugar and explosions to kids .
Software sold under the Sentry and FamilySafe brands can read private chats conducted through Yahoo , MSN , AOL and other services , and send back data on what kids are saying about such things as movies , music or video games .
The information is then offered to businesses seeking ways to tailor their marketing messages to kids .
" This scares me more than anything I have seen using monitoring technology , " said Parry Aftab , a child - safety advocate .
" You do n't put children 's personal information at risk … "

Keith Olbermann Exposes Obama Racism From The Right
MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann cites several examples of why thet right is racist for criticizing President Obama
Mine shafts on the point of being closed down could be used to provide geothermal energy to local towns .
This is the conclusion of two engineers from the University of Oviedo , whose research is being published in the journal Renewable Energy .
The method they have developed makes it possible to estimate the amount of heat that a tunnel could potentially provide .
" One way of making use of low - intensity geothermal energy is to convert mine shafts into geothermal boilers , which could provide heating and hot water for people living nearby " , Rafael Rodríguez , from the Oviedo Higher Technical School of Mining Engineering , tells SINC .
This type of energy , which is hardly used in Spain , is obtained from the internal heat of the Earth .
The engineer and his colleague María Belarmina Díaz have developed a " semi-empirical " method ( part mathematical and part experimental ) to calculate the amount of heat that could be produced by a mine tunnel that is due to be abandoned , based on studies carried out while it is still in use .
" When the mine is still active one can access the tunnels easily in order to gather data about ventilation and the properties of the rocks , as well as to take samples and design better circuits , and even programme the closure of some sections in order to use them for geothermal energy production " , says the engineer , who stresses that , although geothermal energy can be made use of once the mine is closed , " it is no longer possible by that stage to make any modifications , or to gather any useful data to evaluate and improve the system " .
The study looks into geothermal exploitation of a two - kilometre - long mine shaft , in which the temperature of the rocks 500 m below the surface is around 30 º
C .
This is typical of many of the mining areas in Asturias , although it could also be applied to other parts of the world .
Water could be forced in through tubes at 7 º C and return at 12 º C , a big enough heat gain to be of benefit to towns located above the mines .
Advantages of geothermal energy from mines
Rodríguez and Díaz highlight the benefits of building geothermal boilers in mine shafts in that , aside from their predictable energy production levels , they also function practically as an open tube system " but without any risk of heat contamination of aquifers " .
Using geothermal energy also helps to reduce CO 2 emissions , and is not dependent upon climatic conditions ( unlike other renewable energies such as solar or wind power ) .
Other advantages are that these facilities make use of a country 's own resources , do not require new developments on large sites , do not pollute the immediate environment , and are believed to be profitable over the long term .
Geothermal energy can be used directly in family homes , housing developments , swimming pools , fish farms , industrial units and other buildings .

The House health care reform bill is about 400,000 words long .
1,990 pages at $ 2.2 million a word
It runs more pages than War and Peace , has nearly five times as many words as the Torah , and its tables of contents alone run far longer than this story .
The House health care bill unveiled Thursday clocks in at 1,990 pages and about 400,000 words .
With an estimated 10 - year cost of $ 894 billion , that comes out to about $ 2.24 million per word . .

And for some members , that may not be enough .
A “ robust ” public option ca n’t be found in the bill .
Neither can the word “ doctor ” – save for a few references to degrees .
No “ cost curve ” is bent .
No “ blue pill ” is dispensed .
“ Death ” and “ taxes ” are both in there , but “ death panel ” is not .
The text defines dozens of words and phrases , including “ family ” ( “ an individual and . . . the individual ’s dependents ” ) , “ health insurance coverage , ” “ exchange - eligible individual ” and “ Indian . ”
And for those who cry “ read the bill , ” beware .
There are plenty of paragraphs like this one :
“ ( a ) Outpatient Hospitals – ( 1 ) In General – Section 1833 ( t ) ( 3 ) ( C ) ( iv ) of the Social Security Act ( 42 U.S.C. 1395(t ) ( 3 ) ( C ) ( iv ) ) is amended – ( A ) in the first sentence – ( i ) by inserting “ ( which is subject to the productivity adjustment described in subclause ( II ) of such section ) ” after “ 1886 ( b ) ( 3 ) ( B ) ( iii ) ; and ( ii ) by inserting “ ( but not below 0 ) ” after “ reduced ” ; and ( B ) in the second sentence , by inserting “ and which is subject , beginning with 2010 to the productivity adjustment described in section 1886 ( b ) ( 3 ) ( B ) ( iii ) ( II ) ” .
The section deals with “ incorporating productivity improvements into market basket updates that do not already incorporate such improvements , ” if that helps .
Optimistic lawmakers say it could take a week just to get through the bill ’s text .
“ I ’ll have to call an emergency meeting of my staff and drop the customary procedure of me reading and my staff not reading , ” joked House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) , who famously told filmmaker Michael Moore that lawmakers “ do n’t read most of the bills . ”
“ It ’s one thing to read it , ” said Rep. Lee Terry ( R - Neb . ) , a lawyer who voted against the first version of the bill on its way through the Energy and Commerce Committee .
“ It ’s another thing to understand it when it ’s written in legalese . ”
When given the bill ’s dimensions , Rep. Anthony Weiner ( D - N.Y. ) noted that some members are faster readers than others .
“ That ’s one afternoon for Barney Frank , ” he said .
Republicans aide said a print - out of the bill weighs more than 19 pounds and stands nearly nine inches tall .
North Carolina Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry , 34 years old and a few inches taller than 5 feet , said the bill could act as a ” booster seat . ”
Democrats say the essence of the bill is n’t much different from the three sister bills they moved through committees this summer , which came in around 1,000 pages .
If you read those , they say , you pretty much know what ’s in this one .
“ It ’s almost a complete certainty that we have already discussed and debated almost every element that ’s in this bill , ” said Rep. Steve Rothman ( D - N.J . )
McHenry took issue with the notion that the 2,000 - page bill has n’t changed much from the earlier , 1,000 - page versions .
To prove the point , he pulled out a Democratic - written summary of the changes .
All eight pages of them .
Asked why the House will vote on the roughly 400,000 - word bill in a week when it takes a congregation a year to read the 80,000 - word Torah at a synagogue , Rothman , who is Jewish , exhibited the wisdom of a Talmudic scholar .
“ It only takes a year because you read one section a week , ” he said .
But Republican Rep. Joe Barton , who is Texan , said the bill is “ about four reams of paper ” that add up to the American public “ getting reamed . ”
Mr Kennedy and Mr Obama both brought young children to the White House
The US White House has released a photograph of President Barack Obama 's daughter Sasha sneaking up on her father as he works in the Oval Office .
The image has drawn comparisons with the famous 1963 image of John F Kennedy Jnr playing underneath the Oval Office desk as his father reads documents .
That picture helped create the image of " Camelot " associated with the Kennedys .
Mr Obama has said being able to work and live at home is " one of the huge benefits of being president " .
The photograph , taken in early August and released through the official White House Flickr website , shows eight - year - old Sasha Obama sneaking up on her father from behind a sofa as he reads at the desk .
She and her older sister , Malia , are the youngest children to live in the White House since the 1960s , but Mr Obama and his wife Michelle have always said they want their daughters to have as normal a life as possible .
In an interview with the BBC in June , Mr Obama said his family life works well in the White House and his family were his favourite way to unwind .
" One of the huge benefits of being president is I now have this nice office and I go upstairs and have dinner with my family just about every night , " he said .
" We 've got a very good deal . "

A controversial Kiwi mayor is being accused of bullying a group of primary school children after he sent them a letter urging them to sack their teacher .
The seven Maori children , aged between 11 and 13 , had written to the mayor , Michael Laws , to express annoyance that he refused to make a spelling change to the name of the North Island town , Wanganui .
Many are campaigning to have it respelt " Whanganui " , which they argue is the original Maori spelling .
But Mr Laws , a fierce critic of the name change , told them he would take their views seriously " when your class starts addressing the real issues affecting Maoridom , particularly the appalling rate of child abuse and child murder within Maori society , then I will take the rest of your views seriously " .
He told them : " There are so many deficiencies of both fact and logic in your letters that I barely know where to start " .
He added : " Perhaps sacking your teacher for allowing such misapprehension to flourish ? "
In handwriting at the bottom of his letter , Mr Laws wrote : " PS Controlling your anger might be a start ! "
The school principal , Chris Derbidge , says he decided to share the letter with the children .
" We are like a normal , mainstream New Zealand school , but we do have a Maori emersion unit .
In those children 's classrooms , all the curriculum delivery is in Maori .
So they have been learning .
So the task that their teacher had set them was to learn about letter writing , " he said .
" The children had decided because the ' h ' in ' Wananui ' was a topical thing and a somewhat controversial thing in New Zealand at the time , so the children wrote their feelings on the matter . "
Mr Derbidge says what Mr Laws wrote back was totally inappropriate .
" Most disturbing to me and to our parents and to our school community is the one that I 'll read to you ... ' when your class starts addressing the real issues affecting Maoridom , particularly the appalling rate of child abuse and child murder within Maori society , then I will take the review serious ' , " he said .
" That is the point that we object to most strongly .
They are not issues that 11 and 12 - year - old children should be dealing with , or even considering . "
No apology
The issue has blown up on the front pages of New Zealand newspapers , with the children saying they were upset by the response , and parents branding Mr Laws a " bully " .
But the mayor , who is also a radio host and who has previously stirred up contempt by calling the late Tongan King a " bloated brown slug " - said he was " shocked " there was so much interest in his response .
He said his reply had been " facetious " but he had been genuinely shocked by the anger in the letters he 'd received .
" I think it 's wrong for kids to be angry about something inanimate , do n't you ? " he said on air .
Mr Laws said he thought the pupils were " put up to it " by their teacher .
" Do you honestly think that children give a continental about how Wanganui is spelt ? "
" Children this age care about Harry Potter . "
Mr Laws has not apologised , but he has invited the children to afternoon tea .
The students are not sure yet if they will accept .

Millions of Americans have lost homes , jobs and savings to the financial crisis and recession .
While greed and extravagance played roles , many lived beyond their means because their paychecks shrank .
This article is adapted from “ Past Due : The End of Easy Money and the Renewal of the American Economy , ” by Peter S. Goodman , a reporter for The New York Times .
The book , to be published Tuesday by Times Books , explores the origins of the crisis and suggests ways to reinvigorate the economy .
ONE afternoon in November 2006 , a policeman spotted an expired license plate on Dorothy Thomas ’s 10 - year - old Toyota Corolla as she drove through San Jose , Calif .
He ordered her to pull over .
Struggling under the weight of thousands of dollars in credit card bills , Ms. Thomas was perpetually short of cash .
She had not bought a $ 10 auto registration sticker .
The officer checked his database and recognized that she had already been ticketed once before for the same thing .
He arranged to have her car towed away .
“ I got down on my knees and begged that officer , ” Ms. Thomas recalled .
As she watched her car being hauled off , she sensed that this was the beginning of a descent into a crisis from which she might not easily escape .
Without money to pay the towing and storage fees , she could not extract her car from the lot , and the tab soon grew to $ 1,600 .
Without a car , she could not reach the hospital where she worked in the administrative offices , so she lost her $ 16 - an - hour job .
Without a paycheck , she could no longer pay the rent on her modest home .
She moved to Oakland , where a friend lived in a beaten - down , rented house on a street they called Crack Avenue .
By year ’s end , Ms. Thomas , then 49 , was occupying a bunk at a homeless shelter , searching in vain for a job in an economy plagued by unemployment .
The Atlanta Police Department has released nine complaints alleging excessive force and discriminatory comments in a raid last week on the Eagle , a gay leather bar in Atlanta .
A sampling of the complaints from the Southern Voice below :
One man said officers grabbed patrons who did n’t immediately lie down by the neck and forced them to the ground .
The man said he was kicked in the ribs while lying down .
“ Then I heard laughing and giggling and saying this is more fun than raiding niggers with crack .
They also told us to shut the fuck up unless we were spoken too [ sic ] . ”
The man said he heard one person told that if he spoke again he would be hit by a chair .
He also reported that one officer “ said to everyone in general that all you all do is flash your asses and show your cocks . ”
An Eagle employee said he did not know what he was charged with until he got to jail .
“ A lot of officers were laughing and high - fiving each other , and I heard one officer say I thought this was a sex club . ”
Another patron described listening to officers chat about their cell phone plans as he lay on the ground .
“ I was forced down by physical force .
They grabbed my neck and pushed me down .
They put their boot on my back and told me to stay down .
…
If anyone asked anything they were told to ‘ shut the fuck up . ' ”
Another patron said he saw officers forcing people to the ground by officers pushing their shoulders or the backs of their heads .
He said he asked to move because there was broken glass on the floor where he was lying , and he was told to “ shut the fuck up . ”
The customer recounted hearing anti-gay slurs : “ I heard several slurs such as ‘ I hate homosexuals . ’
I also heard ‘ I do n’t like fags . ’
One officer asked me if I was married and had any children , and he told me I should be ashamed for being there . ”
The customer recounted having his diabetes medication , which was in an unmarked container , taken and not returned .
He recounted hearing another customer told that if he did n’t be quiet , an officer would hit him over the head with one of the barstools .
“ There were several officers standing over me that started joking about this is a lot of fun , we ought to come back and do this every week . ”
The customer said he heard an officer say pictures of men on the walls made him sick , and make comments about people ’s appearance , including calling him “ big boy . ”
He also said officers were watching the football game on TV during the raid .
A customer said he at first thought the bar was being robbed because the first police officer to yell “ get the fuck on the floor ” was dressed in civilian clothes and did not display a badge .
An employee who was arrested said that after the customers were allowed to leave , “ the officers started high fiving and jumping up in the air bumping into each other like they were at a football game . ”
An employee who lives in an apartment over the Eagle , who said he was not working that night , said someone started pounding on his door .
He opened the door to two cops who asked if anyone was having sex there .
They asked why there was a bed and he said it was because he lives there .
He was made to come downstairs and was arrested with the other employees .
He recalled hearing comments like “ You people are despicable . ”

FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
Depending on who you ask - the protests against health care reform may or may not be the real thing .
Democrats and the White House claim these sometimes rowdy protests that have disrupted meetings and health care events around the country are mostly orchestrated by insurers , lobbyists and Republican activists .
They 're accusing the GOP of organizing " angry mobs " and trying to destroy President Obama .
Nancy Pelosi even claims protesters are " carrying swastikas and symbols like that " to these meetings .
But Republicans insists these protests are just a sign of real opposition and frustration about the president 's health care plan ... they say the protests are part of a ground - level movement .
Republican Party Chairman Michael Steele says " We 're not inciting anyone to go out and disrupt anything . "
Steele calls the Democrats ' claims " a bunch of baloney " and says there 's no upside for the Republican Party in the protests .
Meanwhile - a new CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll shows the nation is pretty evenly divided over the president 's health care plan - with 50 - percent supporting it and 45 - percent opposed .
The poll also shows that more than half of Americans have strong feelings about this debate ... with one - third saying they strongly oppose Mr. Obama 's plans and 23 - percent saying they strongly favor them .
The poll also suggests that those against the president 's plan may be more motivated to attend town hall meetings than those who support it .
Here ’s my question to you :
Are the protests against health care reform grass roots democracy or orchestrated opposition ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Billy from Las Vegas writes :
Michael Steele is full of baloney .
These protests are no more " grass roots " than the so - called " tea parties " were .
This is a well - financed , corporate - run campaign to disrupt any serious discussion of health care reform so the likes of United Healthcare , Blue Cross and the other " health care denial " companies can protect their business .
Charles writes :
The protesters at the town halls are real .
I am sure a few are there to cause trouble , but a majority are furious about this obscene plan to socialize health care .
Yesterday it came out that the plan would cover abortion on demand , making groups like Planned Parenthood rich and yet cutting service to seniors .
Anyone looking at the plan should be outraged .
Arthur writes :
If this health care package is so great , why are n’t elected officials leading the way , joining the public plan and dumping their private plans ?
This is a grass roots movement because these elitists are giving us a horrible plan , one they are avoiding for themselves .
Mob , indeed .
That is insulting to the people taking part in their government and adding their opinion .
Is n't their health coverage paid for on our dime ?
Charles from Lawrence , New Jersey writes :
These protests are political theater .
The insurance industry has everything to lose with government run health care and will stop at nothing to prevent it .
The GOP pursues politics and policy with the same " professionalism " because they are business cronies .
Profiting from wants is the American way but profiting from needs is predatory dystopia run by corporate overlords .
Alexander from Lee 's Summit , Missouri writes :
It does n't matter if the protests are orchestrated or not , because either way they are legitimate .
America was built on protests that were organized so I have no problem with the protests ; the problem I do have is with the misbehavior of these protesters at the town hall meetings .
Town halls are meant to share ideas , not to yell at those presenting them .

Call the font police !
Or , bureau !
The Font Bureau , Inc. , a Boston - based typographic firm that counts Apple , Microsoft , Newsweek , the Chicago Tribune and Wall Street Journal among its clients , filed suit against NBC this week , alleging the network did not secure the rights to the typefaces it used to promote “ The Jay Leno Show , ” “ Late Night with Jimmy Fallon ” and “ Saturday Night Live . ”
According to the 118 - page complaint , filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court , the Font Bureau says that NBC infringed on its trademarked and copyrighted fonts on NBC.com and CNBC.com .
It is seeking “ no less than $ 2 million ” in damages .
The Font Bureau says NBC and CNBC used its Bureau Grotesque , Interstate and Antenna fonts without permission .
( IAntenna is the one used by the new “ Jay Leno Show . ” )
The lawsuit alleges that NBC “ purchased a single license to use a limited number ” of software sold by the Font Bureau , made “ numerous infringing copies ” and far exceeded the uses permitted by that license .
CNBC , the suit claims , used an “ entirely unauthorized ” copy .
The infringement has caused “ confusion , mistake and deception ” in the marketplace , a “ dilution ” of the Bureau ’s trademarks and substantial lost revenue , according to the suit .
I e-mailed NBC for their side of the story .
They have no comment .
Google is in the process of scanning millions of books
The proposed settlement between Google and US publishers must be resisted , argues Bill Thompson Google is in the middle of a massive project to scan and digitise every book it can get its hands on , whether old or new , and if it gets its way then the US courts will soon endorse an agreement between the search engine giant and the US book industry that will allow it to do this without fear of prosecution for copyright infringement .
Authors and publishers will get some money in return , and we will all benefit from the improved access to digitised books that Google will provide .
The deal sounds like a good one , but not everyone is happy with it .
The Department of Justice in the US has begun an investigation to see if it is anti-competitive , and last month a number of library associations got together with Amazon , Yahoo ! and Microsoft to form the Open Book Alliance which argues that it should not go forward .
The details of the settlement are complex , and it is almost impossible to be sure what would emerge from it because many of the provisions involve setting up things like a Book Rights Registry , and we do n't yet know what they will look like .
World 's librarian
But whatever the detail there remains a fundamental problem .
It is not that the settlement will give Google indemnity from prosecution should it be found to have scanned books that are in copyright without the copyright owner 's permission , nor even that it gives Google freedom to exploit scanned content commercially .
It is , rather , that the settlement gives only Google these privileges , and places one company in a prime position to become the world 's de facto librarian instead of encouraging open access , open standards and a plurality of services and service providers .
Neither Google nor any other company should be entrusted with that responsibility , and nothing in the detail of the agreement or the funds that will be made available to authors as a consequence can change this .
If Google is given a monopoly , either explicitly in the settlement or implicitly because any other scanning project would be forced to negotiate its own multi-million dollar agreement , then the deal must be rejected .
If we let Google have its settlement we will all be the poorer
Bill Thompson
The proposed settlement came about after Google began a project to scan and index millions of books , including many that are still in copyright .
It was sued by groups representing authors and publishers who felt that scanning books , even if the text was only used to create a searchable index which then pointed readers to the relevant text , was an unlicensed use and therefore illegal .
The book trade was also worried that Google might scan the books under the pretext of creating an index and then start offering them online or even selling them , even though it was always absolutely clear that such behaviour would be a breach of copyright .
Instead of fighting the case through the US courts and winning a great victory for those of us who believe that three hundred year - old notions of copyright should not be used arbitrarily to limit new ways of making use of creative works , Google announced in October 2008 that it had reached a settlement with the US Authors ' Guild and the Association of American Publishers that would allow it to continue scanning with permission .
At the moment the settlement hangs in the balance , waiting for what is quaintly termed a ' fairness hearing ' in US District Court on October 7 .
At this hearing of the questions raised since the settlement was announced will be debated , including the question of how the relatively small Authors Guild came to speak for all published writers in the US , living and dead , in negotiating with Google .
One of the arguments being made in favour of Google , most clearly by US industry analyst Jeffrey Lindsay , is that Google deserves to benefit from having taken the risk of digitising books when the project 's legal status was uncertain and that Google , unlike Microsoft and Yahoo ! , has invested millions of dollars in the project and is committed to pushing forward .
Microsoft did indeed abandon its own book scanning project , Live Search Books , in 2008 , largely on cost grounds but also because the legal uncertainties clearly exposed the company to potential liability in what was never a core area of its activity .
Tribal lands But Lindsay 's view seems hard to accept .
Pretending that the world 's libraries are some unexplored continent to be opened up and claimed by the adventurers from Mountain View may appeal to the frontier mentality of US commentators , but it is not a metaphor likely to have much appeal elsewhere .
For one thing the bookshelves of the worlds are already inhabited , just like the territory of the United States , and those of us who remember the fate of the Native Americans may not be happy to see Google build its railroad tracks over our tribal lands .
Even without the dodgy analogy , the project of digitising the information held in the world 's printed books is too important to be dealt with purely as a commercial venture between rights holders and a potential supplier of services .
We are at an inflection point in world history , and the transition we are making from analogue to digital is happening so quickly and offers so many delights that there is a temptation to let the past moulder in archive boxes and concentrate solely on the new and digital .
For those who take that view then letting Google pay to digitise books is an uncontroversial decision , one that can deliver more digital stuff to search through without apparently costing anything .
George Santayana wrote ' those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it ' , but it may also be true that those who do not care to digitise their own past will end up paying a high price to regain what they give up so thoughtlessly .
If we let Google have its settlement we will all be the poorer .
Not for a while , perhaps , but one day we will need more from this new library of Alexandria than Google is willing to offer , and find that the price it demands is more than we can pay .

Yes , a baby is denied coverage because his pre-existing condition is being , well fat .
The insurance company changed its mind once this story hit the media , but this is another one to throw in the WTF bin , when it comes to health care reform .
From The Ed Schultz Show .
In Coders at Work , Peter Norvig quotes NASA administrator Don Goldin saying
We ’ve got to do the better , faster , cheaper .
These space missions cost too much .
It ’d be better to run more missions and some of them would fail but overall we ’d still get more done for the same amount of money .
NASA has extremely rigorous processes for writing software .
They supposedly develop bug - free code ; I doubt that ’s true , thought I ’m sure they do have exceptionally low bug rates .
But this quality comes at a high price .
Rumor has it that space shuttle software costs $ 1,500 per line to develop .
When asked about the price tag , Norvig said “ I do n’t know if it ’s optimal .
I think they might be better off with buggy software . ”
At some point it ’s certainly not optimal .
If it doubles the price of a project to increase your probability of a successful mission from 98 % to 99 % , it ’s not worth it ; you ’re better off running two missions with a 98 % chance of success each .
Few people understand that software quality is all about probabilities of errors .
Most people think the question is whether you ’d rather have bug - free software or buggy software .
I ’d rather have bug - free software , thank you .
But bug - free is not an option .
Nothing humans do is perfect .
All we can do is lower the probabilities of bugs .
But as the probability of bugs goes to zero , the development costs go to infinity .
( Actually it ’s not all about probabilities of errors .
It ’s also about the consequences of errors .
Sending back a photo with a few incorrect pixels is not the same as crashing a probe . )
Norvig ’s comment makes sense regarding unmanned missions .
But what about manned missions ?
Since one of the possible consequences of error is loss of life , the stakes are obviously higher .
But does demanding flawless software increase the probability of a safe mission ?
One of the consequences of demanding extremely high quality software is that some tasks are too expensive to automate and so humans have to be trained to do those tasks .
But astronauts make mistakes just as programmers do .
If software has a smaller probability of error than an astronaut would have for a given task , it would be safer to rely on the software .

Top Chef Season 6 B " Meat Natalie " Episode 10
Advertisement
“ Is competency enough tomorrow ? ”
This from Robin , speculating after her failed Quickfire whether she will simply survive another week — not on trying something ambitious and perhaps failing , but on serving up another steaming plate of mediocrity and hoping that someone does worse .
I ’m sure there are many aspects of Robin ’s personality the other chefs ( and viewers ) do n’t like — she ’s grating , a blabbermouth , all - too - willing to play her cancer survival card when necessary , et al — but I would guess that sentiments like the one above are what irk them the most .
I think I ’ve been in the majority in thinking Robin has stayed for much longer than her talent merits , but tonight deepened my resentment considerably .
What ’s the point of being in a cooking competition if you ’re merely interesting in surviving for another week rather than winning ?
Food is a wondrous , sensuous thing , and she just does n’t seem to give a shit about that .
It ’s lazy and , in its own way , as arrogant as anything the two Michaels might say .
Advertisement
Contrast Robin with Jennifer , who continued her rapidly deteriorating performance in both challenges tonight .
The difference ?
Jen is the more gifted and accomplished of the two , and proved as much throughout most of the competition .
But the other important difference is that she cares .
A lot .
And her caring actually feeds into why she ’s failing , because the intensity that once brought confidence and life to everything she did in the kitchen has suddenly turned against her .
She ’s tired , she ’s second - guessing herself , and she ’s cloaked in such heavy veil of defeatism that she could hardly sauce the dish that so embarrassed her in the Elimination Challenge .
Robin is incapable of that kind of failure ; the closet thing she comes to a failure of ambition is putting a bunch of components on a plate and hoping against hope that they mesh somehow .
Jennifer can still come back , provided she can steel herself and perhaps take a Quickfire or something to get a little swagger back .
Fingers crossed .
Tonight ’s Quickfire was another in a recent rash of sponsored challenges , this one involving TV Guide , reinterpreted TV dinners , and a random selection of “ classic ” show .
( I put “ classic ” in quotation marks because I refuse to use the word in association with anything Hanna Barbera created .
Also : Gilligan ’s Island and M * A * S * H suck , too . )
The chefs drew knives , and it was just unfair that Kevin , who ’s emerged as the runaway favorite to win the whole thing , drew The Sopranos , a show about an Italian family that eats extremely well .
( Sidenote : People largely dismissed the first post - wedding Office episode this season as too silly , but Michael insisting on ordering “ gabagool ” in front of a client with suspected mob ties was pretty hilarious . )
His braised meatballs with polenta sounded like heaven on a plate , and smartly suggested a hearty , family - style meal rather than simply an Italian one .
Other than Mike Isabella never having seen Seinfeld ( to quote Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction : “ You are aware that there ’s an invention called television , and on that invention they show shows ? ” ) , and Robin destroying a perfectly good burger by hollowing it out , sticking an egg inside , and cooking the juice out of it , there was n’t much of interest to the challenge .
( Contrast to last week ’s tag - team , blindfolded assembly - line dish , which I thought was one of the best the show has ever conceived . )
And how sad would it be for Kevin ’s dish to get packaged as frozen food ?
How well could polenta possibly thaw and reheat ?

The Elimination challenge was a classic bait - and - switch , though crueler than usual .
After the chefs spend all night fantasizing about the high - quality meats in Tom ’s Craftsteak , and then get so far as to tour this omnivore ’s wonderland for the perfect cuts , out comes the rug .
In walks the impossibly tiny Natalie Portman and the chefs hear the deflating news about why she remains impossibly tiny :
She ’s a vegetarian .
If you watched Top Chef Masters back in the summer , when an emaciated Zooey Deschanel required gluten - free vegan food , it was déjà vu all over again .
In fact , though Portman used the word “ vegetarian , ” presumably there were restrictions on dairy and gluten as well , because none of that showed up on any of the plates , either .
The chefs had to make an entrée out of fresh vegetables , basically , which required resourcefulness and an ability to improvise on the fly , but to my mind did n’t yield many appetizing dishes .
Naturally , every chef is deflated over the twist except Robin , who gets excited over fresh garbanzo beans .
Not that it mattered :
The beans did n’t make it on every plate , and what survived was another pointless , incoherent experiment covered in salt .
Lucky for her , Mike Isabella sucked worse , screwing up the main “ protein ” in his dish — leaks that were raw from being cooked too fast — and trying to cover it up with some fancy plating .
Jen lost out on the large eggplants and proceeded to soldier on with tiny eggplants , leading to a gloried amuse bouche being passed off as a main course .
On the plus side , she certainly picked the right week to bottom out .
Even the winner , Kevin ’s robust duo of mushrooms and smoked kale , did n’t seem to bowl anyone over .
As food porn goes , this was the lowpoint of the season .

• Thanks to Todd for subbing last week after I was unexpectedly whisked out of town .
Much as I hate to not chime in on the seasonal “ Restaurant Wars ” challenge , he did so ably — nay , heroically .

• Other developing storyline : The dickishness of Michael Voltaggio .
Given Kevin ’s likeability and the plain truth that he ’s been kicking everyone ’s ass week after week after week — and among maybe the strongest group of quality chefs the show has had to date — it was out of line for Michael badmouth Kevin ’s winning Elimination dish because his was more ambitious ( and flawed ) .
And deriding his brother for the “ greasy ” food that did n’t make the plate was n’t good form , either .
• Thoughts on Top Chef : Just Desserts ?
I think Bravo runs too great a risk of stretching one of its flagship brands thin by piling this spinoff on top of another Top Chef Masters season .
There ’s also the risk of going up against the bajillion dessert shows that are on the air right now .
On the other hand , the chefs will have no excuse for coming into the competition without any dessert recipes in mind .

He must therefore go home with Robin next week after a dramatic double elimination .
A Better — and Cooler — Version of “ Cash for Clunkers ”
During the Senate ’s debate over giving $ 2 billion more to the " cash for clunkers " car rebate program , John McCain ( R - AZ ) quipped that " cash for refrigerators " might be next in line .
Does McCain know that it ’s already happening — with a much bigger environmental boost than the auto version ?
In Michigan , the Detroit Free Press reports today that refrigerator recycling programs have taken more than 1,000 power - swigging models off residents ’ hands in less than two months , distributing a $ 50 rebate for each trade - in .
Similar refrigerator - rebate programs are also succeeding in New Jersey , Vermont , and Massachusetts .
Here ’s where the superiority to " cash for clunkers " comes in :
The car rebates , which run as high as $ 4,500 per purchase , ultimately cost taxpayers around $ 160 per ton of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere , assuming that current patterns of fuel - efficiency improvement hold .
But " cash for refrigerators " programs typically offer between $ 25 and $ 50 for the removal of old fridges that emit chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) , the chemicals behind the growing ozone hole that were eliminated from home appliances in the 1990s .
Ridding a home of a CFC - spewing fridge removes about five tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , recycler Sam Sirkin told the New York Times last week .
That works out to a cost of $ 10 per ton for the richest refrigerator rebate program — more than 10 times cheaper than " cash for clunkers . "
Kabul
For the crowd gathered for a second day of festivities at one of the Afghan capital 's garish wedding halls this afternoon there was widespread cynicism at the news of Barack Obama 's Nobel peace prize .
" I do n't know how he can get this prize , " said Najeeb , a 30 - year - old shopkeeper attending a friend 's wedding party .
" Maybe it 's been awarded for all the houses they are bombing , or perhaps it 's for all his soldiers that are dying in Afghanistan and Iraq . "
Next to him a local staff member of a western NGO called Elyas wondered whether Obama will ever be able to bring peace to Afghanistan .
" Obama and his favourite president [ Karzai ] have n't been able to do anything here .
We used to be able to drive to Kunduz and Mazar - i- Sharif [ two northern cities considered safe until recently ] but now we can't because fighters are coming to the roads and looting people . "
But a tribal elder from western Kabul called Shafi said Obama should be given a chance as he reviews his Afghanistan strategy .
" If someone spent 20 years doing nothing for peace he should n't get the Nobel prize ‑ but if he does good things for peace even if it is just for three or four months then I am happy .
He should send more troops to Afghanistan .
If we do n't have support of the world community we wo n't have one hour of peace , again it will be the fighting , civil war and misfortune . "
Jon Boone
Jerusalem
Israelis and Palestinians alike said they were surprised by the news of Obama 's win .
Palestinians , in particular , spoke of their disappointment that Obama had not taken concrete steps towards ending the Israeli occupation or creating an independent Palestinian state .
" I think he does n't deserve the prize because he has n't done anything , " said Mohaned Munir , 20 .
Born in Jerusalem , he was studying computing at Bethlehem University .
" We want him to be more serious in his steps towards the Palestinians if he is going to make real peace here . "
Eyad Bannoura , 50 , a Christian Palestinian decorator from Bethlehem , agreed .
" He does n't deserve it .
He 's not with us .
He says he supports us , but nothing has changed .
We just want peace , to live here in two states , one for us , one for the Jews .
But Obama is like all the leaders in the past : they all say the same thing and nothing happens . "
Bannoura , who was walking through a park in west Jerusalem , is one of the few Palestinians lucky enough to have a work permit to enter Israel .
Dina Heller , a British - born Israeli , said she was still hoping Obama would bring change .
" I think maybe this is a way to try and influence him to change things a bit , but until now things have n't really changed , " she said .
" As for peace here , I hope for it but I do n't see it in the near future .
People have tried and tried for many years and it always seems to be a quagmire . "
However , Netanel Yackobi , 31 , felt Obama 's administration had been unfairly pressuring Israel , particularly over settlements .
" I think we should do what is good for us , not what he tells us to do , " he said .
" This is our home and we do n't need to leave our home .
If somebody wants to live here , like the Arabs , they can live here .
But if they want a country of their own they can go to Iraq or Jordan ‑ there 's lots of space there . "
Yackobi said he was worried the prize might give Obama more confidence in his Middle East diplomacy and that might mean more pressure on Israel .
" It gives him more power , " he said .
" If he gets the prize just for what he said he wants , it is like telling him he 's right and he should go ahead and do it . "
Rory McCarthy
Baghdad
Iraqis reacted warmly to President Obama 's award , although some said he had yet to deliver any tangible results .
Harith Ismail , a 39 - year - old businessman from central Baghdad , said : " Since he became president , he has made serious efforts to bring peace to the world .
He has used dialogue , he has dealt with Iran in constructive ways and he has differentiated himself from Bush .
I believe he wants the Middle East to be safe and free . "
Obama won particular praise for sticking to George Bush 's pledge to withdraw US troops from Iraqi cities by 30 June .
Ali Kadier , 20 , an engineering student at Baghdad University , said : " By withdrawing the troops he won the trust of the Iraqi people and other Muslim countries .
We feel that his presidency is a time of peace .
Look at the way he is dealing with Muslims and Arab countries .
His last speech in Cairo was full of respect to the Muslim world .
He has a respectable style and he deserves the Nobel prize . "
Sweetmaker Aziz Ahmed , 45 , from the inner-city suburb of Karrada , however , remained sceptical : " I have only heard his speech [ in Cairo ] .
I have seen nothing apart from that , just promises .
I do n't think it 's enough , yet .
But if he completes the withdrawal of the Americans and we completely get rid of their presence in the Middle East , then all Iraqis will thank Obama and trust America again .
Then he will deserve not only the Nobel prize , but every other peace accolade the world has to offer .
If he really wants to work for peace , tell him to continue working for it in Iraq . "
Qais Munther , a 33 - year - old doctor from the Baghdad suburb of Mansour , said Obama 's short time as leadership had caused him to reassess his antipathy towards America .
" Obama has changed my view of US presidents .
It is the first time a suitable man in a suitable place seriously deserved the Nobel award .
I 'm expecting him to fulfill his promises and that will change the views that the Muslim world now holds about America . "

Following up on today 's earlier post about alcohol and brain injuries , we bring you a study on alcohol and risk taking behavior .
It seems obvious that drinking alcohol would lead to immediate risk taking , but does drinking as a teenager lead to risk taking behavior as an adult ?
Some researchers have suspected as much , but they have n't been able to rule out the possibility that risk - prone people simply start drinking at an earlier age .
So a research group chose an obvious course of action to test the idea — they got a bunch of rats drunk and let them gamble .
The researchers tested two groups of genetically identical rats , one group that was fed a normal diet and another that boozed it up .
To get the rats drunk , the researchers borrowed the tried - and - true approach of frat boys everywhere — they fed them Jell - O shots .
The rats went on a 20 day bender and were tested for risky behavior 3 weeks later , when they were adults , using a gambling task .
The animals learned that pressing one lever produced small but certain rewards in the form of small sugar pellets and an adjacent lever yielded bigger rewards — more pellets —
but paid off less frequently .
The researchers rigged the game so that in some testing sessions choosing the certain reward was the best overall strategy , while in other sessions the " risky " lever yielded the greatest overall payoff [ ScienceNOW Daily News ] .
The abstemious rats who had never consumed alcohol learned to game the levers depending on the payout rate to consistently get a consistent reward .
However , the rats that essentially got drunk during adolescence were much more likely to push the lever that dispensed an uncertain number of treats —
a risky choice [ WebMD ] .
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , supports the idea that drinking alcohol at an early age leads to risk taking behavior later in life .
They suggest that alcohol could somehow rewires the brain to choose risky behaviors in the future .
However , researchers note that people and rats and quite different — even if some readers disagree — so if / how this study applies to humans remains to be seen .

Moin A. Yahya , Associate Professor of Law at U. Alberta has posted a couple of interesting videos on why criminal suspects should never talk to the police .
Most experienced defence lawyers will tell you that the first words out of their mouth when they get the 3 AM phone call from the jail are : “ do n’t say anything ! ”
But for some reason , criminally accused often do n’t seem to get it .
The videos feature a professor of law ( formerly a defence lawyer ) as well as a police officer explaining why suspects would do well to heed the advice and exercise their right to remain silent .
Though the videos are reflective of American law , the principles are largely applicable here in Canada .
Though we do not have a 5th Amendment , Canadians have long had a right to silence which is now constitutionally entrenched in s. 7 of the Charter ( see R. v. Singh , 2007 SCC 48 for a discussion ) .
And now , without further ado , here is why you ought not to speak to the police :
If you have limited time , I ’d suggest skipping forward to 8:20 , where the professor discusses the “ top 10 reasons why you should never speak to the police . ”

Mercedes also has the Viano , which is more frequently used for limo services .
Very passenger friendly and far less gangly and awkward than the Sprinter .
But since the Sprinter is already here , the decision makes sense .
Students at the University of Kansas have built what may be the coolest hybrid ever – a 1974 Volkswagen Super Beetle–series hybrid that burns biodiesel and gets about 50 mpg .
The Super Beetle had been rusting away on a used car lot until it was donated to a mechanical engineering class led by professor Chris Depcik .
He turned it over to a group of environmentally conscious engineering students who call themselves the EcoHawks .
Over the course of a year , they installed a series of 10 lead - acid batteries and a biodiesel generator .
It is n't very fast – even by Beetle standards – but it runs .
" We have driven it around and reached approximately 30 mph , but this was more of a proof - of - concept drive without pushing the boundaries , " Depcik told Autopia .
" We are currently getting the vehicle into road - ready shape to be driven safely in order to determine these values . "
Depcik estimates that it will be ready to pass a Kansas state inspection " with flying colors " by May 2010 .
Yeah , but why a Beetle , of all things ?
Depcik says it was a natural , given the ready availability of parts .
It 's not as if there are n't a lot of Beetles out there , given that VW built 21.5 million of them before production finally ended in 2003 .
They also liked the idea of making an old car cleaner and more efficient .
And then there 's the fact the team saw the Beetle as a pop-culture icon that could draw attention to the project .
That ploy worked – we * love * this thing .
It 's like a really cool Chevrolet Volt but without the plug - in capability .
Depcik figures the project cost about $ 25,000 and most likely would n't turn a profit if replicated on a larger scale .
Still , he has hope for vehicle recycling and conversion as an alternative to electric cars built from scratch .
The EcoHawks say rebuilding and repurposing the old Bug prevented the release of anywhere from 3 to 12 tons of carbon dioxide .
" If the vehicles were in good shape requiring no body or vehicle work , and a ' kit ' involving a battery pack , battery charger , generator and electric motor could be created , it may be possible , " he said .
" I would love to see it happen .
The main items are determining how to put all of the components in the vehicle while also figuring out how and where to connect the electric motor . "
The Beetle 's new drivetrain features 10 lead - acid batteries – chosen because they 're cheap – that provide juice to an electric motor .
A small diesel generator , which runs on 100 percent biodiesel made from cooking oil collected from the campus kitchen , keeps the batteries going .
Wired.com wanted more specs on the system , but Depcik kept mum .
Although the Beetle 's top speed is estimated at 45 mph , the students are working on Hybrid Beetle 2.0 .
Once the car passes inspection , Depcik and the EcoHawks plan to tear it apart again and make it a plug - in hybrid .
Looking further ahead , they 'd like to configure the electric drivetrain to work with generators powered by ethanol and propane , and possibly upgrade the batteries .
Such mods will almost certainly reduce the car 's 3,640 - pound curb weight ( the original weighed about a ton ) , so the fuel economy and top speed should increase accordingly .
But first , it has to pass inspection .
" I really want them to drive it around town in order to demonstrate what KU engineers can accomplish , " Depcik said .
" We will cross that hurdle after the car passes inspection .
Insurance is expensive for university vehicles , so that may be the limiting factor , unless a sponsor or insurance company helps us out .
The key concept here is that there is really nothing different than a real car on the road now . "

The motorcycle industry often plays catch - up when it comes to technology .
Fuel - injection , anti-lock brakes and even air bags have crept slowly into the motorcycle marketplace years after the auto industry offered them as standard equipment .
But now it could get ahead of the curve with an aftermarket night - vision system .
A handful of luxury brands offer such technology on their top models , but Darren Haley wants to bring it to motorcyclists .
Haley , 34 , is an avid rider and manager of OEM and aftermarket automotive product lines at Flir , a leader in thermal imaging technology .
As such , he had no shortage of resources or expertise to make it happen .
“ I did it because I could and wanted to see what the response would be , ” he said .
Our first reaction to a motorcycle night - vision system was to think it would be a distraction .
Haley insists it is n't .
The infrared camera is mounted in what once was a driving light , and the image is displayed on Haley 's GPS unit ( more on that in a sec ) .
Obviously you do n't want to be staring at it constantly , but use it judiciously and you 'll be fine .
“ I use it like I would a rear - view or side - view mirror , ” Haley said .
Haley has n't come across any deer , but he and his buddies had some close calls during a ride from California to Colorado .
That ’s when they wished they had night vision on board .
Although the system was designed to help riders see pedestrians and animals , it has an added benefit .
If you 've ever been out at night on a two - lane road , you know the oncoming traffic can blind you .
At those times , Haley looks straight at the screen .
“ The display allows you to see the lines of the road without having to look at the car and blinding you , ” he said .
Night vision : a night - and - day difference in visibility – literally .
The system is completely hands - free and displays the information on a GPS unit .
Haley says the biggest challenge in the project was finding a GPS unit with video input .
It was harder still finding a weatherproof unit , he said .
Although the camera is waterproof and shockproof , the display is another story .
For now the screen has to be protected or removed in foul weather .
The system is still in the R&D phase .
Haley has put 9,000 miles on the prototype since installing it on his BMW R1150GS several months ago , but it does n’t give him enough data .
He 's built a few more and loaned them out to get more info .
He 's wishing he'd built more .
“ I can easily find people willing to try this , ” he said .
Who'd have guessed ?
We would love to see a heads - up display or , cooler still , a monocle display like military helicopter pilots use .
So would Haley .
But it 's not in the cards .
Haley said it is n't cost - effective .
He 's focusing on keeping things relatively affordable .
Haley can't say whether the technology might one day be available on new motorcycles or offered as an aftermarket accessory .
One thing he knows for sure , though , is he 'll have to keep the cost as low as possible .
Right now he aims to come in at less than $ 2,000 .
That is quite a premium when most bikes come in at under $ 20,000 .
If you are one of those round - the - world adventure riders or someone who's on the bike 24/ 7 year - round , it might be worth it outside of the obvious cool factor .
It ’s bound to save you the coin from at least one inevitable wreck .

With the recent launch of the new , digital only , PSPgo Sony introduced PSP Minis , bite sized games that are quick and easy to pick up and play while on the go .
BreakQuest is one of the first games from this bold new direction that Sony is taking , one that in many ways brings the PSP in direct competition with the iPhone .
In essence , BreakQuest on the PSP is a port of the classic arcade title of the same name , another take on the highly overcrowded genre of ‘ bat - the - ball ’ games that spawned since BreakOut and Arkanoid .
However , unlike most BreakOut - clones , BreakQuest manages to differentiate itself from the majority of those games by providing several exciting and innovative features .
One of the biggest improvements of the game , over others of the same genre , is its superb physics engine , for when you break a brick it does n’t just simply explode and disappear but reacts in a complex and realistic way .
To spice things up , the weight of the bricks and objects differ from level to level , with some even stuck together in an elastic World of Goo style web , allowing for the physics engine to come into full effect , as numerous chaotic collisions are shown simultaneously on screen .
Additionally , some levels contain enemies that shoot at the player , while others contain obstacles to hinder progress .
The degree of diversity in the levels is a true blessing for the game , helping to add excitement to what can be a rather repetitive genre .
For example , one level challenges players to hit four of the same colours in a row before they disappear , while another tests your skills at beating the game while the bricks are invisible .
The game may be a mere 65 mb , but with a 100 levels in the Quest Mode alone , this title is far from being , well , mini .
Most levels are unique and worth playing , but the occasional repetitive scene dampens the enjoyment of what is mainly a very fun game .
The game has 9 different weapons as well as power - ups that were never seen on the arcade or PC versions of BreakQuest .
Each weapon provides extra depth to the levels as well as helping to get rid of that last annoying brick .
Moreover , the ‘ Gravitator ’ is the added ability of the player to increase gravity on the ball to drag it downwards and thus give that added control over the ball that other games do not provide .
The art style of the PSP game changes from level to level , with one providing a detailed scene of a farmyard , while another pays homage to the classic game Space Invaders .
This varying style is accentuated by the crisp and sharp graphics that , in turn , are livened by bright and vibrant colours .
However , the graphics are limited to a totally 2D plane , which means that explosions and effects are equally limited .
At times the game is devilishly difficult , but with three difficulties ( easy , medium and hard ) in Quest mode and several other difficulties in the Arcade mode , players can adjust the game to suit their difficulty levels , although to unlock harder difficulty settings in Quest mode you must play through every single one of the 100 levels in the game .
The background music of the game ( made by Maniacs of Noise ) is rather enjoyable , and satisfyingly retro , but what really makes the sound top - notch is how what happens in the game affects the song , each time the ball hits an object a tone is emitted , sometimes leading to a Lumines esque tune that delights the ear .
Unfortunately , each track , of which there are many , is rather short , and loops continuously while a level is played .
Ultimately , whether you will enjoy this game or not depends on whether you enjoy the Break Out style of ‘ bat - the - ball ’ titles .
BreakQuest does n’t provide anything that utterly sets it apart from other games in the genre , but with 100 levels , numerous weapons and power - ups , and a fantastic art style , the game manages to improve on a severly stagnated genre to a degree that makes the game definitely worth a look .
At a mere £ 2.49 / €2.99 ( with a US release soon ) , the game packs in hours of fun into an incredibly cheap and small package .
Fifteen students left with permanent scars after branding each other with heated coathangers
Fifteen students were left with permanent scars after branding themselves with heated coat hangers at a house party , it emerged today .
The ' group challenge ' saw each student brand themselves with the initial of the hall they lived in last year .
Participants held a reshaped metal coat hanger to heat on a hot stove for 30 seconds .
Scarred : Fifteen students at Exeter University , pictured , branded themselves using heated coat hangers in a ' group challenge '
Individually , they then took turns to have the burning metal pressed against their chests for ten seconds .
After visiting hospital , at least three of the students were given antibiotics to fight infection .
A burns specialist also warned they will have permanent scarring , following the incident on September 20 at a private house party for students at Exeter University .
One of the branded students , who asked not to be named , told student newspaper Exepose : ' We are a tight group , all very close friends .
' It was n't a spontaneous thing , we had talked about it before . '
He added that the whole episode was viewed as a ' group challenge ' and that within the group of friends there is ' a bit of a daredevil culture ' .
Onlookers said large amounts of alcohol were consumed at the party , but another unnamed student added there was no coercion involved .
He said : ' No one was pinned down .
It was all optional , everyone just stood there and did it .'
A spokeswoman for Exeter University said it would not be investigating the matter .
Update : A Pandora rep explains that “ some developer or unlocked phones will not be able to see the app in the Android market . ”
We ’re hearing that the excellent streaming music app from Pandora is not available in the Android Market if you ’re using a Hero .
This is a very strange development : it ’s available to G1 and MyTouch users with no problem .
Some folks are jumping to the conclusion that Spring is blocking this high bandwidth app , but it comes preloaded on the Palm Pre , so that also seems unlikely .
We ’ve asked Sprint for a comment and will update this post if / when we hear back from them .
If you ’ve got your hands on a Hero and can check , let us know in the comments if you ’re having the same problem .

Database normalization is a technique for designing relational database schemas that ensures that the data is optimal for ad - hoc querying and that modifications such as deletion or insertion of data does not lead to data inconsistency .
Database de normalization is the process of optimizing your database for reads by creating redundant data .
A consequence of denormalization is that insertions or deletions could cause data inconsistency if not uniformly applied to all redundant copies of the data within the database .
Why Denormalize Your Database ?
Today , lots of Web applications have " social " features .
A consequence of this is that whenever I look at content or a user in that service , there is always additional content from other users that also needs to be pulled in to page .
When you visit the typical profile on a social network like Facebook or MySpace , data for all the people that are friends with that user needs to be pulled in .
Or when you visit a shared bookmark on del.icio.us you need data for all the users who have tagged and bookmarked that URL as well .
Performing a query across the entire user base for " all the users who are friends with Robert Scoble " or " all the users who have bookmarked this blog link " is expensive even with caching .
It is orders of magnitude faster to return the data if it is precalculated and all written to the same place .
This is optimizes your reads at the cost of incurring more writes to the system .
It also means that you 'll end up with redundant data because there will be multiple copies of some amount of user data as we try to ensure the locality of data .
A good example of a Web application deciding to make this trade off is the recent post on the Digg Blog entitled Looking to the Future with Cassandra which contains the following excerpt
The Problem
In both models , we ’re computing the intersection of two sets : Users who dugg an item .
Users that have befriended the digger .
The Relational Model
The schema for this information in MySQL is : CREATE TABLE ` Diggs` ( `id` INT ( 11 ) , `itemid` INT ( 11 ) , `userid` INT ( 11 ) , `digdate` DATETIME , PRIMARY KEY ( `id` ) , KEY `user` ( `userid` ) , KEY `item` ( `itemid` ) ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 ; CREATE TABLE `Friends` ( `id` INT ( 10 ) AUTO_INCREMENT , `userid` INT ( 10 ) , `username` VARCHAR ( 15 ) , `friendid` INT ( 10 ) , `friendname` VARCHAR ( 15 ) , `mutual` TINYINT ( 1 ) , `date_created` DATETIME , PRIMARY KEY ( `id` ) , UNIQUE KEY `Friend_unique` ( `userid` , `friendid` ) , KEY `Friend_friend` ( `friendid` ) ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 ;
The Friends table contains many million rows , while Diggs holds hundreds of millions .
Computing the intersection with a JOIN is much too slow in MySQL , so we have to do it in PHP .
The steps are : Query Friends for all my friends .
With a cold cache , this takes around 1.5 seconds to complete .
Query Diggs for any diggs of a specific item by a user in the set of friend user IDs .
This query is enormous , and looks something like : SELECT `digdate` , `id` FROM ` Diggs` WHERE `userid` IN ( 59 , 9006 , 15989 , 16045 , 29183 , 30220 , 62511 , 75212 , 79006 ) AND itemid = 13084479 ORDER BY `digdate` DESC , `id` DESC LIMIT 4 ;
The real query is actually much worse than this , since the IN clause contains every friend of the user , and this can balloon to hundreds of user IDs .
A full query can actually clock in at 1.5 kb , which is many times larger than the actual data we want .
With a cold cache , this query can take 14 seconds to execute .
Of course , both queries are cached , but due to the user - specific nature of this data , it does n’t help much .
The solution the Digg development team went with was to denormalize the data .
They also went an additional step and decided that since the data was no longer being kept in a relational manner there was no point in using a traditional relational database ( i.e. MySQL ) and instead they migrated to a non-RDBMS technology to solve this problem .
How Denormalization Changes Your Application
There are a number of things to keep in mind once you choose to denormalize your data including
Denormalization means data redundancy which translates to significantly increased storage costs .
The fully denormalized data set from the Digg exampled ended up being 3 terabytes of information .
It is typical for developers to underestimate the data bloat that occurs once data is denormalized .
Fixing data inconsistency is now the job of the application .
Let 's say each user has a list of the user names of all of their friends .
What happens when one of these users changes their user name ?
In a normalized database that is a simple UPDATE query to change a single piece of data and then it will be current everywhere it is shown on the site .
In a denormalized database , there now has to be a mechanism for fixing up this name in all of the dozens , hundreds or thousands of places it appears .
Most services that create denormalized databases have " fixup " jobs that are constantly running on the database to fix such inconsistencies .
The No - SQL Movement vs. Abusing Relational Databases for Fun & Profit
If you ’re a web developer interested in building large scale applications , it does n’t take long in reading the various best practices on getting Web applications to scale such as practicing database sharding or eschewing transactions before it begins to sound like all the advice you are getting is about ignoring or abusing the key features that define a modern relational database system .
Taken to its logical extreme all you really need is a key <-> value or tuple store that supports some level of query functionality and has decent persistence semantics .
Thus the NoSQL movement was borne .
The No -SQL movement is a used to describe the increasing usage of non-relational databases among Web developers .
This approach has initially pioneered by large scale Web companies like Facebook ( Cassandra ) , Amazon ( Dynamo ) & Google ( BigTable ) but now is finding its way down to smaller sites like Digg .
Unlike relational databases , there is a yet to be a solid technical definition of what it means for a product to be a " NoSQL " database aside from the fact that it is n't a relational database .
Commonalities include lack of fixed schemas and limited support for rich querying .
Below is a list of some of the more popular NoSQL databases that you can try today along with a brief description of their key qualities
CouchDB : A document - oriented database where documents can be thought of as JSON / JavaScript objects .
Creation , retrieval , update and deletion ( CRUD ) operations are performed via a RESTful API and support ACID properties .
Rich querying is handled by creating Javascript functions called " Views " which can operate on the documents in the database via Map / Reduce style queries .
Usage : Although popular among the geek set most users seem to be dabblers as opposed to large scale web companies .
Cassandra :
A key - value store where each key - value pair comes with a timestamp and can be grouped together into a column family ( i.e. a table ) .
There is also a notion of super columns which are columns that contain whose values are a list of other key - value pairs .
Cassandra is optimized to be always writable and uses eventual consistency to deal with the conflicts that inevitably occur when a distributed system aims to be always writable yet node failure is a fact of life .
Querying is available via the Cassandra Thrift API and supports fairly basic data retrieval operations based on key values and column names .
Usage : Originally developed and still used at Facebook today .
Digg and Rackspace are the most recent big name adopters .
Voldemort : Very similar to Cassandra which is unsurprising since they are both inspired by Amazon 's Dynamo .
Voldemort is a key - value store where each key value pair comes with a timestamp and eventual consistency is used to address write anomalies .
Values can contain a list of further key value pairs .
Data access involves creation , retrieval and deletion of serialized objects whose format can be one of JSON , strings , binary BLOBs , serialized Java objects and Google Protocol Buffers .
Rich querying is non-existent , simple get and put operations are all that exist .
Usage : Originally developed and still used at LinkedIn .
There are a number of other interesting NoSQL databases such as HBase , MongoDB and Dynomite but the three above seem to be the most mature from my initial analysis .
In general , most of them seem to be a clone of BigTable , Dynamo or some amalgam of ideas from both papers .
The most original so far has been CouchDB .
An alternative to betting on a speculative database technologies at varying levels of maturity is to mis use an existing mature relational database product .
As mentioned earlier , many large scale sites use relational databases but eschew relational features such as transactions and joins to achieve scalability .
Some developers have even taken that practice to an extreme and built schema - less data models on top of traditional relational database .
A great example of this How FriendFeed uses MySQL to store schema - less data which is a blog post excerpted below
Lots of projects exist designed to tackle the problem storing data with flexible schemas and building new indexes on the fly ( e.g. , CouchDB ) .
However , none of them seemed widely - used enough by large sites to inspire confidence .
In the tests we read about and ran ourselves , none of the projects were stable or battle - tested enough for our needs ( see this somewhat outdated article on CouchDB , for example ) .
MySQL works .
It does n't corrupt data .
Replication works .
We understand its limitations already .
We like MySQL for storage , just not RDBMS usage patterns .
After some deliberation , we decided to implement a " schema - less " storage system on top of MySQL rather than use a completely new storage system .
…
Our datastore stores schema-less bags of properties ( e.g. , JSON objects or Python dictionaries ) .
The only required property of stored entities is id , a 16 - byte UUID .
The rest of the entity is opaque as far as the datastore is concerned .
We can change the " schema " simply by storing new properties .
…
In MySQL , our entities are stored in a table that looks like this : CREATE TABLE entities ( added_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY , id BINARY ( 16 ) NOT NULL , updated TIMESTAMP NOT NULL , body MEDIUMBLOB , UNIQUE KEY ( id ) , KEY ( updated ) ) ENGINE=InnoDB ;
The added_id column is present because InnoDB stores data rows physically in primary key order .
The AUTO_INCREMENT primary key ensures new entities are written sequentially on disk after old entities , which helps for both read and write locality ( new entities tend to be read more frequently than old entities since FriendFeed pages are ordered reverse - chronologically ) .
Entity bodies are stored as zlib - compressed , pickled Python dictionaries .
Now that the FriendFeed team works at Facebook I suspect they 'll end up deciding that a NoSQL database that has solved a good story around replication and fault tolerance is more amenable to solving the problem of building a schema - less database than storing key <-> value pairs in a SQL database where the value is a serialized Python object .
As a Web developer it 's always a good idea to know what the current practices are in the industry even if they seem a bit too crazy to adopt …yet .

Rightly or wrongly , a business occasionally is picked out by the fates to serve as the " unacceptable face of capitalism " — a term coined by the late British Prime Minister Edward Heath .
Goldman Sachs , for a lot of people , is today 's UFC .
The kinder jokes refer to the legendary investment firm as " Government Sachs , " because of its connections to former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson ( once a Goldman CEO ) and other alumni who , as Washington officials , had hands in last year 's financial crisis rescue operations ....
Last week we got sent a press release about a KFC publicity stunt at the UN , and shrugged it off because we 're not corporate tools who reblog each and every publicity stunt ( unless it involves American Apparel ) .
But what makes this one interesting is that the stunt has deeply embarrassed UN security , who allowed a guy dressed like Colonel Sanders into restricted areas of the UN without security clearance .
The guy even got a photo op with current president of the United Nations General Assembly , Libya ’s Dr. Ali A. Treki !
A publicist for KFC tells us " the Colonel and a photographer were able to talk their way into the UN building to talk to officials about the request that Grilled Nation ' earn a seat ' as the 193rd UN member state . "
Acceptance by the international community is long overdue !
How long can the UN keep sitting on its hands ?
Security is " still trying to find out exactly what happened , " says Michele Montas , spokeswoman for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon .
" It should not have happened — that I will stress , and very strongly .
There was some lapse in security and the individual in question ... was , on the initiative of one security guard , taken ... into the UN . "
Perhaps a little free chicken greased the right palm ?
But despite the photo - op , Treki 's spokesman insists , " There was no meeting .
No appointment scheduled with the actor impersonating Colonel Sanders . . . there was a brief encounter with the president of the General Assembly . "
And Treki only shook the Colonel 's hand because " he 's a very polite man . "
( Which could apply to Treki or Colonel sanders . )
Perhaps the best part of this fiasco is that the spokeswoman for the United Nations Secretary General has been reduced to acknowledging the Grilled Nation 's letter demanding UN membership , telling the National Post of Canada , " That letter is absolutely void to us ; it has no meaning whatsoever .
The UN can not be involved in a commercial venture .
Period .
This is being touched upon by our legal department . "
Good to see they 're keeping busy over there !
One year ago , Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy , bringing to a head the growing chaos on Wall Street .
In the days and weeks that followed Lehmanâ€™s September 15 , 2008 , collapse , credit markets would freeze , the stock market plunged , the government took a controlling interest in AIG , Wachovia and Merrill Lynch merged themselves out of existence , the Congress approved a plan to spend $ 700 billion to bail out Wall Street , the Federal Reserve innovated an array of programs involving trillions of dollars worth of support for Wall Street and the credit markets , and the national economy — and much of the global economy — declined precipitously .
As the crisis unfolded , it quickly became commonplace to suggest that nothing would ever be the same , on Wall Street or in the national economy .
The Wall Street goliaths had been humbled — and many had gone out of business , via merger or bankruptcy .
Deregulation went out of style and even former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan indicated that the conceptual underpinnings of his deregulatory approach had proven flawed .
One year later , it is clear that the conventional wisdom emerging as the crisis developed was wrong .
Some things have changed dramatically — notably in the real economy — but Wall Streetâ€™s political power remains intact .
No new rules are in place to prevent a recurrence of the crisis .
Major questions remain about whether any such rules commensurate with the scale of the crisis — with the important exception of a new consumer financial protection agency — will be seriously considered .
The financial crisis has had a devastating impact on regular people — and the situation continues to worsen , even as the economy enters what may be a potential recovery .
Overall economic growth fell by more than 5 percent ( on an annual basis ) in the fourth quarter of 2008 and by more than 6 percent in the first quarter of 2009 .
Thanks to this economic crash , the official unemployment rate is racing to 10 percent , with many believing it will persist at or near double digits through the end of 2010 .
The actual unemployment rate — taking into account underemployment and discouraged workers — has topped an astounding 16 percent .
A staggering one in six workers is out of work or underemployed .
The poverty rate has worsened dramatically , just based on the available data for 2008 alone .
The official poverty rate in 2008 was 13.2 percent , up from 12.5 percent in 2007 .
There were 39.8 million people in poverty in 2008 , 2.5 million people more than the previous year .
The 2008 poverty rate — and things have surely gotten worse — was the highest since 1997 .
The mortgage crisis continues to worsen .
More than 1.5 million foreclosures were filed through the first seven months of this year .
By mid-2009 , roughly a third of outstanding mortgage borrowers were underwater — meaning they owed more than the value of their home — and the number is growing .
Mortgage modifications — almost none of which touch principal — do not come close to keeping pace .
Goldman Sachs projects there will be 13 million foreclosures between the end of 2008 and 2014 .
The causes of the financial crash continue unabated and in some cases have worsened .
Out - of - control compensation packages , linked to short - term profit performance , drove top Wall Street and big bank executives and traders to take reckless risks .
For them , it was a game of heads we win , tails you lose :
If their firms registered short - term profits , they received outrageous bonus packages ; if there was a longer - term fallout , that would hurt shareholders , but they would have already pocketed their bonuses .
Wall Street bonuses are already on track to match or exceed the glutinous pace of 2007 .
Banks and other financial institutions deemed â€œtoo big to failâ€ engaged in wild speculation , secure in the knowledge that they would ultimately be backstopped by federal support .
These behemoths helped generate the crisis as well by leveraging their political power to peel back the regulatory restraints on Wall Street .
Now , thanks to a series of shotgun mergers , the banks are bigger than ever , and there is a greater combination of commercial banking and investment bank operations in single corporate entities .
The proliferation of exotic financial instruments led to massive leveraging and complicated interconnections among top firms that no one could track .
The unraveling of these ties led to the downfall of AIG , among other things .
While financial derivatives are justified as helping economic players hedge against risk , it turns out they are primarily speculative tools used overwhelmingly by a small number of players .
This concentration of massive speculative betting continues , with five banks owning more than four - fifths of the notional value of all outstanding derivatives in the United States .
The notional value of these banksâ€™ derivatives exceeded $ 190 trillion in the first quarter of 2009 .
Wall Streetâ€™s go - go years earlier this decade were fueled by a housing bubble and deceptive lending practices .
Consumer rip - offs continue apace — and appear to be central to the banksâ€™ business model .
Overdraft fees alone will bring in more than $ 38 billion in revenue to the banks in 2009 .
Meanwhile , the public is paying massively for rescuing Wall Street from itself .
The Special Inspector General set up to oversee the bailout estimates that government agencies , including the Federal Reserve , will ultimately put out more than $ 23 trillion in various programs and supports related to the financial crisis .
This total is almost three times what was spent on World War II , in adjusted dollars .
Most of these trillions will return to the Federal Reserve or the Treasury , but that hardly mitigates the scale of the public investment and risk committed to save Wall Street .
And the Treasury Department is certain to lose tens of billions — quite likely hundreds of billions — in the deal .
The deregulation that led to the financial crisis , the bank - friendly immediate response to the crisis and the failure to impose meaningful restraints on Wall Street after the crisis can all be traced to Wall Street ’s political power .
Wall Street spent more than $ 5 billion on federal campaign contributions and lobbying from 1998 to 2008 , and its fervent spending continues .
The financial sector has spent more than $ 200 million on lobbying in 2009 alone .
In spring of this year , the banks defeated a proposal , which had been expected to pass , to authorize â€œcramdownsâ€ of mortgages in bankruptcy .
This modest measure would have permitted bankruptcy judges to adjust mortgage principal in bankruptcy , to help people stay in their homes .
It would have had relatively limited application and likely would have helped the banks , which are hurt by foreclosures in an environment where they cannot sell houses from which they have evicted borrowers .
But cramdown violates the banksâ€™ ideological commitment to preventing adjustments of principal .
They mobilized to defeat it , leading a frustrated Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin to say the banks â€œown the placeâ€ — meaning the Congress .
And now , the Financial Services Roundtable has openly announced its intention to â€œkillâ€  the most important reform measures urged by the Obama administration : creation of a consumer financial protection agency .
Perhaps one of the most telling statistics is the number of stand - alone pieces of financial reform legislation passed , one year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers : zero .

Secular Bear Markets and the Volatility of Inflation
The U.S. economy is unlikely to return to its tranquil days of the Great Moderation anytime soon .
The 25 - year period beginning in the early 1980 's represented a uniquely smooth ride for the economy and for investors .
The shocks to the economy during this period were smaller in scale and less global in nature .
This allowed the growth pattern of the economy to be contained in a relatively tight range .
It was also a period where the growth rate in government spending trended lower , which coincided with disinflation .
These trends benefited investors greatly .
As their confidence that the future would look much like the past grew , so did their willingness to pay higher multiples for stocks .
But this almost 2 - year old crisis has proved to be larger in nature , centered on the banks and their inability to provide credit , more global , and is mostly being met by a policy response that rests on inflating the Federal Reserve 's balance sheet , notable deficit expansion , and issuing large amounts of Treasury securities to pay for the clean - up .
Even when the economy begins to rebound , the cures administered to the disease are likely to create economic variability far above the levels of the last two decades , and headwinds for sustained economic growth .
As John Hussman recently observed , " economic expansions are emphatically not driven by a ' consumer recovery . '
They are invariably driven by swings in gross domestic investment - capital spending , autos , housing , factories , and other outlays that are heavily reliant on debt financing .
It is a very hard sell to expect a sustained recovery in debt - financed gross investment in an economy under strong deleveraging pressure .
We are in the midst of - and will continue to require - perhaps the largest adjustment in U.S. personal , corporate and government balance sheets that we will see in our lifetimes .
This will be a very long slog .
The outlook is not up , but very widely sideways . "
Pimco's Mohamed El - Erian has sounded a similar note , calling this the ' new normal ' , which may best be described as saying that the next few years will look quite a bit different than what investors are accustomed to .
He suggests that stock investors should " recognize that the equity risk premium will now reflect a permanently higher threat of subordination . "
The abrupt changes to markets , households , institutions , and government policies that have occurred are unlikely to be reversed soon , which will lead to an investing climate of muted world growth , where central banks and treasuries will find it difficult to undo the emergency steps taken , and overall output will fall below longer - term trends .
What will the subordination of the equity class mean for the range of valuations that can be expected over the next couple of years ?
And does the current economic backdrop yet have the characteristics that usually coincide with the end of secular bear markets ?
The variability of economic growth and inflation matters to investors .
When stock investors have difficulty forecasting the cash flows they expect to receive , they raise the discount rate , and valuations fall .
Otherwise , the longer the period of economic tranquility the more confident investors become that the future will look like the recent past , and the further they push multiples up .
The graph below shows P/E multiples versus the level of volatility in the economy - which we proxy here with the volatility of inflation .
( I used a similar graph in Stock Market Valuations Following the Great Moderation , and some of the research below can be thought of as a continuation of the ideas I presented in that article . )
The graph shows that high multiples almost always coincide with low economic volatility , and bubble valuations coincide with very low volatility .
On the other hand , high amounts of volatility in inflation nearly always coincide with rock - bottom valuations .
( Although we use the volatility of inflation as a proxy for economic volatility in this analysis , we could have also used the volatility of economic output , because the two are highly correlated . )
The previous graph gives a good indication of where multiples are given the full range of inflation volatility .
But we can look at this association of the variability in inflation and multiples from another angle .
We can ask what the typical range of valuation was given a range of inflation variability .
We know that generally multiples are low when the variability of inflation is high .
But it would be helpful to know what the typical range of valuations was during periods where the variability of inflation has been high or low .
The next graph offers some perspective on this .
It shows a set of box plots , which represents the range of P/E multiples during periods of differing amounts of inflation volatility .
The dark blue section of each box plot represents the spread around each median , and contains half of the data in each period .
The lines drawn outside of each of the boxes represent the roughly 25 percent of the data that sits furthest on each side of the median .
Valuations are represented by Robert Shiller 's P/E based on the 10 - year average of real earnings .
The red line running through all of the boxes represents the current ratio of price to averaged earnings .
The top plot shows the range of valuations during the periods where inflation volatility was the lowest , like the mid 1950's and the first half of the 1960's .
It also includes a large chunk of the 1990's .
The bottom plot represents the 25 percent of periods where inflation was the most volatile .
These periods are most often represented by high inflation like that of the 1970's , but they also include periods of slight deflation like the late 1940's .
This is important to consider , because it 's not just inflation that can send multiples lower , but also deflation .
It 's the uncertainty of future price level direction that has the most direct effect on multiples .
The blue blocks show the typical range of multiples ( between the 25 th and 75 th percentile ) , while the endpoints represent the extremes at the 99 th percentile .
The data line up as you would expect , considering the relationship between inflation variability and valuation .
Periods of low volatility often coincide with higher levels of valuation , and that sort of low economic variability can help to generate stock market bubbles .
The plot that is second from the top shows the range of valuations when economic variability is slightly below the median .
In this setting , the typical range of multiples is between 14 and 19 ; the 99 percentile is about 26 .
For above - average volatility ( the two bottom plots ) the typical valuation multiples are between about 10 times and 15 times the 10 - year average of trailing real earnings .
The highest multiple typically seen during these periods is about 20 .
For a reference point , the P/E on 10 - year trailing earnings is currently about 16 .
Currently , the level of the volatility of inflation is still low compared with the historical range .
Present conditions would fall into the 2 nd plot from the top in the graph above .
At about 900 , the S&P 500 is roughly at the midpoint of normal valuations for this level of inflation volatility .
Using the current level of inflation variability as the only measure of investment conditions , S&P levels between 800 and 1100 would represent typical range of variation .
A return to 2007 highs would represent bubble valuations in the 99 th percentile .
Alternatively , if the next few years include both the effects and the reversal of the recent emergency fiscal and monetary stimulus - call it the Great Unwinding - inflation volatility could move above average , leading to more moderate valuations for the S&P .
The 25 th and 75 th percentile for the two bottom plots in the graph above would then suggest a level for the S&P 500 of about 575 and 850 .
An extreme in the 99 th percentile would be about 1150 on the index .
Investors may regain their exuberance and lack of risk aversion during the next couple of years , but it seems unlikely .
The 2003 -2007 cyclical bull market will very likely go down in the books as an outlier .
It 's extremely rare for investors to push stock prices back up to near bubble levels immediately following a prior bubble .
The recent bull market , coming on the heels of the technology and dot - com crash , was a rare occurrence where leverage , easy credit , a housing market bubble , record profit margins , and inflated earnings ( in hindsight ) , created an atmosphere where investors were once again willing to bid stock prices to ( ultimately unrewarding ) long - term levels .
To illustrate , on the basis of Robert Shiller 's P/E ratio , the S&P 500 has tended to peak at about 23 times trailing earnings before declining ( although in 1929 they rose above 30 and in 2000 they rose above 40 ) .
We can use that level of about 23 times earnings as a benchmark for measuring the length of time between bubble periods where investors disregard risk aversion .
The years where the smoothed P/E ratio , after climbing above about 23 times trailing earnings , then fell below that level are : 1900 , 1929 , 1965 , 2002 , and 2007 .
It usually takes about a generation between stock market bubbles for investors to forget the damage done to long - term returns by investing in overvalued markets - 5 years was the outlier .
And with profitability , margins , and earnings in the dumps , and with a long climb out in front of them , it 's difficult to imagine investors disregarding risk aversion completely again soon .
As an aside , the Shiller P/E ratio will be fighting a headwind for at least the next year and half , and probably longer .
That 's because it 's calculated using a 10 - year moving average of real earnings .
The earliest earnings in the calculation include those generated by companies in 1999 and most of 2000 .
Prior to profits turning down in September of 2000 , earnings were regularly above $ 50 a share .
Current trailing earnings are about $ 7 a share .
Each month , the calculation drops an earnings number from the peak of 1999 and replaces it with the current figure .
This creates persistent downward pressure on the trailing real earnings figure .
Without an extreme rebound in earnings , this P/E ratio will creep higher over the next year even if the index price remains unchanged .
As this ratio has gained in influence during this profits recession , this may not be inconsequential to investors ' valuation assessments .
Secular Bear Markets and the Volatility of Inflation
It 's not only the level of volatility and uncertainty in the economy that matters to investors , but also the trend and the persistence in this uncertainty .
Shrinking amounts of volatility in the economy creates an environment where investors are willing to pay higher and higher multiples for stocks , while growing uncertainty brings lower and lower multiples .
And while there are cyclical gyrations in the volatility of inflation and economic performance , there are also secular trends .
These secular trends in the volatility of inflation closely overlap secular stock bull and bear markets .
( Secular markets are often defined by their primary trend - up or down - even if over shorter periods they move counter to that trend . )
These secular trends can be seen in the first set of graphs below , which show the three secular bull markets of last century which occurred from 1918 - 1929 , 1950 - 1963 , and from 1982 - 2000 .
The blue lines ( scaled on the left axis ) in each of the graphs denote the S&P 500 P/E Ratio .
The red lines ( scaled on the right axis ) track the volatility of inflation during each period .
The black dotted lines show the linear trend of the volatility of inflation .
The graphs show that secular bull markets are fueled by economic volatility that trends persistently lower .
While there are shorter term gyrations in the volatility of inflation during these periods , in all three , the longer - term trend was lower .
The uncertainty faced by investors declined noticeably during each secular bull market , and the end of each bull market usually coincided with a few years of very low economic volatility which helped the markets move into steeply overvalued territory in each case .
When that trend in economic volatility abruptly changed , the secular bull markets came to an end .
You can see the aftermath in the next set of graphs , which show the same interaction of market valuation and the volatility of inflation , but in this case during the three secular bear markets of last century , and the secular bear market beginning in 2000 .
The graphs show that secular bear markets have consistently coincided with rising levels of inflation volatility .
In each case the level of economic volatility grinded higher throughout the secular bear market .
Increasing economic volatility is what helps chaperone multiples from overvalued territory to deeply undervalued territory .
It 's the uncertainty of the stability in the growth rate of the economy and the uncertainty of the price trend that discourages investors .
Piles of behavioral finance research show that investors overweight recent trends in their decisions .
As uncertainty climbs , investors push multiples lower and lower assuming this uncertainty will be perpetual , eventually pricing stocks at generational lows .
It 's important to note that during the current secular bear market , the volatility of inflation has mostly been well contained .
The cyclical bear market of 2000 - 2003 - although aggravated by the recession of 2001 - was mostly about valuation adjustment .
Stocks moved from spectacular levels of overvaluation to moderate overvaluation , and at the recent lows , to slight undervaluation .
Valuations going forward may show their typical sensitivity to economic uncertainty , and for this reason , the change in the slope of the volatility of inflation over the last two years is troublesome .
The level of inflation volatility is still low , relative to the peaks reached during prior secular bear markets .
If the level of inflation volatility continues to increase , it will become more difficult to argue that the secular bear market has come to an end .
The graphs above show that the secular bear markets of last century shared three characteristics .
They each lasted for more than 15 years , they each ended at extremely attractive levels of valuation ( generally about 7 - 9 times trailing 10 - year earnings ) , and , and they each endured many years of growing volatility in output and inflation , which eventually created the mindset for investors to price stocks at attractive levels of valuation .
The current secular bear market can claim none of these characteristics yet .
Any increase in economic volatility during Great Unwinding of the next few years will be crucial in determining the outcome for stocks .

It ’s pretty clear that our national conversation , our national debate is broken – as Al Gore persuasively argued in The Assault on Reason .
On health care – for example – we ’re arguing over distractions and barely touching on the issues at stake .
When Barack Obama ran for office , he won in a large part because he convinced Americans he could change the debate – that he did n’t have a stake in the Baby Boomer arguments that had dominated our political debate since the 1980 election – that he would tackle the long - term festering issues these Baby Boomer debates had put off .
This was the promise of Barack Obama , the source of people ’s hope , the attraction he had for the young and indeed for the aging Baby Boomers themselves .
During his election campaign , he proved at least once that he could rise above the vitriol of base politics that had accustomed the people to expect Clintons and Bushes to exchange presidencies in dirty campaigns .
He broke the cycle that threatened to destroy his candidacy with his speech on race .
In the end , he also prevailed over the forces of xenophobia , of racism , of bigotry .
The fact that he won was extraordinary and proved something else – that not only was Obama able to raise the level of the national conversation – but that he could inspire a majority of the country to give his new approach a chance .
For those who supported him , his failure to change this conversation is the root of their disappointment in him .
I still think it ’s early – but it has become clear that if Obama cannot fix our national conversation , he will not be able to accomplish most of what he has set out to do .
On health care , Paul Krugman has been gloating that he predicted this – that he knew the right wing would throw everything they had at Obama and at every one of his policies .
But Obama never promised to stop people from throwing stuff at him .
His promise was to rise above it .
This is what is the base issue at stake in this health care fight – more profound than our unsustainably increasing costs or the thousands who die each year because they are without coverage .
Fareed Zakaria pointed out that in a crisis our system proved it could act .
But the financial crisis did not prove our system could handle a crisis ; instead , it proved that we were lucky to have individuals in place who appropriated whatever power they needed .
And it was the least accountable person in the room – Ben Bernanke – who had the most power and used it the most .
Congress , responding to popular pressure , almost destroyed the whole process .
Obama – if he is to tackle any issues after health care – must break this budding idiocracy that derails every attempt to have an adult conversation ; he must deflate the growing fears .
I can see only one way he can do this – or at least begin to :
He has to take the health care bill – and get it through with a strong public option and with end of life counseling .
He has to call , “ Bullshit . ”
Explain to the country again the point of these programs and what they will do – and ask anyone who experiences otherwise to contact the White House .
They called Medicare and Social Security and the entire New Deal “ socialism ” and “ tyranny ” too .
And now they are broadly popular and considered key components of our market - based system .
To break these idiocratic forces , Obama needs to force these controversial measures through and allow the Republicans opposing it to demagogue it in every way possible .
Then make sure there are strong transparency measures in place .
And then let those who predicted a Holocaust look foolish .
It ’s the first step to discrediting their methods and reforming our national conversation .

CLEVELAND — Former Cleveland resident Jimmie Jackson , 44 , already in prison for rape , was sentenced to the maximum 20 years in prison for breaking into a house and raping an 11 - year - old girl .
Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Shirley Strickland Saffold sentenced Jackson last month , after he pleaded guilty to aggravated burglary and rape .
He crawled into a bedroom window Nov. 16 , 2002 , and raped the girl , while holding a knife to her throat and threatening to kill her if she screamed , prosecutor 's spokesman Ryan Miday said .
Jackson 's DNA was recently matched to the evidence after he was required to give a blood sample in prison .
He was sentenced Oct. 23 to seven years in prison for raping another child in 2007 .
Editor 's note : Jim Rogers is chief executive officer of Charlotte , North Carolina - based Duke Energy , which generates much of its power from coal - burning plants and is making investments in clean energy technology in China .
Jonathan Lash is the president of the World Resources Institute .
Ming Sung is Asia Pacific representative of the Clean Air Task Force .
Jim Rogers , CEO of coal - burning Duke Energy , wants the U.S. to join with China against greenhouse gases .
( CNN ) --
There is a lot of rhetoric on Main Street and in our nation 's Capitol these days portraying China as a job - stealing polluter whose economy is growing at the expense of the United States .
But business leaders and policy advocates who work in China see a different picture : a China that is investing heavily in innovation and determined to win the global race to supply its citizens and the world with clean energy technologies .
China is the largest producer of solar water heaters , with 50 percent of the world 's production and 65 percent of all installations .
It produces 30 percent of the world 's photovoltaic sets and is installing wind turbines faster than any other nation .
China 's expanding middle class is increasingly mobile , with more than 50 million electric bicycles , and China is developing the first mass - produced plug - in hybrid electric car .
The country has 14 nuclear power plants under construction and plans to start 10 more next year .
Although there has been much talk about creating " green jobs " in the United States , China leads the world with its massive investment in energy efficiency and renewable power .
China 's growth has come with a heavy price : pollution .
China produces 80 percent of its electricity from coal and now leads the world in greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants .
Dirty air and contaminated water affect many millions of Chinese and are two of the nation 's most serious problems .
Although the United States has made great strides in reducing pollution in recent decades , we are still the world 's second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions , with emissions per capita four times higher than China's .
Our nation is also heavily dependent on coal and imported oil .
We are moving ahead in solar energy , wind and efficiency , but we are doing so in a fragmented , state - by - state approach that reflects our democracy and regulatory structures .
By forging relationships with leading Chinese state - owned and private energy and technology companies , U.S. companies -- at times working with the federal government -- can create a " ladder of cooperation " with the Chinese to lead the world forward on climate change .
We will not climb this ladder overnight but one rung at a time .
With the United Nations ' climate change conference in Copenhagen , Denmark , just two months away , it is imperative that our two nations establish a more trusting , give - and - take relationship upon which good business partnerships are built .
The World Resources Institute , the Clean Air Task Force and Duke Energy have started this work , with great prospects for results .
WRI , an independent , non-partisan environmental research organization , is working with China to calculate its greenhouse emissions as a key part of its next national Five - Year Plan to advance its economy .
The intent is to develop reportable and verifiable measures in the plan that could facilitate China 's participation in an international climate agreement .
Duke Energy recently announced a memorandum of understanding with the China Huaneng Group , China 's largest power generator , and the ENN Group , one of the nation 's largest private energy companies .
The focus of these efforts is to cooperatively develop and commercialize an array of clean energy technologies .
The Clean Air Task Force -- an environmental organization advancing clean technology in the United States and China -- is pivotal to Duke Energy efforts .
It has created a network of a dozen Chinese and U.S. companies to develop joint business ventures to build advanced , low - carbon coal technology in China and around the world .
This network is expanding to include an array of other renewable and clean energy technologies .
Historically , Americans have known little about China and , at times , are justifiably concerned about its growing power and influence .
This is changing as our trading and financial interdependencies grow .
Today , China is the largest exporter to the United States and the largest holder of U.S. debt .
It is clearly not beneficial to either country to turn back the clock .
There always will be healthy competition between China and the United States in developing and marketing technologies , but we must work closely together to scale up and commercialize the best ideas , regardless of whether it comes from our two nations or other countries in Europe or Asia or North America .
China and the United States bring extraordinary and complementary skills to the table .
China 's 1.3 billion people and unmatched economies of scale can bring new technologies to market fast -- in " China time " -- at a speed that is virtually impossible anywhere else in the world .
The United States is the world 's largest economy , with an educational and technological infrastructure that is unmatched in the world , and stable energy regulation and investment policies .
The sooner we get to work on achieving proposed congressional targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , the less expensive addressing climate change will ultimately be .
We need to build on the emerging cooperation that exists between our two nations on energy and climate .
We need to take responsibility for the fact that we are the world 's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases .
If the United States and China can come together to lead on addressing climate change , the rest of world will follow .
To make this relationship work , each country should leave fear and timidity at the door , put economic self - interest to work and forge the strategic partnerships necessary to get the job done .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jim Rogers , Jonathan Lash and Ming Sung .

Happy Days is a series about the search for contentment , written by those striving to come to terms with the lives they lead .
All progress paves over some bit of knowledge or washes away some valuable practice .
Within a few years , e-mail and Twitter moved the art of letter writing to the trash bin .
And in an age when all psychic life is being understood in terms of neurotransmitters , the art of introspection has become passé .
Galileos of the inner world , such as Soren Kierkegaard ( 1813 - 1855 ) , have been packed off to the museum of antiquated ideas .
Yet I think that the great and highly quirky Dane could help us to retrieve a distinction that has been effaced .
These days , confide to someone that you are in despair and he or she will likely suggest that you seek out professional help for your depression .
While despair used to be classified as one of the seven deadly sins , it has now been medicalized and folded into the concept of clinical depression .
If Kierkegaard were on Facebook or could post a You Tube video , he would certainly complain that we , who have listened to Prozac , have become deaf to the ancient distinction between psychological and spiritual disorders , between depression and despair .
There is abundant chatter today about “ being spiritual ” but scarcely anyone believes that a person can be of troubled mind and healthy spirit .
Nor can we fathom the idea that the happy wanderer , who is all smiles and has accomplished everything on his or her self - fulfillment list , is , in fact , a case of despair .
But while Kierkegaard would have agreed that happiness and melancholy are mutually exclusive , he warns , “ Happiness is the greatest hiding place for despair . ”
Despair is marked by a desire to get rid of the self , an unwillingness to become who you fundamentally are .
Kierkegaard was called “ the Fork ” as a child because of his uncanny ability to find people ’s weaknesses and stick it to them .
His lapidary “ Sickness Unto Death ” is a study of despair , which in the Danish derives from the notion of intensified doubt .
Almost as a challenge to keep out the less than earnest reader , Kierkegaard begins “ Sickness ” with this famous albeit slightly ironic bit of word play :
A human being is a spirit .
But what is spirit ?
Spirit is the self .
But what is the self ?
The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation relating itself to itself in the relation .
For those who do not immediately pitch the book across the room , the magister continues , “ A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite , of the temporal and the eternal , of freedom and necessity . ”
Despair occurs when there is an imbalance in this synthesis .
From there Kierkegaard goes on to present a veritable portrait gallery of the forms that despair can take .
Too much of the expansive factor , of infinitude , and you have the dreamer who cannot make anything concrete .
Too much of the limiting element , and you have the narrow minded individual who cannot imagine anything more serious in life than bottom lines and spread sheets .
Though it will make the Bill Mahers of the world wince , despair according to Kierkegaard is a lack of awareness of being a self or spirit .
A Freud with religious categories up his sleeves , the lyrical philosopher emphasized that the self is a slice of eternity .
While depression involves heavy burdensome feelings , despair is not correlated with any particular set of emotions but is instead marked by a desire to get rid of the self , or put another way , by an unwillingness to become who you fundamentally are .
This unwillingness often takes the form of flat out wanting to be someone else .
Kierkegaard writes :
An individual in despair despairs over something .
So it seems for a moment , but only for a moment ; in the same moment the true despair or despair in its true form shows itself .
In despairing over something , he really despaired over himself , and now he wants to be rid of himself .
For example , when the ambitious man whose slogan is “ Either Caesar or nothing ” does not get to be Caesar , he despairs over it … precisely because he did not get to be Caesar , he can not bear to be himself .
In America , there is endless talk of the importance of having a dream — that is , a dreamed - up self that you will to become : a millionaire , a surgeon , or maybe the next Dylan or George Clooney .
But master of suspicion that Kierkegaard was , he goes on to note that while the man who has failed to become Caesar would have been in seventh heaven if he had realized his dream , that state would have been just as despairing in another way — because in that giddy self - satisfied condition , he would never have come to grasp his true self .
On the issue of depression of which Kierkegaard and his entire family were very well acquainted , Kierkegaard could have been a reductionist .
He seems to have recognized that we could be born into the blues .
In 1846 , he sighed :
I am in the profoundest sense an unhappy individuality , riveted from the beginning to one or another suffering bordering on madness , a suffering which must have its basis in a mis-relation between my mind and body , for ( and this is the remarkable thing as well as my infinite encouragement ) it has no relation to my spirit , which on the contrary , because of the tension between my mind and body , has gained an uncommon resiliency .
The spirit is one thing , the psyche another :
The blues one thing , despair another .
How might Kierkegaard have parsed the distinction for the Doubting Thomas who will only believe what he can glean on an M.R.I .?
Perhaps he would describe it this way .
Each of us is subject to the weather of our own moods .
Clearly , Kierkegaard thought that the darkling sky of his inner life was very much due to his father ’s morbidity .
But the issue of spiritual health looms up with regard to the way that we relate to our emotional lives .
Again , for Kierkegaard , despair is not a feeling , but an attitude , a posture towards ourselves .
The man who did not become Caesar , the applicant refused by medical school , all experience profound disappointment .
But the spiritual travails only begin when that chagrin consumes the awareness that we are something more than our emotions and projects .
Does the depressive identify himself completely with his melancholy ?
Has the never ending blizzard of inexplicable sad thoughts caused him to give up on himself , and to see his suffering as a kind of fever without significance ?
If so , Kierkegaard would bid him to consider a spiritual consultation on his despair , to go along with his trip to the mental health clinic .
Update : Gordon Marino responds to readers on the classification of despair as a “ deadly sin . ”
Gordon Marino is professor of philosophy and director of the Hong / Kierkegaard Library at St. Olaf College in Northfield , Minn .
He is author of “ Kierkegaard in the Present Age , ” and co-editor of “ The Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard . ”
His new book , “ Ethics : The Essential Writings ” will be published by Random House this summer .
An active boxing trainer , Gordon covers boxing for the Wall Street Journal and is working on a book on boxing and philosophy .
How convenient for the judge and the media to paint Bernard Madoff as Mr. Evil , a uniquely venal blight on an otherwise responsible financial industry in which money is handled honestly and with transparency .
Madoff , sentenced Monday to 150 years in prison for bilking investors of billions , should be exhibit A in why the dark world of totally unregulated private money managers and hedge funds should be opened to the light of systematic government supervision .
Instead , he is being treated as an aberrant menace , with the danger removed once the devil incarnate , as his victims describe him , is locked up and the key thrown away .
For goodness ’ sake this was not some sort of weird outsider who flipped out , but rather a key developer of the modern system of electronic trading and a founder and chairman of Nasdaq .
Madoff often was called upon to help write the rules on financial regulation and therefore became quite expert at subverting them .
As Securities and Exchange Commission Inspector General H. David Kotz testified before Congress , the inspector general ’s office is looking into “ [t ] he extent to which the reputation and status of Bernard Madoff , and the fact that he served on SEC Advisory Committees , participated on securities industry boards and panels , and had social and professional relationships with SEC officials , may have affected commission decisions regarding investigations , examinations and inspections of his firm . ”
Those relationships were close ( the personal ties included the marriage of one of Madoff ’s nieces to an SEC official ) and stretched out over the decades during which Madoff was a major player on Wall Street .
At the very time back in 1999 when the SEC was being formally warned that a Madoff scam was under way , Madoff was consulting with then - SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. on regulatory matters .
When Levitt retired a year later , Madoff was quoted in the trades as paying tribute to him :
“ He brought all of us to the negotiating table time and time again , on a whole host of issues , and to a greater extent than any other SEC chairman . ”
Levitt wrote in a January 2009 opinion article in The Wall Street Journal , “ I knew Bernie Madoff and had no reason to believe he was not a legitimate market maker , nor did anyone at that time know he was acting as an adviser to outside investors . ”
Nor was he required to tell anyone .
And even if he had been , it ’s unlikely that part of Madoff ’s business would have been looked into .
In the deregulatory mania of the preceding two decades , it had been assumed that such managers did not need regulating , and funding for the SEC kept getting cut .
As Levitt noted in the article , it would only get worse :
“ Since 2002 , the number of investment advisers — such as Madoff Securities — has increased by 50 % .
Yet enforcement resources have been flat or even reduced . …
As a result , only about 10 % of investment advisers can expect to be examined every three years , and the goal of inspecting every adviser once every five years — laughably light oversight in its own right — has been abandoned . ”
Money for proper oversight was not allocated because the prevailing ideology regarding private investment firms — embraced by President Bill Clinton ever as fervently as President George W. Bush would later — was the gospel of radical financial deregulation , a practice that has landed us in the larger banking mess .
As with the trading in unregulated derivatives , all of the operations of private investor groups , such as hedge funds , were thought not to require government supervision because these were conducted by professional financiers dealing with sophisticated investors who knew what they were doing .
If the investment went south , it was on their dime and there would be no innocent victims .
As we saw with the collapse of AIG and now Madoff , that notion is false because private investment contracts can involve the resources of charitable organizations and pension funds and can end up costing the homes , savings and jobs of ordinary citizens who have no idea of which end of this arcane stuff is up .
When Levitt worked for Clinton as head of the SEC , he teamed up with Alan Greenspan , Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers to destroy what remained of financial service industry regulation imposed by President Franklin Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression .
In recent years Levitt , alone among that gang of four , has criticized that action and accepted some personal responsibility for the subsequent financial meltdown .
He was right again when he stated in his January article : “ The Madoff scandal should be a wake - up call for more consistent , uniform , and rigorous regulation of investment advising … the final prod for a fundamental reform of the financial regulatory structure . … ”
He gets it .
Let ’s hope that Congress does too and is not fooled by the argument of Wall Street lobbyists that Madoff was a lone rotten apple now safely discarded .
When my colleagues and I began doing research on ( everyday mind reading ) about 20 years ago , we expected to find that women would be more accurate than men at inferring the specific content of other people 's thoughts and feelings .
This expectation was based on the cultural stereotype of " women's . "
Surprisingly , however , when we tested for evidence of this expected difference , we kept failing to find any support for it .
In seven straight studies , the average accuracy score of our female participants was not significantly different from the average score of our male participants .
So where was the evidence for the presumed superiority of " women 's intuition " ?
We did n't find it in a study of the initial interactions of opposite - strangers .
We did n't find it in a study of the initial interactions of same - sex ( female - female versus male - male ) strangers .
We did n't find it in a study of all - male groups versus all - female groups .
And it failed to appear regardless of whether the study had been conducted in Texas , in North Carolina , or in New Zealand .
But just when we had begun to conclude that the stereotype of " women 's intuition " was a cultural myth , a very strange thing happened .
In the next three studies that we conducted in our lab at the University of Texas at Arlington , we found a significant gender difference favoring the female perceivers .
Seven studies in a row with no gender difference , and now three studies showing a difference .
What was going on here ?
When my graduate student colleague , Tiffany Graham , compared the methods of all 10 studies to see if she could find a change in the procedure that might help us understand what was going on , it took her less than a day to find the answer .
In the first seven studies , it was n't clear to the participants that their empathic ability was being assessed .
However , in the last three studies , we had changed the procedure .
Each time the participant had written down their inference about what the other person was thinking or feeling at a designated point in the interaction , we then asked the participant to rate how accurate they thought their empathic inference was .
In retrospect , it seemed likely that the effect of asking them to rate the accuracy of their empathic inferences was to make clear to them that we were measuring their empathic ability -- an ability at which women ( according to the women 's intuition stereotype ) are supposed to excel .
To check the plausibility of this interpretation , we conducted a new study using the " old " procedure , and the gender difference again failed to appear .
We then conducted another new study using the " new " procedure ( the one requiring self - ratings of empathic accuracy ) and the significant gender difference re-appeared .
Aha !
We could " turn off " the gender difference by removing the cue that signalled that this was an empathic ability task , and we could " turn on " the same difference by restoring that cue .
This pattern of results suggested to us that although the average woman does n't have more empathic ability than the average man , we could create a heightened level of in the women by reminding them that the task was one in which women should excel .
When we re-analyzed our findings with this hypothesis in mind , we found strong evidence that the gender difference we had occasionally observed was indeed based on differential motivation rather than differential ability .
Women , on average , do n't have greater empathic ability than men , but they do try harder to live up to their stereotype in situations in which they are reminded of it .
At this point , two creative researchers at the University of Oregon , Kristi Klein and Sara Hodges , decided to conduct a study in which they would cue both men and women that they were working on an empathy - related task .
However , to see if they could bring men's motivation up to the level of the women's in the study , they paid the participants in one condition of their study to be as empathically accurate as possible !
What did they find ?
In the condition where no payment was offered but the participants were reminded that they were working on an empathy - relevant task , the women did significantly better than the men ( just as my colleagues and I had found when we provided the participants with a similar cue ) .
However , when the same reminder was given but the participants were also paid to be as accurate as possible , the men's performance matched that of the women , suggesting that Klein and Hodges had found an incentive ( money ) that would motivate men as strongly as the women 's intuition stereotype was able to motivate the women .
As Klein and Hodges concluded at the end of the article reporting their research , men as a group are n't poor " everyday mind readers " ; they are simply unmotivated ones .
If you want men to show you how well they can compete with women in " reading " other people 's minds , just pay them for it !
For a more complete account of this research , see Chapter 6 of Everyday Mind Reading , by William Ickes ( Prometheus Books , 2003 ) .
This week we ’ve seen three usually staid mainstream media outlets – Newsweek Magazine , the PBS NewsHour with Jim Lehrer , and FOX Business News – examining the growing movement in California and nationwide to discuss the inevitable re-legalization of cannabis in America .
[ UPDATE : Apparently the FOX Business Channel ( not FOX News ) will have a series called “ High Noon ” beginning Monday at Noon ET / 9 am PT . ]
We begin with the PBS NewsHour and their fine report featuring the Honorable Rebecca Kaplan from the Oakland City Council and Richard Lee , the founder of Oaksterdam University .
For balance ( I suppose ) they also interview the police chief of El Cerrito , California , who provides the obligatory doses of “ reefer madness ” at around the 5:00 mark .
Once again , I have to ask the cop at the end of the piece :
How many people who do n’t smoke pot now are going to start smoking pot once it is legal , and how much is that going to cost ?
Whatever it is , make the tax on pot equal to that amount , minus the expenditures we ’ll save on not arresting people and sending helicopters on weeding missions , and we ’ve covered the costs !
( Actually , since Miron estimates that we ’d reap in revenues and savings around $ 14 billion annually from legalized pot nationally , you have to convince us that the brand new legal pot smokers who are n’t already smoking now would cost society more than that . )
We ’re still trying to figure out how you inject marijuana ( from Newsweek photo essay on pot propaganda )
That stupid retort that legal weed will cost society more than the taxes only works if you believe that nobody is smoking weed now and suddenly when it ’s legal , everyone will smoke weed .
22,000,000 PEOPLE ARE SMOKING WEED THIS YEAR ALREADY !
Whatever that costs us as a society , we ’re already paying NOW without taking in any tax money !
Cannabis does not “ add another vice ” to tobacco and alcohol that costs our society so much more than their taxes bring in .
Alcohol and tobacco use create huge medical bills and death .
Cannabis does not .
With three legal choices and cannabis being obviously safest , we ’ll cut costs as people choose it over alcohol and tobacco , and raise tax revenues that are currently going to black marketeers .
Read more about Newsweek and FOX Business News after the break …
Next we have the series of article in Newsweek , which has seemingly devoted an entire issue to the subject of legalization .
In “ Welcome to Potopia ” , they describe the section of Oakland known as Oaksterdam as “ a model for what a legalized - drug America could look like . ”
Dr. Nora Volkow from NIDA and Prof. Mark Kleiman from UCLA are cited to provide the necessary balance , with the typical warnings that “ It ’s certainly true that this is not your grandfather ’s pot , ” as if our grandfathers were smoking nothing but ditchweed in the 1960’s .
( Sorry , but Sgt. Pepper and Dark Side of the Moon were not composed by nor appreciated by people smoking ditchweed . )
Our own Paul Armentano is quoted as well :
The fact that we now are debating it — at least in some parts of the country — is the result of a number of forces that , as MacCoun puts it , have created the perfect pot storm : the failure of the War on Drugs , the growing death toll of murderous drug cartels , pop culture , the economy , and a generation of voters that have simply grown up around the stuff .
Today there are pot television shows and frequent references to the drug in film , music , and books .
And everyone from the president to the most successful athlete in modern history has talked about smoking it at one point or another .
“ Whether it ’s the economy or Obama or Michael Phelps , I think all of these things have really worked to galvanize the public , ” says Paul Armentano , the deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws and the coauthor of a new book , Marijuana Is Safer ; So Why Are We Driving People to Drink ?
” At the very least , it ’s started a national conversation . ”
Newsweek also looks at the “ green rush ” in Los Angeles County in a piece called “ The Wild West of Weed ” and how District Attorney Cooley says “ about 100 % ” of the dispensaries are illegal and that “ the time is right to deal with this problem . ”
Weed dealer turned dispensary owner Jason Beck tells his story of suffering through a DEA “ smash - n - grab ” raid where the cops were trapped in his store thanks to all the bulletproof glass and “ man traps ” he had installed for security .
“ If we were real gangsta drug dealers , we could have sniped them all out , ” Beck says , lamenting how the DEA destroyed all his security equipment and how $ 12,500 in cash just mysteriously disappeared .
The Newsweek series winds up with a look at Drug Policy Alliance ’s Ethan Nadelmann , called “ The Pro - Drug Czar ” ( a term I ’d bet he ’d disagree with … he ’s not “ pro-drugs ” , he ’s “ anti-prohibition ” ) .
Ethan gives the readers some of the best sound bites on how the drug war is impacting our prisons , saying “ We lock up more people on drug charges than all of Western Europe locks up for everything , and they have 100 million more people than we do .
We have less than 5 percent of the world ’s population but we have almost 25 percent of the world ’s incarcerated population .
We rank first in the world in per capita incarceration , and the drug war is the No. 1 driving factor . ”
Then this morning we are told the folks over at Fox Business News are beginning a series looking at the legalization wave in America .
There are no stories or videos to post yet , but you can be sure that when there are , we ’ll report on them here at NORML .
The remarkable thing in these series of news stories are not that the mainstream media is covering the legalization issue , it is how they are covering the issue .
The discussion is no longer “ what about the children ? !? ” and the doom - and - gloom warnings of heroin in the 7 - Elevens if we legalize cannabis .
The discussion now focuses on the economic viability of the cannabis market and the 40 - year - long failure of the War on ( Certain American Citizens Using Non-Pharmaceutical , Non-Alcoholic , Tobacco - Free ) Drugs™ to do anything to impede that market .
The pot -pun headlines are fading away and the ledes of the stories are tilted favorably toward our issue .
In the past the government anti-pot propaganda dominated the story and if any contrary view was even broached , it was reformers being thrown a bone deep in the closing paragraphs to offer a rebuttal that was often couched in derogatory , “ here ’s what the stoners say ” language .
Now our side is presented as the rational , common - sense , business - savvy side of the issue with the hysterical law enforcement propaganda given the end - of - article quotes , often couched in desperate , “ here ’s what the reefer mad say ” language .
America is becoming convinced that legalization of cannabis makes sense from a public health , public safety , and economic standpoint .
And we have n’t even begun bringing up how much money industrial hemp would bring us in a legalized cannabis world …

Cortado 0.5.1 release
The Cortado java applet is a pure java implementation of a Theora decoder .
Originally developed by the folks at Fluendo S.A. , and subsequently developed by Wikimedia , upstream stewardship was recently passed to Xiph.org .
Cortado has been used for many years as a way to support free media content on the web , and is still an important component as a fallback for browsers which do n't yet support Ogg audio and video streams natively .
The new maintenance team have now made their second update release of Cortado .
Since the last official Fluendo release , version 0.5.1 adds
Support for baseline Theora features used by the libtheora 1.1 encoder .
Better and faster display code .
Basic support for Ogg Kate subtitles .
Various other bug and robustness fixes .
Please visit the Cortado homepage for more information , including downloads and examples of how to use the applet .
Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release .
It was a real community effort .
Theora 1.1.1 release
We 've made a follow - up point release to new stable release .
This fixes some issues with the inline assembly used by the MSVC compiler and various minor build issues .
There are no other significant changes .
Thanks to everyone who 's tested and given us feedback in the last week !
Theora 1.1 " Thusnelda " release
After over a month of public testing , we 're pleased to declare our 1.1 rewrite of libtheora stable .
This is the reference implementation for the Theora video codec .
Source code for libtheora 1.1.0 is available now , and will be incorporated in major Theora - supporting applications soon .
What 's so great about the 1.1 release ?
The highlights are :
Better - looking videos or
or Smaller files at the same quality .
Much faster decoder .
Two - pass mode for making files just the size you want them .
for making files just the size you want them .
Rigid bitrate controls trade off quality for the needs of live streaming applications .
This release incorporates all the work we 've been doing over the last year , and the encoder has been completely rewritten , although some of the code had its genesis way back in 2003 .
It also brings substantial performance and robustness improvments to the 1.0 decoder .
This release is API and ABI compatible with the 1.0 stable release and can be used as a drop in replacement , although some changes are needed to take advantage of new encoder features like two - pass .
We recommend upgrading to all our users .
Rate - control has been substantially overhauled from the 1.0 release .
The new rate control module hits its target much more accurately and obeys strict buffer constraints , including dropping frames if necessary .
The latter is needed to enable live streaming without disconnecting users or pausing to buffer during sudden motion .
Obeying these constraints can yield substantially worse quality than the 1.0 encoder , whose rate control did not obey any such constraints , and often landed only in the vague neighborhood of the desired rate target .
The new -- soft - target option can relax a few of these constraints , but the new two - pass rate control mode gives quality approaching full " constant quality " mode with a predictable output size .
This should be the preferred encoding method when not doing live streaming .
Two - pass may also be used with finite buffer constraints , for non-live streaming .
Here is a list of some of the technical improvements in the 1.1 encoder .
If you have been following Monty 's demo pages , many of these will be familiar to you .
Rate - distortion optimization , which leads to Better mode decision Better quantization decisions
Most coding decisions only use an approximation of the full RDO process for speed reasons , but casting this in a proper RDO framework eliminates vast swaths of heuristics and fragile thresholds from the 1.0 encoder .
Better motion search
The new motion search generates better results in less time , and does not suffer from CPU spikes under heavy motion like the 1.0 encoder 's did .
Better fDCT
The 1.0 encoder 's forward transform was not well - matched to the inverse DCT used in the decoder , and was as a result responsible for substantial loss of detail and texture at high rates .
It has been replaced with a forward DCT that gives much smaller round - trip error .
The inverse DCT in the decoder remains unchanged , for compatibility .
Adaptive quantization
The bitstream specification has supported changing the quantizer on a block - by - block basis since it was first published in 2004 , however only an unreleased proof - of - concept encoder made use of this facility .
The 1.1 encoder now uses it to allocate bits more effectively within a frame , giving improved quality at higher rates .
Better quantization matrices
The new matrices give much less ringing and mosquito noise at low rates , substantially improving the appearance of high - contrast edges ( e.g. , text ) .
A real rate - control module
As mentioned above , the new rate control actually meets its targets , can enforce hard buffer constraints , and has a two - pass mode to allow it to plan allocation decisions in advance .
Expanded rate - control API
It is now possible to change the target quality , bitrate , buffer delay , and keyframe interval in the while encoding .
This gives an application using libtheora much more control over the final output .
Explicit variable frame rate support in the encoder A new API allows an application to cheaply insert duplicate frames to maintain A - V sync during live streaming or for hybrid 24/30 fps content .
The decoder still operates at a fixed frame rate , but can report these duplicates to the application , allowing it to skip expensive processing .
Support for 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 video
As with adaptive quantization , the specification has always supported the less common 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 chroma subsamplings , useful for high contrast material like screencasts and special effects precursors .
The 1.0 decoder supported these subsamplings properly .
However , the 1.0 encoder could n't produce streams in these formats .
They are now supported in the 1.1 encoder .
There are many other improvements in this release .
The codebase is substantially smaller , the examples have all been ported to the 1.x API , the MSVC assembly is now in sync with the gcc assembly , and much more .
We strongly encourage all our users to upgrade .
This is not the end of the story , however .
We are continuing to work on encoder improvements , and have made significant progress on optimizing the decoder on ARM and TI C64x DSP processors , important for Theora playback on mobile devices .
Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release , and especially to the Mozilla Foundation , the Wikimedia Foundation , Red Hat , Inc. and private donors who supported this work .
Third beta release
Another week , another release .
Like the last one , the new beta release of the encoder rewrite fixes some problems with the new bitrate management .
If you had trouble with uneven quality with previous 1.1 releases , please give this one a try ; the behaviour is better .
Second beta release
A week after the first beta release of the " Thusnelda " encoder for the Theora format , Xiph.org has released a second beta .
This version improves bitrate management with some hard - to - encode files .
It also contains build system fixes and a few polishing changes .
First beta release of the new encoder
Xiph .
Org is pleased to announce the first beta release of our reference implementation of the free Theora video format , codename " Thusnelda " .
This release incorporates extensive changes to the encoder 's rate control .
The encoder is both more configurable and functions better in all configurations .
The new options include support for two - pass encoding , the ability to change the bitrate and quality targets dynamically during an encode , and the ability to drop frames to meet very low bitrate targets , all commonly - requested features .
This release includes all the major features we intend for 1.1 release .
Please give it a try .
We 're particularly interested in sequences it does poorly on , and feedback from framework and applications developers on the new two - pass api .
For details of how to use the two - pass mode , please check the code in the examples directory .
Many thanks to Red Hat and the Mozilla Foundation , who supported this work .
Firefox 3.5 released with native Theora support

Final 1.0 release imminent ; 1.0 release candidate 2 now available
The Xiph .
Org Foundation is pleased to announce the second release candidate of libtheora 1.0 .
This second release candidate corrects all bugs found in final testing of the first release candidate , and will become 1.0 final in one week if no new ' blockers ' are found .
Full source downloads of the second release candidate are currently at http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora.
Mozilla commits support for Theora in Firefox
The Xiph .
Org Foundation and the Mozilla Foundation share the common goal of keeping the Web free and open for everyone , so it did not come as a surprise when Mozilla 's Chris Blizzard announced that the upcoming Firefox 3.1 will support both Ogg Theora and Vorbis , alongside the HTML 5's < video > element .
This announcement paves the way for web developers to break away from proprietary media technologies .
For the average user it means posting , hosting and playing video / audio data will become as easy an activity as it currently is for images .
For private companies adopting these open standards it means getting rid off the middle man and his licensing fees .
With the < video > element and Theora , exciting development possibilities such as SVG desktops or annotated media will also be possible , creating new ways of interacting with video online .
The adoption rate of this online revolution by other browsers soon joining the effort will help start a new age for multimedia .
Be part of it .
Theora 1.0 beta3 released
This is the third beta release toward our first stable implementation of the reference library .
This release includes new separate encoder and decoder libraries supporting the new - style API based on theora - exp .
Also included are assembly optimizations for gcc and MSVC builds , better documentation , general robustness and bug fixes .
Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release .
Please give it a try and report any remaining issues .
Theora 1.0 beta2 released
This is the second beta release toward , following three weeks after beta 1 .
This release fixes some bugs and improves the specification document .
We recommend upgrading to all users .
Theora 1.0 beta1 released
Moving out of alpha status Theora is now available as version 1.0 beta1 .
This release features many changes since alpha7 - for example the beta1 decoder is a complete rewrite supporting the whole Theora specification .

Cinelerra supports distributed theora encoding
Cinelerra is a well known nonlinear video editor with support for renderfarms , enabiling use of distributed cpu power to do faster rendering .
A year after getting import and export support for theora , Cinelerra now has distributed theora encoding support , which makes theora content creation much faster .
Thanks to Andraz Tori for this .
libtheora 1.0 alpha6 release
We 're pleased to announce a new release of the libtheora reference implemenation .
This is an incremental update over alpha 5 , consisting primarily of bug fixes and a merge of the encoder optimizations from the theora - mmx branch .
Changes since the 1.0 alpha 5 release :
Merge theora - mmx simd acceleration ( x86_32 and x86_64 )
Major RTP payload specification update
Minor format specification updates
Fix some spurious calls to free ( ) instead of _ogg_free ( )
Fix invalid array indexing in PixelLineSearch ( )
Improve robustness against invalid input
General warning cleanup
The offset_y member now means what every application thought it meant ( offset from the top ) .
This will mean some old files ( those with a non-centered image created with a buggy encoder ) will display differently .
Thanks to everyone who contributed !

Andrey Filippov has an article on his FPGA Theora encoder in Xcell Journal this month .
While the earlier article at LinuxDevices focussed on the software , this one covers in more detail the hardware and use of the FPGA to achieve the elphel camera 's remarkable encoding speed .
Andrey and other hackers will be demonstrating the cameras at the Open Source Forum in Moscow next weekend .
Theora decoder ported to C #
Ogre developer pjcast has a C# port of the Theora decoder , based primarily on the JOrbis and Cortado java decoders .
He reports both video and sound are working , and performance is pretty good .
The decoder components should be usable under any of the C# frameworks , but the example playback application is still a bit rough and not portable outside MS Windows .
A development snapshot is available for those who would like to try out the code .
Fedora Conference Video
Video from the Fedora Users & Develper Conference last month in Boston is up in Theora format .
The files are available here , or you can get a complete torrents of the Developer and User tracks .
Versions with only Vorbis audio are also linked .
It 's great to see stuff like this going up .
Update as of 20050405 , the direct file links no longer work , but the torrent is still available .
In related news , Seth Nickell has video of the experimental Luminocity OpenGL compositing engine and window manager in Theora .
Video screenshots !
Quite cool .
Elphel FPGA camera encodes Theora
Andrey Filippov has an article today on LinuxDevices describing his open source hardware theora encoder , embedded in the reconfigurable network camera he designed , which is also open source .
Now this is what computing should be like !

Fluendo funds RTP streaming of Theora and Vorbis
Streaming media startup Fluendo.com announced today they will be funding a spec and reference implementation for encapsulation of Theora video and Vorbis audio over the RTP streaming protocol , important for multicast , digital broadcast , and conferencing applications .
A press release was issued this morning .
While HTTP streaming of Ogg - encapsulated multimedia has been supported for most of the history of our free codecs , RTP support is an oft - requested feature that we 've never had a good solution for .
We 're very happy to see Fluendo driving this new work .
Phil Kerr will be managing the developement of the new drafts .
The development process is open , with discussion taking place in the new xiph - rtp mailing list .
Please join if you 're interested in these issues .
Theora encoder , Katiuska 0.6.1 , released

Theora I bitstream freeze
Big news .
The Theora I bitstream format is now frozen !
This means it 's safe to start distributing videos in the theora format .
Files produced by the alpha 3 reference encoder will be supported by all future decoders .
Beta 1 was going to be the official freeze point , but was delayed by continuing work on the draft specification document ; however we have reviewed enough of the design in writing the spec that we no longer need to reserve the right to make corrections to the encoder behavior .
So go ahead , there 's no reason to delay adopting a free alternative any more !
Theora alpha 3 release
We 're pleased to announce the alpha 3 release of the theora reference implementation .
The main differences over alpha 2 :
The encoded image has been flipped to match the sense used in VP3 , with the origin at the lower left .
This allows lossless transcoding of VP3 content .
The decoder data tables included in the bitstream header are more complete and have more scope for future encoder improvements .
Some experimental tools are available in the win32 directory , including a transcoder for avi vp3 files .
We hope there were be no more incompatible bitstream changes , but as with previous alpha releases we make no promises that the format will not change again .
Experimental playback support is now available ( separately ) for Helix / Realplayer 10 , Xine and mplayer ; you might look at those if you want a more full - featured player .
Be sure to use an alpha - 3 compatible version .
Source now in subversion
We 've switched our version control system to subversion from cvs , along with all the other Xiph .
Org Foundation projects .
Please make a fresh checkout if you 're following the development tree :
svn checkout http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/theora
as cvs is no longer updated .
You can also mount the dav url directly on your desktop for read - only access .
See our instruction page for details .
You can find more information about this great new tool at definitive reference book 's website .
Status update
There has n't been much progress of late .
Derf has been working on a new encoder , and in doing so came up with some suggested bitstreams changes to increase the scope for future encoder improvements .
These will be integrated into the reference encoder and released as ' alpha 3 ' for testing .
The main hold - up for the beta release is still a draft spec .
Everyone 's waiting for this because it means the format will be frozen and encoded files will be supported by future versions of the reference implementation .
So if you want to help things along pull out the code and help with the documentation , or donate something to help pay for the work .
Theora alpha 2 release
The libtheora reference implementation has reached its ' alpha 2 ' milestone .
A lot of bugs have been fixed and new features added , including all the planned changes to the bitsteams format .
This is more of an internal milestone than a public release , but we are making a source tarball available for convenience .
Nevertheless we recommend using the svn version if possible .
This release also requires svn libogg and libvorbis to compile ; you might try the svn nightly tarball if you do n't already have these checked out .
You will need to build and install the ' ogg ' and ' vorbis ' modules .
VP3 Legacy Codec binaries
Mauricio Piacentini has been maintaining the original VP32 sources upon which theora is based .
He 's pooling his efforts with Xiph a bit and has decided to keep his work in xiph.org svn , in the ' vp32 ' module where the code was originally released .
We hope this will help concentrate efforts related to theora and bring additional focus to both projects .
He is also making his binary builds for Quicktime 6 and Video for Windows available on this site .
Please visit the legacy VP3 page for file links and complete information .
Status update
Things have been slow for some time , so we just wanted to say what 's been happening .
Monty 's been busy with unrelated contract work since finishing the zero-copy libogg , and no one has stepped up to act as maintainer in the meantime .
We 've been working on a wiki todo for theora and for xiph generally .
So feel free to look ( and contribute ) there .
Test Suite
We 've posted a test suite for your encoding pleasure .
Feel free to post comments and questions to the Theora mailing lists .
Robot Roll Call
The first part of Theora Alpha Two , the delicious Video Layer FAQ is now available on the FAQ page , written by Dan Miller .
The second part is libogg hacking , the results of which will be posted just a little after December 27th .
Alpha
Two is really more of an informational release than a big downloadable install - fest , so do n't fire up the testbeds just yet .
Welcome to theora.org , the official website for Theora , a video codec and integration project maintained and supported by the Xiph .
Org Foundation for the benefit of all humankind .
What is Theora ?
Theora will be a video codec that builds upon On2's VP3 codec .
While Vorbis has reached 1.0 , Theora is currently being integrated into the Ogg multimedia framework , as well as being optimized from the VP3 codebase at its heart .
Theora will be released in June of 2003 , with three major milestones , the first being released today , September 25th , 2002 .
Today 's piece is available for download in the ' theora ' module of the Xiph .
Org FoundationSVN repository , as well as a UNIX tarball available here .
There 's a lot of useful information under the hood , so please have a look around by using the navigation links at the top of the page .
If there 's anything you think that we need on this page , please contact us and let us know what you 'd like to see .
For the legal terms on the usage of the VP3 codec , please check out the SVN page .

The federal government has accelerated its $ 16 million dollar PR campaign to brainwash and coerce increasingly suspicious Americans into taking the swine flu vaccine by weaving their propaganda into a popular pre-school show for children currently airing on PBS Kids .
Sid the Science Kid is a half - hour series produced by Jim Henson Productions and KCET in Los Angeles , California .
The program is bankrolled in part by The Boeing Company , a titan of the military - industrial complex .
During an episode of the show set to air on Monday , the computer - generated characters are shown dancing around and singing about how their are taking their flu vaccine .
Indeed , the entire episode is devoted to pro-vaccine propaganda and was created in association with Health and Human Services .
The episode is entitled , “ Getting a Shot : You can do it ! ”
According to a press release , “ Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius , Education Secretary Arne Duncan , and Lisa Henson , CEO of the Jim Henson Company , will join Washington - area school children for a screening of the new “ Sid the Science Kid ” special episode on the flu at the U.S. Department of Education Auditorium . ”
Children will also be directed to the Sid the Science Kid website to play games focused around the issue of vaccines .
“ In this special episode , Sid explains how vaccines work and shows millions of children what they can do to prevent the spread of the flu , ” said Secretary Sebelius .
“ Sid will be a great messenger as we continue to find new and creative ways to reach out to children , adults , and families about how to stay healthy during flu season . ”
As we have reported , the government is openly embedding propaganda about its health care agenda into the plots of major network shows all this week .
We also discovered a separate example of almost subliminal brainwashing where the watching audience are told to get the flu shot via a deceptive and insidious insert during an episode of FlashForward , a sci- fi series currently airing on ABC .
What ‘ Sid the Science Kid , ’ the pharmaceutical lobby and Kathleen Sebelius wo n’t tell you about the swine flu vaccine is that children are already dying after taking similar vaccines , that healthy young women are getting brain disorders after being injected with flu vaccines , that the H1N1 shot contains dangerous additives like mercury which cause autism , and that a child is 40 times more likely to be struck by lightning than have their life saved by a swine flu vaccine .
While children are having this crap shoved down their throats on television , the New York Times ‘ educational division is teaching them in schools across the country that openly admitted facts about the dangers of the swine flu vaccine are all in fact “ myths ” .
Some of the “ myths ” claimed by the Times include manifestly provable facts such as the potential that flu shots will have side - effects .
This is clearly stated on the inserts of vaccine batches by the pharmaceutical companies themselves , but the NY Times is teaching children in American schools that it is a myth !
According to the Times , it is also a myth that any of the batches of H1N1 vaccine contain thimerosal , a mercury based preservative , despite the fact that this again is openly admitted by the pharmaceutical companies who produce the vaccines .
If none of the vaccines contained mercury , then maybe the NY Times can tell us why top officials in the German government , including Chancellor Angela Merkel , as well as German soldiers , have been given an additive - free version of the vaccine that does n’t contain thimerosal ?
With rapidly expanding numbers of parents refusing to allow their children to take the seasonal or swine flu shot , the government has a problem on its hands having already bought over 300 million doses of the vaccine .
This is manifesting itself in the form of bellicose and fearmongering propaganda being gleefully spewed out by the compliant networks as the feds start to panic about the fact that the idiot public are waking up to the real agenda behind the toxic vaccines and the record windfall profits currently being reaped by pharmaceutical companies who are laughing all the way to the bank .

Browser based free free html5 live stream player radio to listen all radio streams from SHOUTcast Internet - Radio .
Selection of 77,000 + online radio stations from 150 countries around the globe .
SHOUTcast is a complete suite of Sofware to power internet radio into the future .
SHOUTcast lets you transmit your audio to listeners around the world .
Join more than 77,000 stations using SHOUTcast right now .
SHOUTcast DNAS is cross-platform proprietary software for streaming media over the Internet .
The software , developed by Nullsoft , is available free of charge .
It allows digital audio content , primarily in MP3 or High - Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding format , to be broadcast to and from media player software , enabling the creation of Internet radio " stations " .
The most common use of SHOUTcast is for creating or listening to Internet audio broadcasts ; however , video streams exist as well .
Some traditional radio stations use SHOUTcast to extend their presence onto the Web.
SHOUTcast Radio is a related website which provides a directory of SHOUTcast stations .
Software
The SHOUTcast software uses a client–server model , with each component communicating via a network protocol that intermingles audio or video data with metadata such as song titles and the station name .
It uses HTTP as a transport protocol .
Although multicast was planned , it was never developed .
SHOUTcast servers and clients are available for FreeBSD , Linux , macOS , Microsoft Windows , and Solaris .
Client - only versions exist for Android , BlackBerry OS , iOS ( iPad , iPhone ) , Palm OS and webOS ( Radio Hibiki ) , PlayStation Portable , Windows Mobile , Symbian S60 and UIQ , Nintendo DS ( DSOrganize ) , and Wii .
The output format is supported by multiple clients , including Nullsoft 's own Winamp as well as Amarok , Exaile , foobar2000 , iTunes , Songbird , Totem , XMMS , and Zinf .
If the client does not support the SHOUTcast protocol , then the SHOUTcast server sends the stream without the metadata thus allowing it to be heard / viewed in clients like Windows Media Player .
SHOUTcast servers are usually linked to by means of playlist files , which are small text files ( usually with extensions .pls or .m3u ) that contain the URL of the SHOUTcast server .
When that URL is visited in a Web browser which identifies itself as Mozilla - compatible ( as most do ) , the server will return a generated SHOUTcast server info / status page , rather than streaming audio .
Stations
A feature of SHOUTcast servers is the ability to optionally publish server information , including the current number of listeners , in a directory of stations that AOL maintains on the SHOUTcast website .
Site visitors can pick a station to listen to and download a playlist file for use in their own SHOUTcast - capable media player .
In September 2008 , AOL redesigned the SHOUTcast website , which had been roughly the same since 2000 .
In 2010 , SHOUTcast again redesigned it with more of an AOL look .
As part of the redesign , the directory and services were rebranded as " SHOUTcast Radio " , rather than " SHOUTcast Streaming Technology . "
The redesign included a fully functional option to view the site and directory with the old layout .
At the time VideoLAN said that AOL 's license for use of the SHOUTcast Radio servers would “ us to integrate the spyware and adware based Shoutcast Radio Toolbar inside your browser . ” and thus prevents open source software from using the SHOUTcast Radio servers .
Popularity
SHOUTcast said in 2011 that up to 900,000 concurrent listeners could be seen on public streams during peak hours .
The audience on private streams is unknown .
The maximum and minimum number of listeners fluctuates widely during a day , with roughly three times as many listeners during peak hours as at low use times .
As of May 2014 SHOUTcast Radio included over 50,000 stations .
As lawmakers begin their month - long recess this week , conservatives are making a concerted effort to derail town hall meetings being held by Democrats on health care reform across the country , according to the Center for American Progress .
Last week ,
The Progress Report obtained a leaked memo from a volunteer with Tea Party Patriots , a website sponsored by Americans for Prosperity ( AFP ) ( led by a former associate of Jack Abramoff ) and FreedomWorks ( led by former Republican Majority Leader and current lobbyist Dick Armey ) .
The memo detailed how town hall goers should infiltrate meetings and harass Democratic members of Congress .
The memo said activists should “ stand up and shout out and sit right back down ” so the representative is “ made to feel that a majority , and if not , a significant portion of at least the audience , opposes the socialist agenda of Washington . ”
The overall goal , said the memo , is to “ rattle ” the elected official . [ … ]
The published memos are similar to talking points being distributed by FreedomWorks that push an anti-health reform assault all summer .
Patients United , a front group maintained by AFP , is busing people all over the country to protest health care reform .
America ’s Health Insurance Plans , the trade group and lobbying juggernaut representing the health insurance industry , is also sending staffers to monitor town halls in 30 states .
Meanwhile , Conservatives for Patients ’ Rights ( CPR ) , led by disgraced hospital executive Rick Scott , is running a national campaign against a public health care option . [ … ]
Two nights ago , Reps. Steve Kagen ( D - WI ) and Steve Driehaus ( D - OH ) had to face down angry mobs .
Kagen , whose town hall was targeted by the Wisconsin chapter of AFP , was “ repeatedly disrupted ” by “ incomprehensible ” shrieks and shouts from conservatives .
I personally do n’t have any problem with conservatives protesting policies that they do not agree with .
What I do take issue with however is the fact that these demonstrations are being to at least some extent orchestrated and pushed by the insurance industry and other health care lobbyists that have a strong financial stake in maintaining the despicable status quo .
Also , being on the right side of the issue is important .
While these conservative protesters may be genuinely concerned about greater government involvment in health care , I think they are either incredibly selfish ( in not wanting to help those who are unnecessarily suffering and dying due to the failings of our current system ) or more likely simply ill - informed on this issue .
Even a brief look at the dismal state of the health care system in the U.S. should make the need for a far more massive overhaul than the Democrats are currently proposing obvious .
Here are just a few statistics that was I able to quickly throw together :
Visit Healthcare - NOW !
or Physicians for a National Health Program to learn more about what I think is truly needed in this country : Single - payer national health insurance .
And if you care about real reform , make your voice heard at these meetings as well .

Developing an HIV vaccine has proved difficult
Two powerful new antibodies to HIV have been found which could aid development of a vaccine , researchers say .
Researchers , led by the International Aids Vaccine Initiative ( IAVI ) , say the discovery reveals a potential new Achilles heel in the virus 's defences .
The antibodies are the first of their type to be identified in more than a decade , and the first to be isolated from donors in developing countries .
Details of the breakthrough feature in the journal Science .
The researchers hope it could lead to more similar antibodies being found , which in turn could aid the hunt for an effective HIV vaccine .
Identifying antibodies that act against a broad range of HIV types will be critical for the development of an effective vaccine
Keith Alcorn
NAM Wayne Koff , of the IAVI , said : " The findings themselves are an exciting advance toward the goal of an effective Aids vaccine because now we 've got a new , potentially better target on HIV to focus our efforts for vaccine design .
" And having identified this one , we 're set up to find more , which should further accelerate global efforts in Aids vaccine development . "
The new antibodies - broadly neutralising antibodies - are produced by a minority of people with HIV .
They are distinct from other antibodies to HIV because they neutralise a high percentage of the many types of HIV in circulation worldwide .
It is widely believed that to prevent HIV infection a vaccine would need to teach the body to produce these powerful antibodies before exposure to the virus .
Animal experiments suggest that conceptually such a vaccine would work .
Before this finding only four antibodies to HIV had been discovered that were widely agreed to be broadly neutralising .
However , all four worked by binding to a place on HIV that has proven difficult for vaccine - makers to exploit .
Accessible target
The latest duo are potentially much more useful because they bind to the virus at sites which scientists believe are more accessible .
In theory that should make it easier to produce a vaccine which could stimulate the body to start producing these key antibodies .
And because the antibodies are very powerful they would not have to be produced in very large quantities to confer protection .
The two new antibodies target one of the proteins that form a spike used by HIV to infect cells .
These proteins are highly - variable and thus difficult for the immune system to attack .
But the new antibodies target an area of one protein that does not change .
Keith Alcorn , of the HIV information service NAM , said : " Identifying antibodies that act against a broad range of HIV types will be critical for the development of an effective vaccine .
" We need to remember that this is an early stage of research .
" HIV vaccine research will be a long - term effort and we certainly should n't expect these findings to lead to a vaccine in a few years .
" A lot more work on antibodies and vaccine design is going to be needed to come up with vaccines that can be put into clinical trials . "
The IAVI team joined forces with the Scripps Research Institute , and the biotechnology companies Theraclone Sciences and Monogram Biosciences on the project .

I am slowly rewriting and moving some of my posts from my old blog to Music Think Tank .
My apologies to those of you that do n’t like getting reruns in your newsreader .
The day the band ( the company ) was formed , band members voted to split ownership evenly ; now you find yourself doing much more work or creating far more value than your bandmates .
Perhaps you started out as a band , but the band has also become a business .
You do n’t want to appear greedy and it ’s not your style to change the rules once the game has started .
However it does n’t seem fair that everyone benefits evenly when you ’re doing more work than everyone else .
This is one of the most common problems in small businesses - ownership and reward is divided evenly , but the work and / or the value creating capability are not .
Here are eleven easy steps to fix the problem .
Step One - Form a plan and create a presentation of your plan .
Read the following ten steps and create a plan .
Your plan will call for a simple presentation of some basic math .
Before revealing the plan to anyone , do the plan math yourself first ( download this spreadsheet - further explained below ) .
Determine if your plan is fair and just by presenting your plan to an outside businessperson that can impartially advise you .
When you present your plan , consider asking a facilitator / advisor or an impartial / experienced mediator to attend the meeting (s ) with your bandmates .
The no -boyfriend / girlfriend , no - husband / wife rule should be enforced on the day (s ) of the meeting (s ) .
Step Two - Valuate the band .
Days or even weeks prior to presenting your plan , come to an agreement on the present financial value of the band / business .
The band should do this annually .
It ’s a great exercise for bands that are looking for investors , for bands that are looking for a record deal , and for artists that may be compensating others with equity .
( Tip - assign a value to each fan , to each song and to your brand , or multiply your annual profits ( revenue minus expenses ) by 5 . )
I am going to call this value the Band Value ( used in the calculations below ) .
Step Three - Revisit day one .
Revisit the day you divided ownership evenly .
Sit down with the band and talk about that day .
List all of the things that were collectively on your agendas when you formed the band .
If that list had more than five things on it , you planned more than most .
Have fun
Rehearse as needed
Record an album
Put on a great live show
Build a fan base
When you created the day - one list , dividing ownership evenly made perfect sense , and if 100 % of your current activities were still confined to that list … it still makes perfect sense .
However something happened since day one , the list has grown to ninety - five things and you ’re doing eighty - five of them .
The deal ( the game ) has already changed .
So you ’re not changing the rules midstream , you are asking to update the rules based upon the ‘ game ’ that is being played now .
Step Four - Revert to day one .
Express you willingness ( and happiness ) to revert to the original deal that was negotiated the day the band was formed - nothing more and nothing less ; your not renegotiating , you ’re reverting to the beginning ( to the day when the original short and simple to - do list was created ) .
Step Five - Present some logic as follows …
Talking point :
You never realized how much work goes into the business of being a band .
Talking point : Organizations work far better when everyone feels they are justly compensated .
Talking point : Creativity flows when stress is reduced .
Talking point :
It ’s far better to fix things now than to wait until the day when the band is bigger .
Talking point : Friendship is more important than ownership or compensation ; therefore you find it necessary to revert to day one - the day when friendship and music were the basis for forming the band .
Talking point :
The energy required to do all the things you are doing for the band is taking time and energy away from the other things you need to do to move your own life forward .
Step Six - Present your list
Unfurl the list of things you are currently doing for the band which are over and above the list of things you never bargained for on day one .
You should be perfectly willing to discontinue doing the things on this expanded list , as you are about to give your bandmates the option of outsourcing or delegating everything on the list to someone else .
Step Seven - Assign values / costs to each item on the list
Work with the band to assign a value / cost to each of the items on the list .
Tip -
What would it truly cost you to outsource each item annually ?
Assuming the quality and the time commitment obtained from others would equate to what you provided when you did the tasks .
Once again , you should express your willingness to give these items up to someone else - although that probably wo n’t happen .
Now add up the total value of all of the items on your list .
This total should represent the true annual cost / value of the services you perform .
I am going to call this number the Service - Value .
Step Eight - Create a multi - year deal .
I recommend putting the subject of what YOUR time is worth to the band - to bed for no less than two years and for no more than three years .
You should not have to renegotiate with your band every year , so a two - year deal seams reasonable .
Three years works - however the value of the band should have changed significantly by the end of year three ( you will understand why the value of the band matters to your deal when you do the math below ) .
Take the Service - Value number from step seven and multiply it by two or three ( years ) to get what I will call your Multi - Year - Service - Value .
Step Nine - Receiving cash for the extra work you do .
To receive cash for the Multi - Year - Service - Value you provide - divide the Multi - Year - Service - Value by the number of months in the deal ( 24 or 36 ) to come up with a Monthly Service Value Fee ( call it whatever you want ) .
The band should pay you this Monthly Service Value Fee prior to dividing up ANY revenue between ALL band members .
When I say ALL band members , this also includes your equal or proportionate share .
Just because you are getting paid the Monthly Service Value Fee , this does NOT mean that you should not receive your proportionate share ( of revenues ) after the fee is paid .
After all , you are the Service Provider in this instance AND you are an owner and participant in the band .
Remember , you expressed your unflinching willingness ( in steps 6 and 7 ) to compensate an outside contractor , manager or service provider , but you ’re just doing the extra work instead .
Step Nine - Receiving equity ( stock ) for the extra work you do .
Alternatively ( to cash ) , to receive equity ( stock ) for the services you render - divide the Multi - Year - Service - Value by the Band Value ( step two ) to arrive at the additional percentage of the company / band that you should receive .
Every owner , including you , will have to shave off this percentage to give you your additional percentage points .
Why do YOU have to shave off points ?
Once again , look at yourself as TWO people - owner and employee .
All owners should share the burden of dilution equally when you make deals that use your equity as capital / compensation .
And , if the band does additional equity deals - the “ TWO ” of you ( see example ) will have to burden the dilution required by any new deal that uses equity as a form of payment or compensation .
Example ( you are Fred )
Current Ownership : Fred 20 % , Barney 20 % , Wilma 20 % , Betty 20 % , Dino 20 % Multi-Year - Service - Value = $ 30,000 Band Value = $ 300,000 ( 30,000 divided by 300,000 = your additional 10 % )
New Ownership ( notice Fred as ‘ two ’ people ) : Fred 10 % , Fred 18 % , Barney 18 % , Wilma 18 % , Betty 18 % , Dino 18 %

Step Ten - Handing publishing revenue …
Unless you have agreed to direct some percentage of publishing revenue into your corporation , division of publishing revenue is a separate matter .
I do recommend channeling publishing revenue into a corporation that is owned by the band ( read this post for more information ) .
This is something investors will prefer .
Seek qualified legal counsel when setting this up .
If your lead singer is also playing an instrument , perhaps he / she should be counted as 1.5 or 2 people when dividing ( on day one ) ownership / compensation ( vocal = an instrument + a second instrument ) , especially if he / she is also the songwriter .
Once again , this depends on how you are all dividing publishing revenue .
Step Eleven - Maintain proper perspective …
The current situation may be putting a strain on your friendships or on your ability to be creative .
You are restoring balance to the situation so that everyone can move forward without brain lock .
If your motives are honest and your valuation of the band and your services are just , you should n’t have much of a problem adjusting your compensation or obtaining additional equity .
If you expect one of your bandmates to be headstrong about changing the deal then I would advise you to bring in an advisor that this person trusts .
Finally , do n’t try to accomplish all of this in one meeting .
Set the Band Value in week one and wait a couple of weeks to calculate your Multi - Year - Service - Value .

5 Hydropolis

Hydropolis is a sprawling underwater hotel under construction in Dubai of the United Arab Emirates , the home of most of the world 's ridiculous construction projects .
Sixty - six feet below the Persian Gulf and covering an area equal to London 's Hyde Park , this $ 5,500 - a- night undersea pleasure dome caters to a very select clientele - - obscenely rich folks who have never read Michael Crichton 's Sphere .
Why It 's Awesome :
Juxtaposing an aquatic city next to the world 's biggest desert boomtown is such a goofily whimsical idea you can't help but smile .
It 's like the UAE hired Dr. Seuss as their urban planner .
If you still can't picture the sheer ridiculousness of all this , imagine if , across the street from their famous ice hotel , the city of Quebec built a hotel made entirely of fire .

Why You Will Shit Your Pants :
Hmm , what part of " experimental underwater hotel that literally costs the GDP of East Timor , is filled with moronic rich people and is in a politically tenuous corner of the world " does not sound like the next installment of the Die Hard franchise ?
Or the sequel to Bioshock ?
Or , hell , any episode of Sealab 2021 ?
Could the potential for shit to FUBAR be any higher ?
We 'd compare this opulent , waterlogged enterprise to the Titanic , but the Titanic did n't have a built - in missile defense system waiting to malfunction in some horrifying way .

Other Inconveniences :
Forget booking your honeymoon here .
If you 're spending $ 5,000 a night , you 're not going to close the drapes ; you want to fuck like Namor the Submariner .

Residents , rescue workers and security officials gather after a bomb explosion at a Peshawar market on Wednesday .
( ( Fayaz Aziz / Reuters ) )
An explosion at a popular women 's market in Peshawar has killed at least 93 people .
The bomb blast Wednesday hit the Mina Bazaar in Peepl Mandi , a neighbourhood in the northwestern Pakistani city where many Shia Muslims live , said police official Sajid Khan .
" The car was parked outside a market frequented mostly by women , " city official Azam Khan told Reuters .
The car bomb sparked fires that engulfed several buildings and filled the area with smoke .
A mosque was among the severely damaged buildings , officials said .
TV footage from the area shows collapsed buildings and massive piles of debris .
" There was a deafening sound and I was like a blind man for a few minutes , " said Mohammad Usman , who was wounded in attack .
" I heard women and children crying and started to help others .
There was the smell of human flesh in the air . "
Security officials and ambulances are having trouble navigating the narrow lanes in the area and the heavy smoke is causing further traffic congestion , Khan said .
200 wounded
Medical officials said hospitals were overflowing with more than 200 victims wounded in the attack .
Dr. Zafar Iqbal said most of the injured and dead are women and children .
The death toll is expected to rise , Iqbal said .

( ( Mohammad Sajjad / Associated Press ) )
Three bombs have exploded in Peshawar this month .
No group immediately claimed responsibility but attacks staged by Islamist militants this month have killed more than 200 people across the country .
North West Frontier Province Information Minister Mian Iftikhar Hussain blamed the militants for Wednesday 's attack .
" We are hitting them at their centre of terrorism , and they are hitting back targeting Peshawar , " he said .
" This is a tough time for us .
We are picking up the bodies of our women and children , but we will follow these terrorists and eliminate them . "
Officials said they believe the attack was aimed at swaying public support away from an army offensive against al - Qaeda and Taliban close to the Afghan border .
The Taliban have warned Pakistan that they would stage more attacks if the army does not end its offensive in the South Waziristan tribal region , where the military has dispatched some 30,000 troops to flush out insurgents .
Clinton in Islamabad
The attacks will not shake Pakistan from its offensive , said Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi .
" We will not buckle .
We will fight you .
We will fight you because we want peace and stability in Pakistan , " he said .
A man looks at a fire in the marketplace that was bombed in Peshawar on Wednesday .
( ( Mohammad Iqbal / Associated Press ) )
Wednesday 's attack also coincided with a trip to Pakistan by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , who praised the Pakistani government for pressing the military offensive , while speaking in Islamabad .
" I give the Pakistani government and military high marks for taking them on , " she told reporters .
" That was n't what they were doing before . "
The campaign in South Waziristan , which began Oct. 17 , has ramifications beyond Pakistan , Clinton said .
" Clearly these people are allies in a network of terrorism that includes al - Qaeda , and therefore we believe that what the Pakistanis are doing in standing up to extremism in Pakistan is in our national security interests , " she said .

Norway 's one of the most expensive countries in the world , and house prices have remained at a record high this September , which is why the same article gives a list of fourteen places with the cheapest house prices in Norway .
No information is given on how interesting they are to live in though , so we 'll have to turn to other sources for that .
The average price nationwide is 24,900 kroner per square metre ( one square metre is about ten square feet ) , or $ 4300 USD , and the most expensive part of the country is Oslo and Bærum with average prices at 33,800 and 33,000 kroner ( $ 5825 and $ 5690 ) .
Outside of Oslo the most expensive locations are Stavanger and Sandnes with 30,600 ( $ 5275 ) and 27,000 ( $ 4655 ) .
And now for the fourteen cheapest parts of the country .
# 14 : Sandefjord - average price 19,900 kroner ( $ 3430 USD ) per square metre
Population 42,333 and seems to be famous for having Viking ships , spas , and whaling .
There is also a brewery and a chocolate factory here .
# 13 : Møre og Romsdal - average price 19,400 kroner ( $ 3345 USD ) per square metre
The largest city in this region is Ålesund with a population of 41,385 , and is famous for its large concentration of Jugendstil architecture .
The region uses Nynorsk as its official linguistic standard ( as opposed to Bokmål , which is what most people learning Norwegian learn ) .
# 12 : Agder outside Kristiansand - average price 19,400 kroner ( $ 3345 USD ) per square metre
That 's Vest - Agder - Kristiansand is the capital of this region , so everywhere but that .
Vest - Agder has a population of 166,976 and Kristiansand is about half that .
Besides that the largest settlement seems to be about 13,000 people or so .
Next to it is another region with Agder in the name called Aust - Augder - total population is 106,842 of which 41,241 is in the capital called Arendal , which looks like this .
Arendal is a port town with a large jazz festival and some other yearly music festivals .
Seems to have a large number of churches too .
# 11 : Buskerud outside Drammen - average price 19,100 kroner ( $ 3290 USD ) per square metre
Buskerud has a population of 253,006 of which 60,145 live in Drammen .
This is the town of Hurum along the coast , with a population of 9,011 .
Kongsberg is another town in the region with a population of 23,997 .
# 10 : Rural Vestfold - average price 19,000 kroner ( $ 3275 USD ) per square metre
Vestfold is located fairly close to Oslo with a road leading directly into Oslo and thus real estate in the cities there would be expensive , but apparently the areas outside the cities are n't that bad .
The picture above is of Holmestrand , population 9,949 and thus probably one of the places to which the list is referring .
# 9 : Fredrikstad - average price 18,900 kroner ( $ 3260 USD ) per square metre
Fredrikstad is a relatively large city ( by Norwegian standards ) with a population of 72,935 and located to the southeast of Oslo , pretty close to the Swedish border .
It has an old town which is Northern Europe 's best preserved old town .
A blog post here seems quite impressed with Fredrikstad .
Fredrikstad is right next to Sarpsborg ( # 5 on the list ) .
# 8 : Larvik - average price 18,400 kroner ( $ 3,170 USD ) per square metre
Larvik is located within Vestfold , right along the southwestern edge .
It 's a ways out of Oslo but it still lies on the road leading directly into the city .
Bottled water is produced here .
# 7 : Northern Norway outside Tromsø - average price 18,300 kroner ( $ 3,155 USD ) per square metre
This is Bodø , population 46,049 .
It lies just north of the Arctic Circle so you can see the sun 24 hours a day during the summer , and 24 hours of darkness during the darkest part of the winter , each for about a month at a time .
It 's also a very windy city .
# 6 : Trøndelag outside of Trondheim : average price 18,000 kroner ( $ 3,105 USD ) per square metre
Trøndelag is where you start to get into the northern part of the country and has a total population of 418,453 of which 168,257 live in Trondheim .
Outside of Trondheim the largest city is called Stjørdal :
with a population of 20,616 .
Stjørdal is quite close ( 35 km ) to Trondheim which gives it a growing population as a satellite city , and it has a lot of birds and an interesting castle .
# 5 : Sarpsborg - average price 17,300 kroner ( $ 2,985 USD ) per square metre
Remember Fredrikstad ( #9 ) ?
This city is in the same region , and located even closer to the main road that goes northwest to Oslo and southeast into Sweden ( eventually to Gothenburg / Götenborg ) .
Sarpsborg has a population of 51,813 and together with Fredrikstad they form the fifth largest urban area in Norway .
Sarpsborg is the home of the brewery Borg Bryggerier , which produces these beers .
Bethlehem ( yes , the Bethlehem ) is one of its sister cities .
# 4 : Rural Østfold - average price 16,300 kroner ( $ 2,810 USD ) per square metre
Østfold is where Fredrikstad and Sarpsborg are located , and you can see how prices fall even further when getting out of the cities altogether .
That 's Rakkestad , population 7,232 .
It 's basically located in the same area as the other two cities mentioned but smaller and a bit more out of the way , as it's off the main road that leads into Oslo to the northwest and Gothenburg to the southeast in Sweden .
Rakkestad has a lot of farming and forestry .
Though not related to Rakkestad in particular , the Wikipedia page on the community has the following : " Everyone in Norway has a right of access to and passage through uncultivated land in the countryside , regardless of who owns it ... You may also put up a tent for the night , but you must keep at least 150 metres ( 492.1 ft ) away from the nearest house or cabin .
If you want to stay for more than two nights in the same place , you must ask the landowner 's permission . "
# 3 : Oppland outside of Lillehammer - average price 16,300 kroner ( $ 2,810 USD ) per square metre
Oppland has a population of 183,851 of which only 25,070 live in Lillehammer , but Lillehammer was the site of the 1994 Olympics .
Just next to Lillehammer though is Gjøvik , which actually has a larger population ( 28,627 ) .
It 's also located alongside the same lake and is further south so less out of the way than Lillehammer and closer to Oslo .
# 2 : Telemark - average price 15,800 kroner ( $ 2,725 USD ) per square metre
This is Skien , the largest city in Telemark with a population of 50,595 .
It 's fairly close to Larvik ( that 's # 8 ) but is a bit farther away from Oslo .
The page on Skien on the Norwegian Wikipedia is more detailed than most other cities its size , with quite a few pictures .
And now we get to the cheapest part of Norway :
#1 : Hedmark outside of Hamar - average price 15,300 kroner ( $ 2,640 USD ) per square metre
Hedmark is located northeast of Oslo , and just east of Oppland where Lillehammer is located .
Total population is 189,586 of which 27,593 live in Hamar .
This is Elverum , the next largest city with a population of 19,665 .
There is a forest museum here .
Elverum also happens to be extremely close to Hamar , which looks like this .
So there you have it , the fourteen cheapest places in Norway in terms of real estate .
When living abroad it 's important to choose a location that balances cost of living with opportunity , so simply finding the cheapest place to live is no help if opportunities to work are severely restricted .
Norway also has a lot of linguistic variation , so keep in mind that people living in places off the beaten track will likely be incomprehensible at first , even if you 've put in the time to learn a lot of Bokmål before going .
Personally my favourite from looking at the list alone would probably be # 9 , Fredrikstad .
Seems to have a nice old town , is fairly close to Oslo , also next to Sarpsborg , Sweden is easily accessible too .
Ålesund also seems to be quite interesting for those that are interested in Nynorsk and / or architecture and enjoy the cool weather .
Here 's another nice image of Ålesund either at dawn or dusk .

Artosis -
When did you start thinking about going to Korea for Starcraft , and
what finally made you decide to take the leap ?
Ret -
I ’ve always wanted to be a pro gamer for Starcraft , and go to Korea .
When I was younger , perhaps the more appropriate age , there were less
foreigners in Korea and contacting pro teams managers was a lot harder
than now .
I had never expected that I would still get the chance to go
to Korea , but when the opportunity arose I realized that it was still
my dream and that I wanted to give it my best shot .
Artosis -
What are your goals in going to Korea ?
How long do you intend to stay ?
Ret -
The immediate goal for Starcraft would be to win the courage
tournament and then perhaps play a Pro League match .
But we ’ll have to
see what happens when SC2 comes out and how that changes things .
I
really do n’t know how long I ’ll stay , but I intend to stay in
pro gaming for SC2 , so it could be a long time .
Artosis -
Winning the courage tournament is something that only 1 foreigner
has ever done before ( Assem ) , even though NonY came very close , losing
the finals 1 - 2 on his first try .
Supposedly they have even made it a
much harder tournament now .
What time frame do you think you can win
this event in ?
Ret -
I think my ZvZ will be the only problem with winning Courage .
So if
I can get that matchup up to par quickly , I should be a pretty strong
contender .
If that happens reasonably quick , I think I could possibly
win it on my first try .
But of course to win any tournament with a
strong field of players , you ’ll also need some luck .

The world will suffer another financial crisis , former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan has told the BBC .
" The crisis will happen again but it will be different , " he told BBC Two 's The Love of Money series .
He added that he had predicted the crash would come as a reaction to a long period of prosperity .
But while it may take time and be a difficult process , the global economy would eventually " get through it " , Mr Greenspan added .
" They [ financial crises ] are all different , but they have one fundamental source , " he said .
BBC AFTERSHOCK SEASON
The BBC reports on the first anniversary of the credit crunch across radio , TV , and online .
See how China 's domestic migrants are returning to the city as a result of the crisis
See how the crisis has affected the finances of central governments around the world
Listen to WS radio on the crisis Full coverage of Aftershock online " That is the unquenchable capability of human beings when confronted with long periods of prosperity to presume that it will continue . "
Speaking a year after the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers , which was followed by a worldwide financial crisis and global recession , Mr Greenspan described the behaviour as " human nature " .
He said the current crisis was triggered by the trade in US sub - prime mortgages - home loans given to people with bad credit histories - but he added that any factor could have been the catalyst .
If it were not the problem of these toxic debts , " something sooner or later would have emerged " , Mr Greenspan said .
Risks Mr Greenspan , who when he ran the US central bank was hailed as a man who could move markets , also warned that the world 's financial institutions should have seen the looming crisis .
" The bankers knew that they were involved in an under - pricing of risk and that at some point a correction would be made , " he said .
If I am right , the next financial crisis , when it comes , stands to make the last two years look like a ' warm up '
Stephen , a city insider , writing in the latest BBC City Diaries
City Diaries : 9 September " I fear too many of them thought they would be able to spot the actual trigger point of the crisis in time to get out . "
He also warned that Britain , with its globally - focussed economy , would be harder hit than the US by the current recession and collapse in world trade .
" Obviously we 've both suffered very considerably but ...
Britain is more globally oriented as an economy and the dramatic decline in exports globally and trade generally following the collapse of Lehman Brothers had dramatic effects in the financial system of Britain , " Mr Greenspan said .
" It 's going to take a long while for you [ Britain ] to work your way through this . "
Road to recovery
In order to prevent the situation arising again , financiers and governments should look to clamp down on fraud and increase capital requirements for banks , the former central banker said .

Regulations targeting the latter would mean banks would be forced to hold enough money to cover their normal operations and honour withdrawals .
However despite his belief in a brighter future , the former Fed chief did warn that the path to recovery should steer clear of protectionism as applying strict regulations could hamper recent developments that have opened up global trade .
" The most recent endeavour to re-regulate is a reaction to the crisis .
The extraordinary impact of these global markets is making a lot of financial people feeling they have lost control .
" The problem is you cannot have free global trade with highly restrictive , regulated domestic markets . "
Historic event During the interview for BBC Two's The Love of Money series , the former Fed chief said the current economic crisis was a " once in a century type of event " , and one that he did not expect to witness .
Blamed by some for not doing more to prevent the crisis , Mr Greenspan denied any responsibility for the problems gripping the global economy .
" It 's human nature , unless somebody can find a way to change human nature , we will have more crises and none of them will look like this because no two crises have anything in common , except human nature . "
Alan Greenspan was interviewed as part of BBC Two 's Love of Money series to be broadcast at 2100 BST on 10 , 17 and 24 September .

Some family members with money in individual trusts are opting to go off on their own .
The bigger issue is when families have to cooperate to run the business the patriarch set up .
In the past , family businesses and family wealth were commingled .
If the business was struggling , the patriarch would often finance shortfalls .
“ Now the kids are upset about where the money is going , ” said Holly Isdale , managing director at Bessemer .
“ Intrafamily dynamics are playing a bigger part in decisions . ”
If the family put in place a strict estate plan , the children may legally own a good portion of what the patriarch made .
And now they have choices to make that may go against his wishes .
“ These families have recognized that autopilot is not a good strategy , ” said Amelia Renkert - Thomas , a lawyer with Withers Bergman .
The other risk to super - rich families is government action and increased regulation .
They suspect it is coming but do not know how it will affect them .
The result is that they are increasingly anxious about the future while still shell - shocked from the past year .
“ We are telling them not to make changes for the sake of making changes , ” said Theodore Beringer , managing director of the Beringer Group , a family office adviser .
“ First , they need to find out what needs to be changed . ”
RETURN TO BASICS
Figuring out what they need to do differently has prompted many super - rich families to ponder the same question as the rest of us :
How did the boom years change us ?
The basic issue for them is deciding what they want to do as a family now that they realize they cannot do everything .
“ You ’re worth $ 500 million one day and wake up the next and it ’s $ 350 million and you ’ve pledged $ 100 million to the Met , ” said Rob Elliott , senior managing director at Bessemer .
“ What are the family ’s goals ?
Is it philanthropy or bringing along the next generation ? ”
Excerpted fromGrowing Up bin Laden : Osama ’s Wife and Son Take Us Inside Their Secret World , by Najwa bin Laden , Omar bin Laden , and Jean Sasson , published this month by St. Martin ’s Press ; © 2009 by the author .
Since the time I could observe and reason , I have mainly known my father to be composed , no matter what might be happening .
That ’s because he believes that everything of earthly life is in the hands of God .
It is difficult , therefore , for me to imagine that he became so excited when my mother told him I was about to be born that he momentarily misplaced his keys .
After a frantic search , I ’m told he settled my mother hastily in the car before spinning off at a reckless speed .
Luckily he had recently purchased a new automobile , the latest Mercedes , because on that day he tested all its working parts .
I ’ve been told it was golden in color , something so beautiful that I imagine the vehicle as a golden carriage tearing through the wide palm - tree - lined boulevards of Jeddah , Saudia Arabia .
Within a short while after that chaotic journey , I made my appearance , becoming the fourth child born to my parents .
I was only one of many in a chain of strong personalities in our bin Laden family .
My father , although quiet - natured in many ways , has always been a man that no other man can control .
My paternal grandfather , Mohammed Awad bin Laden , was also quite famous for his strength of character .
After the premature death of his father , who left behind a grieving widow and four young children , Grandfather bin Laden sought his fortune without a clue as to where he would end up .
He was the eldest at 11 years .
Since Yemen offered few possibilities in those days , my grandfather bravely turned his back on the only land and the only people he had ever known , taking his younger brother , Abdullah , with him to join one of the many camel caravans trekking through the area .
After traveling through the dusty villages and towns of Yemen , they arrived at the port of Aden .
From there they sailed a short distance across the Gulf of Aden to Somalia .
In Somalia , the two bin Laden boys were employed by a cruel taskmaster , known for his furious outbursts .
One day he became so annoyed at my grandfather that he hit him on the head with a heavy stick .
The injury resulted in the loss of sight in one eye .
My grandfather and uncle were forced to return to their village until his recovery .
The following year they set out once again , this time traveling in the opposite direction , north to Saudi Arabia .
I ’m sure they were eager to stop at many outposts , but nothing seemed to have the magic they were seeking .
The two boys , young and unlettered , lingered only long enough to earn sufficient money to stave off hunger and to continue what must have seemed an endless journey .
Something about Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , appealed to my grandfather , because that walled city on the Red Sea marked the end of their arduous voyage .
Grandfather bin Laden was poor yet he was full of energy and determination .
He felt no shame in tackling any honest labor .
Jeddah was the ideal place for such a character , for the city and the country were at an economic turning point .
In the early 1930s , my grandfather ’s vigor , strength of mind , and attention to detail caught the attention of an assistant to King Abdul Aziz , the first king of Saudi Arabia , who had recently won many tribal wars and formed a new country .

Among the grandees of the Princeton University faculty , past and present , Cornel West is the only one to have appeared in two sequels of “ The Matrix , ” playing a Zion Elder called Councillor West ; recorded songs with both André 3000 and John Mellencamp ; and seen his words quoted on a Starbucks cup .
A couple of weeks ago , West published a memoir titled “ Living and Loving Out Loud . ”
He did not write it , exactly ; the book is an as - told - to with David Ritz , who has similarly collaborated with Ray Charles , Aretha Franklin , and Grandmaster Flash .
None of the above can be said of Christian Gauss or Woodrow Wilson .
Cornel West Illustration by Tom Bachtell
Cornel
West is everywhere , constantly on the road .
A self - fashioned “ scholar - bluesman , ” he travels from lecture hall to church pulpit and on to Barnes & Noble , wearing a formal and elegant uniform––black suit , white shirt , French cuffs , black tie , black scarf .
“ I ’ve got four more just like this one , ” he says .
“ And the dry - cleaning bills to go with it . ”
West stopped by Times Square the other day on his way to a speaking engagement uptown .
He had in tow his publisher and his sweetly beleaguered assistant , Mary Ann Rodriguez , who valiantly attempts to get him to his gigs on time ; just in case Rodriguez loses him , he carries a tiny leather - bound date book crammed tight with the details of his obligations , paid and otherwise .
“ I ’ve never spent a weekend in Princeton , ” West said .
“ I ’m on the road , on the move , brother .
I meet magnificent people , I have a great time , I learn so much , and , at the same time , I ’ve got to make some money , because I ’ve got women in my life — or women in my past , let ’s put it that way . ”
Of the many roles that West has played in the academy and the media lately , it ’s been his ongoing support - slash - critique of Barack Obama that is the most curious .
It was not a relationship that began with daffodils and candy .
At Tavis Smiley ’s State of the Black Union conference , in February , 2007 , West said that he admired Obama as a “ very decent , brilliant , charismatic brother , ” but lamented that he “ holds us at arm ’s length , ” the better not to alienate white voters .
A few days later , Obama called West and the two men spoke for what West described as four hours .
“ First thing he said was ‘ Well , Brother West , you ’re much more progressive on these things than I am .
We ’re not going to agree on everything . ’
I said , ‘ Of course !
My only thing is — you be true to yourself , I ’ll be true to myself .
That ’s all I ask . ’
Then he went in and talked about what King meant , what that legacy meant , how he ’d been shaped by it , and so forth .
And it was a genuine opening .
That ’s why I could discern a certain decency .
I said , ‘ Brother , I will be a critical supporter .
I ’ll be a Socratic supporter . ’ ”
Nine months later , at a fund - raiser at the Apollo Theatre , West introduced Obama with unbridled enthusiasm and Obama returned the favor , calling West “ a genius ” and “ an oracle . ”
West campaigned for Obama in Iowa , South Carolina , Illinois , and Ohio , but he was dismayed by his speech on race in Philadelphia .
West thought the speech was politically “ masterful , ” but “ intellectually , it was pretty thin . ”
He kept his thoughts to himself , but he was especially annoyed that Obama had said that the Reverend Wright was full of rage , because he was somehow stuck in time , still wrestling with Jim Crow , and that he equated black anger with white resentment .
“ Have you seen the young brothers and sisters in prison , on the block ? ”
West said .
“ I do n’t mind being an angry black man in terms of having righteous indignation at injustice , given the situation right now in the country .
But as a candidate he had to distance himself .
. . .
There have been excesses of affirmative action and so forth and so on , but Jim Crow de facto is still in place .
. . .
Who are the major victims of that ?
The poor — disproportionately black and brown and red .
You got to tell the truth , Barack .
Do n’t trot out this shit with this coded stuff ! ”
And yet , West said , “ I intentionally remained relatively silent .
It was a very delicate moment . ”
Now , a year after the election , West has kept to his promise : he is a Socratic supporter .
“ I do n’t want to downplay the progress , though , because Obama is a black man .
It ’s just that : first , you ’ve got the parents .
It ’s more Johnny Mathis than Curtis Mayfield , or more Lena Horne than Sarah Vaughan , in terms of phenotype .
And , second , you ’ve got someone who really is a master at easing the fears and anxieties of white brothers and sisters .
That ’s part of the basis of his success .
And I do n’t put that down .
We need different kinds of people in the world . ”
So far , West finds himself infinitely more impressed by Obama ’s mastery of “ spectacle ” than by his attention to the poor .
“ In terms of the impact on young people , I think it ’s a beautiful thing , ” he said of Obama ’s election .
“ But , in the end , even spectacle has to deal with the darkness .
That ’s where the bluesman comes in .
Guy Lombardo can be nice on a certain night , but you ’re going to need Duke Ellington and Count Basie . ” ♦
Comedian David Cross brought his stand - up routine to Washington 's Warner Theatre Wednesday night and made a shocking confession ( assuming he was n't joking ... ) at the end of his routine :
That he snorted cocaine while seated just yards away from President Barack Obama at this year 's White House Correspondents ' Association dinner .
" So I got to go because my girlfriend is a fancy Hollywood actress and she got an invitation to go this last time , so we went , " the " Arrested Development " star told the crowd .
He went on to say that he has an ongoing competition with a friend in which the two try to constantly out - do each other in " dares and outrageousness . "
Cross said that he was seated " super close to the president " and seated with or near former Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta , Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius , former Defense Secretary Don Rumsfeld , Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and " the editor - in - chief of the USA Today . "
" But it 's crazy and there 's security , Secret Service is standing there , " said Cross .
" I 've got photos of all this .
...
I 'm there and the president is right here and with all these people at the table " Cross snorted some coke , he said .
" Maybe 40 feet from the president of the United States ! "
Cross said he texted his friend to say , " No way you can ever top that . "
For the whole summer , the Republicans had managed to shift the debate from " should we reform the health care system in this country ? " to " is the Democratic plan to reform health care a government takeover ? "
So , instead of the onus being on the health care industry and their Republican lovers to prove that we should maintain the status quo , the onus shifted to Democrats to prove that their plan was perfect .
This is an old trick of lobbyists ( really well demonstrated in Thank You For Smoking ) .
You change the conversation to a battle you can win .
So , Rep. Grayson used their methods against them .
And now the conversation we 're having is whether the health care system is acceptable or if it leads to killing people for profit .
Mission accomplished .
Michael Moore is doing the same in his move Capitalism .
First , he is changing the conversation on who caused the financial collapse in the first place .
Most people are acutely aware that it was the bankers , but not the Fox News audience .
So , when he went on Sean Hannity 's show the other night , he introduced that idea to them and then Hannity was stuck in the position of defending the bankers and blatantly blaming the victims and the poor .
Instead of discussing how government was at fault , Moore started a conversation on how deregulation might have led to this mess .
But more importantly , he started a battle for the heart and soul of Christianity .
He proposed in the movie and in his debate with Hannity that being on the side of the rapacious rich is un-Christian .
He claimed his position is the more Christian position .
For so long , the Republicans have simply claimed that they are more Christian without anything to back them up .
They just shouted louder .
Now , Moore is shouting just as loud .
By putting them on the defensive on how they are not good Christians if they help the rich crush the poor , he has once again changed the conversation .
Are the Republicans bad Christians ?
It does n't matter what the answer is , that 's a question you can't lose with .
What the conservative movement has understood for a long time is sometimes it takes something a little inflammatory to change the conversation .
You have to draw attention to you , so people can start discussing the topic you want .
This was perfectly demonstrated by the wild and angry town hall crowds .
They were sometimes saying hideous things about Obama but they succeeded in shifting the burden of proof on to the Democrats .
Now , it looks like we have a couple of guys that know how to play this game .
And they have succeeded in shifting the focus back to where it should be .
It 's refreshing to have people who know what they 're doing on your side .

I recently stopped to congratulate a young mother pushing her toddler in a stroller .
The woman had been talking to her barely verbal daughter all the way up the block , pointing out things they had passed , asking questions like “ What color are those flowers ? ” and talking about what they would do when they got to the park .
This is a rare occurrence in my Brooklyn neighborhood , I told her .
All too often , the mothers and nannies I see are tuned in to their cellphones , BlackBerrys and iPods , not their young children .
There were no such distractions when my husband and I , and most other parents of a certain age , spent time with our babies , toddlers and preschoolers .
Like this young mother , we talked to them .
We read to them and sang with them .
And long before they became verbal , we mimicked their noises , letting them know they were communicating and we were listening and responding .
( And we ’ve done the same with our four grandsons , all born after the turn of this wireless century . )
I am not the only one alarmed by modern parental behavior .
Randi Jacoby , a speech and language specialist in New York , recently told me in an e-mail message : “ Parents have stopped having good communications with their young children , causing them to lose out on the eye contact , facial expression and overall feedback that is essential for early communication development .

It turns out that Benito Mussolini , inventor of fascism and promulgator of vast atrocities in Ethiopia and elsewhere , had his sinister career kick - started with dollops of secret cash from -- where else ? -- the intelligence service of one of the great and good world - leading democracies of his day .
The Guardian reports that Britain 's MI5 reached out and touched young Mussolini when he was still a Fox News - style " journalist " railing against peaceniks opposed to Italy 's involvement in the pointless slaughter of World War I .
The British security organs were afraid that reason and human fellow - feeling would run rampant in Italy if the dirty hippies were n't crushed , so they began pumping a great deal of scratch to Mussolini -- who did not confine himself to Beckian media rants , but also marshaled various thugs to beat up war opponents :
Archived documents have revealed that Mussolini got his start in politics in 1917 with the help of a £ 100 weekly wage from MI5 .
For the British intelligence agency , it must have seemed like a good investment .
Mussolini , then a 34 - year - old journalist , was not just willing to ensure Italy continued to fight alongside the allies in the first world war by publishing propaganda in his paper .
He was also willing to send in the boys to " persuade ' ' peace protesters to stay at home .
Cambridge historian Peter Martland , who discovered details of the deal struck with the future dictator , said : " Britain 's least reliable ally in the war at the time was Italy after revolutionary Russia 's pullout from the conflict .
Mussolini was paid £ 100 a week from the autumn of 1917 for at least a year to keep up the pro-war campaigning – equivalent to about £ 6,000 a week today . "
British aid and comfort to Il Putze did n't stop with the war - goosing dosh , of course .
Mussolini was widely admired by many of the elite in Britain ( and elsewhere ) , who admired his strongman rule , which swept aside all that silly nonsense about law and democracy .
Winston Churchill was a big fan , declaring that Mussolini -- " the Roman genius , " as he called him -- was " the greatest lawgiver among men . "
He also lauded the violent and corrupt fascist dictatorship for " render[ing ] a service to the whole world " by demonstrating how to crack down on " subversive forces . "
Later , of course , thousands of British soldiers died fighting against the forces of the great lawgiver after he threw in with his pupil ( and later master ) , Adolf Hitler .
But what can you do ?
You live by the strongman , you die by the strongman .
( Or rather , the cannon fodder you command dies by the strongman . )
At least Winnie and Bennie had many years of fond mutual regard before that little falling - out at the end .
Meanwhile , Mussolini 's corrupt , undemocratic influence lives on , in diluted ( so far ) form under Silvio Berlusconi , the egomaniacal media oligarch whose ruling coalition includes a party which openly boasts of its direct lineage to Mussolini 's thuggish faction .
The legacy of this ugly episode also lives on in the never - ending replication of the MI5 - Mussolini hook - up by our " leading democracies , " whose chief foreign policy seems to be the fostering of violent thugs and " strongmen " to keep a lid on " recalcitrant tribes " ( another evocative phrase of that Nobelist litterateur , Churchill ) -- and to stoke any wars the great and good get going .
Saddam Hussein is of course a prime example .
As everyone ( except 97 percent of the US population ) knows , Saddam was hired by the CIA when he was a mere stripling as part of a hit team to take down a once - favored Iraqi strongman who had , as so often happens , gotten above his raising .
As Richard Sale explains :
[ Saddam 's ] first contacts with U.S. officials date back to 1959 , when he was part of a CIA - authorized six - man squad tasked with assassinating then Iraqi Prime Minister Gen .
Abd al - Karim Qasim .
In July 1958 , Qasim had overthrown the Iraqi monarchy in what one former U.S. diplomat , who asked not to be identified , described as " a horrible orgy of bloodshed . "
According to current and former U.S. officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , Iraq was then regarded as a key buffer and strategic asset in the Cold War with the Soviet Union .
For example , in the mid-1950s , Iraq was quick to join the anti-Soviet Baghdad Pact which was to defend the region and whose members included Turkey , Britain , Iran and Pakistan .
Little attention was paid to Qasim 's bloody and conspiratorial regime until his sudden decision to withdraw from the pact in 1959 , an act that " freaked everybody out " according to a former senior U.S. State Department official .
You can kill , jail and torture who you like -- as long as you play on our team , and do what we say .
If not , why then , you are a rogue , an outlaw , a new Hitler , an urgent and imminent danger to the world .
In the event , Saddam -- like many intelligence " assets " ( and bosses ) over the years -- botched the job completely .
But he had shown he was a team player , so the Americans kept the cash flowing to him , while also backing the Baath Party 's later , successful coup , giving the faction the usual assistance ( as in Indonesia a couple of year later ) with tracking down and slaughtering " leftists " .
As historian Roger Morris noted in the New York Times :
According to Western scholars , as well as Iraqi refugees and a British human rights organization , the 1963 coup was accompanied by a bloodbath .
Using lists of suspected Communists and other leftists provided by the C.I.A. , the Baathists systematically murdered untold numbers of Iraq 's educated elite -- killings in which Saddam Hussein himself is said to have participated .
No one knows the exact toll , but accounts agree that the victims included hundreds of doctors , teachers , technicians , lawyers and other professionals as well as military and political figures .
[ As happened yet again years later , in the latest American - assisted " regime change in Iraq -- CF . ]
Later , after their boy Saddam had risen through the ranks to become one of their very own -- head of the Party 's secret intelligence service -- the American security organs helped his family faction outgun their party rivals to take sole control .
The rest , as we know , is history : the famous " tilt " toward Iraq in the Iran - Iraq War ( which included supplying Saddam with U.S. military intelligence to direct bombing raids on Iranian cities and chemical attacks on Iranian forces ) ; the big grip - and - grin with Ronnie Reagan 's " special envoy , " Don Rumsfeld ; George Bush Senior 's eager arming and funding of Saddam after the war ( and after the gassing of the Kurds ) , Bush 's secret directives to government agencies to cut sweetheart deals with Saddam , Bush 's sale of " dual-use " technology to Saddam ; the inevitable falling - out when Saddam attacked the Bush Family 's long - time business partners in Kuwait ; the glorious Gulf War , with its " Turkey Shoots " and massive bombing ; the years of bipartisan " sanctions " which enriched Saddam and many Western interests but killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children ; and of course , the American - launched war in 2003 , which has now killed well over a million innocent people , and is still going on .
[ For more background on the Saddam 's relationship with Washington , see " Prelude to a Quagmire . " ]
This kind of blowback is endemic to the policy of buying thugs and supporting tyrants to do the dirty work for coddled imperial elites .
You buy them , you build them up , you support them , and then , when they go off the reservation -- or when the horrific suffering , death and repression they 've inflicted with your help blows up in their faces ( as with the Shah of Iran ) -- you have to step in and slaughter even more people , either directly ( Iraq 2003 , Panama 1989 , etc. ) , or indirectly ( the Iran - Iraq War , the Reagan - backed genocidal repressions in Latin America , the Ethiopian invasion of Somalia , etc. ) .
And on and on it goes .
For example , many of the justifications offered for Barack Obama 's Nobel Prize centered largely on one thing : the fact that he went to Cairo and made a speech about America 's good intentions toward the Muslim world -- a speech nearly identical to many that George W. Bush had made in the Middle East .
Yet where did Obama choose to make this world - changing clarion call ?
In the heart of one of the most undemocratic regimes in the region , a corrupt , brutally repressive regime heavily sustained by the United States for decades -- and now embraced by the Continuer - in - Chief .
As the Washington Post reports :
Since the speech , Egyptian security forces have launched a fresh campaign against the banned Muslim Brotherhood , an influential Islamist opposition group , arbitrarily arresting hundreds of members , from young bloggers to senior leaders .
The government has prevented a centrist opposition movement from legally becoming a political party .
In this Nile Delta industrial city , the epicenter of recent worker strikes , the government has appeared unresponsive to labor concerns -- or is cracking down .
" We are very disgruntled with President Obama , " said Kamal al - Fayoumi , a labor leader who was jailed by the government for launching a major strike last year .
" He has given the regime the green light to do what it wants with the Egyptian people . "
The market for college education looks a lot like the market for houses circa 2006 — very bubbly .
And the reason is similar :
There is too much credit .
Colleges can keep raising prices , despite the recession , because the government keeps lending students more money to pay them .
According to a report cited by Anne Marie Chaker in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday , the government will lend students $ 75.1 billion to pay for college this year , up a spectacular 25 percent compared with last year .
But the extra credit is n’t benefiting students .
It ’s just inflating the price of their education , burying them under a bigger pile of debt despite stagnant wage growth and poorer employment prospects .
This is eerily reminiscent of the housing bubble , when too easy credit inflated the price of houses well beyond their fundamental value .
What is the fundamental value of a house ?
Roughly speaking , it is what a buyer can pay for it , some portion of his income plus what he can borrow .
Historically , the increase in house prices has tracked income growth .
But excessively easy credit disrupted this relationship over the past several years .
A similar dynamic is playing out in the market for college education .
A college degree can be valued by the incremental earning power that it can provide over a working lifetime .
In other words , how much more will you make if you go to college than if you do n’t ?
Are those extra earnings enough to pay back your loans with interest , along with the opportunity cost of forgoing full - time wages while you ’re a student ?
A common misconception is that a college degree is worth a million dollars over the average working lifetime .
But a paper published late last year by the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges pegs the value at close to a tenth of that , $ 121,539 .
This is a very rough figure .
There are big differences depending on the type of school , the time it takes a student to finish their degree and other factors .
In any case , the present value of going to college is positive , but not nearly as high as most think .
And surely , during a recession , colleges would n’t be able to keep raising prices .
Not only are job and wage prospects down , more parents are struggling to make ends meet , and lower house prices mean that the home equity ATM has stopped spitting out cash .
But this year , the price of tuition is expected to rise 12 percent .
Indeed , since 1979 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , tuition has outpaced inflation every single year , and by greater than two times most years .
Where is the money coming from to increase prices ?
The government .
According to Dr. Richard Vedder , Director of the Center for College Affordability and Productivity , federal loan programs are responsible for the dramatic rise in tuition costs .
First made widely available with the Higher Education Act of 1965 , federal loans went from near zero to $ 75 billion this year .
This leaves students saddled with debt when they graduate .
In a CCAP paper published in April 2008 , Andrew Gillen says that in 2006 , the average student graduated with debt equal to 50 percent of his median income , up from less than 35 percent in 1999 .
A big reason colleges will be able to raise tuition prices this year is because dependent undergrads can now borrow $ 31,000 from the federal Stafford loan program , up from $ 23,000 just last year .
The government , we ’re led to believe , is acting heroically to “ save ” the economy by providing credit where the private market wo n’t .
In reality , it ’s sustaining an asset bubble , and not just in college educations .
Those who are asset rich — homeowners , banks , stock and bond investors — are benefiting at the expense of everyone else as the government props up the value of their holdings .
In the long run this will be very destructive for the economy .
Those who need to buy assets are being forced to pay prices that are artificially inflated because the government is providing too much credit to finance the purchase .
The price is n’t being allowed to fall , so buyers who do n’t have oodles of cash lying around are forced to pile on the debt .
The government should get out of the way and let the price of college fall .
If it does n’t , many who would otherwise want to buy a college education will refuse as the costs race ahead of the benefits .
( CNN ) -- Scientists say a very rare find of some 20 fossilized pterodactyls has produced the first clear evidence of a controversial theory of evolution .
This image shows the fossilized skeleton of Darwinopterus which was found in north - east China earlier this year .
The fossils were found in northeast China earlier this year , embedded in rock dating back 160 million years , and have been called " Darwinopterus " after the renowned naturalist Charles Darwin .
The creature 's discovery has astounded scientists because their age puts them within two recognized groups of pterodactyls -- primitive long - tailed forms and advanced short - tail forms -- and they display characteristics of both .
The combination of features indicates that the primitive pterodactyls evolved relatively quickly , and that certain groups of features changed at the same time .
Traditional evolutionary theory suggests that one feature -- a tail for instance -- would slowly evolve over time .
" Darwinopterus came as quite a shock to us , " said David Unwin , from the University of Leicester 's School of Museum Studies , which identified the creature , along with researchers from the Geological Institute of Beijing .
" We had always expected a gap - filler with typically intermediate features such as a moderately elongate tail -- neither long nor short -- but the strange thing about Darwinopterus is that it has a head and neck just like that of advanced pterosaurs , while the rest of the skeleton , including a very long tail , is identical to that of primitive forms , " he said .
By comparing the fossil with others from earlier and later periods , scientists have been able to sketch a rough timeline of the pterodactyl 's progression .
" The head and neck evolved first , followed later by the body , tail , wings and legs , " Unwin said .
The researchers say more study is needed to substantiate the idea of that evolution could occur relatively quickly , and that whole parts of a plant or animal 's body could change at once .
The fossils indicate Darwinopterus was about the size of a crow , with long jaws , sharp , pointed teeth and a flexible neck .
It had " hawk - like " qualities , scientists say , which allowed the creature to kill and eat smaller , feathered dinosaurs which would later evolve into birds .
Pterodactyls were prevalent during the Mesozoic Era between 220 and 65 million years ago .
The research has been published in the " Proceedings of the Royal Society B : Biological Sciences . "

Politicians ' failure to address what voters have always regarded as one of their top two priorities ( the other is the economy ) has opened the door to the BNP .
Nick Griffin does not owe his opportunity to peddle evil views on tonight 's Question Time to some faulty judgment of the BBC .
His vote in the European elections earned it for him .
And that opportunity only arose because of the political cowardice and irresponsibility of the two main parties – but particularly of the Labour Party .
Poll after poll shows BNP support coming from ex-Labour voters who believe their party has deserted them on immigration , and failed to represent their interests as underdogs in what until recently was a country characterised by unparalleled prosperity .
A U.S. District Court judge in San Jose has awarded Facebook $ 711 million in damages in an anti-spam case the social - networking giant filed against online marketer Sanford Wallace , who is known as the " Spam King . "
The Palo Alto company claimed Wallace and two associates registered as Facebook members in November 2008 to start a spam and phishing scheme .
According to court documents , the firm said Wallace sent numerous Facebook members a link to a Web site that tricked them into revealing their login information .
Some messages sent the Facebook user to other sites that paid Wallace for that traffic .
The spammers would repeat the cycle by logging into the compromised accounts and sending more messages , the suit said .

Facebook claimed there were 14 million violations of the federal anti-spam law known as CAN - SPAM .
In March 2009 , Judge Jeremy Fogel issued a temporary restraining order and then a preliminary injunction against Wallace .
In an order filed Thursday , Fogel said Wallace violated the law " with blatant disregard " for the rights of Facebook and its members .
Fogel also wrote that he is referring Wallace , who did not appear in court for scheduled hearings , to the U.S. attorney 's office for criminal contempt charges for violating the restraining order and the injunction .
Fogel rejected Facebook 's request for $ 7.5 billion in damages .
In November , Facebook won a record $ 873 million judgment against a Canadian resident accused of sending more than 4 million bogus messages from members ' profiles , many advertising male enhancement drugs .
In 2008 , Facebook rival MySpace won a $ 234 million judgment against Wallace and another Internet marketer , Walter Rines .
Wallace , however , filed for bankruptcy in June .
" While we do n't expect to receive the vast majority of the award , we hope that this will act as a continued deterrent against these criminals , " Sam O'Rourke , the company 's associate general counsel , said in a Facebook message .
" This is another important victory in our fight against spam . "
Al Jazeera responds to Obama on the yarmulke issue
In a private meeting a few weeks back , U.S. President Barack Obama reportedly complained to American Jewish leaders that he was being portrayed in the Arab media as too close to Israel .
“ Every time I ’m shown on Al Jazeera they show me at the Western Wall with a yarmulke on , President Obama said , ” according to ABC News .
This morning , I asked Al Jazeera ’s director general , Wadah Khanfar , to respond directly to Obama ’s critique .
Khanfar is in Washington this week — his first - ever trip to D.C. — and the Middle East Institute hosted an on - the - record briefing with him this morning .
“ Of course it ’s not true ” that he ’s only showing wearing a yarmulke , Khanfar said with a smile .
“ I ’m not sure if he ’s watching Al Jazeera . ”
He admitted that the Arabic satellite network did “ show a clip of him wearing the yarmulke ” when he visited Jerusalem , and maybe “ a promotion where it introduces the leader in other ways . ”
But if so , it would have been a promo among other clips , he said , and in any case , Al Jazeera had “ covered his speeches , his policies , far beyond summarizing that one single shot . ”
Khanfar seemed optimistic about the Obama administration , saying that the Middle East had suffered greatly during the past eight years , and that the hostility toward the United States was “ also very harmful for a lot of people in the region . ”
“ Even for Al Jazeera , ” he said , “ America is inspiring , ” pointing out that the network was founded in 1996 on the Western model .
“ People [ in the region ] do not hate America .
People love American values .
People would love to see American values active in their lives . ”
Now , he said , there is a “ new window of opportunity ” for the United States to return to its previous relationship with the Middle East .
Khanfar also defended the satellite channel against charges that it was sensationalist .
Everyone has his own editorial philosophy , ” he said , noting that Al Jazeera had a “ code of conduct and ethics ” and guidelines for its reporters .
Every organization has its own “ spirit of reporting , ” he said , and Al Jazeera ’s ethos was “ putting people at the center ” and not deferring to governments and their “ narrow ” agendas .
“ We put a lot of anger and frustration on the screen , ” he admitted , “ because that is a reality in the Arab state . ”
“ We should not forget that we have the most complicated hotspots in the world , ” he continued .
“ Iraq , Somalia , Yemen , Palestine , Iran … I can count forever …
Mostly every day headlines will be about explosions , suicide bombings , people angry . ”
“ In our case we cannot afford to have comfortable debates about healthcare ” on television , he said with some evident emotion .
What was his agenda in Washington ?
He did n’t say , but one comment offered a clue :
He said that Al Jazeera ’s biggest business priority is distribution in the United States .
The English channel was recently made available on cable in the Washington metro area , something he hoped would be a first step toward broader availability .

Swine flu jab link to killer nerve disease : Leaked letter reveals concern of neurologists over 25 deaths in America
Prevention :
Is the swine flu jab safe ?
A warning that the new swine flu jab is linked to a deadly nerve disease has been sent by the Government to senior neurologists in a confidential letter .
The letter from the Health Protection Agency , the official body that oversees public health , has been leaked to The Mail on Sunday , leading to demands to know why the information has not been given to the public before the vaccination of millions of people , including children , begins .
It tells the neurologists that they must be alert for an increase in a brain disorder called Guillain - Barre Syndrome ( GBS ) , which could be triggered by the vaccine .
GBS attacks the lining of the nerves , causing paralysis and inability to breathe , and can be fatal .
The letter , sent to about 600 neurologists on July 29 , is the first sign that there is concern at the highest levels that the vaccine itself could cause serious complications .
It refers to the use of a similar swine flu vaccine in the United States in 1976 when :
More people died from the vaccination than from swine flu .
500 cases of GBS were detected .
The vaccine may have increased the risk of contracting GBS by eight times .
The vaccine was withdrawn after just ten weeks when the link with GBS became clear .
The US Government was forced to pay out millions of dollars to those affected .
Concerns have already been raised that the new vaccine has not been sufficiently tested and that the effects , especially on children , are unknown .
It is being developed by pharmaceutical companies and will be given to about 13 million people during the first wave of immunisation , expected to start in October .
Top priority will be given to everyone aged six months to 65 with an underlying health problem , pregnant women and health professionals .
The British Neurological Surveillance Unit ( BNSU ) , part of the British Association of Neurologists , has been asked to monitor closely any cases of GBS as the vaccine is rolled out .
One senior neurologist said last night : ‘ I would not have the swine
flu jab because of the GBS risk . ’
There are concerns that there could be a repeat of what became known as the ‘ 1976 debacle ’ in the US , where a swine flu vaccine killed 25 people – more than the virus itself .
A mass vaccination was given the go - ahead by President Gerald Ford because scientists believed that the swine flu strain was similar to the one responsible for the 1918 - 19 pandemic , which killed half a million Americans and 20 million people worldwide .
The swine flu vaccine being offered to children has not been tested on infants
Within days , symptoms of GBS were reported among those who had been immunised and 25 people died from respiratory failure after severe paralysis .
One in 80,000 people came down with the condition .
In contrast , just one person died of swine flu .
More than 40 million Americans had received the vaccine by the time the programme was stopped after ten weeks .
The US Government paid out millions of dollars in compensation to those affected .
The swine flu virus in the new vaccine is a slightly different strain from the 1976 virus , but the possibility of an increased incidence of GBS remains a concern .
Shadow health spokesman Mike Penning said last night : ‘ The last thing we want is secret letters handed around experts within the NHS .
We need a vaccine but we also need to know about potential risks .
‘ Our job is to make sure that the public knows what ’s going on .
Why
is the Government not being open about this ?
It ’s also very worrying if GPs , who will be administering the vaccine , are n’t being warned . ’
Two letters were posted together to neurologists advising them of the concerns .
The first , dated July 29 , was written by Professor Elizabeth Miller , head of the HPA ’s Immunisation Department .
It says : ‘ The vaccines used to combat an expected swine influenza pandemic in 1976 were shown to be associated with GBS and were withdrawn from use .
‘ GBS has been identified as a condition needing enhanced surveillance when the swine flu vaccines are rolled out .
‘ Reporting every case of GBS irrespective of vaccination or disease history is essential for conducting robust epidemiological analyses capable of identifying whether there is an increased risk of GBS in defined time periods after vaccination , or after influenza itself , compared with the background risk . ’
The second letter , dated July 27 , is from the Association of British Neurologists and is written by Dr Rustam Al - Shahi Salman , chair of its surveillance unit , and Professor Patrick Chinnery , chair of its clinical research committee .
Halted :
The 1976 US swine flu campaign
It says : ‘ Traditionally , the BNSU has monitored rare diseases for long periods of time .
However , the swine influenza ( H1N1 ) pandemic has overtaken us and we need every member ’s involvement with a new BNSU survey of Guillain - Barre Syndrome that will start on August 1 and run for approximately nine months .
‘ Following the 1976 programme of vaccination against swine influenza in the US , a retrospective study found a possible eight - fold increase in the incidence of GBS .
‘ Active prospective ascertainment of every case of GBS in the UK is required .
Please tell BNSU about every case .
‘ You will have seen Press coverage describing the Government ’s concern about releasing a vaccine of unknown safety . ’
If there are signs of a rise in GBS after the vaccination programme begins , the Government could decide to halt it .
GBS attacks the lining of the nerves , leaving them unable to transmit signals to muscles effectively .
It can cause partial paralysis and mostly affects the hands and feet .
In serious cases , patients need to be kept on a ventilator , but it can be fatal .
Death is caused by paralysis of the respiratory system , causing the victim to suffocate .
It is not known exactly what causes GBS and research on the subject has been inconclusive .
However , it is thought that one in a million people who have a seasonal flu vaccination could be at risk and it has also been linked to people recovering from a bout of flu of any sort .
The HPA said it was part of the Government ’s pandemic plan to monitor GBS cases in the event of a mass vaccination campaign , regardless of the strain of flu involved .
But vaccine experts warned that the letters proved the programme was a ‘ guinea - pig trial ’ .
Dr Tom Jefferson , co-ordinator of the vaccines section of the influential Cochrane Collaboration , an independent group that reviews research , said : ‘ New vaccines never behave in the way you expect them to .
It may be that there is a link to GBS , which is certainly not something I would wish on anybody .
‘ But it could end up being anything because one of the additives in one of the vaccines is a substance called squalene , and none of the studies we ’ve extracted have any research on it at all . ’
He said squalene , a naturally occurring enzyme , could potentially cause so - far - undiscovered side effects .
Jackie Fletcher , founder of vaccine support group Jabs , said : ‘ The Government would not be anticipating this if they did n’t think there was a connection .
What we ’ve got is a massive guinea - pig trial . ’
Professor Chinnery said : ‘ During the last swine flu pandemic , it was observed that there was an increased frequency of cases of GBS .
No one knows whether it was the virus or the vaccine that caused this .
‘ The purpose of the survey is for us to assess rapidly whether there is an increase in the frequency of GBS when the vaccine is released in the UK .
It also increases consultants ’ awareness of the condition .
Panic over ?
The number of swine flu cases has fallen sharply in the past few weeks
‘ This is a belt - and - braces approach to safety and is not something people should be substantially worried about as it ’s a rare condition . ’
If neurologists do identify a case of GBS , it will be logged on a central database .
Details about patients , including blood samples , will be collected and monitored by the HPA .
It is hoped this will help scientists establish why some people develop the condition and whether it is directly related to the vaccine .
But some question why there needs to be a vaccine , given the risks .
Dr Richard Halvorsen , author of The Truth About Vaccines , said : ‘ For people with serious underlying health problems , the risk of dying from swine flu is probably greater than the risk of side effects from the vaccine .
‘ But it would be tragic if we repeated the US example and ended up with more casualties from the jabs .
‘ I applaud the Government for recognising the risk but in most cases this is a mild virus which needs a few days in bed .
I ’d question why we need a vaccine at all . ’
Professor Miller at the HPA said : ‘ This monitoring system activates pandemic plans that have been in place for a number of years .
We ’ll be able to get information on whether a patient has had a prior influenza illness and will look at whether influenza itself is linked to GBS .
‘ We are not expecting a link to the vaccine but a link to disease , which would make having the vaccine even more important . ’
The UK ’s medicines watchdog , the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency , is already monitoring reported side effects from Tamiflu and Relenza and it is set to extend that surveillance to the vaccine .
A Department of Health spokesperson said : ‘ The European Medicines Agency has strict processes in place for licensing pandemic vaccines .
‘ In preparing for a pandemic , appropriate trials to assess safety and the immune responses have been carried out on vaccines very similar to the swine flu vaccine .
The vaccines have been shown to have a good safety profile .
‘ It is extremely irresponsible to suggest that the UK would use a vaccine without careful consideration of safety issues .
The UK has one of the most successful immunisation programmes in the world . ’

IT WAS HORRENDOUS
Victim : Hilary Wilkinson spent three months in hospital after she was diagnosed with Guillain - Barre Syndrome
When Hilary Wilkinson woke up with muscle weakness in her left arm and difficulty breathing , doctors initially put it down to a stroke .
But within hours , she was on a ventilator in intensive care after being diagnosed with Guillain - Barre Syndrome .
She spent three months in hospital and had to learn how to talk and walk again .
But at times , when she was being fed through a drip and needed a tracheotomy just to breathe , she doubted whether she would survive .
The mother of two , 57 , from Maryport , Cumbria , had been in good health until she developed a chest infection in March 2006 .
She gradually became so weak she could not walk downstairs .
Doctors did not diagnose Guillain - Barre until her condition worsened in hospital and tests showed her reflexes slowing down .
It is impossible for doctors to know how she contracted the disorder , although it is thought to be linked to some infections .
Mrs Wilkinson said : ‘ It was very scary .
I could n’t eat and I could n’t speak .
My arms and feet had no strength and breathing was hard .
I was treated with immunoglobulin , which are proteins found in blood , to stop damage to my nerves .
After ten days , I still could n’t speak and had to mime to nurses or my family .
‘ It was absolutely horrendous and I had no idea whether I would get through it .
You reach very dark moments at such times and wonder how long it can last .
But I ’m a very determined person and I had lots of support . ’
After three weeks , she was transferred to a neurological ward , where she had an MRI scan and nerve tests to assess the extent of the damage .
Still unable to speak and in a wheelchair , Mrs Wilkinson eventually began gruelling physiotherapy to improve her muscle strength and movement but it was exhausting and painful .
Three years later , she is almost fully recovered .
She can now walk for several miles at a time , has been abroad and carries out voluntary work for a GBS Support Group helpline .
She said : ‘ It makes me feel wary that the Government is rolling out this vaccine without any clear idea of the GBS risk , if any .
I would n’t wish it on anyone and it certainly changed my life .
‘ I ’m frightened to have the swine flu vaccine if this might happen again – it ’s a frightening illness and I think more research needs to be done on the effect of the vaccine . ’
Hotline staff given access to confidential records
Confidential NHS staff records and disciplinary complaints could be accessed by hundreds of workers manning the Government ’s special swine flu hotline .
They were able to browse through a database of emails containing doctors ’ and nurses ’
National Insurance numbers , home addresses , dates of birth , mobile phone numbers and scanned passport pages – all details that could be used fraudulently .
And private and confidential complaints sent by hospitals about temporary medical staff – some of whom were named – were also made available to the call - centre workers , who were given a special password to log in to an internal NHS website .
It could be a breach of the Data Protection Act .
The hotline staff work for NHS Professionals , which was set up using taxpayers ’ money to employ temporary medical and administrative staff for the health service .
The not - for - profit company runs two of the Government ’s swine flu call centres – with 300 staff in Farnborough , Hampshire , and 900 in Watford , Hertfordshire .
Shadow Health Secretary Andrew Lansley described the revelations as ‘ disturbing ’ .
Anne Mitchell , a spokeswoman for Unison , said : ‘ There ’s no excuse for such a fundamental breach of personal security .
Action needs to be taken as soon as possible to make sure this does not happen again . ’
A spokeswoman for NHS Professionals would not confirm whether access to the confidential files had been granted .
In a profanity filled tirade in NYC this week , Mickey Rourke lamented the use of the f - word … faggot that is .
Warning , NSFW at all …
Pathetic human being .
Can I have my money back for the Wrestler ?
I do n’t care how much I enjoyed it .
And we soon have to suffer him in the new Iron Man movie .
President Jarrett Barrios of GLAAD was swift to respond …
“ This is a slur that , regardless of what Mickey Rourke has convinced himself that it means , is often the last word that gay people , and gay youth in particular , hear before they ’re bullied , harassed or assaulted .
Rourke is showing himself to be painfully ignorant of how this vulgar , abusive slur feeds a climate of anti-gay hatred , intolerance and violence .
Rourke either needs to figure this out , or media needs to stop giving him a platform for promoting these kinds of slurs . ”
Rourke also received a lot of negative press last November when he threatened to break a “ faggot ” writer ’s legs .

In 1986 , 80 % of fourth - grade girls were dieting .
WSJ reporter Jeffrey Zaslow interviewed 100 of them back then , and recently followed up with a few , asking if they think things are getting better for girls .
The verdict :
It 's even worse .
Advertisement
Furthermore , writes Zaslow , " Those girls I interviewed are 32 and 33 years old now , and when I got back in touch with some of them last week , they said that they and their peers have never escaped society 's obsession with body image .
While none of them descended into eating disorders , some told stories of damaging diets and serious self - esteem issues regarding their weight . "
Gee , I love a happy ending !
In other cheery news , Zaslow 's interviewees were right :
It 's gotten worse .
These days , eating disorders are on the rise , girls as young as five are preoccupied with body image , and " Between 2000 and 2006 , the percentage of girls who believe that they must be thin to be popular rose to 60 % from 48 % . "
Advertisement
For about as long as I 've been literate , journalists have been wringing their hands about little girls ' body image problems in articles like the ones Zaslow wrote then and now .
And yet , it has n't gotten better .
And people still act all shocked when they hear the latest statistics , as if it was OK when only around half of little girls believed thinness was a requirement for being popular — i.e. , being liked — but 60 % , whoa !
That 's just terrible !
The question is , what are we going to do before another 20 years go by , and it 's up to 75 or 80 % , with 100 % of fourth - grade girls dieting and new studies showing that female infants are worried their diapers make their butts look fat ?
For those of you who were horrified by my suggestion that we should focus on encouraging healthy behavior for its own sake and quit freaking out about childhood obesity , this is one reason why I suggest that , and suggest it passionately .
Zaslow notes that Claire Mysko , former director of the American Anorexia Bulimia Association ( and , disclosure , an acquaintance of mine ) , " worries that childhood obesity - prevention efforts can make girls obsessive about weight . "
He also writes that a study published earlier this year in the Journal of Psychosocial Nursing found preoccupation with body image " can be exacerbated by our culture 's increased awareness of obesity , which leaves many non-overweight kids stressed about their bodies . "
( FYI , it also leaves overweight kids stressed about their bodies , but I guess we 're supposed to think that 's OK ; obviously , there 's ample evidence to suggest that feeling ugly , disgusting , frustrated , left out and ashamed leads directly to healthy weight loss .
Just look around you . )

A lot of things have changed since 1986 — including , as Mysko points out , far more extreme retouching of images of the women who represent our culture 's beauty standard — but one of the most obvious should be that we have lost our minds about fat .
Whether or not obesity is as dramatic a public health crisis as we 've been led to believe , the overwhelming message has been that individuals are responsible for solving it .
Which means every day , the news brings dozens of new exhortations to lose weight in order not only to prevent your own early demise , but to lift the burden on our health care system and restore America 's glory .
For all but the thinnest of us , weight loss is cast not merely as a potential step toward better personal health but a moral obligation to society , to your children , to your partner , and to people who do n't want to sit next to a fatty on the subway .

And we 're supposed to be surprised that an overwhelming desire to be as thin as possible is gripping children ever younger and ever more tightly ?
Forgive me if I 'm not .

America 's Moral Panic Over Obesity [ The Atlantic ]
On Thursday , U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar - Kotelly struck another decisive blow to the credibility of the Bush administration ’s detention policies at Guantánamo ( and the continuation of those same policies by Obama ’s Justice Department ) , granting the habeas corpus petition of the Kuwaiti prisoner Fouad al - Rabia , a 50 - year old aeronautical engineer and a father of four , who had been accused of fundraising for Osama bin Laden and running a supply depot for al - Qaeda in Afghanistan ’s Tora Bora mountains .
Announcing her ruling , Judge Kollar - Kotelly ordered the U.S. government " to take all necessary and appropriate diplomatic steps " to arrange his release " forthwith . "
Why the courts are more qualified than the government to appraise the Guantánamo cases
The ruling brings to 30 the number of habeas petitions granted in the wake of the Supreme Court ’s ruling , in June 2008 , that the Guantánamo prisoners have constitutionally guaranteed habeas rights .
Just seven petitions have been refused ( a success rate for the prisoners of 81 percent ) , and as the government dithers about what to do with the remaining 225 prisoners , these statistics confirm yet again — as I have been arguing since President Obama took office — that the courts and the prisoners ’ lawyers , with their long history of dealing with the cases , are better qualified than the government to understand the extent to which those held at Guantánamo were , for the most part , subjected to extremely dubious post - capture intelligence - gathering , based primarily on the " confessions " of other prisoners , or of the prisoners themselves , in situations where coercion or bribery were prevalent .
Just two days ago , the New York Times revealed that the government ’s interagency Guantánamo Task Force , established on Obama ’s second day in office to work out whether to charge or release the prisoners , was struggling with the kind of decisions that the courts are already making , and which they will continue to make , as ordered by the Supreme Court .
The Times explained that " About 80 detainees have been approved for resettlement in other countries , " and that " About 40 other detainees , including the Sept. 11 defendants , have been referred for prosecution in either a military or civilian criminal court , " but that " The cases of more than 100 of the remaining detainees are undergoing a second review by the prosecution teams , who so far have been unable to reach a consensus about whether these prisoners should be transferred to other countries or prosecuted . "
The story of Fouad al - Rabia , which I explain below , ought to demonstrate to the government that much of its caution is misplaced , and that the same applies to its optimism .
Al - Rabia was very probably one of the 40 or so prisoners scheduled to face a trial , and , in addition , the allegations against him were regarded as more serious by the government than those against many — if not the majority — of the 110 or so prisoners who are facing a second government review .
The supposed case against Fouad al - Rabia
In the fantasy world of the " War on Terror , " anyone who met Osama bin Laden was a terrorist fundraiser , and anyone who passed through the Tora Bora mountains to escape the war in Afghanistan in December 2001 was a member of al - Qaeda and / or the Taliban , who had been involved in the inconclusive " final showdown " between al - Qaeda and the U.S .
There were reasons to doubt both allegations , because thousands of people had met bin Laden innocently ( briefly introduced to him at religious gatherings or business meetings ) , and also because thousands of people — civilians as well as soldiers — had fled Afghanistan for Pakistan via the city of Jalalabad at the time of " the battle of Tora Bora . "
In addition , because Osama bin Laden ( as well as other senior al - Qaeda figures , and a number of senior Taliban officials who had supported him ) had safely escaped from Tora Bora , it was also worth considering that the majority of those who were captured were either civilians , caught up in the chaos , or simple foot soldiers who had been too slow or insignificant to have had an opportunity to escape .
Most of the " martyrs " — those who stayed to fight to the death — had achieved their aim , as their corpses littered the mountains after the battle reached its anti-climactic end in mid-December .
For Fouad al - Rabia , sold to U.S. forces by Afghan soldiers who had , in turn , bought him off members of the U.S. - backed Northern Alliance ( the Taliban ’s opponents ) , his long years at Guantánamo , and the relentless interrogations to which he was subjected , led inexorably to both sets of allegations being leveled against him .
In November 2008 , al - Rabia was put forward for a trial by Military Commission ( the " terror trials " introduced by Dick Cheney in November 2001 , and revived by Congress in 2006 , after the Supreme Court ruled them illegal ) and was charged with conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism .
The government alleged that he had worked as a fundraiser for Osama bin Laden in Kuwait and had traveled to Afghanistan on several occasions between June and December 2001 " for the purpose of meeting with bin Laden , " and also alleged that he had been " in charge of an al - Qaeda supply depot at Tora Bora , " where he " distributed supplies to al - Qaeda fighters . "
As I explained at the time ( in a version of the story that I described in greater detail in my book The Guantánamo Files ) :
The problem with this story is that al - Rabia has not denied meeting bin Laden or being present at Tora Bora , but has , over the years , provided detailed explanations of how both events were entirely innocent .
As a good Muslim , he took time out every year to visit those less fortunate than himself and provide humanitarian aid .
In 2001 , his attention was drawn to Afghanistan , and when he visited in June he met various Taliban officials and was also introduced to Osama bin Laden , who , he said , explained that his mission was to force U.S. troops to leave the Arabian Peninsula .
He said that he was shocked that , when he pointed out that this might allow Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait again , " Bin Laden said no problem .
Let Saddam come in and then something would happen and control would come back . "
Al - Rabia said that he then returned to Kuwait and gained approval for a humanitarian mission from the Kuwaiti Joint Relief Council , but explained that his return to Afghanistan coincided with the start of the U.S. - led invasion in October 2001 .
Trapped , like many others , he traveled from city to city in search of an escape route , and eventually … ended up in Jalalabad and joined the exodus into the mountains .
Because of his age and experience , he said he was compelled by a senior figure in al - Qaeda to look after the " issue counter , " where supplies — food and blankets , rather than weapons — were being handed out .
Overweight and suffering from a variety of ailments , al - Rabia said that he was finally allowed to leave the mountains , traveling with a Palestinian , Mahrar al - Quwari , who is also held at Guantánamo [ but was approved for release by a military review board under the Bush administration ] .
He added , however , that , after staying with an Afghan family for a week , they were betrayed to the Northern Alliance .
The U.S. allies then sold them to other Afghans , who imprisoned them in Kabul before turning them over to U.S. forces .
As I also explained , it struck me as highly unlikely that al - Rabia would have been shepherded off the mountains and ultimately betrayed , had he really been associated with al - Qaeda , but in court his lawyers provided an explanation of his experiences in Tora Bora that was even more damning for the government .
As Carol Rosenberg described it in the Miami Herald , his lawyers argued at a four - day hearing last month that " the U.S. military had worn Rabia down through relentless and abusive interrogation to the point where he falsely confessed that he ran a supply depot in the Battle of Tora Bora in Afghanistan in December 2001 . "
Rosenberg also explained that one of his lawyers , David Cynamon , argued that U.S. interrogators had " learned of Rabia ’s Arabic honorific , Abu Abdullah al - Kuwaiti , and confused him with another Kuwaiti who had the same nickname . "
Cynamon explained that a man with that particular nickname ( literally , the Kuwaiti who is the father of Abdullah ) " did handle logistics and supplies " at Tora Bora , but was killed by U.S. bombing .
Speaking to the Miami Herald on Thursday , Cynamon added , " The government ’s so - called case against Mr. al Rabia was based almost entirely on false ‘ confessions ’ wrung out of him by months of clearly improper and abusive interrogation techniques taken right from the playbook of the North Koreans and Chinese Communists .
Our government should be ashamed of itself — first for using such tactics , then for defending them in court .
This is why the writ of habeas corpus matters . "
Following Judge Kollar - Kotelly ’s ruling , the Justice Department provided no comment , and did not indicate whether it will appeal the decision , but I sincerely hope that the government follows the judge ’s advice and repatriates al - Rabia — and another Kuwaiti , Khalid al - Mutairi , whose habeas petition was granted in July — as swiftly as possible , as he has clearly suffered more than enough .
The abuse of Fouad al - Rabia in Guantánamo
The judge ’s full opinion has not yet been made available , but Carol Rosenberg explained that the government ’s case had relied on the fact that " military - intelligence agents had accurately concluded that Rabia was at Tora Bora , " and that it had also attempted to make inferences about the supposed threat he posed by noting that , as a younger man , he had " obtained a master ’s degree from the Daytona Beach campus of Embry Riddle Aeronautical University . "
To me , it sounds innocuous enough that an aeronautical engineer should have studied in the States , but in Guantánamo , anyone who had spent time in the U.S. was regarded as a potential member of a sleeper cell , and , as a result , al - Rabia was subjected to brutal treatment .
Three British men released in March 2004 — the so - called " Tipton Three , " whose story was dramatized in the film " The Road To Guantánamo " — explained that al - Rabia , like dozens of other prisoners , was subjected to prolonged sleep deprivation , in the program known euphemistically as " the frequent flier program . "
This involved moving prisoners from cell to cell every few hours , over a period of days , weeks or even months , supposedly to wear down their resistance ( although in reality , as a recognizable form of torture , it was more likely to cause severe mental anguish and allied physical side - effects ) .
The men reported that al - Rabia was moved every two hours , leaving him " suffering from serious depression , losing weight in a substantial way , and very stressed because of the constant moves , deprived of sleep and seriously worried about the consequences for his children . "
Al - Rabia was also subjected to the malign policy whereby medical staff at Guantánamo were co-opted as part of the interrogation process .
His lawyers explained that , although he suffered from serious stomach pains , he was told that he " could n’t receive medication unless he cooperated " with the interrogators .
It is not known if this contributed to the false confessions identified in court , but despite the litany of cruelty and incompetence outlined above , the most startling fact concerning al - Rabia ’s long detention and his final exoneration is that those overseeing Guantánamo were told in the summer of 2002 , by a senior CIA intelligence analyst , who , almost uniquely , was also an Arabic expert , that al - Rabia had been wrongly detained .
What the CIA knew , and how it was ignored by David Addington
In The Dark Side , Jane Mayer explained how the analyst had conducted interviews with a random sample of the prisoners , and how his conclusion — that one - third of the men held at the time " had no connection to terrorism whatsoever " — was brushed off by David Addington , Cheney ’s Legal Counsel , when John Bellinger , the Legal Advisor to the National Security Council , and General John Gordon , the NSC ’s senior terrorism expert , learned of the agent ’s report and tried to reveal the information to President Bush , to ask him to urgently review the cases of the men held at Guantánamo .
According to two sources who told Mayer about the meeting , Addington dismissed their concerns by declaring , imperiously , " No , there will be no review .
The President has determined that they are ALL enemy combatants .
We are not going to revisit it ! "
This , as Mayer noted , was the crux of the government ’s position , as articulated by those who were dictating the policy from the Office of the Vice President .
Mayer wrote , " The President had made a group - status identification , as far as he was concerned .
To Addington , it was a matter of presidential power , not a question of individual guilt or innocence . "
One of the men who particularly suffered because of Addington and Cheney ’s counter - productive arrogance was Fouad al - Rabia , who is the man described by the CIA analyst in an interview with Mayer as follows :
One man was a rich Kuwaiti businessman who took a trip to a different part of the world every year to do charity work .
In 2001 , the country he chose was Afghanistan .
" He was n’t a jihadi , but I told him he should have been arrested for stupidity , " the CIA officer recalled .
The man was furious with the United States for rounding him up .
He mentioned that every year up until then , he had bought himself a new Cadillac , but when he was released , he said , he would never buy another American car .
He was switching to Mercedes .
This is another small piece of evidence to add to the burgeoning file of complaints against Dick Cheney and David Addington ( the one that begins with torture and calls for prosecution , but also includes a whole section on arrogance and incompetence ) , but it amazes me that no one in the Justice Department , under President Obama , investigated the CIA analyst ’s report , and , instead , stuck to the allegations put forward by military prosecutors in the Bush administration ’s Military Commission system ( overseen by the Convening Authority Susan Crawford , a protégée of Dick Cheney and a close friend of David Addington ) , and advanced mindlessly towards another humiliation in court .
Internet users and online advertising have always had a complex relationship .
The ads pay for the content and services that many users find essential , but on many sites , advertisements have become increasingly intrusive and processor - intensive .
That 's led to the development of software , like ClickToFlash , that limits the intrusiveness .
One of the latest incidents in the ongoing battle over advertising involves file - hosting sites , which support the service by showing ads to users as they download files .
One of these sites , MediaFire , is bothered by a Firefox plugin called SkipScreen which automates the user straight past the ads .
Instead of going after the software 's developers , however , they 've apparently targeted Mozilla , which hosts a link to the plugin .
File hosting sites provide a useful service for anyone who does n't have the wherewithal , either technological or financial , to host large files .
Files can be uploaded simply via a browser to free accounts , and then links to the download shared with anyone — it 's a bit like a media - agnostic YouTube .
These sites obviously do n't make money from the free accounts .
Instead , they try to convince users to upgrade to premium services ( more storage space , no file size limits , etc. ) , and by showing ads to anyone who does any downloading .
Depending on the service , those ads can require several click - throughs before the bits actually start to flow .
Another gimmick is forcing users to wait as long as two minutes to begin the download .
So , it 's no real surprise that enterprising coders decided to smooth over the process .
SkipScreen is programmed to recognize data within the HTML of many popular services , and use that to get straight through to the underlying file .
To some extent , this is just an extension of Firefox 's existing capabilities .
We tested a MediaFire download , and found it tried to open a full - screen popup ad during the process , which the browser happily blocked for us .
SkipScreen , however , went quite a bit beyond the call of duty .
Not only did it start the download without any user intervention , but as soon as the file started downloading , it replaced the MediaFire page with one of its own making that 's largely an ad for SkipScreen itself , with a Google - supplied text ad thrown in as well .
It 's no surprise that the people behind MediaFire are a bit annoyed by this , but they 've gone after an unexpected target : Mozilla , which hosts a download link for SkipScreen as part of its collection of Firefox plugins .
In a letter sent to Mozilla , the company accuses the SkipScreen developers of " hiding their contact information behind their hosting company , " although it 's not clear whether MediaFire attempted to use the available e-mail address for the developers .
In any case , the letter demands that Mozilla cease " promotion , indexing , and distribution " of the plugin , claiming that it violates MediaFire 's acceptable use policy and " steals costly bandwidth . "
The SkipScreen developers , however , have gotten the Electronic Frontier Foundation to take up their case .
In a letter that has also been sent to Mozilla , the EFF calls MediaFire 's claim 's " baseless , " arguing , " SkipScreen , like many other add - ons , simply automates certain browser tasks in order to improve the user experience . "
The letter points out that only users who set up accounts agree to the company 's acceptable use policy ; downloaders just go straight through to the file .
Furthermore , it notes , there 's no real difference in total bandwidth use for downloads initiated with or without the plugin .
Mozilla has a pretty clear set of rules for its Firefox add - ons , but the only one that might apply in these circumstances is prohibition of the following : " Add -ons that clearly violate terms of service for websites , e.g. , spam generators , flooding messages , denial of service attacks , extreme server load generators , etc . "
It would appear that MediaFire wrote its complaint with this in mind , given its emphasis on acceptable use violations .
In any case , the whole idea of attempting to get SkipScreen off of Mozilla 's plugin site may end up backfiring .
SkipScreen can be installed regardless of where it 's downloaded from , and an extended exchange of lawyer - generated , threatening letters will do little more than raise the software 's profile .
Business Ideas That Work For Everyone
Is there a money making business opportunity that works for everyone ?
Does it really exist ?
Can I make an insane amount of money even when I do n't have any specific skills ?
If these are similar questions you have been pondering upon lately , then let me tell you that the answer to all of your questions is a great big ' YES ' .
GameStop director Leonard Riggio has sold 2.3 million shares in the company , in a move that analysts say might be a sign of pessimism on the retailer 's near - term prospects .
Riggio -- also board chairman and founder of the Barnes & Noble bookstore chain , which used to own GameStop -- earned $ 60.2 million through the sale , and lowers his stake in the company to 5.5 percent from 6.9 percent .
" Unless he desperately needs $ 60 million , " it appears that he does n't think the stock is going to be performing very well , insider trading firm Form4 Oracle co-founder Alex Romayev told financial magazine Barron 's .
" He 's got a lot bigger stake in Barnes & Noble .
Clearly he thinks selling GameStop is better than selling Barnes & Noble .
" Most analysts have been generally positive on the retailer 's prospects ahead of the key holiday season , thanks to hardware price cuts , improved year - over - year comparisons likely ahead , and the view of retailers like Best Buy that consumer foot traffic is about to make a return But Romayev told Barron 's that the last time Riggio made a GameStop shares sale not related to options , he divested just in time to avoid a 62 percent loss .

Activating a small fraction of neurons triggers complete memory .
Just as a whiff of pumpkin pie can unleash powerful memories of holiday dinners , the stimulation of a tiny number of neurons can evoke entire memories , new research in mice suggests .
Shining light on mouse neurons caused them to remember .
Photolibrary
Memories are stored in neurons distributed across a host of brain regions .
When something triggers a memory , that diffuse information is immediately and cohesively reactivated , but it 's unclear how the circuit gets kicked into full gear .
Over the past few years , a handful of studies have suggested that a small number of neurons — perhaps even single neurons — can trigger sensations 1,2,3 .
But this idea remains controversial and has never been demonstrated with memory .
Now , Michael Häusser and his colleagues at the the Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research at University College London have developed a way to activate a small subset of the neural circuit that underlies a specific memory .
They found that this handful of neurons was able to activate the rest of the circuit and get animals to recall the memory .
The team 's findings were presented in Chicago at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience4 .
" I was surprised that such a small spark could bring the memory back to life , " Häusser says .
" It gets at a fundamental question in memory research : what fraction of the cells in a network that are used to store information are required to reactivate that memory ? "
Genetic trickery
To target the neurons involved in memory formation , Häusser 's group used a combination of genetic tricks .
The researchers took advantage of a gene called c-fos — which is expressed by recently activated neurons — and used the portion that controls gene expression to turn on the light - sensitive protein channelrhodopsin .
They inserted the gene for the c-fos - controlled channelrhodopsin into cells in a portion of the hippocampus that is known to have a crucial role in memory formation .
Häusser and his team then trained mice to associate a painful electric shock with a tone .
Whenever the mice heard the tone they would stop moving , bracing themselves for the imminent shock .
When the neurons involved in remembering the association fired during the learning process , c - fos became activated .
And for the small number of neurons that had received the gene , the light - sensitive channel was activated too .
" We basically get the brain to select the cells that express the channel , " says team member Kate Powell .
" The stronger the cells are activated , the stronger the channel is going to be expressed .
We 're really getting the cells that are most important for the memory . "
Neurons that express channelrhodopsin will fire when exposed to blue light .
When the researchers shined blue light onto the hippocampus using a laser and an implanted fibre - optic cable , the mice promptly froze , suggesting that the light had triggered the fearful memory .
Activating about a hundred cells , and as few as 20 cells , was enough to trigger the memory .
But when the group inserted channelrhodopsin into random cells in the hippocampus , they were unable to make the mice freeze — indicating that only the cells that were activated during memory formation can trigger the memory .
" It 's a remarkably small number of neurons , when such a huge number is thought to be involved , " says Powell .
There are about one to two million cells in this region of the hippocampus , she says , and between 5 – 15 % are activated during the fear - learning process .
Häusser says he wants to try to target smaller and smaller populations to find out the minimum number required to evoke the memory .
" The brain is very efficient in terms of its storage and processing .
There are lots of computational and energetic and wiring advantages to having a small number of cells being effective , " he says .
Light touch
A couple of recent papers have shown that precise , light - controlled activation of certain brain areas can affect memory formation , but these were not specific to the circuit underlying the memory5,6 .
" It 's a beautiful demonstration , and a very clever , very precise technique , " says neuroscientist Serge Charpak at INSERM , France 's main biomedical research agency , in Paris .
" I certainly would n't have expected so few neurons to be enough to get this behaviour . "
" So far all manipulations of neural activity have targeted local clusters of neurons or certain neural cell types , " adds Michael Brecht at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Berlin , who studies neural circuitry .
" If the conclusions turn out to be correct , such highly selective manipulations suggest that the brain might actually compute with small , precisely selected sets of neurons . "
The latter idea started to gain support in the field only recently , and is " a major departure from the mass action views of neural activity that were taught just 10 years ago " , says Brecht .

The authors note that the fear - conditioning paradigm , although robust and thoroughly studied , is a crude probe .
They hope to be able to use their genetic tool to probe more subtle memories , and to search for other regions of the circuit that might be able to trigger the behaviour .
" It 's really cool that you can select cells based on their activity , " says Powell .
" It gives us a lot of options for investigating memory in a new way . "
Thursday morning 's GDC Austin keynote was met with a large crowd as Blizzard Entertainment 's J. Allen Brack and Frank Pearce took the stage to offer a detailed look into the inner workings of the genre - dominating World of Warcraft .
Introduced by BioWare 's Rich Vogel , the two men completed a three - part series run by GDCA on the inner workings of the gaming powerhouse .
Vogel introduced the two with word that they'd be focusing on the company 's operations , and Brack began by separating the " universe " of World of Warcraft ( its design , production , and implementation ) from the in - game universe of barbarian shamanism and magical power .
He admitted that the company tends to hold things fairly close to the vest , but today their intent was to share some of the ' behind the scenes ' elements rarely considered by company outsiders .
World of Warcraft was launched on a foundation of 10 years of Warcraft RTS games .
Brack noted the first appearance of the yellow exclamation point in the Warcraft III title , and the RPG - focused elements of the Orc Campaign in the Frozen Throne expansion .
The World of Warcraft team , which split from Warcraft III , was actually working on a squad - based RPG called Nomad prior to their shift in focus .
The game featured haunting alien imagery , but it was something that they ultimately could n't find a voice for .
After months of pre-production struggle , they set aside Nomad and began work on WoW ; " What would we do if we wanted to start a project today ? " was the question they asked .
The answer : an MMO .
Management , Programming , Art , and Production
Within the World of Warcraft team , there are some 30 department leads .
There are three tiers of management , with France Pierce ( Executive Producer ) on top .
Production Director Brack and Game Director Tom Chilton are below him , and below those two men are arrayed 8 lower - level managers .
Brack notes that they try to structure the teams around the people , and not the other way around .
They feel strongly that employee strengths should dictate organizational structure , and as a result all reporting structures within the company vary by team .
Each team on the game aims to be made up of 5 - 8 people .
They break that regularly , Brack admits , but that is the goal .
The programming department currently consists of 32 people , and envelopes systems , tools , gameplay , server technologies , and UI .
Brack singled out the tools team as a critical component of this group .
They make tools not only for the developers , but for customer service as well .
Blizzard has an expectation of a long life for World of Warcraft , and so they see these tools as products to be fully - supported in - house .
These tools go through their own proofing process , with certification dictated within the company .
Their UI team is a cross - disciplinary team with artists , LUA programmers , and C++ developers all collaborating on the game 's front end .
In all , the programming team is responsible for some 5.5 million lines of code .
The art department is currently sitting at 51 people .
Technical artists , character artists , environmental artists , dungeon artists , prop artists , animators , and concept artists are all lumped into this group .
The prop team Brack calls out as a new group , a team dedicated entirely to creating wheels of cheese , torches , and other accoutrements to make a place within the game world feel ' alive ' .
Overall the art department is responsible for some 1.5 million assets .
Pearce moves on to the Production department , only 10 members strong .
They 're overseeing of all the other departments , and view themselves more as support than management per se .
They aim for low ratio of employees to producers , to ensure that every Blizzard employee is getting somewhat individual attention .
Creative teams to not report to producers , he pointed out .
Team leads , instead , take up leadership roles within individual departments .
The art lead , for example , still creates art .
Creative employees report to the men and women that best understand their individual process .
In turn , producers and leads collaborate to ensure that everyone understands their role .
Leads are not forced into management / leadership roles they are n't comfortable with .
Pearce notes the importance of what he called ' succession planning . '
Producers help each team to understand who would be tapped in the future to take on a leadership role should the current lead step down , as well as plot out the future careers of individual employees .
Overall production has managed 33,000 tasks in the last ten years .
Design , Cinematics , Sound , and Platform
The design department , some 37 members strong , came up next .
Class designers , profession designers , itemization designers , level designers , event designers , encounter and lead designers are all grouped here .
Brack points out the multi-disciplinary nature of the level creation team .
They use WoWEdit to incorporate art assets and create the zones in the game .
The events team is responsible for not only holidays like Hallow 's End , but also static world components like the city of Dalaran and the new and popular Argent Tournament .
Over the years , the team has created some 70,000 spells and some 40,000 NPCs .
The cinematics group was the next to be pointed out by Pearce .
Machinima sequences , teasers , and the amazing pre-rendered cinemas that make Blizzard games kick off with a flash are all created in this group .
As a talented group of artists , they also use this group to direct the creation of sword replicas , statues , and other physical objects .
The group is 123 people strong , and Pearce notes that they could actually spend a whole talk just talking about how cinematics is organized .
The in - house sound department was next on the block for Brack .
Handling sound effects , music , voice casting and recording are all partner projects with this team .
The group 's audio director is a talented composer , and has ended up composing a number of pieces for the game .
There are over 27 hours of music in World of Warcraft currently , and Brack jokes that fully half of some patches for the game are audio files .
Platform services was the next group detailed , incorporating technologies for all of the games across the company , Macintosh development , QA , localization , and QA for in - house elements .
There are some 245 people in this department , one of the largest in the company .
Brack drilled down into the QA group , noting their sometimes inglorious role to test every patch and gold master .
The size of their workload continually grows .
World of Warcraft kicked off with some 2600 quests .
They added 2700 quests in the Burning Crusade expansion and another 2350 quests in the Wrath of the Lich King drop .
A total of 7650 quests in the game makes it very challenging to maintain and track all of the game 's content .
The QA group has tackled some 180,000 bugs since the game launched .
Localization , Technical Services , International Offices , and Online Services
Localization translates and culturalizes World of Warcraft into 10 different languages , and Pearce notes that there are actually more people playing WoW outside of the English language servers than inside .
The capability to do all of this work in - house is incredibly important , and as a result they have no ' partial ' localizations .
It 's not just translation and localization , they view a new language as an ongoing commitment to all the players on those servers .
They actually have a dedicated producer working with this group to ensure that they have all the resources they need .
Choosing to launch in a new language is a decision they do n't make lightly , and Pearce points out that this group currently tracks 360,000 text strings and some 2 million words .
The technical services group is dedicated to getting every patch to the players .
Patch 3.1 pushed some 4.7 petabytes of data to the players .
Brack points out that they actually have to do some 10 patches for any given patch they do because of the numerous languages they support .
QA has to test every patch they release , and there are actually 126 types of patches ( streaming , universal , incremental ) that all have to be updated and supported .
A monumental task , Brack says .
The Blizzard Online Network services group is Pearce 's next focus .
A huge group , they have data centers from Texas to Seoul , and monitor over 13,250 server blades , 75,000 cpu cores , and 112.5 terabytes of blade RAM .
He points out the picture of the GNOC in their slideshow , a data core that even has televisions tuned to the weather stations .
They use those to ensure that conditions of the data center are up to their standards ; with only a staff of 68 people they ensure connectivity across the globe for the numerous WoW servers .
International offices handle local market conditions , games that are released in other countries , and the occasional censorship issue prompted by a government .
They also handle local marketing as well , ensuring it meets with regional sensibilities .
There are hundreds of people in all these offices across the globe .
Brack went on to talk about the customer support staff , a group with 2,056 game masters , 340 billing managers , and a host of other background staffers .
These tireless staffers also work from locations around the world , ensuring that any local variations in culture ( or the game ) are respected .
Pearce then focused on the Online Services team , a group that includes the important gaming service Battle .
net .
Pearce gave a quick overview of the many new features coming to the service such as Battle .
net - wide friends , integrated billing , and a number of other new features .
Online Services specifically handle login technologies and billing elements for World of Warcraft .
There are now 12,000,000 Battle.net accounts , and they look forward to the eventual seamless integration of that community and the WoW community .
Web , Community , PR , et al
The Web team was Brack 's next group to discuss , a team responsible for managing a host of websites , online stores , the WoW Armory , and promotional materials .
The mobile technologies team at Blizzard is grouped under this umbrella as well , and Brack calls out the mobile armory and the mobile authenticator as products they 've previously released .
They currently manage some 900,000 web files .
The corporate applications team is the company 's internal tools team for activities " around " the game .
They work to do fraud prevention , maintain bug tracking , keep a look out for upcoming trojans and spyware , maintain the internal wiki , and are responsible for the WoW team 's internal data mining .
This is the group that ensures the designers know exactly what is popular and what is n't in the game .
Pearce jokes that the achievements system has been especially popular with WoW players and to date the players have unlocked some 4,449,680,399 rewards .
The PR and community teams were Brack 's next focus , the groups responsible for public interaction .
The PR team has helped to ensure some 10,000 articles have been written about World of Warcraft , while the community team acts as a liason between the players and the team itself .
The 66 members of the community team ensures that civility is maintained on the game forums , and produce the always popular " blue posts " .
The eSports group is responsible for all of the Tournament - related activities .
Their budget includes prize money , travel arrangement money , and venue arrangements , and they ensure that professional gamers are tied directly into the WoW / Blizzard organization .
To date they 've hosted almost 1640 events .
The events team proper is responsible for organizing BlizzCon , getting employees to events like GDCA , and coordinating with other consumer conferences .
Brack notes the new addition of streaming viewers via DirecTV this year , and the explosive acts of Jay Mohr and Ozzy Osborne .
With streaming viewers , BlizzCon had 100,000 participants this year -- and although it loses money for the company as a standalone event , it 's incredibly important for marketing reasons .
Marketing , the next group on the docket , handles box creation , web campaigns , TV commercials , partner promotions ( such as WoW - themed Mountain Dew ) , and in - game promotions like refer -a - friend or the scroll of resurrection .
They 're obviously very successful , as their commercials have seen over 10,000,000 views since Blizzard 's television advertising campaign began .
Licensing , a related group within the company , handles novel publishing , comics , strategy guides , the upcoming WoW magazine , apparel , plushies , action figures , games , and endless other tie-ins .
Their role is to pair the right products with the right brand , and to date they 've helped to release 400 products with Blizzard properties .
The creative development team is the hub for the company 's history .
They have two full - time lore historians , keepers of blizzard 's past .
They are the liaisons with the novelists , work to create shared art resources , act as an archive for every piece of art that 's been created for Blizzard Entertainment , and currently maintain 100,000 art assets .
Pearce takes a moment to note that the World of Warcraft team also has the capability to tap into the resources of other development groups within the company .
He singles out the StarCraft 2 team as helpful for getting the original game out the door .
Strike teams from these other groups are also helpful in evaluating World of Warcraft content without the connection that the team members already have , impartial observers for new content .
Brack notes that WoW also taps all of the other ' background ' departments in the company .
Finance , Human Resources , Facilities groups , the legal team , and of course the IT team all support the massive undertaking that is World of Warcraft .
Making the World Work
As an organization , World of Warcraft utilizes 20,000 computer systems , 1.3 petabytes of storage , and more than 4600 people .
" Operating an online game is about more than just game development . "
Pearce hopes that the importance of these non-development groups is obvious , especially given the explosive growth of the company over the last five years .
" World of Warcraft has completely changed the organization " , and it would n't have been possible without the departments that they 'd singled out .
Banks and the recovery will dominate the finance ministers ' agenda Deepening divisions have appeared among international finance ministers , meeting in London , about how to curb excessive bank bonuses .
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde has promised to launch an " onslaught " against large payouts .
The UK has dismissed the idea , while other countries remain concerned about how best to recover from the recession .
The issues are set to dominate a meeting of the G20 group of leading developed and emerging economies .
At their meeting - a preparatory session for the next full G20 summit - G20 finance ministers will consider whether recent signs of economic improvement should be followed by a reverse of some of the emergency measures implemented to stimulate the global economy .
France , Germany and Japan have all shown positive growth in recent months .
At the opening of the meeting on Saturday , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown warned that withdrawing government support too early could undermine economic recovery .
" The IMF argue and Mr Strauss - Kahn ( head of the IMF ) is here to say this , fiscal policies should continue to support economic activity until economic recovery has taken hold .
" It is clear in my view that too early a withdrawal of vital support could undermine the tentative signs of recovery we are now seeing and lead to a further downward lurch in business and consumer confidence , reducing growth and employment and actually worsening governments ' debt positions over the longer term . "
' Rules ' on bonuses Mr Brown also called for consistent rules on bankers ' pay and bonuses .
" We can not accept a return to the past ways of governance .
Specifically , pay and bonuses cannot reward failure or encourage unacceptable risk taking , " he said .
Outlining her opposition to the bonus culture , Mrs Lagarde earlier told the BBC that bonuses had contributed to the global financial crisis and needed to be capped .
Lagarde said the world was still suffering from events a year ago " What happened 12 months ago was just horrible for our societies , it was horrible for our economies , and we are still suffering as a result , " she said .
France is proposing a series of mandatory caps on bonuses - which the head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers , Luxembourg 's Jean - Claude Juncker , said he " totally supported " .
But Britain 's Chancellor Alistair Darling has described the idea of a cap as " unworkable " , instead favouring rules linking bankers ' pay to long - term performance .
The BBC understands that Chancellor Alastair Darling will propose that bonus payments be paid out over five years and only in the form of stock options .
The plan envisages that the bulk of the bonus be paid in the final two years of that five year period and includes claw - back clauses .
The suggestion by Mr Darling goes some way to meet the concerns of many other EU governments who had suggested an outright cap on bonuses , says the BBC's Joe Lynham .
US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is also understood to be opposed to a cap on bonuses .
He is pressing for new measures to prevent a repeat of the banking crisis , says BBC economics correspondent Andew Walker .
Mr Geithner wants banks to hold more capital to protect themselves against losses .
Emerging economies warn Holding a mini-summit away from the G20 meeting , ministers from emerging economies Brazil , Russia , India and China ( Bric ) called for caution , warning it was " too early " to talk of an end to the crisis .
The global economy still faces great uncertainty , and significant risks remain to economic and financial stability
Bric statement
Finance ministers face tough talks G20 : Economic summit snapshot
The huge cash injections pumped into businesses by governments around the world could not be withdrawn in a hurry without causing new problems , they said .
Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega added that " the exit should be gradual " as withdrawing state aid to economies too quickly " would not send a good signal to the markets " .
" The global economy still faces great uncertainty , and significant risks remain to economic and financial stability , " the four countries , known as the Bric quartet , said after their mini-summit .
Of European nations , Germany wants the G20 countries to start discussing when and how to withdraw stimulus measures , but fellow European Union members have been reluctant .
Ms Lagarde said the timing of any withdrawal was something that " God only knows " .

Capt Lake was known by his French field name Jean - Pierre Lenormand A British officer who trained French Resistance fighters during World War II was told to " go home " by Charles de Gaulle , newly released files show .
Peter Lake was awarded the Military Cross and France 's Croix de Guerre for his actions in the run-up to D - Day .
But just three months after the Allied landings , the leader of Free France told him he had " no business " there .
Mr Lake died in June aged 94 , but his account of the meeting has been released by the National Archives .
It is contained within his Special Operations Executive personnel file and describes a meeting with Gen de Gaulle in the town of Saintes , south - west France , on 18 September 1944 .
Nom de guerre Mr Lake , then a captain , spoke fluent French and was known by the field name Jean - Pierre Lenormand .
He decided to join a number of French officers who went along to greet the general , but was surprised by the conversation that followed .
We do n't need you here .
You too must go home .
Au revoir
General de Gaulle General de Gaulle : " Jean - Pierre , that 's a French name . "
Mr Lake : " My nom de guerre , mon general . "
Gen de Gaulle : " What are you doing here ? " Mr Lake : " I belong to the Inter - Allied Mission for Dordogne , and I am at the moment with Dordogne troops at Marennes , mon general . "
Gen de Gaulle : " But what are you doing here ? " Mr Lake : " I am training certain troops for special operations . "
Gen de Gaulle : " Our troops do n't need training .
You have no business here . "
Mr Lake : " I obey the orders of my superiors . "
Gen de Gaulle : " You have no business here , I say .
You have no right to exercise a command . "
Mr Lake : " Mon general , I exercise no command . "
Gen de Gaulle : " We do n't need you here .
It only remains for you to leave .
You too must go home .
Return , return quickly .
Au revoir . "
Later , Mr Lake noted : " The whole dialogue passed very quickly and in a tone of voice which there was no mistaking .
" It was so unexpected that I must confess I was far too taken aback to reply intelligently , and I think the majority of those present had similar reactions . "
Capt Lake was parachuted into France in April 1944
Despite the incident , Mr Lake was highly regarded by senior Army commanders and was referred to in an official report as " modest , unassuming , but possessed of considerable authority " .
" His dust - up with de Gaulle showed him to be a good diplomat , level - headed and intelligent , " the report added .
Mr Lake was parachuted into the Dordogne on the night of 9 April 1944 and immediately began training teams of resistance operatives .
To do this he organised " evening classes " in subjects such as sabotage , but recalled that his first sortie was with fighters who were " armed like pirates , behaved like pirates and expected me to do likewise " .
After the D - Day landings on 6 June , Mr Lake said the situation became " very precarious " as the Germans stepped up attacks on the resistance .
Nevertheless , in mid-June he carried out a daring operation to blow up a major railway line .
Mr Lake returned to Britain in October 1944 and went on to have a successful career with the UK consular service .

Incredibly , no smash - ups .
But I 'm wondering WTF were they doing !?!
If you 're planning on dressing up in a homemade Jason Vorhees or Freddy Krueger costume or any other movie character , beware .
The Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) will be cracking down on the unlicensed Halloween costumes of trick - or - treaters and party goers across the United States .
In a press release sent out yesterday to media outlets , the MPAA announced that Licensed Costume Patrol ( LCP ) vans would be patrolling neighborhoods and checking costumes for proper licensing .
The costumes will be confiscated and a lawsuit filed , if the costume is not from a licensed costume vendor .
" We 'll also be collecting the candy of the costume wearer , " said MPAA president and COO Bob Pisano .
" We are entitled to any proceeds gained by use of an unlicensed costume , that includes candy . "
Pisano noted that the candy would be donated to studios , so they can use it in lobbies and waiting rooms .
" This will help them defray some of the revenue lost to these pirates , " said Pisano .
Ironically , dressing as a pirate is legal unless the costume strays too close to Captain Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies .
Cease and desist orders have already been received by several Web sites with instructions on making trademark and copyright - infringing costumes .
" Studios reap large profits from character licensing , and we can't have people dressing up as Indiana Jones without paying for it .
How can studios finance movies like Transformers 2 : Rise of the Fallen if your son dresses up as Optimus Prime without the $ 200 licensing fee , " said Pisano .
Related News MPAA Lobbying for Home Theater Regulations MPAA to Thwart Pirates by Making All Movies Suck Alternate Universe Congress Passes PRO Freedom Act " With trick - or - treating a widespread practice across America , the LCP wo n't be able to cover every neighborhood .
So we 've created profiles of neighborhoods to find the ones most likely to steal from us , " said Pisano .
" Areas where people are ' into crafts ' or ' like sewing ' or ' poor ' will be targeted . "
To help parents determine if their child 's costume is properly licensed the MPAA has set up a Web site at mpaa.org / trickortheft .
There , parents can tell how close their homemade costume can look to a protected movie character without infringing .
It also lists stores where legal costumes can be purchased .
" It 's never too early to teach kids the dangers of intellectual property theft , " said Pisano .
" You take a kid 's candy away now , and he 'll never want to violate intellectual property rights again . "

LP has been mentioned a number of times on LtU but never featured as a topic of discussion in its own right .
On the face of it , it seems like an eminently sensible way to program .
Why has n't it taken the whole world by storm ?
Knuth puts forward Jon Bentley 's observation as one possible answer : " a small percentage of the world 's population is good at programming , and a small percentage is good at writing ; apparently [ Knuth is ] asking everybody to be in both subsets . "
To discuss this and other theories on their merits , a quick refresher on the basics of LP is in order .
As usual , the relevant Wikipedia article is informative but bland .
As Knuth pointed out , original sources are often best .
Here are two good ones :
The second paper is the more interesting of the two .
It contains a literate program by Knuth and a review of the same by McIlroy :
Knuth has shown us here how to program intelligibly , but not wisely .
I buy the discipline .
I do not buy the result .
He has fashioned a sort of industrial - strength FabergÃ© egg -- intricate , wonderfully worked , refined beyond all ordinary desires , a museum piece from the start .
I , too , buy the discipline for programming in the small but can't really see how CWEB - like systems can be adapted to and adopted by multi- hacker teams working on very large code bases written in a mixture of different languages .
Ramsey 's Literate Programming on a Team Project enumerates some of the problems .
Can LP be used for anything other than small - to - medium programs written by a single person in a single language ?

10 Myths About Canadian Health Care , Busted
By Sara Robinson
TomPaine.com
February 5 , 2008
2008 is shaping up to be the election year that we finally get to have the Great American Healthcare Debate again .
Harry and Louise are back with a vengeance .
Conservatives are rumbling around the talk show circuit bellowing about the socialist threat to the ( literal ) American body politic .
And , as usual , Canada is once again getting dragged into the fracas , shoved around by both sides as either an exemplar or a warning — and , along the way , getting coated with the obfuscating dust of so many willful misconceptions that the actual facts about How Canada Does
It are completely lost in the melee .
I ’m both a health - care - card - carrying Canadian resident and an uninsured American citizen who regularly sees doctors on both sides of the border .
As such , I ’m in a unique position to address the pros and cons of both systems first - hand .
If we ’re going to have this conversation , it would be great if we could start out ( for once ) with actual facts , instead of ideological posturing , wishful thinking , hearsay , and random guessing about how things get done up here .
To that end , here ’s the first of a two - part series aimed at busting the common myths Americans routinely tell each other about Canadian health care .
When the right - wing hysterics drag out these hoary old bogeymen , this time , we need to be armed and ready to blast them into straw .
Because , mostly , straw is all they ’re made of .
1. Canada ’s health care system is “ socialized medicine . ”
False .
In socialized medical systems , the doctors work directly for the state .
In Canada ( and many other countries with universal care ) , doctors run their own private practices , just like they do in the US .
The only difference is that every doctor deals with one insurer , instead of 150 .
And that insurer is the provincial government , which is accountable to the legislature and the voters if the quality of coverage is allowed to slide .
The proper term for this is “ single - payer insurance . ”
In talking to Americans about it , the better phrase is “ Medicare for all . ”
2. Doctors are hurt financially by single - payer health care .
True and False .
Doctors in Canada do make less than their US counterparts .
But they also have lower overhead , and usually much better working conditions .
A few reasons for this :
First , as noted , they do n’t have to charge higher fees to cover the salary of a full - time staffer to deal with over a hundred different insurers , all of whom are bent on denying care whenever possible .
In fact , most Canadian doctors get by quite nicely with just one assistant , who cheerfully handles the phones , mail , scheduling , patient reception , stocking , filing , and billing all by herself in the course of a standard workday .
Second , they do n’t have to spend several hours every day on the phone cajoling insurance company bean counters into doing the right thing by their patients .
My doctor in California worked a 70 - hour week : 35 hours seeing patients , and another 35 hours on the phone arguing with insurance companies .
My Canadian doctor , on the other hand , works a 35 - hour week , period .
She files her invoices online , and the vast majority are simply paid — quietly , quickly , and without hassle .
There is no runaround .
There are no fights .
Appointments are n’t interrupted by vexing phone calls .
Care is seldom denied ( because everybody knows the rules ) .
She gets her checks on time , sees her patients on schedule , takes Thursdays off , and gets home in time for dinner .
One unsurprising side effect of all this is that the doctors I see here are , to a person , more focused , more relaxed , more generous with their time , more up - to - date in their specialties , and overall much less distracted from the real work of doctoring .
You do n’t realize how much stress the American doctor - insurer fights put on the day - to - day quality of care until you see doctors who do n’t operate under that stress , because they never have to fight those battles at all .
Amazingly : they seem to enjoy their jobs .
Third :
The average American medical student graduates $ 140,000 in hock .
The average Canadian doctor ’s debt is roughly half that .
Finally , Canadian doctors pay lower malpractice insurance fees .
When paying for health care constitutes a one of a family ’s major expenses , expectations tend to run very high .
A doctor ’s mistake not only damages the body ; it may very well throw a middle - class family permanently into the ranks of the working poor , and render the victim uninsurable for life .
With so much at stake , it ’s no wonder people are quick to rush to court for redress .
Canadians are far less likely to sue in the first place , since they ’re not having to absorb devastating financial losses in addition to any physical losses when something goes awry .
The cost of the damaging treatment will be covered .
So will the cost of fixing it .
And , no matter what happens , the victim will remain insured for life .
When lawsuits do occur , the awards do n’t have to include coverage for future medical costs , which reduces the insurance company ’s liability .
3 . Wait times in Canada are horrendous .
True and False again — it depends on which province you live in , and what ’s wrong with you .
Canada ’s health care system runs on federal guidelines that ensure uniform standards of care , but each territory and province administers its own program .
Some provinces do n’t plan their facilities well enough ; in those , you can have waits .
Some do better .
As a general rule , the farther north you live , the harder it is to get to care , simply because the doctors and hospitals are concentrated in the south .
But that ’s just as true in any rural county in the U.S .
You can hear the bitching about it no matter where you live , though .
The percentage of Canadians who ’d consider giving up their beloved system consistently languishes in the single digits .
A few years ago , a TV show asked Canadians to name the Greatest Canadian in history ; and in a broad national consensus , they gave the honor to Tommy Douglas , the Saskatchewan premier who is considered the father of the country ’s health care system .
( And no , it had nothing to do with the fact that he was also Kiefer Sutherland ’s grandfather . ) .
In spite of that , though , grousing about health care is still unofficially Canada ’s third national sport after curling and hockey .
And for the country ’s newspapers , it ’s a prime watchdogging opportunity .
Any little thing goes sideways at the local hospital , and it ’s on the front pages the next day .
Those kinds of stories sell papers , because everyone is invested in that system and has a personal stake in how well it functions .
The American system might benefit from this kind of constant scrutiny , because it ’s certainly one of the things that keeps the quality high .
But it also makes people think it ’s far worse than it is .
Critics should be reminded that the American system is not exactly instant - on , either .
When I lived in California , I had excellent insurance , and got my care through one of the best university - based systems in the nation .
Yet I routinely had to wait anywhere from six to twelve weeks to get in to see a specialist .
Non-emergency surgical waits could be anywhere from four weeks to four months .
After two years in the BC system , I ’m finding the experience to be pretty much comparable , and often better .
The notable exception is MRIs , which were easy in California , but can take many months to get here .
( It ’s the number one thing people go over the border for . )
Other than that , urban Canadians get care about as fast as urban Americans do .
4 . You have to wait forever to get a family doctor .
False for the vast majority of Canadians , but True for a few .
Again , it all depends on where you live .
I live in suburban Vancouver , and there are any number of first - rate GPs in my neighborhood who are taking new patients .
If you do n’t have a working relationship with one , but need to see a doctor now , there are 24 - hour urgent care clinics in most neighborhoods that will usually get you in and out on the minor stuff in under an hour .
It is , absolutely , harder to get to a doctor if you live out in a small town , or up in the territories .
But that ’s just as true in the U.S. — and in America , the government wo n’t cover the airfare for rural folk to come down to the city for needed treatment , which all the provincial plans do .
5 . You do n’t get to choose your own doctor .
Scurrilously False .
Somebody , somewhere , is getting paid a lot of money to make this kind of stuff up .
The cons love to scare the kids with stories about the government picking your doctor for you , and you do n’t get a choice .
Be afraid !
Be very afraid !
For the record : Canadians pick their own doctors , just like Americans do .
And not only that : since it all pays the same , poor Canadians have exactly the same access to the country ’s top specialists that rich ones do .
6. Canada ’s care plan only covers the basics .
You ’re still on your own for any extras , including prescription drugs .
And you still have to pay for it .
True — but not as big an issue as you might think .
The province does charge a small monthly premium ( ours is $ 108 / month for a family of four ) for the basic coverage .
However , most people never even have to write that check : almost all employers pick up the tab for their employees ’ premiums as part of the standard benefits package ; and the province covers it for people on public assistance or disability .
“ The basics ” covered by this plan include 100 % of all doctor ’s fees , ambulance fares , tests , and everything that happens in a hospital — in other words , the really big - ticket items that routinely drive American families into bankruptcy .
In BC , it does n’t include “ extras ” like medical equipment , prescriptions , physical therapy or chiropractic care , dental , vision , and so on ; and if you want a private or semi- private room with TV and phone , that costs extra ( about what you ’d pay for a room in a middling hotel ) .
That other stuff does add up ; but it ’s far easier to afford if you ’re not having to cover the big expenses , too .
Furthermore : you can deduct any out - of - pocket health expenses you do have to pay off your income taxes .
And , as every American knows by now , drugs are n’t nearly as expensive here , either .
Filling the gap between the basics and the extras is the job of the country ’s remaining private health insurers .
Since they ’re off the hook for the ruinously expensive big - ticket items that can put their own profits at risk , the insurance companies make a tidy business out of offering inexpensive policies that cover all those smaller , more predictable expenses .
Top -quality add - on policies typically run in the ballpark of $ 75 per person in a family per month — about $ 300 for a family of four — if you ’re stuck buying an individual plan .
Group plans are cheap enough that even small employers can afford to offer them as a routine benefit .
An average working Canadian with employer - paid basic care and supplemental insurance gets free coverage equal to the best policies now only offered at a few of America ’s largest corporations .
And that employer is probably only paying a couple hundred dollars a month to provide that benefit .
7. Canadian drugs are not the same .
More preposterious bogosity .
They are exactly the same drugs , made by the same pharmaceutical companies , often in the same factories .
The Canadian drug distribution system , however , has much tighter oversight ; and pharmacies and pharmacists are more closely regulated .
If there is a difference in Canadian drugs at all , they ’re actually likely to be safer .
Also : pharmacists here dispense what the doctors tell them to dispense , the first time , without moralizing .
I know .
It ’s amazing .
8 . Publicly - funded programs will inevitably lead to rationed health care , particularly for the elderly .
False .
And bogglingly so .
The papers would have a field day if there was the barest hint that this might be true .
One of the things that constantly amazes me here is how well - cared - for the elderly and disabled you see on the streets here are .
No , these people are not being thrown out on the curb .
In fact , they live longer , healthier , and more productive lives because they ’re getting a constant level of care that ensures small things get treated before they become big problems .
The health care system also makes it easier on their caregiving adult children , who have more time to look in on Mom and take her on outings because they are n’t working 60 - hour weeks trying to hold onto a job that gives them insurance .
9 . People wo n’t be responsible for their own health if they ’re not being forced to pay for the consequences .
False .
The philosophical basis of America ’s privatized health care system might best be characterized as medical Calvinism .
It ’s fascinating to watch well - educated secularists who recoil at the Protestant obsession with personal virtue , prosperity as a cardinal sign of election by God , and total responsibility for one ’s own salvation turn into fire - eyed , moralizing True Believers when it comes to the subject of Taking Responsibility For One ’s Own Health .
They ’ll insist that health , like salvation , is entirely in our own hands .
If you just have the character and self - discipline to stick to an abstemious regime of careful diet , clean living , and frequent sweat offerings to the Great Treadmill God , you ’ll never get sick .
( Like all good theologies , there ’s even an unspoken promise of immortality : f you do it really really right , they imply , you might even live forever . )
The virtuous Elect can be discerned by their svelte figures and low cholesterol numbers .
From here , it ’s a short leap to the conviction that those who suffer from chronic conditions are victims of their own weaknesses , and simply getting what they deserve .
Part of their punishment is being forced to pay for the expensive , heavily marketed pharmaceuticals needed to alleviate these avoidable illnesses .
They ca n’t complain .
It was their own damned fault ; and it ’s not our responsibility to pay for their sins .
In fact , it ’s recently been suggested that they be shunned , lest they lead the virtuous into sin .
Of course , this is bad theology whether you ’re applying it to the state of one ’s soul or one ’s arteries .
The fact is that bad genes , bad luck , and the ravages of age eventually take their toll on all of us — even the most careful of us .
The economics of the Canadian system reflect this very different philosophy : it ’s built on the belief that maintaining health is not an individual responsibility , but a collective one .
Since none of us controls fate , the least we can do is be there for each other as our numbers come up .
This difference is expressed in a few different ways .
First : Canadians tend to think of tending to one ’s health as one of your duties as a citizen .
You do what ’s right because you do n’t want to take up space in the system , or put that burden on your fellow taxpayers .
Second , “ taking care of yourself ” has a slightly expanded definition here , which includes a greater emphasis on public health .
Canadians are serious about not coming to work if you ’re contagious , and seeing a doctor ASAP if you need to .
Staying healthy includes not only diet and exercise ; but also taking care to keep your germs to yourself , avoiding stress , and getting things treated while they ’re still small and cheap to fix .
Third , there ’s a somewhat larger awareness that stress leads to big - ticket illnesses — and a somewhat lower cultural tolerance for employers who put people in high - stress situations .
Nobody wants to pick up the tab for their greed .
And finally , there ’s a generally greater acceptance on the part of both the elderly and their families that end - of - life heroics may be drawing resources away from people who might put them to better use .
You can have them if you want them ; but reasonable and compassionate people should be able to take the larger view .
The bottom line :
When it comes to getting people to make healthy choices , appealing to their sense of the common good seems to work at least as well as Calvinist moralizing .
10 .
This all sounds great — but the taxes to cover it are just unaffordable .
And besides , is n’t the system in bad financial shape ?
False .
On one hand , our annual Canadian tax bite runs about 10 % higher than our U.S. taxes did .
On the other , we ’re not paying out the equivalent of two new car payments every month to keep the family insured here .
When you balance out the difference , we ’re actually money ahead .
When you factor in the greatly increased social stability that follows when everybody ’s getting their necessary health care , the impact on our quality of life becomes even more signficant .
And True — but only because this is a universal truth that we need to make our peace with .
Yes , the provincial plans are always struggling .
So is every single publicly - funded health care system in the world , including the VA and Medicare .
There ’s always tension between what the users of the system want , and what the taxpayers are willing to pay .
The balance of power ebbs and flows between them ; but no matter where it lies at any given moment , at least one of the pair is always going to be at least somewhat unhappy .
But , as many of us know all too well , there ’s also constant tension between what patients want and what private insurers are willing to pay .
At least when it ’s in government hands , we can demand some accountability .
And my experience in Canada has convinced me that this accountability is what makes all the difference between the two systems .
It is true that Canada ’s system is not the same as the U.S. system .
It ’s designed to deliver a somewhat different product , to a population that has somewhat different expectations .
But the end result is that the vast majority of Canadians get the vast majority of what they need the vast majority of the time .
It ’ll be a good day when when Americans can hold their heads high and proudly make that same declaration .
Next week :
More mythbusting on common conservative canards about efficiency , innovation , and competitiveness .

The Government is considering opening ACC 's work account to private competition as part of a deal to get ACT 's backing for its stalled reforms .
In a sign of National 's sensitivity on the issue , ACC Minister Nick Smith 's office refused to comment yesterday on any talks between the parties .
But ACT leader Rodney Hide confirmed he had put a proposal to National and expected a reply early next week .
It is understood ACT is offering to back the ACC reform bill if National pledges progress on its own election promise to " investigate opening the work account to competition " .
Employers and the self - employed make contributions to the work account to cover work - related injuries .
Mr Hide was confident a deal could be struck .
" They 've gone away and then we will pick it up next week .
I do n't think there will be any problems . "
National also said it was committed to competition and choice as the best way to ensure ACC 's efficiency .
Mr Hide said private sector competition would be " ACT 's way " .
" National agree with it philosophically .
It 's hard for them to argue against , philosophically . "
Labour leader Phil Goff said an agreement on Mr Hide 's terms would amount to privatisation .
Dr Smith 's proposed bill would push out the date for fully funding the scheme by five years to 2019 , lift levies and trim some entitlements .
It needs to be passed by February to stop even bigger fee rises .
Progress stalled this week after the Government took urgency in Parliament but was forced to shelve debate on ACC because it did not have the numbers to pass the bill .
If talks with ACT fail , National 's other option is to seek Maori Party backing .
A spokesman said Maori Party MPs would consider the issue at Tuesday 's caucus meeting .
The party is likely to want a softer line on cuts to wage compensation entitlements , especially for seasonal workers .
A spokesman for Dr Smith declined all comment yesterday , and would not confirm whether any talks with other parties were planned or were under way .
Earlier in the week Dr Smith said consideration of opening the scheme to competition was not a priority .
But Prime Minister John Key said yesterday there were valid arguments to look at the idea , and it was in his party 's policy .
" We have n't conducted that yet .
Let 's see how things go . "
Government insiders confirmed there was some " back and forth " of proposals between National and its support parties .

Jose Luis Rodriguez 's haunting portrait of an Iberian wolf won over the judges
A picture of a hunting wolf has won the prestigious Veolia Environment Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2009 award .
Jose Luis Rodriguez captured the imaginations of the judges with a picture that he had planned for years , and even sketched out on a piece of paper .
" I wanted to capture a photo in which you would see a wolf in an act of hunting - or predation - but without blood , " he told BBC News .
" I did n't want a cruel image . "
With a great deal of patience and careful observation of the wolves ' movements , he succeeded in taking the award - winning photograph .
Mr Rodriguez used a custom - built infrared trap to snap the wolf as it leapt into the air .
The WPY competition , now in its 45th year , is owned by BBC Wildlife Magazine and London 's Natural History Museum .
The panel of judges looked through more than 43,000 entries to this year 's competition .
This is the fifth year that wildlife photographer Mark Carwardine has been on the judging panel .
He said of the winning photo : " It 's captured thousands of years of human - wolf interaction in just one moment . "

The image of a photographer 's dreams
Enlarge Image
Mr Rodriguez won the Animal Portraits category and went on to win the top prize with this haunting image that the judges said captured the character of the wolf .
When he started planning the photograph , he feared that he might not be able to get close enough to the Iberian wolves .
This subspecies of the grey wolf lives close to human habitation in northern Spain .
They are often persecuted by people who see them as a threat to livestock , and they are consequently very wary .
Watching the animals as they returned to the same spot to collect food each night , Mr Rodriguez decided on his dream shot .
He eventually captured it using a photographic trap that included a motion sensor and an infrared barrier to operate the camera .
He hopes that his picture , " showing the wolf 's great agility and strength " , will become an image that can be used to show just how beautiful the Iberian wolf is and how the Spanish can be proud to have such an emblematic animal .

The yellowhammer males fought over ownership of the oats

Fergus Gill , who was 17 years old when he entered the competition , won this year 's Young Photographer of the Year award for his picture of a brief but dramatic clash between two of the colourful UK songbirds .
He started planning the image in summer , collecting oat sheaves from a local farmer specifically as winter food for the yellowhammers .
One evening in February , hearing that snow was forecast for the next morning , Fergus set up his hide in the garden of his home in Scotland and hung out feeders for the birds .
" At one point , I counted 32 yellowhammers feeding on the ground , " he said .
When the snow fell , the birds jumped up on to the feeders and the males would occasionally fight over the oats .
" The spats were incredibly fast , " he said .
It took Fergus two days to capture the dramatic clash that earned him his award .

With the help of his feisty cat , Igor Shpilenok won the Urban and Garden Wildlife category with this shot .
He spent five months as a ranger in the Kronotsky Nature Reserve in Kamchatka in the east of Russia , and took his cat Ryska with him for company .
" It 's a very remote place and there were lots of animals - bears , foxes , wolverines - living near my cabin , " he told BBC News .
" The cat was really jealous about me .
If I started to look at the animals , she would attack them .
Just like a woman , " he smiled .
" Maybe she thought I was her pet . "
But the animals were curious about the area 's new residents , and were drawn by cooking smells from the cabin .
The foxes in particular would visit every day .
" When they came within 20 m , that was her boundary and chased them .
It was really funny - foxes were climbing trees to get away from the cat . "
Mr Shpilenok 's wife , Laura Williams , selected the category - winning image .
" It 's ironic , " she said .
" He photographs the wilderness , but the two times he 's won a category [ in this competition ] it 's been the urban wildlife one .
Because the wilderness is his back yard . "

Urmas Tartes won the Animals in their Environment category for this image of a springtail , otherwise known as a " snow flea " navigating its way through delicate snowflakes .
When the temperature drops below freezing , the insect climbs down through the frosty crevasses to the warmer soil below .
" But they 're only active a few degrees below zero , " Mr Tartes told BBC News .
" I had to ' ambush ' the weather for just the right temperature and conditions .
" I was travelling with my wife and it started snowing slightly , " he recalled .
" We came to a place where we thought it might be possible [ to see the insects ] and the thermometer in the car said it was just the right temperature . "
Mr Tartes had waited for the perfect weather in which the snow fleas would be active , but the snowflakes would remain frozen .
His patience paid off , and he managed to take over 100 shots while the insects negotiated their way through the tricky terrain .
He believes he captured something truly unique and that this was largely thanks to his knowledge of his country and its climate .
" I think the best of the photos I take are in my homeland , " he told BBC News .
" There 's a saying in Estonia that in order to see new things , you have to follow common paths - paths you know . "

Somehow the Walt Disney Co. managed to convince the parents of one - third of America ’s babies to spend $ 200 million a year on Baby Einstein videos .
The tapes were supposed to smarten kids up , but watching TV from ages 1 - 3 could actually cause attention problems .
Under pressure , Disney is now offering refunds .
Your little monster might have the disposition of a flea , but at least you can get your $ 15.99 back .
Americans used to be outraged by the idea of marketing to kids , but then they started buying their pint - sized consumers everything in sight .
Disney has obviously had great success selling things to children , but recruiting customers right out of the womb ?
That takes some chutzpah .

Early Thursday , the US Catholics Conference on Bishops circulated a memo ( see below ) and “ supporting ” documents to all bishops urging them to use this Sunday ’s mass as a lobbying event designed to defeat health care reform if the bishops do n’t get what they want on abortion .
What do they want ?
They want to scuttle the well crafted compromise moderate pro-lifers and all prochoice groups have reluctantly supported and insist that health care reform efforts be used to cut off all sources of funding for abortions for all women — whether they are on Medicaid or currently have coverage for abortion in their private insurance plans .
Just about everyone rational has accepted the Capps Amendment which baldly states that federal funds will not be used for abortions .
But the bishops want to reinterpret what constitutes federal funds and claim that a private insurance plan that covers abortion ( though it might have some subscribers who do get a federal subsidy ) would constitute using federal funds .
The only way , they say , to insure that no federal funds are used is to exclude from the overall exchange any insurance plan that covers abortion .
Their solution ?
Offer women special riders to insurance that cost additional funds if they want private coverage .
The insult to women , the idea of a scarlet “ A ” abortion rider to single them out is bad enough , but turning Sunday Mass into a political rally is absolutely too much .
One can only hope that every pro-life supporter of health care reform who has said that health care reform is too important to use as a way to advance either pro-choice or prolife objectives — from Jim Wallis to Catholics United and everyone in between — speaks out immediately in opposition to this kind of immoral use of religious services .
And every pro-choice Catholic needs to walk out of church when the lobby sermon begins .
USCCB Nationwide Bulletin Insert
Pulpit Announcements & Prayer Petition
Instructions :
As introduced by a cover letter to all bishops from the President of the Conference and the Chairmen of the 3 major USCCB committees engaged in health care reform , the US bishops have asked that the USCCB Nationwide Bulletin Insert on health care reform be printed or hand - stuffed in every parish bulletin and / or distributed in pews or at church entrances as soon as possible .
Congressional votes may take place as soon as early November .
Please encourage parishioners to pray for this effort as well .
More information can be found at www.usccb.org/healthcare.
To be announced at all Masses on the weekend when the Bulletin Insert is distributed :
Congress is preparing to debate health care reform legislation .
The Catholic bishops of the United States strongly support genuine health care reform that protects the life and dignity of all , from the moment of conception until natural death .
However , all current bills are seriously deficient on abortion and conscience rights , and do not yet provide adequate access to health care for immigrants and the poor .
In your pews / bulletins today , you ’ll find a special flier / bulletin insert from the US Bishops Conference asking you to please contact your Representative and Senators immediately and urge them to fix these bills with pro-life amendments .
The flier / bulletin insert includes a web address that allows you to send an email message to Congress with a click of a button .
The bishops have asked for our swift action and the commitment of our prayers for this critical effort .
Thank you for your help .
We can help make sure that health care reform will be about saving lives , not destroying them .

* DuPont claims Monsanto holds “ illegal monopoly ”
* Monsanto CEO seeks probe by DuPont independent directors
* Justice Dept. , USDA to examine antitrust concerns
KANSAS CITY , Mo. , Aug 18 ( Reuters ) -
It ’s getting dirty down on the farm .
As U.S. farmers prepare to harvest billions of bushels of corn and soybeans -- key ingredients in food , livestock feed and transportation fuel around the world -- seed technology titan Monsanto Co MON.N and its chief rival DuPont DD.N are ramping up their rivalry to new heights .
DuPont is accusing Monsanto of illegal anti-competitive practices , while Monsanto counters that DuPont is engaging in a covert smear campaign that borders on fraud .
Monsanto CEO
Hugh Grant this week sent a letter , a copy of which was obtained by Reuters , to DuPont chairman Charles Holliday accusing the company of a “ serious breach of business ethics ” and requesting that a special committee of DuPont ’s independent directors investigate what Grant called an “ attack ” on Monsanto ’s seed business .
Monsanto officials claim DuPont has supported forged documents and secretly funded Monsanto critics .
“ This is just the tip of the iceberg of dirty tricks .
I have never seen corporate conduct of this nature , ” said Monsanto lawyer Scott Partridge .
DuPont counters that it is simply trying to expose what it calls Monsanto ’s “ illegal monopoly ” and the harm it says Monsanto is doing to farmers and others up and down the food chain .
“ This is not just a DuPont problem .
This is a competition problem .
They ’ve gained illegal monopoly power , ” said DuPont attorney Don Flexner .
The stakes have now risen as both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Justice Department said this month they will launch an examination of competition and antitrust concerns in the seed industry .
“ We understand that there are concerns regarding the levels of concentration in the seed industry , particularly for corn and soybeans , ” said Philip Weiser , deputy assistant attorney general in the antitrust division at the U.S. Department of Justice .
SOURED RELATIONS
Both companies have strong positions in the U.S. seed industry and have been racing each other and other competitors to develop higher - yielding crops through genetic modifications and other means .
This spring , the competition spilled into the courts as Monsanto and DuPont sued each other over a soured licensing arrangement .
Monsanto claimed DuPont was using its Roundup Ready herbicide - tolerant trait outside the scope of the agreement .
DuPont countersued , seeking relief under antitrust laws to end what it calls “ Monsanto ’s multifaceted , anti-competitive scheme to unlawfully restrict competition . ”
Monsanto claims , and DuPont does not dispute , that DuPont has been aligning with , and in some cases funding , groups critical of Monsanto .
Monsanto in turn has launched an effort to discredit DuPont , working with a Washington law firm to circulate documents that lay out a series of scathing accusations .
The documents accuse DuPont of misleading investors about certain product capabilities , as well as involvement in what Monsanto has said were several falsified letters to lawmakers and others that criticize Monsanto .
Monsanto spokesman Lee Quarles said the company wants to protect itself against DuPont ’s “ smear campaigns ” designed to “ compete through deceit . ”
DuPont spokesman Anthony Farina said Monsanto is engaging in a “ campaign of diversion ” and that DuPont was cooperating with a group of attorneys general from states including Iowa , the top U.S. corn grower , investigating Monsanto ’s business practices .
CRYING FOUL
The biotech corporate battle comes at a time when farmers , agricultural academics and consumer groups are growing increasingly concerned about climbing seed prices and industry concentration .
“ We ’re hearing lots of complaints from farmers about huge price increases and that non-GMO ( genetically modified ) seed availability no longer exists , ” said Bill Wenzel , national director of the Farmer to Farmer Campaign on Genetic Engineering , which has been studying the sharp price increases in soy and corn seed in recent years .
A decade ago , DuPont ’s Pioneer Hi-Bred seed unit , based in Johnston , Iowa , controlled more than 40 percent of the lucrative U.S. corn seed market .
But that had fallen to about 30 percent in 2008 , according to DuPont , which gets about a quarter of its $ 30 billion in revenues from its agricultural and nutrition unit .
Monsanto ’s rapid rise in power over the last decade has come through a series of seed company acquisitions , broad licensing deals and tightly protected patents for its proprietary seed technology .
St. Louis , Missouri - based Monsanto pegs its market share for its branded corn seed at about 36 percent , and says branded soy seed enjoys a 29 percent share and cotton a 41 percent share in the United States .
But DuPont and other critics say that , through licensing deals with about 200 other companies , Monsanto ’s genetic traits are spread through nearly all of the U.S. corn , soy and cotton acres planted each year .
They say Monsanto ’s power translates into steep price increases for farmers and increasingly fewer seed choices .
“ That level of concentration is scary , ” said Iowa State University agricultural economist Neil Harl .
“ The Department of Justice antitrust division is right on target in my view . ”
Monsanto recently announced , for instance , that its new Roundup Ready 2
Yield soybeans will cost farmers about $ 74 an acre in 2010 on average , while the current version of its Roundup Ready soybeans cost $ 52 an acre .
Monsanto said the price hikes are valid because farmers receive added value with technological improvements to the seeds , higher yields and greater efficiencies .
It also argues there is no shortage of seed varieties .
Monsanto ’s prowess in the seed industry has made it a darling of Wall Street .
Last year the company posted record net sales of $ 11.4 billion for fiscal 2008 , a 36 percent jump from fiscal 2007 .
Monsanto officials say they welcome the added antitrust scrutiny .
“ This is a very competitive industry , ” said Partridge .
“ We welcome the opportunity to participate and to be involved in these discussions so people can learn more about Monsanto and how we compete . ” ( Reporting by Carey Gillam ; editing by Jim Marshall )
Blind 7 - Year - Old Boy Sees With His Ears U.K. boy uses same tongue - clicking sonar technique as dolphins , bats to navigate
Oct. 9 , 2009  --
Born without sight , 7 - year - old Lucas Murray used to be so afraid of walking he would n't take a step without his parents by his side .
" He would walk , but he would hold our hands .
Always , " said his mother , Sarah Murray of Dorset , England .
" When he was younger , he would n't even walk on a bumpy surface . "
But now Lucas has become more mobile than his parents ever imagined , running with friends , playing basketball and jumping on a trampoline -- all on his own .
The incredible change , his mother said , is owed to a technique called echolocation , similar to the method used by dolphins and bats , that allows Lucas to paint a picture of his surroundings using sound he creates himself .
To " see " the world around him , he clicks his tongue on the roof of his mouth and listens to the echo that bounces back .
From the sound , he can make out the location , depth and shape of objects around him , allowing him to navigate even unfamiliar areas .
Echolocation Used by Small Percentage of Blind Population
Though it 's estimated that only about 5 to 10 percent of the blind population now uses a sonar - type approach , the Murrays and others hope it could someday become as common as the widely - adopted white cane .
Inspired by a documentary about a blind American boy who had mastered echolocation , Sarah Murray and her husband Iain Murray reached out to Daniel Kish , a blind psychologist who has practiced the technique since childhood and has been teaching it for more than 15 years .
Two years ago , Kish traveled to the Murrays ' hometown and worked with Lucas for four days , teaching him not just echolocation , but convincing Lucas and his parents that blindness does n't need to be a limiting condition .
" You have to be able to let go , and it 's the hardest thing in the world , " said Sarah Murray .
The family lives by a lake , and when Kish suggested the family let Lucas walk along the shore on his own , she said , " It was terrifying .
And Lucas found it terrifying too . "
" I had to walk with my hands in my pockets and grip them tightly , " she said .
But after the family overcame the initial fear , Lucas ' progress skyrocketed .
He advanced from learning how to detect different sized bowls and cardboard panels by clicking to navigating grocery stores entirely on his own .
In addition to clicking , Lucas also uses a white cane to find his way .
Psychologist : Echolocation
Is Means to an End
" He likes exploring things , he likes climbing things , " his mother said .
" He likes supermarkets and going off on his own …
He 'll go up the escalator .
That would n't have been conceivable in a million years . "
She said the frequency of Lucas ' clicks depends on the environment and how familiar he is with it , but the technique is second nature to him now .
" It 's quite nice really , " said Lucas .
" I just do it .
It just works really . "
And , as his confidence has grown , his parents ' perception of his future has been transformed .
" We had a vision of Lucas needing assistance , having a [ guide ] dog , and now he 's never going to be able to see but I do n't see any limits on what he can achieve , " said Sarah Murray .
Kish said that mindset is the goal of his echolocation technique , which he calls FlashSonar .
" Although FlashSonar seems to be the most inspiring and impressive part of our work , to us , it 's really not the end , it 's really a means to an end , " he said .
" The goal is what we call self - directed achievement . "
Visual Cortex Can Create Images from Sound
The greatest problem facing blind people is that they tend to be directed by others and have their choices made for them by others , Kish said .
The FlashSonar technique helps blind individuals become more independent and , ultimately , overcome that problem .
With his charity , World Access for the Blind , Kish said he has helped hundreds of blind people develop their sense of hearing to " see . "
" What we really do is we teach the brain how to image using non-visual information , " he said .
Although he has used the technique since childhood , it was n't until he researched echolocation in graduate school that he understood how it worked .
He said that even in the brains of blind people , the visual cortex continues to function .
Although images do n't reach it from the optic nerve , it can image data from other senses , such as hearing .
" The visual cortex is falsely named , " he said .
" It should more appropriately be named the imaging cortex .
It can take any data fed to it and image that data …
And echolocation is just another way of imaging . "
He said he 's seen people with advanced echolocation skills listen to the echoes from their clicks to sketch entire scenes of their surroundings .
Some See Clicking as Negative Distinction
But echolocation is n't without its detractors .
" [ Blindness ] is a rare condition and people do not respond favorably to it .
There 's a big push to try and normalize blindness so that it is n't seen as negatively distinctive , " Kish said .
" And it 's believed that odd behaviors such as clicking your tongue could be construed as a negative distinction . "
Although the method he teaches produces a very discrete click , he said for some it 's seen as abnormal .
Chris Danielson , a spokesman for the National Federation of the Blind , said that the organization does n't oppose echolocation , but advocates it in conjunction with the white cane .
" If you look at the blind population as a whole , that seems to be the most helpful for the most people .
That or the use of the guide dog , " he said .
While some people have demonstrated aptitude for echolocation , he said it does n't seem to be as effective for most blind people .
But Kish and the families he has helped argue that while some may have more natural talent , echolocation does n't need to be restricted to a small percentage of the blind population .
It can be taught to anyone and has the potential to change the entire system of mobility for blind people , they say .
" If people can get past the point that this is n't magic , it is n't revolutionary , if we can get past those barriers it could happen , " said Sarah Murray .
Echolocation and the greater philosophy it reflects , she said , " Completely turns on its head the way blind people should orient themselves . "

TAKING THE FOX PROBLEM SERIOUSLY ….
Tensions between the White House and the Republican cable news network have been evident since Inauguration Day , but it was n’t obvious that the president ’s team intended to do something about it until a month ago , when Obama appeared on five networks ’
Sunday morning shows , and decided to exclude Fox News .
The strategy became clearer two weeks ago with an interesting piece from Time ‘s Michael Scherer , which quoted Communications Director Anita Dunn describing Fox News as “ opinion journalism masquerading as news . ”
Pressed to defend her remarks last week on CNN , Dunn did n’t hesitate , accurately characterizing Fox News as “ a wing of the Republican Party . ”
I ’m delighted to see that the White House is n’t backing down on this .
Today , White House senior adviser David Axelrod shared his thoughts with ABC ’s George Stephanopoulos .
“ It ’s really not news — it ’s pushing a point of view , ” Axelrod said of the Republican network .
“ And the bigger thing is that other news organizations like yours ought not to treat them that way , and we ’re not going to treat them that way .
We ’re going to appear on their shows .
We ’re going to participate but understanding that they represent a point of view . ”
Also this morning , White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel told CNN that Fox News is “ not a news organization . ”
He added , “ [ I ] t ’s important not to have the CNN ’s and the others of the world being led and following Fox , as if what they ’re trying to do is a legitimate news organization . ”
Slate ‘s Jacob Weisberg not only approves of this approach , he explained why it ’s time for the rest of the political world to reevaluate its approach to Fox News .
There is no longer any need to get bogged down in this phony debate , which itself constitutes an abuse of the fair - mindedness of the rest of the media .
One glance at Fox ’s
Web site or five minutes randomly viewing the channel at any hour of the day demonstrates its all - pervasive political slant .
The lefty documentary Outfoxed spent a lot of time mustering evidence about Fox managers sending down orders to reporters to take the Republican side .
But after 13 years working for Roger Ailes , Fox employees do n’t need to be told to help the right any more than fish need a memo telling them to swim .
Rather than in any way maturing , Fox has in recent months become more boisterous and demagogic in rallying the opposition against Obama .
The “ fair and balanced ” mask has been slipping with increasing frequency — as when a RNC press release was regurgitated so lazily that it repeated a typo on air or when a reporter wondered why other networks were n’t doing PR for “ tea parties ” that Fox covered the way the Hearst press covered the Spanish - American war .
On Fox , fact - checking about the president ’s health care proposal is provided by Karl Rove .
For literary coverage , it features the bigot Jerome Corsi ’s rants about Obama and John Kerry .
Meanwhile , the crybaby Glenn Beck has begun to exhibit a Strangelovean concern about America ’s precious bodily fluids , charging the government with trying to invade our bloodstream by vaccinating us for swine flu .
With this latest misinformation campaign , Fox stands to become the first network to actively try to kill its viewers .
That Rupert Murdoch may skew the news rightward more for commercial than ideological reasons is somewhat beside the point .
What matters is the way that Fox ’s successful model has invaded the bloodstream of the American media .
And that ’s precisely why the White House ’s media strategy matters .
Fox News ’ model makes a mockery of American journalism , and poisons the larger discourse — in part by encouraging mimicry ( Weisberg said CNN ’s Lou Dobbs has become “ a nativist cartoon ” ) , and in part by pushing nonsensical stories that legitimate news outlets pursue because they ’re aired on Fox News .
For Murdoch , Ailes , and company , “ fair and balanced ” is a necessary lie .
To admit that their coverage is slanted by design would violate the American understanding of the media ’s role in democracy and our idea of what constitutes journalistic fair play .
But it ’s a demonstrable deceit that no longer deserves equal time .
Whether the White House engages with Fox is a tactical political question .
Whether we journalists continue to do so is an ethical one .
By appearing on Fox , reporters validate its propaganda values and help to undermine the role of legitimate news organizations .
The question is n’t why the White House is treating Fox News like a partisan propaganda outlet .
The questions are a ) why it took so long ; and b ) why others are n’t following the White House ’ lead .
Sixteen people were arrested this morning at 99 Park Ave in New York City for entering the lobby of the health insurance company Aetna and demanding that Aetna stop denying healthcare approved by doctors .
This was the beginning of a campaign in which over 300 people have committed to nonviolently risking arrest :
On September 29th in New York City , October 8th in Chicago , and in cities across the country on October 15th , over 100 people who have signed this pledge will put our bodies on the line to challenge the real death panels .
We will enter the offices of the major insurance companies and demand that they cover the care they are denying to their members .
We wo n't leave until they do .
The companies will have to decide - admit they 're wrong and approve the care , or have us arrested and show the world how far they will go to protect their obscene profits .
If we 're arrested , some of us will even refuse to give our names and be released until the insurance companies meet our demand .
We hope that our actions will save the lives of some of the people who are being denied critical care by these death panels today .
But we know we can save the lives of millions in the years to come by putting a spotlight on just why our system is broken and how urgently we need fundamental change .
We will go to jail to demand that the insurance companies stop denying care to their members immediately , but our sacrifice will be a call to our entire nation to stand up to these death panels and demand real reform - Medicare for All - that finally ensures that every one of us gets the health care we need .

Russia expelled senior Israeli diplomat Shmuel Polishuk on allegations of espionage , intelligence gathering , and actions which violate bilateral agreements .
Based at the Israeli Embassy in Moscow , Polishuk is the Chief Consul and local director of Nativ Liaison Bureau of the Prime Minister 's Office , which seeks to encourage immigration from Russia .
The diplomat returned to Israel on Tuesday after the Russian authorities gave him five days to leave the country .
Last week he was detained for questioning by the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service ( FSK ) .
Since Polishuk holds a diplomatic passport , he is immune from arrest or being put on trial ; instead he was released and ordered to leave the country .

WASHINGTON -- Somebody explain this to me :
The president of the United States wins the Nobel Peace Prize , and Rush Limbaugh joins with the Taliban in bitterly denouncing the award ?
Glenn Beck has a conniption fit and demands that the president not accept what may be the world 's most prestigious honor ?
The Republican National Committee issues a statement sarcastically mocking our nation 's leader -- elected , you will recall , by a healthy majority -- as unworthy of such recognition ?
Why , oh why , do conservatives hate America so ?
OK , I know , it 's just some conservatives who 've been exhibiting what they , in a different context , surely would describe as " Hanoi Jane " behavior .
Others who have n't taken leave of their political senses -- and are familiar with the concept of manners -- responded to President Obama 's unexpected award with equanimity and even grace .
Sen .
John McCain , for example , offered his good - natured congratulations .
Some of Obama 's most strident critics , however , just can't give it a rest .
They use words like " farce " and " travesty , " as if there were always universal agreement on the worthiness of the Nobel peace laureate .
Does anyone remember the controversy over Henry Kissinger or Yasser Arafat or F.W. de Klerk ?
The problem for the addlebrained Obama - rejectionists is that the president , as far as they are concerned , could n't possibly do anything right , and thus is unworthy of any conceivable recognition .
If Obama ended all hunger in the world , they 'd accuse him of promoting obesity .
If he solved global warming , they 'd complain it was getting chilly .
If he got Mahmoud Abbas and Binyamin Netanyahu to join him around the campfire in a chorus of " Kumbaya , " the rejectionists would claim that his singing was out of tune .
Let the rejectionists fulminate and sputter until they wear themselves out .
Politically , they 're only bashing themselves .
As Republican leaders -- except RNC Chairman Michael Steele -- are beginning to realize , " I'm With the Taliban Against America " is not likely to be a winning slogan .
More interesting , but no less goofy , is the recommendation -- by otherwise sane commentators -- that Obama should decline the award .
This is ridiculous .
If the award just represented the political views of a handful of left - leaning , self - satisfied Norwegian Eurocrats , as some critics have charged , then it would n't matter whether Obama won it or not .
But of course it means much more .
The Nobel Peace Prize , irrespective of the idiosyncratic process that selects its winner , is universally recognized as a stamp of the world 's approval .
For an American president to reject such a token of approval would be absurdly counterproductive .
Obama has shifted U.S. foreign policy away from George W. Bush 's cowboy ethos toward a multilateral approach .
He envisions , and has begun to implement , a different kind of U.S. leadership that I believe is more likely to succeed in an interconnected , multipolar world .
That this shift is being noticed and recognized is to Obama 's credit -- and to our country's .
The peace prize comes as Obama is in the midst reviewing war strategy in Afghanistan .
Some advocates for sending additional troops are complaining -- and some advocates of a pullout are hoping -- that the award may somehow limit the president 's options .
But the prize is nothing more than an acknowledgment of what Obama has been saying and doing thus far .
He hardly needs to be reminded of his philosophy of international relations -- or that he once called Afghanistan a " war of necessity . "
Threading that needle is not made any easier or harder by the Nobel committee 's decision .
What I really do n't understand is the view that somehow there 's a tremendous downside for Obama in the award .
It raises expectations , these commentators say -- as if expectations of any American president , and especially this one , were not already sky high .
Obama has taken on the rescue of the U.S. financial system and the long - term restructuring of the economy .
He has launched historic initiatives to revolutionize health care , energy policy and the way we educate our children .
He said flatly during the campaign that he wants to be remembered as a transformational president .
The only reasonable response is McCain's : Congratulations .
Nothing , not even the Nobel Peace Prize , can set the bar any higher for President Obama than he 's already set it for himself .

Advertisement Scientists say they are a step closer to curing colour blindness using gene therapy .
A US team were able to restore full colour vision to adult monkeys born without the ability to distinguish between the colours red and green .
Nature journal describes the technique used by the researchers at the University of Washington .
Although more studies are needed , the same treatment may work for humans who are colour blind , experts believe .
Full colour Until now scientists had not thought it was possible to manipulate the adult brain in this way .
It was considered that adding new sensory information , such as the visual receptors necessary for perfect colour vision , could only be done in the earliest years of life when the brain is at its most malleable or " plastic " .
But Professor Jay Neitz and his team were able to introduce therapeutic genes into the light - sensing cells at the back of the eye of adult male squirrel monkeys .
This provides a positive outlook for the potential of gene therapy to cure adult vision disorders
The study authors
The therapeutic genes contained the necessary DNA code to enable the light - sensing cells to distinguish between red and green - something lacking in the male monkeys .
Tests revealed the gene therapy was a success .
The male monkeys now possessed the necessary photopigments to see all colours and were able to correctly pick out red from green on computer image tests .
The monkeys were treated over two years ago and their improvement in colour vision has remained stable since .
Professor Neitz 's team will continue to monitor the animals to evaluate the long - term treatment effects .
They are hopeful that a similar therapy could benefit people who are colour blind .
" This provides a positive outlook for the potential of gene therapy to cure adult vision disorders , " they said .
There are several forms of colour blindness .
The most common form is inherited red / green colour blindness , passed on through a faulty colour vision gene on an X chromosome .
A person with normal colour vision will be able to see the eye in this image Sometimes colour blindness occurs because of diseases such as macular degeneration or from side effects of medicines .
Winfried Amoaku , an expert in ophthalmology at the University of Nottingham , said the research could eventually benefit approximately 7 % of males and 1 % of females born with genetic colour deficiencies .
He said : " These research seems to be the first in primates to address the colour vision deficiencies and indicate that intact cells are modifiable in their colour perception .
" Further research is required , however , before this comes to human clinical trials , and therapy in the clinics . "

WASHINGTON ( ISNS ) --
With the speed of computers so regularly seeing dramatic increases in their processing speed , it seems that it should n't be too long before the machines become infinitely fast -- except they can't .
A pair of physicists has shown that computers have a speed limit as unbreakable as the speed of light .
If processors continue to accelerate as they have in the past , we 'll hit the wall of faster processing in less than a century .
Intel co-founder Gordon Moore predicted 40 years ago that manufacturers could double computing speed every two years or so by cramming ever - tinier transistors on a chip .
His prediction became known as Moore 's Law , and it has held true throughout the evolution of computers -- the fastest processor today beats out a ten - year - old competitor by a factor of about 30 .
If components are to continue shrinking , physicists must eventually code bits of information onto ever smaller particles .
Smaller means faster in the microelectronic world , but physicists Lev Levitin and Tommaso Toffoli at Boston University in Massachusetts , have slapped a speed limit on computing , no matter how small the components get .
" If we believe in Moore 's law … then it would take about 75 to 80 years to achieve this quantum limit , " Levitin said .
" No system can overcome that limit .
It does n't depend on the physical nature of the system or how it 's implemented , what algorithm you use for computation … any choice of hardware and software , " Levitin said .
" This bound poses an absolute law of nature , just like the speed of light . "
Scott Aaronson , an assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge , thought Levitin 's estimate of 75 years extremely optimistic .
Moore 's Law , he said , probably wo n't hold for more than 20 years .
In the early 1980s , Levitin singled out a quantum elementary operation , the most basic task a quantum computer could carry out .
In a paper published today in the journal Physical Review Letters , Levitin and Toffoli present an equation for the minimum sliver of time it takes for this elementary operation to occur .
This establishes the speed limit for all possible computers .
Using their equation , Levitin and Toffoli calculated that , for every unit of energy , a perfect quantum computer spits out ten quadrillion more operations each second than today 's fastest processors .
" It 's very important to try to establish a fundamental limit -- how far we can go using these resources , " Levitin explained .
The physicists pointed out that technological barriers might slow down Moore 's law as we approach this limit .
Quantum computers , unlike electrical ones , can't handle " noise " -- a kink in a wire or a change in temperature can cause havoc .
Overcoming this weakness to make quantum computing a reality will take time and more research .
As computer components are packed tighter and tighter together , companies are finding that the newer processors are getting hotter sooner than they are getting faster .
Hence the recent trend in duo and quad - core processing ; rather than build faster processors , manufacturers place them in tandem to keep the heat levels tolerable while computing speeds shoot up .
Scientists who need to churn through vast numbers of calculations might one day turn to superconducting computers cooled to drastically frigid temperatures .
But even with these clever tactics , Levitin and Toffoli said , there 's no getting past the fundamental speed limit .
Aaronson called it beautiful that such a limit exists .
" From a theorist 's perspective , it 's good to know that fundamental limits are there , sort of an absolute ceiling , " he said .
" You may say it 's disappointing that we can't build infinitely fast computers , but as a picture of the world , if you have a theory of physics allows for infinitely fast computation , there could be a problem with that theory . "

According to Billboard , Eminem ‘s music publisher , Eight Mile Style is planning to sue both Apple and Aftermath Records for the unauthorized distribution of 93 of Em ‘s songs in downloadable formats via iTunes .
The case , which was filed back in 2004 , will go to trial on Thursday in Detroit if a settlement is not reached by Wednesday .
Eight Mile claims that Apple illegally made over $ 2.5 million from Eminem iTunes downloads , a bulk of which came from the 2002 smash single “ Lose Yourself , ” off of the “ 8 Mile ” movie soundtrack .
Not only does the publishing company demand money for the loss in royalties , they are also asking for a share in profits of Apple ‘s iPod sales .
In addition , Eight Mile Style alleges that Aftermath collected $ 4 million from Eminem ‘s music sales in partnership with Apple .
Although Aftermath and Apple refute the accusations , showing court documents that suggest Aftermath owns the exclusive rights to Eminem ’s master compositions , the publishing company believes it actually owns the rights to Em ‘s music .
This is not the first time Aftermath and Apple have had to go to court over licensing disputes .
In 2007 , Em ‘s producers , FTB Productions also filed suit against Aftermath for licensing Em ‘s music to Apple ‘s iTunes .
If the trial is taken to court , Eminem may act as a witness .
Part 1 : The Facts of the Matter
No one knows what will emerge ultimately from the talks beginning in Geneva Oct. 1 between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany on the matter of the Tehran government ’s nuclear program .
Iran says it looks forward to the talks and promises to be forthcoming .
But judging by the stance of the United States , Great Britain , France and Germany last week at the UN conferences in New York and the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh , draconian sanctions may be enacted against Iran in a few months .
This would result in yet another crisis that the world does n’t need just now .
Russia and China — which hold veto power in the Security Council that can weaken or prevent additional sanctions — have up to now resisted the Obama Administration ’s drive for tough new UN punishments .
President Barack Obama met separately during the week with Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Chinese President Hu Jintao in an effort to obtain their agreement to threaten more stringent sanctions should Iran procrastinate during the talks .
The White House later suggested to the press that Medvedev may be coming around to Obama ’s point of view , but this seems to be based on very skimpy evidence — a remark that “ in some cases sanctions are inevitable . ”
Hu evidently did n’t even go that far .
China opposes sanctions in principle as a means of resolving international disputes .
Moscow and Beijing do not subscribe to the negative depiction of Iran promoted by Washington , Tel Aviv , London , Paris and Bonn .
They understand the situation to be far more complex than the U.S. and its allies publicly acknowledge .
The Iran question suddenly took center stage Sept. 25 during a week of hectic political activity .
The White house set up a hastily arranged and theatrically produced press conference at the start of the G20 meeting in order to detonate a political bombshell intended to destroy Tehran ’s contention that it is only interested in nuclear power , not nuclear weapons .
The conference opened with Obama standing at the microphone with French President Nicholas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown positioned solemnly to his left and right .
It was explained that German Chancellor Angela Merkel would have joined the trio but was delayed .
Obama then declared that Iran had for several years been secretly building an underground plant in mountainous terrain to manufacture nuclear fuel near the city of Qom about 100 miles from Tehran , in addition to the plant and facilities in Natanz already known to the world .
He suggested the new plant was intended to produce weapons without the world ’s knowledge , though that was not proven .
Obama then charged that “ Iran ’s decision to build yet another nuclear facility without notifying the IAEA [ International Atomic Energy Agency ] represents a direct challenge to the basic compact at the center of the non-proliferation regime …
Iran is breaking rules that all nations must follow … and threatening the stability and security of the region and the world . ”
Refusal to “ come clean , ” he said , “ is going to lead to confrontation . ”
Sarkozy and Brown followed Obama and seemed to go even further than the American leader in denouncing Iran , explicitly demanding harder sanctions .
Said Brown : “ The level of deception by the Iranian government , and the scale of what we believe is the breach of international commitments , will shock and anger the entire international community . ”
The New York Times reported that “ after months of talking about the need for engagement , Mr. Obama appears to have made a leap toward viewing tough new sanctions against Iran as an inevitability …
American officials said that they expected the announcement to make it easier to build a case for international sanctions . ”
The majority of House and Senate members have long been critical of Iran ’s government and the new allegations have only fanned the flames of their hostility .
Right wing Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , the leading Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee , declared : “ The U.S. and other countries must immediately impose crippling sanctions on the Iranian regime , including cutting off Iran ’s imports of gasoline .
The world cannot stand by and watch the nightmare of a nuclear - armed Iran become reality . ”
Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry , chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , stated “ now is the time to supplement engagement with more robust international sanctions . ”
As intended , the hyped disclosure created headlines around the world .
It probably convinced many Americans , already primed to detest Iran , that Tehran is building nuclear bombs to obliterate the U.S. and Israel .
This is not an unlikely conclusion for many people to accept after 30 years of Washington ’s incessant campaign to demonize the government that overthrew and replaced America ’s puppet , the dreaded Shah of Iran .
The U.S. broke diplomatic relations with Iran after this act of lèse majesté and the subsequent “ hostage crisis , ” and has nourished a grudge to this day .
If push does come to shove with Iran it is important to remember how effortless it was to hoodwink the majority of American politicians and the masses of people into backing a completely unnecessary war against Iraq .
As in the buildup to the unjust invasion of Iraq , today ’s U.S. corporate mass media is playing its principal part to perfection — uncritically echoing government distortions about the danger of Iran ’s nonexistent nuclear weapons .
The Iran situation is different , but yet similar in terms of mass public manipulation and the possibility of a future confrontation getting out of hand .
Can this be , once again , a situation of high - stakes geopolitics where things are rarely as they seem ?
We think so .
Let ’s look at the immediate charge against Iran , based on the “ revelations ” of the last week , then take on the bigger picture in Parts 2 and 3 .
The “ shocking ” news may have been delivered with a sense of surprise and high urgency , but U.S. intelligence agencies , joined by their counterparts in some allied countries , were aware since 2006 that Iran was constructing a second uranium processing plant that still remains under construction and is not operational .
According to a Sept. 26 article circulated by the McClatchy newspaper group quoting a U.S. intelligence official , “ There was dialogue with allies from a very early point . ”
Bush Administration Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnel first informed Obama about the facility soon after he won election .
He has been kept up to date since then .
Before going public with the information last week , the president saw to it that several other governments were told in advance , as was the IAEA and others .
Washington officials claimed Iran became aware “ in late spring ” that the U.S. was spying on the “ secret ” facility .
They said Iran then informed the International Atomic Energy Agency Sept. 21 about the existence of its project , implying Tehran did so because its cover was blown .
In a statement Sept. 24 the IAEA acknowledged that Tehran had informed them that a “ pilot fuel enrichment plant is under construction in the country , ” and that it “ also understands from Iran that no nuclear material has been introduced into the facility . ”
Iran insisted to the Vienna - based IAEA and the world that the enrichment plant under construction is designed only for fueling nuclear power installations .
Soon after Obama ’s G20 speech , Iran ’s Atomic Energy Organization declared the new “ semi- industrial enrichment fuel facility ” was “ within the framework of International Atomic Energy Agency ’s regulations . ”
Press reports said “ The head of Iran ’s nuclear program suggested UN inspectors would be allowed to visit the site . ”
The invitation was extended before Washington ’s demand that it do so .
A quite unruffled Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appeared at a press conference in New York after Obama ’s disclosures .
He seemed to regard the American president ’s allegations , and the staged manner in which they were delivered , not only the making of a mountain out of a molehill but an act of bad faith just before the talks are to begin , suggesting non-threateningly that Obama will come to regret his confrontational demeanor .
Ahmadinejad told the press that the plant in question would n’t be operational for 18 more months and that it did not violate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
He went further and said nuclear weapons “ are against humanity [ and ] they are inhumane , ” comments in keeping with his recent calls for eliminating all nuclear weapons .
The Iranian leader also said that Iran informed the IAEA about the plant only a few days ago instead of when ground was broken because construction had reached the stage where it should be reported , not because it found out that a U.S. spy agency was watching .
What are we to make of this ?
First it must be understood there is a dispute over the IAEA ’s safeguard provisions governing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Iran considers itself to be in total compliance with the NPT , and this appears to be true .
Inter - Press Service reporter Jim Lobe wrote Sept. 25 that “ Under the basic Safeguards Agreement of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of which Iran is a signatory , member states are required to declare their nuclear facilities and designs at least 180 days before introducing nuclear materials there . ”
According to an article in the Sept. 26 New York Times by Neil MacFarquhar , “ Tehran ’s stance hinges on different interpretations of the agency ’s regulations , said Graham Allison , the director of Harvard University ’s Belfer Center and an Iran nuclear expert .
“ For two decades , the agency required Iran to report only when nuclear material [ for uranium enrichment ] was introduced to a facility .
By 2003 it rescinded that , in line with the guidelines for most [ but not all ] countries , demanding reporting when construction began , Mr. Allison said .
But the agency never declared Iran out of compliance when Tehran claimed the old agreement was still in place . ”
In talking to the press after Obama ’s speech , Ahmadinejad said that the new facility would be completed in 18 months , so under Iran ’s understanding of its responsibilities , the notification was a year in advance .
The U.S. maintains that Iran informed the IAEA when it learned U.S. spy agencies had become aware of the plant , but if that were so , why did Tehran wait three months before contacting the nuclear agency ?
Had they acted out of fear of being exposed as non-compliant would n’t they have contacted IAEA immediately ?
“ What we did was completely legal , according to the law , ” the Iranian president said .
“ We have informed the agency , the agency will come and take a look and produce a report and it ’s nothing new . ”
According to the Associated Press Tehran ’s notice to the IAEA specified that the enrichment level would be up to 5 % , suitable only for peaceful purposes .
Weapons - grade material is more than 90 % enriched . ”
The AP also noted that the IAEA now “ says Iran is obliged to make such a notification when it begins design of such facilities ” and that “ a government cannot unilaterally abandon such an agreement . ”
This is confusing , of course .
But since Iran was never designated as non-compliant and was allowed to proceed under the previous rules for years after it registered its rejection of the new terms , the thunderous criticism emanating from the U.S. , Britain and France appears to have no serious merit .
CIT is close to handing control to bondholders , in a sweeping exchange offer that would eliminate 30 % to 40 % of its more than $ 30 billion in outstanding debt , the Wall Street Journal reports .
The plan would offer bondholders new debt secured by CIT assets , which would mature later than current debt .
If not enough bondholders agreed to the plan , the company could seek to execute the restructuring in bankruptcy court , the person said .
The result could potentially be one of the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy - court filings in U.S. history .
The source quoted by the WSJ cautions that talks “ remained fluid and many details remained to be ironed out .
To some extent it 's been predicted for awhile that the bondholders would end up with the company .
The timing of the news also suggests chicanery in the planting of the story this morning , about how the company could merger with IndyMac -- a story fiercely denied by prospective matchmaker John Paulson .

A common occurrence ?
Arctic waters are at best chilly and at worst close to freezing .
Which may explain why a polar bear cub has recently been seen riding on the back of its mother as the bears swim across parts of the Arctic Ocean .
The cub then briefly rode her back as she clambered out of the icy water , a unique event photographed by a tourist .
Experts have rarely seen the behaviour , and they say the latest find suggests it may be a more common practice than previously thought .
Dr Jon Aars from the Norwegian Polar Institute in Tromso describes what happened in the journal Polar Biology .
On the 21 July 2006 , Mrs Angela Plumb , a tourist from the UK , was aboard a ship in the mouth of a fjord in the Svalbard archipelago .
I would imagine a big benefit is the ride is faster
Professor Andrew Derocher from the University of Alberta , Edmonton , Canada Holidaying in the wildlife hotspot of Duvefjorden , Nordaustlandet , Mrs Plumb spotted the mother bear with a seven - month - old cub hitching a ride on her back .
" The cub was on the back of the polar bear when it was in the water , then it got out of the water and stayed on its mother 's back a little , then she shook it off , " Mrs Plumb explains .
For large parts of the year , polar bears ( Ursus maritimus ) live among the sea ice , feeding mainly on seals .
The challenge for the bears is to navigate the many areas of open water between the islands of floating ice .
Seeing the bear had a radio collar , Mrs Plumb got in touch with Dr Aars to report her sighting and asked if this was a common behaviour .
" I had n't seen this behaviour before or heard about it so I asked other researchers and found out it is something that has been observed but not frequently at all , " Dr Aars says .
Out of the cold Cubs are known to ride their mother 's back when moving through deep snow as they leave their den areas .
Cubs of other bear species such as the sloth bear also ride on their parents .
However , the the extent to which polar bear cubs hitch a ride on swimming adults in open water is unknown .
Dr Aars was especially interested if this behaviour might have some adaptive value for the bears .
" This could be potentially important because it means that the cubs get exposed to less water .
If they are in the water they would have to swim and very small cubs are very badly insulated in water , " he says .
Adults are well adapted to swimming in the cold water with insulating subcutaneous fat and and large body mass .
However , young bears have very little insulating fat , as they do not develop brown fat stores until adulthood .
Their fur coat also loses most of its insulating properties if immersed in ice water .
Dr Aars suggests staying out of the water could be vital for the cub 's ability to survive in habitats where sea ice is scattered across open ocean .
Speedy transport
Another reason for the behaviour could be that it aids the mother 's mobility in the water .
" I would imagine a big benefit is the ride is faster , an adult female polar bear is a strong swimmer , cubs of this size are much slower and time in water is time lost hunting , " suggests Professor Andrew Derocher from the University of Alberta , Edmonton , Canada .
" The mother would rather put her time into gaining more food by reaching good habitat rather than swimming and using energy , " he explains .
The scientists are interested to find out if this behaviour might be a regular occurrence within the polar bear population .
" It 's important to remember the vast areas it may happen in .
It has not been observed that much , but it could be more common than we think , " says Dr Aars .
Prof Derocher also wonders if the people who share the bears ' habitat might be able to help unravel this behaviour .
" It would be interesting to hear if Inuit have seen this behaviour , I 'm always very impressed that our observations match what local people have seen before , but they do n't tell you about them unless you ask . "

J.C. PENNEY has broken free of its suburban parking area to invade Herald Square , and the most frequent question on New York ’s collective lips seems to be : Why ?
Why would this perennially square department store bother to reanimate itself in Manhattan  in the sleekest , scariest fashion city in America  during a hair - raising economic downturn , without taking the opportunity to vigorously rebrand itself ?
Why would this dowdy Middle American entity waddle into Midtown in its big old shorts and flip - flops without even bothering to update its ancient Helvetica Light logo , which for anyone who grew up with the company is encrusted with decades of boring , even traumatically parental , associations ?
J. C. Penney has always trafficked in knockoffs that are n’t quite up to Canal Street ’s illegal standards .
It was never “ get the look for less ” so much as “ get something vaguely shaped like the designer thing you want , but cut much more conservatively , made in all - petroleum materials , and with a too - similar wannabe logo that announces your inferiority to evil classmates as surely as if you were cursed to be followed around by a tuba section . ”
But things , perhaps , have changed .
The juniors section of the new Manhattan Penney ’s seems to be trying , in a somewhat timid fashion , to thump with new energy .
Mini-sections flirt with Topshop - like knockoffs and goth wear lite  not quite a Hot Topic , but nearly lukewarm .
It is possible for a raging tween to walk out of Penney ’s looking mildly subversive in a zebra - print tee , a studded punk ( vinyl ) belt and black ankle - zip jeans ( $ 42 ) .
Young girls and their moms were quite delighted , gasping and squealing to find T - shirts with post - Jacko - facto memorial sentiments like “ I ♥ Michael Jackson ” ( $ 20 ) and “ Every Girl Needs Her Vampire . ”
The Obama administration threw a bone to the lunatic , fringe left a few days ago .
The memo to federal prosecutors in medical marijuana states has garnered hearty applause from Greenwald and the Marijuana Policy Project .
When elected , Obama said that federal raids on state - law legal marijuana cultivation and distribution would end .
The did n’t , not by a long shot , and the reasoning was that the feds would continue to prosecute people who violated state and federal laws .
That boils down to everyone , no matter their standing under state law .
The latest memo simply tells prosecutors that it ’s not a good use of their time to bring charges against those abiding by their State ’s law .
So hold your applause .
This memo amounts to nothing , which is precisely what ’s it ’s meant to amount to while simultaneously making Obama look like a good guy .
The Department of Justice is committed to the enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act in all States .
Congress has determined that marijuana is a dangerous drug , and the illegal distribution and sale of marijuana is a serious crime and provides a significant source of revenue to large - scale criminal enterprises , gangs , and cartels .
One timely example underscores the importance of our efforts to prosecute significant marijuana traffickers : marijuana distribution in the United States remains the single largest source of revenue for the Mexican cartels .
Note the Department ’s commitment , “ in all States ” .
I have to wonder what credentials Congress possess that enables it to determine how dangerous any drug is , as if that august body was known for its deep , careful thinkers and scientists .
Furthermore , according to everything i’ve ever read , drug scheduling is under the purview of several departments that are all within the executive branch .
That ’s how Congress established the system when it determined which drugs were dangerous and which drugs were n’t .
So the President could order the DEA , HHS and the FDA to review the scheduling of a drug and force Congress to be along for the ride .
Yes , marijuana trafficking is the single largest source of revenue for Mexican drug cartels .
That ’s because it ’s illegal .
I thought supply and demand was like the American catechism .
Restricting supply only pushes prices , and hence profits , up .
This idea that further restricting supply will somehow diminish cartel profits flies in the face of everything Ronald Reagan and common sense taught me …not that the two necessarily intersect .
As a general matter , pursuit of these priorities [ catching druggies ] should not focus federal resources in your States on individuals whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana .
… prosecution of commercial enterprises that unlawfully market and sell marijuana for profit continues to be an enforcement priority of the Department .
To be sure , claims of compliance with state or local law may mask operations inconsistent with the terms , conditions , or purposes of those laws , and federal law enforcement should not be deterred by such assertions when otherwise pursuing the Department ’s core enforcement priorities .
So according to the Obama administration , if you ’ve got cancer or aids and your supplier is giving you marijuana for free that ’s ok .
But just because someone is in full compliance with his State ’s law is no protection .
In other words , “ Hey , do n’t make us look like assholes by arresting someone who ’s got six months to live . ”
The administration produces a list of characteristics that should suggest prosecution .
Some of them make sense , but there ’s always a catch .
“ Evidence of money laundering activity ” makes the list .
As any monetary gain from the sale of marijuana is criminal under federal law , just about any use of marijuana proceeds could be considered money laundering .
And if you do n’t think that the DEA wo n’t see that argument , you ’re high .
This guidance regarding resource allocation does not “ legalize ” marijuana or provide a legal defense to a violation of federal law , nor is it intended to create any privileges , benefits , or rights , substantive or procedural , enforceable by any individual , party or witness in any administrative , civil , or criminal matter .
Nor does clear and unambiguous compliance with state law or the absence of one or all of the above factors create a legal defense to a violation of the Controlled Substances Act .
Get the picture ?
Nor does this guidance preclude investigation or prosecution , even when there is clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state law , in particular circumstances where investigation or prosecution otherwise serves important federal interests .
It should be clear by now that there ’s nothing in this memo worthy of applauding .
Sure it ’s a step in the right direction , but that only deserves the response , “ It ’s about damned time . ”
The administration has the power to start the ball rolling on significant drug reform .
Rescheduling would end the entire “ debate ” .
Judging by election in results in states where a marijuana referendum was on the ballot in 2008 , dope is a lot more popular than hope .
There ’s no political risk to Obama at the voter level .
The voters who would be angered by the move wo n’t be voting Democratic before the second coming in any case .
There are a at least few million who would probably vote for the politician who reforms marijuana laws regardless of anything else the politician does .
The youth vote would basically deify such a politician .
Big time donors like the pharmaceutical industry would n’t like it , which might indicate who ’s side the President is on , but see above and ask yourself if it would even matter for the one more election he can win .
But there almost certainly wo n’t be any movement on a relatively simple problem with a pretty straight - forward solution that would have positive benefits in other areas of concern like health care and the economy .
With the ability to legally cultivate marijuana there are probably a lot of unemployed American facing foreclosure who might attempt an entrepreneurial response to the death of the American Dream .
Places like Southeastern Kentucky would have a valuable cash crop , and they probably would n’t need so much tax - funded aid .
Hell , folks in those places might even start thinking that Obama ai n’t so bad after all .
Never mind the taxation question .
Enforcing taxation will be even more difficult than enforcing criminalization .
Let the money flow through the real economy and accept that it will trickle up .
Smart states will establish retail distribution licensing similar to the existing structure for alcohol .
It will raise local and state revenues ; keep control over the retail sector ; and be subject to sales tax .
We ’ll just have to take our chances on person - to - person transactions being claimed as miscellaneous income .
Regardless , that money will be spent and serve the greater economy .
Plenty of savings can be found by not wasting tax dollars on prosecution and incarceration of marijuana cases .
And i’ll bet that law enforcement will still have plenty to do .
The answer is simple and frankly , the question is stupid .
So you ’ll have to forgive me if i hold my applause until the end … though i might not be able to hold them if some intrepid journalist asks the President if he thinks it would have been better for the nation if he ’d been convicted of his youthful indiscretions and never gotten to be President .
Clearly you can smoke pot and grow up to be President , you just ca n’t get caught doing it .
Perhaps it would help if there was an authoritative definition of " proper monk behaviour " ?
" There are n't evil guys and innocent guys .
It 's just ...
It 's just ...
It 's just a bunch of guys . "
- Steve Arlo , Zero Effect
Perhaps there is a test that can be applied to any action that will determine how " proper " it is ?
Ask the questions - " Am I doing something that is helpful to another person trying to use perl ?
Did I at least intend to help ? "
But then there is the matter of jokes .
I think jokes and pop-culture references are inherently monk - like behavior & I would call them proper .
Lulz on the other hand can take on that Andy Kaufman quality ** - where they might only be funny to the perpetrator .
That borders on behavior more befitting of a Troll .
We would like to think that Monks and Trolls are mutually exclusive camps .
I repeat , we would like to think that ...
But then again comments like that are like chumming for flames , so my last transgression was apparently this sentence .
** - mind you I truly love Andy 's work .
Sadly however it could be argued that since the mainstream audience was n't " in on the joke " much of the time , he had a hard time of it , especially at the end .
Kurt Vonnegut
Artist , Anarchist and Social Critic
By Gaither Stewart
I somehow thought he would last forever , charming as always , joking , teasing , mocking , prickling , criticizing so wittily that the target of his pungent irony thought he was kidding , praising so ambiguously that those he loved thought he was criticizing , throwing mud pies in the faces of the powerful and calling them names , and boasting to one and all that he made lots of money being impolite .
���������� � � I most certainly am a member of the establishment , � Vonnegut told me that day over twenty years ago , I think it was the fall of 1985 , in his town house on the East Side in Manhattan .
An Amsterdam magazine had sent me to New York to interview the light of a �certain � American literature who so titillated , amused and charmed Europeans by ridiculing the ridiculous sides of America , by his playful lack of reverence for institutions and authority and for all the things that too many people take too seriously . �
� No one is more in its center than me but I don�t maintain contacts with the other members .
Though I don�t feel solidarity with it , I admit membership and I don�t like establishment people who play at the false role of rebels .
Then the establishment needs people like me � however I�m a member only because I have money , otherwise they wouldn�t even talk to me . �
�����������
At the appearance of his first novel , Player Piano , in 1952 , in the same year that Hemingway published The Old Man and the Sea and Steinbeck brought out East of Eden , Kurt Vonnegut was thirty and still widely considered an underground writer , despite Graham Greene�s labeling him �one of the best living American writers . �
����������� Kurt Vonnegut ( born 1922 in Indianapolis , died in New York , April 11 , 2007 from the consequences of a fall two weeks earlier ) was a very humorous man , so entertaining that he was deceptive , marked by broad grins , soft delivery and false modesty .
I wondered , as his co-establishment members must have wondered , too , where the creative artist ends and the performer begins .
Or vice - versa .
Was he a real social critic or simply a cynic ?
���������� �
After he became widely known in the sixties Vonnegut was identified with the revolt against realism and traditional forms of writing .
Though he most certainly was a �social writer� from beginning to end , he was also more experimental than his contemporaries like Norman Mailer , Philip Roth and John Barth , more fascinated by the absurd and the ridiculous .
His science fiction and short stories that had appeared in the best magazines in the post - war years , Atlantic Monthly , Esquire , Playboy , Colliers , Cosmopolitan , Saturday Evening Post , were marked by parody and experimental ridicule .
A cult grew around him , especially among youth , so that he remained �mysterious � even after he no longer belonged to the underground .
The appearance of each of his subsequent books was an event and he remained a fresh writer .
���������� �
Things got underway in earnest already in that first novel .
Vonnegut�s admiration for the marvels of technology had resulted in his early bent for science fiction , which he wrote a lot of .
In Player Piano he was �fascinated by the wonderfully sane engineers who could process anything � do anything on their own horizontal level .
Miraculous what the engineers could do .
They were brilliant but didn�t seem to do anything brilliant .
� Drawn on Huxley�s Brave New World and science fiction in general , Vonnegut�s concern was that these specialists , each working in his own field , would soon produce their own leaders , a caste created by a technocracy barren of leaders capable of working on a vertical level and devoid of fresh humanistic ideas .
���������� � � Precisely this scientific system created our leaders .
The problem is they brought little ideology into the factories .
In general there is so little ideology left � if we ever had any at all .
It �s good that we at least appeal to justice .
On the other hand , I have found that one can behave ideologically within a small group related by profession or interests .
I�m fascinated by the Paris Commune for example , especially its branch of anarchism .
People tend to hang onto natural anarchy .
The life of Bakunin is useful .
Seen as useful people , anarchists offer a fascinating alternative to big government today .
When I was a prisoner of war in Germany my small labor unit was left to fend for itself in destroyed Dresden .
( One of his most famous novels , Slaughterhouse Five . )
We dealt effectively with the thieves among us without being ferocious .
We did that intuitively . �
That was Vonnegut .
One of his contorted Americas is controlled by one enormous corporation - state under the guidance of an ugly old girl whose weighty signature is her fingerprints ( Jailbird ) .
In this society the poor spend their time squirting chemicals into their bodies for the simple reason that �on this planet they don�t have doodley - squat . �
That was the society that concerned the writer , Kurt Vonnegut , searching for a place for the individual .
Like himself his characters are amusing , entertaining and sympathetic � and rebels all .
Yet his conclusions are seldom humorous .
���������� � � Big government is like the weather , you can�t do anything about it .
People are moving away from central authority and its ineffective bureaucracy , which has created too many artificial jobs in Washington to accommodate our children .
Then , let�s face it , leadership is so poor . �
In fact , Vonnegut spent his later years attacking that bureaucracy , especially the George W. Bush administration .
His artistic family background �his father and grandfather were architects , his daughters painters �and his association with painters and musicians engendered yearnings in him for the image of the Renaissance man .
The day I spent the afternoon and early evening with him he invited me along to check in at the Greenwich Village gallery that was showing fifty of his book illustrations that he called �doodles with a felt - tip pen . �
At the vernissage the vain writer - illustrator was as nervous as a Broadway musical star on opening night .
But not to worry !
His fans snapped them up at one thousand dollars each .
He must have chuckled all the time to himself .
That exhibit was the stuff of a typical Vonnegut literary vignette as in Breakfast of Champions in which he pokes fun at the art world , phony artists and gullible consumers in a mixture of ambivalence and pity .
His fictional artist Karabekian has been paid $ 50,000 by the town for sticking a yellow strip of tape vertically on a piece of canvas .
The whole town hates him for the swindle until he explains that it was an unwavering band of light , like each of them , like Saint Anthony .
� All you had to do was explain , � say the relieved people to their cultural hero , now convinced they have acquired one of the world�s masterpieces .
� If artists would explain more people would like art more . �
� Though Vonnegut repeats that workers simply want an explanation , the cynic suspects cynicism in him too .
� Sometimes I think the people of the world are begging to understand .
And to be understood by the United States .
They want to be understood more than they want to be �freed� by America .
Actually the US encourages not seeing other peoples .
Disregard for other peoples is a matter of education .
Making money is the point .
Don�t waste your time .
Conserve your resources .
Withhold your time from people who can�t reward you .
This started when Reagan came along and did away with social help using tax monies that Roosevelt�s New Deal had introduced .
So the poor are now up the creek !
( This was 1985 , remember , before Iraq and Afghanistan and Iraq and East Africa and the war on terrorism . )
� And our intellectuals didn�t react at all to his re-election , � says the self - proclaimed Socialist - anarchist .
� He ran unopposed . �
In Deadeye Dick a neutron bomb being transported along the Interstate goes off , killing 100,000 people of the town but leaving everything else intact .
After the dead are buried under the parking lot for sanitary reasons , the question is what to do with the contaminated area .
Someone proposes moving Haitian immigrants there .
The point is that Vonnegut�s technological society needs the workers but it cares even less for non-Americans than for its own citizens .
� I�m convinced that slavery will come back , and Haitians were after all once slaves .
With all the automation , society needs slaves .
One will perhaps have the option of selling one�s services for long periods , thirty years , or for life .
There will be many takers .
Like the Asians and Mexicans who work here now for less than minimum wages . �
���������� � Americans who make their lives abroad see this generalized blindness to other peoples in their fellow Americans quite clearly , though they themselves are apparently unconscious of the neglect .
I think Vonnegut must be right : it �s education � and some brainwash , too .
Tourism and travels to Europe and Asia and South America to photograph the natives don�t really correct the blindness ; sometimes it reinforces it . �
We �re drinking scotch and black coffee and chain smoking in the kitchen of his unpretentious but large and expensive townhouse �four stories , with garden �in a swanky pretentious area of Manhattan .
A cold wind is blowing down from among new high - rise buildings .
Long Vonnegut in baggy pants and wool shirt is sprawled on an iron garden chair , drawling out his witticisms , descriptions and pronouncements , candid and down - to - earth , having fun at the expense of everyone �himself , me , us and them �the artist and social critic and performer , too .
He runs his slim delicate fingers through long reddish hair and pulls nervously at his mustache .
His talk has the quality of being quiet and breath - taking simultaneously .
He seemed and acted younger than his years .
����������� � I am successful , � he stresses , returning again and again to the money thing .
� Privileged !
When I was young and working for General Electric I was a hostage of society because I had six children .
Now I �m free because I have money .
I don�t like the privileged class , in the same way I will always resent the officer class .
I was a private during the war and saw an infantry division wiped out its first time in combat because it was poorly led .
Like America is poorly led today .�
( Reading the write - ups of the two interviews I did with him in 1980 and again in 1985 is a curious experience ; much of what he had to say then he could have said this year . ) �
���������� � � Like many writers Vonnegut said that writing for him was a way to rebel against his parents � life style .
He claimed he chose writing because he wrote better than he painted , and because you have to do something to make your mark .
He liked writing for newspapers because of the immediate feedback , which plays an enormous role among journalists I have known .
Journalists are as vain as novelists and find it rewarding to write an article in the evening and see it in print the next day .
I liked , appreciated and agreed with his social stance but he was his most entertaining and I believe most in earnest speaking of the arts .
���������� �
� You can�t help but look back wistfully to the days of Cellini and Leonardo da Vinci who worked in many arts .
But today there are so many things to do that we don�t have the time to dedicate ourselves wholly to the arts .
Still , I believe in the arts .
My children say I dance well .
I can shag and that �s mysterious to the young .
I can jitterbug and that impresses them .
And I play the clarinette lovingly .
In general the arts have held up well in catastrophic situations .
Yet there are preferences .
It �s true that painters like to paint and writers hate to write .
Putting paint on a canvas is fun and is easy .
You don�t even have to finish it .
After six strokes you have a painting .
At that point you can frame it and hang it .
Maybe that�s why writers like to paint and draw .
Norman Mailer is a good drawer .
Tennessee Williams does good watercolors .
Henry Miller is the best writer - painter I have known .
Poetry too is fast .
That �s why poets have so much time to sit around caf�s and talk .
But the novelist is always busy , sitting at a typewriter like a stenographer , which is boring and lonely .
� My book , Breakfast of Champions , is about art .
I think art should be refreshing to everyone .
But many artists are in league with the rich to make the poor feel dumb , like all the galleries downtown with walls covered in dots and blank whites .
The rich organize art in such a way as to prove they have different souls from the poor , to give a biological justification to their status .
Mystification is the secret .
Ruling classes find it politically useful that workers can�t understand the pictures in the galleries .
Inaccessible art grew out of industrialization .
In the Renaissance art was of the people . �
Vonnegut�s heroes are outsiders , the rebels in big organizations who think the system is wrong and maybe want to change it .
In a wacky and comical way he depicts the hopeless and sad human condition .
His heroes care about involvement .
Yet they are helpless .
They have little power to decide anything .
� No man is in control , � he murmurs .
� People are just born on this planet and are immediately hit over the head and yelled at .
Ten per cent of the world�s children are abused .
So what chance does man have ?
My own success is like an American dream .
My growth graph is perfect .
I�m prosperous .
I can see clearly how it worked for me .
I�m convinced we�re all programmed in a certain way .
Still , big bureaucracy appalls me .
Gore Vidal was right that this is the only country in the world that does nothing for its citizens .
Jobs don�t go around .
The auto industry is laying people off ( that was twenty - two years ago and it still is ! ) .
Still , I have to say that working on the assembly line is better than doing nothing at all .
But the problem is we�re just not useful anymore .
We need to find new uses for man , find a simpler way of life . �
The backdrop of Vonnegut�s stage is this :
While the people lament gasoline prices and call for small cars , Detroit turns out bigger cars and lays off workers .
The people eat macrobiotic foods and squirt chemicals up their assholes and swallow exotic anti-hemorrhoid salves .
It �s the people !
But not people in his beloved New York !
His settings are the wide expanses of America .
Where the really funny , mad things happen .
A world so far from Europe as to be incredible .
A world that baffles Europeans . ��
At a certain point , still in the kitchen , and after his wife had glanced in a couple times , I think to check on the scotch level , and after he told me he never gave interviews to the American press , only to Europeans , and pouring more scotch said that interviews were hard work , and after he admitted he neglected his German heritage and the Vonnegut family tree in M�nster , I asked him about his statement in a recent book �I don�t remember which �that people and nations have their story that ends , after which it�s all epilogue , and he intimated that the US story ended after World War II .
���������� � � That was only a joke , � he said wryly , smiling sheepishly .
���������� � � It didn�t sound like a joke .
It sounded quite serious . �
����������� � Well � ( reluctantly , perhaps not wanting to appear too critical of the USA to the European public ) , � the United States story will become epilogue unless it succeeds in renewing itself .
Like a play peters out if it slows down and has nothing else to say .
One must invent new themes for development .
Economic justice is one such theme that would make our first two hundred years seem like only Act I .
That would become Act II .
If that theme is not developed , then our story peters out .
Our legal justice would then become mere mockery .
Remember the old quip : � It �s no disgrace to be poor but it might as well be . �
���������� � � In the Constitution there is nothing about economic justice , only the legal utopia .
The Bill of Rights is a utopia .
We have laws that violate the Constitution .
It �s now time to start thinking about social fairness .
Our superstar government leaders deal with billions of dollars and we have individuals richer than the whole state of Wyoming .
The military - industrial complex is robbing us blind , building their bizarre weapons that costs $ 40,000 a shot to use .
Sensitive weapons that don�t work in the dark or under 50 � .
We can�t possibly understand all that crap .
Compare the arms manufacturers to the salesmen of snake eye in the frontier days .
The miracle medicine .
In the 1930s we had Eugene Debs who labeled arms manufacturers �merchants of death .�
Then the crooks took over the labor unions and we have nothing left today so that I don�t have a banner to which I can adhere .
And the same type of people are on top in our society today , selling their quack remedies , to protect us against the dread disease of Communism .
( I�m certain he said the same about terrorism in later years ! )
And that�s what I say in my annual lectures at ten universities .
I would like to see that change .
���������� � � Yet people don�t give a damn about anything .
Few care what we pour into the world everyday .
Few care if we go to war .
People are embarrassed about life and don�t care if it all ends .
Humans have decided that the experiment of life is a failure . �
���������� �
One of his characters speaks of being born like a disease : � I have caught life .
I have come down with life .�
Speaking about experiencing the destruction of Dresden , a city of beauty like Paris , Vonnegut said he was the only there who found it remarkable that it all went up in smoke .
� Not even the Germans seemed to care . �
The scotch flowed .
The kitchen was blue with smoke .
Thank God I was recording our talk or little would have remained .
At some point one of us said �doodley - squat . �
He loved those sounds , spicing his novels liberally with skeedee wah , skeedee wo .
At critical moments his heroes mumble in skat talk of the jazz era , skeedee beep , zang reepa dop , singing a few bars to chase the blues away .
Then , yump - yump , tiddle - taddle , ra - a - a - a , yump - yump - boom .
And abbreviations Ramjac , epicac and euphic .
Onomatopeic or symbolic nonsense .
Doodley - squat for the nothing at all the poor don�t have .
���������� �
It all sounded OK in the smoky blue kitchen over scotch but what do those sounds mean ?
Futuristic concepts ?
Or sounds of joy or despair ?
The voice of truth ?
Or just social chatter ?
Escape or mere foolishness ?
Is he writer or entertainer ?
���������� � � Any agreement on the basis of friendliness obliterates ideas and thinking .
What about that ?�
���������� � � Yes , I wrote that .
The stupid performance of man and his degeneration are possible because no one is thinking .
There has been a warm brotherhood of stupidity .
What do words mean anyway ?
The old Hollywood joke is expressive :
����������� Question :
How do you say , �fuck yourself ? �
���������� � Answer : � Trust me .��

I took the following information from various websites , Dutch , German and Italian , of countries where Vonnegut was immensely popular , simply in order to round out his life story .
After his last novel in 1997 he left fiction writing and became a senior editor for In These Times .
The magazine is dedicated to informing and analyzing popular movements for social , environmental and economic justice ; to providing a forum for discussing the politics that shape our lives ; and to producing a magazine that is read by the broadest and most diverse audience possible .
Vonnegut wrote that if the magazine didn�t exist he would be a man without a country .
In his columns there he began a blistering attack on the administration of President George W. Bush and the Iraq war . �
" By saying that our leaders are power - drunk chimpanzees , am I in danger of wrecking the morale of our soldiers fighting and dying in the Middle East ? " he wrote .
" Their morale , like so many bodies , is already shot to pieces .
They are being treated , as I never was , like toys a rich kid got for Christmas . "
In �A Man without a Country � he wrote that " George W. Bush has gathered around him upper - crust C- students who know no history or geography . "
He did not regard the 2004 election with much optimism ; speaking of Bush and John Kerry , he said that " no matter which one wins , we will have a Skull and Bones President at a time when entire vertebrate species , because of how we have poisoned the topsoil , the waters and the atmosphere , are becoming , hey presto , nothing but skulls and bones . "
In 2005 , Vonnegut was interviewed by David Nason for The Australian .
During the course of the interview Vonnegut was asked his opinion of modern terrorists , to which he replied " I regard them as very brave people . "
When pressed further Vonnegut also said that " They [ suicide bombers ] are dying for their own self - respect .
It 's a terrible thing to deprive someone of their self - respect .
It 's [ like ] your culture is nothing , your race is nothing , you 're nothing ...
It is sweet and noble � sweet and honorable I guess it is � to die for what you believe in . "

Our blog sibling Gizmodo just noticed a Microsoft promotion at Win741.com , offering U.S. students Windows 7 Home Premium for just $ 30 .
That 's a good deal better than the $ 120 retail price for an upgrade , and , as with the Ultimate Steal Office offering , Microsoft and cohorts are n't exactly going to ring up your alma mater 's provost to ensure you 're still enrolled there when you hand over your .edu mail address .

Update :
The information below was the original text of this post involving a $ 19 Windows 7 Professional offering .
We emailed the Association for Computing Machinery and heard back from Lillian Israel , director of membership , who noted that Windows 7 purchases have been pulled from the ACM 's discounted license offerings due to misuse of memberships .

The CyberNet blog points any student with an interest or inclination toward the " science , technology , engineering , and mathematics fields " to check out the Association for Computing Machinery ( ACM ) , where a membership is $ 19 and one of membership 's key perks is access to Microsoft 's MSDN Academic Alliance catalog .
That lets you snag Office and other normally high - priced products for very low prices , and Windows 7 Professional licenses for free , minus the cost of membership .
A single validation key for Windows 7 Professional at the cost of a pizza is pretty good , but CyberNet sweetens the deal by noting that picking up eight separate keys for 32 - and 64 - bit version of Windows 7 in four different languages gives you eight keys that work on any installation .

Minimap is a feature provided by the Sublime editor .
It shows a smaller , “ minibar ” , display of the current buffer alongside the main editing window .
This page is about a minimap implementation for Emacs .
In the minibar window , it highlights the portion of the buffer that is currently visible in the main window .
This highlight position is updated automatically , as you navigate in the main window .
You can scroll the main window by dragging the highlighted area in the minibar .
You can configure the size / readability of the sidebar freely by specifying the font familiy and height .
Here are two screenshots of the minibar in action :
With Bitstream Vera Sans , Height 30 , with semantic overlays enabled ( requires CEDET ) :
With Proggyfont Tiny , Height 20 :
It is in GNU ELPA , so you can get it directly from ‘ M - x package - install ’ , or you can find its code at https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs/elpa.git/tree/packages/minimap/minimap.el
Repository at GitHub : https://github.com/dengste/minimap
Usage :
Use ‘ M - x minimap - mode ’ to toggle the minimap minor mode .
By default , the Minimap will automatically be activated for all buffers which are derived from ‘ prog - mode ’ .
to toggle the minimap minor mode .
By default , the Minimap will automatically be activated for all buffers which are derived from .
Use ‘ M -x customize - group RET minimap RET ’ to adapt minimap to your needs .
Things you can customize :
Recenter strategies - always keep active region in the middle , or scroll dependent on the position in the buffer .
Can use information from CEDET ’s semantic analyzer to display structure , functions , variables and types .
Alternatively , can display certain faces in their normal size so that you can still read them ( function names , for instance ) .
Position on the left or right .
Set minimap - update - delay to 0 if you want an immediate reaction to scrolling ( slows down scrolling , though ) .
KNOWN BUGS :
Currently cannot deal with images .
Display / movement can be a bit erratic at times .
TODO :
Fix known bugs .
Make sidebar permanently visible .
This requires something like a ‘ window group ’ feature in Emacs , which is currently being worked on ( for the EmacsCodeBrowser ) .
Moving the active region with the keyboard / mouse - wheel ?
Somehow make the minimap more compact – maybe the line spacing can still be reduced ?
For now , you can choose another , more condensed fonts .
Sublimity is a similar package .

Do you use the Scheme programming language ?
If so , do you program mainly in a serious mood to write applications , or in a crafty mood to have fun ?
In other words , do you consider yourself a non-Scheming Schemer , or a Scheming Schemer ?
I consider myself a Scheming Schemer : I program in Scheme mainly in a crafty mood just to have fun .
To quote Alan Perlis from the dedication in SICP :
“ I think that it ’s extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing .
When it started out , it was an awful lot of fun .
Of course , the paying customers got shafted every now and then , and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously .
We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful , error - free perfect use of these machines .
I do n’t think we are .
I think we ’re responsible for stretching them , setting them off in new directions , and keeping fun in the house .
I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun .
Above all , I hope we do n’t become missionaries .
Do n’t feel as if you ’re Bible salesmen .
The world has too many of those already .
What you know about computing other people will learn .
Do n’t feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands .
What ’s in your hands , I think and hope , is intelligence : the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it , that you can make it more . ”
Alan J. Perlis ( April 1 , 1922 - February 7 , 1990 )
Nevertheless , as many of you probably know , some recent developments in the evolution of the Scheme programming language have reduced the influence of the language .
In particular , the R5RS vs. R6RS schism and the replacement of the 6.001 course at MIT , based on Scheme , with a 6.01 course , based on Python , are two events that have created much controversy .
Concerned over such events , recently , I posted a thread , entitled “ Ideas for an SICP ’? ” on the comp.lang .
scheme USENET newsgroup , asking for suggestions for an alternative to SICP with a similar content , as follows :
[ W] ith Scheme replaced by Python at MIT , this special role of Scheme
as the vehicle for teaching sophisticated students of computer science
has been greatly diminished .
Arguments against SICP as being too
difficult for an introductory textbook notwithstanding , the presence
and usage of that textbook contributed greatly to the significance of
Scheme as a tool in teaching introductory computer science .
It seems that SICP could use a replacement .
What is needed is an
alternative textbook to use Scheme in a role that cannot be fulfilled
by such languages as Python , in order to foster creativity and
originality in programming for future freethinking hackers .
In
addition , such an alternative textbook would need to be actively used
by leading educational institutions of introductory computer science
in raising a new generation of future Scheme hackers .
Does anybody have any suggestions for a plan that could lead to the
birth and growth of such an alternative leading textbook ?
Many
programmers tend to be strongly influenced by the first textbook that
they encounter in learning programming ; whether that language is
Scheme or Python could have great effect on the future influence of
such languages .
The SICP phenomenon has been done once ; why not give
rise to a new SICP ’ phenonemon ?
There were several responses .
In particular , one user , Ray , responded as follows :
[ N] obody who ’s grown up with the web , and who thinks of
computers as being primarily communications devices , will
believe that that makes a language anything other than a
crippled toy if you ca n’t interface with the hardware
capabilities of the machine , enabling you to do something
as “ simple ” as writing a web browser in it , managing network
connections , handling Graphical UI elements , and rendering
text and graphics on the screen . [ … ]
Now , consider what Scheme ’s got that Python does n’t got .
It comes down to syntactic abstraction and continuations .
Courses based on SICP do n’t use them , so MIT had nothing
to lose by going to Python .
Perhaps .
But has Scheme really lost the essence of its appeal ?
I disagree .
Recently , I started reading a guide ( albeit in Japanese , since I can read that language as well ) by Shiro Kawai on the Gauche implementation of Scheme , and opened up a chapter on continuations .
( For those of you who do not know , continuations are a control mechanism in Scheme which allows assignment of control flow to a variable , allowing a process to be “ continued ” ( hence the name ) from the point where the continuation was saved . )
Since I had not yet fully understood continuations , I found the chapter extremely interesting , and could not stop reading .
At one point , I encountered the following procedure which used a continuation , written in continuation - passing style ( a.k.a. “ CPS ” style ) ( in which , rather than assigning the continuation directly to a variable , the continuation is explicitly passed as a parameter ) , to calculate the factorial function :
( define ( fact / cps n cont ) ( if ( = n 0 ) ( cont 1 ) ( fact / cps (- n 1 ) ( lambda ( a ) ( cont ( * n a ) ) ) ) ) )
This procedure returns the same results as the following ( much simpler ) one ( listed on the same page ) , which does not use a continuation :
( define ( fact n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 (* n ( fact (- n 1 ) ) ) ) )
In particular , I started at the mysterious “ ( a ) ” variable in the following piece of code above , wondering what that variable represented :
( fact / cps (- n 1 ) ( lambda ( a ) ( cont ( * n a ) ) ) )
Suddenly , it dawned upon me :
The “ ( a ) ” variable stored the parameter that was passed to the continuation ( “ ( lambda ( a ) ( cont ( * n a ) ) ) ” ) , which , in turn , captured the control state of the procedure at that point of execution , which was , in turn , passed back as a parameter to the enclosing procedure !
In short , the continuation was a microcosm of the execution context of the procedure at that point in time , encapsulated in a lambda abstraction !
Here , “ fact / cps ” is the name of the procedure , which stands for “ factorial in CPS ( continuation - passing style ) form . ”
Suppose we call “ fact / cps ” in the most simple case : a value of 0 for the first parameter , and a function that simply returns the parameter passed to it as a second parameter :
( fact / cps 0 ( lambda ( a ) a ) )
Then , in “ fact / cps ” , “ ( = n 0 ) ” is true in the if - statement , so “ ( cont 1 ) ” is called , where “ cont ” is simply the second parameter of the enclosing “ fact / cps ” function , or “ ( lambda ( a ) a ) ” ( the continuation ) , which returns the value of the parameter “ a ” , which is 1 in this case , so 1 is returned .
Let ’s be a little bolder , and use a value of 1 for the first parameter :
( fact / cps 1 ( lambda ( a ) a ) )
This time , “ (= n 0 ) ” is false in the if - statement , so the following recursive call is made ( substituting 1 for n ) :
( fact / cps (- 1 1 ) ( lambda ( a ) ( cont ( * 1 a ) ) ) )
In the recursive call , (- 1 1 ) is substituted for the first parameter of “ fact / cps ” , and “ ( lambda ( a ) ( cont (* 1 a ) ) ” is substituted for the second parameter of “ fact / cps ” .
This is the same as the following call ( reducing the first parameter to a value ) :
( fact / cps 0 ( lambda ( a ) ( cont ( * 1 a ) ) ) )
However , since we had passed an identity function , “ ( lambda ( a ) a ) ” for “ cont ” in the enclosing function , this reduces to the following call ( expanding “ cont ” to “ ( lambda ( a ) a ) ” ) :
( fact / cps 0 ( lambda ( a ) ( ( lambda ( a ) a ) (* 1 a ) ) ) )
Here , the explicit continuation “ ( lambda ( a ) ( ( lambda ( a ) a ) (* 1 a ) ) ) ) ” first takes whatever is handed to it as the parameter “ a ” , and passes it to the inner function ( lambda abstraction , actually , but we ’ll dismiss that point here ) , so we reach “ (( lambda ( a ) a ) (* 1 a ) ) ” .
But this is just the identity function on the inner “ (* 1 a ) ” .
So this part just reduces to “ ‘(* 1 a ) ” , which is the same as just “ a ” , which is whatever value is passed to this continuation , so this continuation is just the identity function .
So when “ fact / cps ” is recursively called with 0 for the first parameter n and this identity value continuation “ ( lambda ( a ) ( ( lambda ( a ) a ) (* 1 a ) ) ) ) ” for the second parameter cont , we first reach “ (= n 0 ) ” as the condition in the if - statement , which is true .
This leads to evaluating the following :
( cont 1 )
But “ ( cont 1 ) ” is just this identity continuation called with 1 , so it just returns the parameter 1 .
So , “ ( fact / cps 1 ( lambda ( a ) a ) ) ” is just the value passed to it :
1
Of course , we did n’t need to pass the identity function “ ( lambda ( a ) a ) ” as the second parameter to “ fact / cps ” .
We could have formatted the output , for example , by passing a formatting function , instead ( to borrow the syntax of Gauche Scheme ) :
( lambda ( a ) ( format #t " The factorial value is ~a . " a ) )
Then we could have invoked “ fact / cps ” with that formatting function for the function to be passed as the continuation , as follows :
( fact / cps 3 ( lambda ( a ) ( format #t " The factorial value is ~a . " a ) ) )
This would have returned the following :
The factorial value is 6.#< undef >
Alternatively , we could have chosen to multiple whatever was returned by 2 , just to screw up the function , as follows :
( fact / cps 3 ( lambda ( a ) (* 2 a ) ) )
This would have returned the following :
12
Hey , why not combine the two functions , and get Scheme to say something funny ?
( fact / cps 3 ( lambda ( a ) ( format #t " I do solemnly swear that the factorial value is ~a . " (* 2 a ) ) ) )
Scheme then would have returned the following :
I do solemnly swear that the factorial value is 12 .
Despite ( or maybe because of ? ) all this exploratory monkey - business , in the “ Aha ! ” moment described above , I felt an ecstasy of enlightenment that I do not often experience elsewhere ( er , elsewhen , rather ) .
Such “ Aha ! ” moments are crucial to appreciating the fun in computer science .
They are commonly found whenever a deeper level of understanding is achieved by contemplating something which is not obvious at first .
I have noticed that they are found more easily in Scheme than in some other programming languages , because of the flexibility that the language allows in even esoteric expressions .
In order to enjoy programming , one must appreciate the fun in programming , and it is difficult to appreciate this factor without experiencing an “ Aha ! ” moment .
The deeper the understanding , the more intense the exhilaration associated .
Continuations and syntactic abstraction , in particular , are very abstruse ( some may even say “ arcane ” ) topics , especially when first encountered , and can require relatively deep understanding .
Hence , by providing opportunities to learn such concepts , Scheme can provide an ideal opportunity to experience the fun of programming .
Thus , the continued need for Scheme .
Not all books that use Scheme adopt this approach .
An alternative approach is to structure the curriculum so that the learning becomes a linear process , rather than a series of leaps , so that all the parts fit together neatly like solving a jigsaw puzzle , rather than like climbing a mountain .
Not to be critical of this approach , but not everybody prefers it .
In one critique , José Antonio Ortega Ruiz , in his blog , “ A Scheme bookshelf « programming musings , ” contrasts one well - known textbook that uses this alternative approach , How to Design Programs ( a.k.a. “ HtDP ” ) , with SICP , as follows :
The most cited alternative to SICP is How to Design Programs by Felleisen , Findler , Flatt and Krishnamurthi .
Its authors have even published a rationale , The Structure and Interpretation of the Computer Science Curriculum , on why they think SICP is not well suited to teaching programming and how their book tries to fix the problems they ’ve observed .
I wo n’t try to argue against such eminent schemers , but , frankly , my feeling is that HtDP is a far , far cry from SICP .
HtDP almost made me yawn , and there ’s no magic to be seen .
Ortega - Ruiz is somewhat harsh in his critique of HtDP .
After all , according to the authors of the paper explaining the rationale behind the book , The Structure and Interpretation of the Computer Science Curriculum , HtDP was created in the first place to rectify two major perceived problems with SICP ( page 9 of the paper ) :
… SICP does n’t state how to program and how to manage the design
of a program .
It leaves these things implicit and implies that students can discover a
discipline of design and programming on their own .
The course presents the various
uses and roles of programming ideas with a series of examples .
Some exercises then
ask students to modify this code basis , requiring students to read and study code ;
others ask them to solve similar problems , which means they have to study the
construction and to change it to the best of their abilities .
In short , SICP students
learn by copying and modifying code , which is barely an improvement over typical
programming text books .
SICP ’s second major problem concerns its selection of examples and exercises .
All
of these use complex domain knowledge … .
While these topics are interesting to students who use computing in electrical
engineering and to those who already have significant experience of programming
and computing , they assume too much understanding from students who have n’t
understood programming yet and they assume too much domain knowledge from
any beginning student who needs to acquire program design skills .
On the average ,
beginners are not interested in mathematics and electrical engineering , and they do
not have ready access to the domain knowledge necessary for solving the domain
problems .
As a result , SICP students must spend a considerable effort on the do -
main knowledge and often end up confusing domain knowledge and program design
knowledge .
They may even come to the conclusion that programming is a shallow
activity and that what truly matters is an understanding of domain knowledge .
While these are all valid points , Ortega - Ruiz ’s last clause , “ there ’s no magic to be seen , ” actually describes the key conflict here .
What exactly is this “ magic ? ”
To be experimentally borderline facetious , according to Arthur C. Clarke ,
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic .
Arthur C. Clarke , “ Profiles of The Future ” , 1961 ( Clarke ’s third law )
English physicist & science fiction author ( 1917 – )
So maybe we ’re actually referring to “ any sufficiently advanced technology . ”
What do we mean by “ sufficiently advanced ? ” I would suggest ( to use a recursive definition ) , “ sufficiently advanced to the point that deep understanding unachievable superficially is required to understand the material . ”
Whether or not this “ magic ” is to be used in pedagogy actually relates to the fundamental design philosophy behind HtDP , as opposed to that behind SICP .
To quote the above - referenced paper explaining the rationale behind HtDP , “ The Structure and Interpretation of the Computer Science Curriculum , ” as follows ( page 11 ) :
The recipes also introduce a new distinction into program design : structural ver -
sus generative recursion .
The structural design recipes in the first half of the book
match the structure of a function to the structure of a data definition .
When the
data definition happens to be self - referential , the function is recursive ; when there
is a group of definitions with mutual cross-references , there is a group of function
definitions with mutual references among the functions .
In contrast , generative re -
cursion concerns the generation of new problem data in the middle of the problem
solving process and the re-use of the problem solving method .
Compare insort and kwik , two standard sort functions : ;; ( listof X ) -> ( listof X ) ( define ( insort l ) ( cond [ ( empty ? l ) empty ] [ else ( place ( first l ) ( insort ( rest l ) ) ) ] ) ) ;; ( listof X ) -> ( listof X ) ( define ( kwik l ) ( cond [ ( empty ? l ) empty ] [ else ( append ( kwik ( larger ( first l ) l ) ) ( first l ) ( kwik ( smaller ( first l ) l ) ) ) ] ) )
The first function , insort , recurs on a structural portion of the given datum , namely ,
( rest l ) .
The second function , kwik , recurs on data that are generated by some other
functions .
To design a structurally recursive function is usually a straightforward
process .
To design a generative recursive function , however , almost always requires
some ad hoc insight into the process .
Often this insight is derived from some mathe -
matical idea .
In addition , while structurally recursive functions naturally terminate
for all inputs , a generative recursive function may diverge .
htdp therefore suggests
that students add a discussion about termination to the definition of generative
recursive functions .
HtDP takes pains to remove the requirement for this “ ad hoc insight ” into the problem - solving process .
The authors of the book then make the following claim ( same page ) :
Distinguishing the two forms of recursion and focusing on the structural case
makes our approach scalable to the object - oriented ( OO ) world .
That may be so , but that contrasts sharply with the spirit of the original quotation by Alan Perlis above :
Of course , the paying customers got shafted every now and then , and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously .
We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful , error - free perfect use of these machines .
I do n’t think we are .
I think we ’re responsible for stretching them , setting them off in new directions , and keeping fun in the house .
So we have two sharply contrasting approaches :
One to use Scheme for fun , and the other to use Scheme for scalability .
Again , this basically is a matter of taste .
In his above - mentioned post in the above - mentioned thread , Ray contrasted the advantages of Scheme vs. Python as follows :
[ S ] cheme still has no standard means of managing network connections
or rendering anything on the screen .
Python has these things .
Now , consider what Scheme ’s got that Python does n’t got .
It comes down to syntactic abstraction and continuations .
Courses based on SICP do n’t use them , so MIT had nothing
to lose by going to Python .
SICP does n’t use syntactic abstraction .
In the first
edition , this was because Scheme did n’t have them yet .
In the current edition …. well , here ’s the footnote
about macros from the current edition , page 373 :
Practical Lisp systems provide a mechanism that
allows users to add new derived expressions and
specify their implementation as syntactic
transformations without modifying the evaluator .
Such a user - defined transformation is called a
/ macro / .
Although it is easy to add an elementary
mechanism for defining macros , the resulting
language has subtle name - conflict problems .
There
has been much research on mechnaisms for macro
definitions that do not cause these difficulties .
See , for example , Kohlbecker 1986 , Clinger and
Rees 1991 , and Hanson 1991 .
( Aside : “ practical ” lisp systems have them ; the dialect
covered in the book does not .
Students can and do draw
the obvious conclusion …. )
Granted , specific implementations do have these functions .
But there is no single main implementation of Scheme that everybody uses , and the libraries that implement these functions are not necessarily portable across implementations .
Therefore , Scheme as a language ( as opposed to a specific implementation ) does not have these functions .
But is that necessarily bad ?
I do n’t think so .
I think that the whole point of Scheme , as a language , is , to quote Alan Perlis above , that we are “ [ not ] responsible for the successful , error - free perfect use of these machines , [ but ] for stretching them , setting them off in new directions , and keeping fun in the house . ”
To sum , when I first approached SICP , I found it too challenging to digest .
I had to quit reading it repeatedly , and then return to it later , and I still have read only a portion of the book .
But I became entranced with the magic of computer science as demonstrated by such creatures as tail recursion in Scheme in SICP .
And it was precisely this magic that kept me returning to computer science in general , and to Scheme in particular .
On the other hand , books such as HtDP are very comforting and reassuring .
While SICP sometimes makes me wonder why I am such an idiot , HtDP makes me feel as if I am no longer an idiot .
I no longer need to think for hours and hours during my sleep about how to overcome a particular problem .
Books such as HtDP make the material very straightforward .
However , by doing so , they also remove all the magic , and break the spell .
I feel that an intermediate approach is better .
The magic is necessary , but the sorcery in SICP can be too much at first .
However , the jigsaw - puzzle approach of HtDP seems too straightforward .
There is not enough exploration to maintain interest after a certain level of reader sophistication .
Paradoxically , although I can read HtDP much , much faster than SICP , I also fall asleep reading it just as much faster , and actually have n’t read so far in it .
A gentler approach than that of SICP , which still offers more exploration than HtDP , would be a better compromise .
Also , I feel that the greatest strength of Scheme lies in its flexibility for exploratory programming .
Scheme shares one quality that is also shared by such addictive games as Tetris :
It is relatively simple to learn , yet extremely difficult to master .
Writing simple procedures to calculate such functions as the factorial function or the Fibonacci sequence is deceptively simple at first .
But when the student ventures into such deeper areas as tail recursion , continuations , and syntactic abstractions , the procedures can become tantalizingly complex .
To conclude , should n’t Scheme really be a language for scheming programmers to figure out mainly how to have fun ?
I like to be a Scheming Schemer , always scheming plots for stretching the lambda abstractions to set them off in new directions , mainly just to have fun .
Are you a Scheming Schemer ?
OCTOBER 14-- A South Carolina teenager is facing a felony charge for throwing a " deadly missile " at a moving vehicle .
The armament in question was a burrito .
According to this Hernando County Sheriff 's Office report , the 15 - year - old suspect , a passenger in a Dodge , allegedly threw the burrito Saturday afternoon at John Addie 's Honda as the cars traveled alongside each other on a Florida street .
Cops discovered burrito remnants inside and outside the vehicle , as well as on Addie , who was not injured when struck by the flying foodstuff ( somehow , Addie 's Honda suffered a chipped windshield during the incident ) .
After tracing the Dodge 's license plate , cops confronted the teenager , who admitted throwing the burrito as a " prank . "
He claimed that no other object was thrown at the Honda , though cops concluded that there was evidence that " a hard object caused damage " to Addie 's car .
The admitted burrito tosser , pictured in the mug shot at left , was booked into jail and later released into his father 's custody .

[ digg - reddit - me ] Tim Lynch from Cato@Liberty appeared on CNN with former drug czar Barry McCaffrey and was outraged at the blatant lies he told .
Lynch points to two specific lies :
that it is a “ fantasy ” with “ zero truth ” that “ the Drug Enforcement Administration or any other federal law enforcement ever threatened care - givers or individual patients ” regarding medicinal marijuana ; and
that it was “ nonsense ” that the DEA was “ going to threaten doctors simply for discussing the pros and cons of using marijuana with their patients ” until the Ninth Circuit held that such a restriction was unconstitutional .
Of course , McCaffrey is no stranger to eliding the truth .
I posted a video a while back pointing out another whopper McCaffrey told – this time to an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations :
De facto legalized ?
Yet McCaffrey himself attacked those politicians who suggested even allowances for medicinal marijuana :
After California passed a compassionate use initiative in 1996 , McCaffrey warned doctors in the state that their privileges to prescribe narcotics would be stripped by the DEA if they prescribed or recommended marijuana use .
In July 1998 , as part of the anti-pot campaign , the drug czar claimed that Holland , a country with liberal drug laws , had a murder rate double that of the United States .
In fact , although robberies have increased in the Netherlands since pot was made widely available in the late 1980s , the country ’s murder rate is scarcely a quarter of the U.S. rate .
McCaffrey never corrected himself .
When Gary Johnson , New Mexico ’s maverick Republican governor , spoke in favor of decriminalization , McCaffrey flew out to the state and claimed that Johnson had said “ heroin is good . ” [ my emphasis ]
If we are to believe his comments now , he apparently secretly did not oppose legalization while he was drug czar – as I reported earlier , he said at the same event as the above :
QUESTIONER : … [ W ] hy not just legalize drugs ?
Former Drug Czar , General BARRY MCCAFFREY ( retired ) : … [ S ] ince I ’m not in public life , [ I can say ] I actually do n’t care .
I care about 6th graders through 12th graders .
If you ’re 40 years old , and you ’re living in Oregon , and you have 12 giant pot plants in the back of your log cabin , knock yourself out .
Yet despite the fact that he claims marijuana is de facto legalized and that he secretly did n’t care if it was legalized , under his leadership as drug czar continuing through his successor ’s term , arrests for mere marijuana possession went way up [ pdf ] – and not just for large amounts as he suggests here .
Yet arrests related to marijuana surpassed that of both heroin and cocaine in McCaffrey ’s first year as drug czar – and almost matched that of all non-marijuana - related drug offenses .
According to a study by Ryan S King and Marc Mauer [ pdf ] , “ Marijuana arrests increased by 113 % between 1990 and 2002 , while overall arrests decreased by 3 % ” – and the bulk of these arrests ( over 50 % ) were of small users .
Under Barry McCaffrey , the War on Drugs became the War on Marijuana – yet he claims marijuana was de facto legalized ; Barry McCaffrey himself personally attacked politicians who supported medical marijuana laws , supervised an agency that deliberately went after people following state laws allowing medicinal marijuana , and threatened any doctor who mentioned to a patient that marijuana might help him or her with prosecution – yet any recitation of these facts documented at the time and afterwards , he refers to as “ fantasy ” and “ nonsense . ”
On top of it all , he now claims to have not even opposed the legalization of marijuana as he supervised the War on Marijuana .

Ten Quirky Issues with Cross - Platform Version Control
A big chunk of the software industry today can mostly ignore the issues of multiple platforms , for one of the following reasons :
They only support Windows .
It 's got like 90 % market share , so why not ?
They serve a web application and do n't care what the end user is actually using as long as their browser works .
But version control tools involve more cross-platform concerns than most other kinds of software .
Neither of the reasons above tends to work very well .
If a software team has 450 Windows users and 50 people on Mac or Unix , then a Windows - only solution just wo n't do .
Since a primary task of a version control tool is to manage source code trees on the user 's hard disk , a web application just wo n't do .
So , even as most coders have moved on to a world where they can remain blissfully ignorant of the problems of writing software for multiple operating systems , those of us who create version control tools are still wrestling with those problems .
And in fact , I claim that our challenges are tougher than most .
Version control users ask for the darndest things , especially in the big enterprise companies .
It 's easy to believe that all you need is Windows , Mac , Linux and maybe Solaris .
Then you find out just how prevalent things like AIX and HPUX are .
Terms like " Irix " and " Win95 " and " mainframe " get tossed around until you 're numb and nothing surprises you anymore .
When somebody asks for a port to an arcane platform , you roll your eyes and wonder is if it uses 8 - bit bytes or not .
Worse than that , version control vendors are n't just porting to oddball operating systems .
We actually have to make our software interoperate across all those environments .
And that 's where things start to get quirky .
On a Linux system , create a file called " README " .
In the same directory , create a file called " readme " .
Check them both in .
Now go to a Mac and check them both out .
Since the Mac file system is [ usually ] case insensitive , something bad is going to happen .
Same goes for Windows / NTFS .
On a Mac , checkin a file called " PRN " .
Check it out on a Windows system .
That file name is not allowed under Windows , for backward compatibility with MS - DOS ..
Under Linux , checkin a file with a name that ends in a dot .
Check it out under Windows .
The trailing dot is probably gone .
Now check the file back in and go back to your Unix system .
If your version control system handled this badly , you 've probably got two copies of the file , one with the trailing dot , and one without .
Same goes for a trailing space .
On a Linux system , checkin a file with a path that is 261 characters long .
Check it out under Windows .
This might work .
It probably wo n't .
It kind of depends on whether .NET is involved or not .
There 's a \\ ? \ trick to get around the limitations of the Win32 layer , but the .NET libraries do n't use it .
On a Mac , checkin a file that has a resource fork and some Finder info .
Check it out on a Linux machine .
What happens ?
Did stuff show up as xattrs ?
Should it have ?
On that same Linux machine , make a change and check it back in .
Then check it out on the Mac again .
Is the Finder info still there ?
On a Linux machine , checkin a file with a colon in the name .
Check it out on a Mac .
Not sure what 'll happen , but it probably wo n't be what you want .
On a Windows machine , checkin a file with a name that begins with a dash .
Now check it out under Linux and try manipulating it with command - line utilities .
Apps will think the filename is a command - line option .
What if somebody creates a file named " - rf * " and a Linux user tries to rm it ?
OK , bad example .
The point remains : Filenames which begin with a dash may cause more problems on some platforms than on others .
On a Linux machine , create a source code file and check it in .
Check it out on Windows and open it with notepad .
The line - endings are Unix - standard LF , but Windows apps expect CRLF , so notepad shows the entire file as one line .
Now open the same file under Visual Studio .
The file looks fine now .
Now edit a few lines in the middle of the file , check it back in , and check it out on Linux again .
The lines you edited are messed up .
On a recent Ubuntu Linux system , create a file called " EspaÃ±ol " .
Do the same thing on Mac OS X 10.5 .
These two files have the same name , but even though you are [ probably ] using the utf - 8 encoding of Unicode on both systems , the bytes which represent that name do not match .
On the Linux machine , the file name [ probably ] will be in NFC normalized form ( Espa\u00f1ol ) .
On the Mac , everything gets normalized to NFD ( Espan\u0303ol ) .
When you check these files in and start working with them , bad things will happen unless your version control tool understands what 's going on and deals with it appropriately .
On a Unix machine , checkin a symbolic link .
Check it out on Windows .
What happens ?
Like I said , things get quirky .
Measuring more than half - a- metre , what is described as the world 's longest insect has gone on display at the Natural History Museum , London .
At 56.6 cm , the Phobaeticus chani ( Chan 's megastick ) beats the previous record holder , another stick - insect , by more than one centimetre .
Overweight pregnant women are ' condemning children to lifetime of obesity '
Pregnant women who are overweight could be condemning their children to a lifetime of obesity unless they trim down while trying for a baby , U.S. experts say .
Researchers from medical centres in New York and Quebec found an obese mother 's womb may send a signal to their unborn baby that encourages them to grow into a fat child and adult .
The process is more than just passing along genes that promote obesity but the scientists said they have yet to track down a biological explanation for the signal .
Women who are very overweight when pregnant may have children predisposed to obesity according to new research ( Posed by models )
Robert Waterland of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston studies the effects of obesity in mice .
He speculated the signal between mother and offspring could affect the child 's brain circuitry and predispose them to making more fat - storing cells .
Dr John Kral of the SUNY Downstate Medical Centre in New York led the latest study .
He said his research suggests that obese women can help the next generation by losing weight just before pregnancy .
With researchers at Laval Hospital in Quebec , Dr Kral studied children of severely obese women who were born before or after their mother 's weight - loss surgery .
They found that , in comparison to children born before surgery , those born afterward were far less likely to be severely obese .
In addition , those born afterward showed lower levels of blood fats and indicators of future diabetes .
Dr Kral says families typically do n't change lifestyle or diet after surgery , so that does n't explain the outcome .
Instead , he says , the surgical bypass operation made the women 's bodies less efficient at digesting and absorbing food , and lowered levels of sugar and fat in the blood .
That , in turn , would reduce the number of calories delivered to the foetus to levels like those provided by a normal - weight mother , he said .
Once scientists identify the obesity signal , they may be able to recommend ways to suppress it , perhaps through diet or behavioral strategies .
In the meantime , experts say obese women should avoid pregnancy until they lose weight as obesity in pregnancy raises the risk of complications like diabetes , caesarean deliveries and stillbirth .

From native Exchange support to native Facebook support ( it will sync with your contacts ) , browser improvements , a completely updated Maps application , unified email Inbox — there ’s much , much more — and a brand new UI makeover , version 2.0 starts to make Android a really viable ( and interesting ) platform .
Bounce over the jump for all the screenshots and our walkthrough !
Please note : this is n’t the final build of Android 2.0 and the follow reporting is based on the version we have running .
Things can and will change prior to release .
Microsoft Exchange compatibility looks to be built - in to the OS now , and the new unified Inbox is perfect for keeping up with your personal and corporate email .
You can star ( flag for the corporate world ) emails , mark multiple as read or unread , delete , forward — whatever you want basically .
Emails load effortlessly .
Unfortunately ( or not so unfortunately ) the unified Inbox wo n’t work with your Gmail account as that uses the specific Google - made Gmail email application in Android .
Maps has been updated to include Layers .
We ’d imagine this will grow over time but now you can overlay search queries , Wikipedia entries , Latitude buddies , traffic , transit lines , and even load remote My Maps where you can share and receive directions with others .
Android 2.0 seems to have some multi - touch gestures built - in like two - finger tapping in Maps , that will zoom in , however , there ’s no gesture to zoom out and pinching does n’t work .
© Apple .
The browser has a nice little UI makeover with a redone URL entry bar which includes a Favicon .
In terms of performance , no this version we have does n’t have Flash 10 , Google keeps making strides in the browser space .
It ’s worlds better than anything we ’ve used previously on a stock Android OS , and jumps one notch higher than HTC ’s customized browser .
There is not multi - touch in here as of now , but , you can double tap to zoom in and zoom out which is really all we ’ve been asking for since Android 1.0 .
Oh and did we mention this thing flies ?
We ’re talking ridiculously close to iPhone 3GS web page speeds .
There ’s now a YouTube widget you can place directly on your homescreen and that allows for literally two - click YouTube video uploads .
You hit record , the video recording app launches , you type in a title and description for your newly - recorded video , and it ’s up and away .
While the settings area is roughly the same overall , there ’s a lot of interesting additions in 2.0 .
For starters , there ’s haptic feedback built - in and a brand new Accessibility option .
There ’s also a new option for Text - to - speech and generally with Android 2.0 , you ’re given more control over the settings of your phone and more opportunities to customize it based on your liking .
Something completely bewildering is the fact that if you set a lock code for the phone ( seriously give people a choice to use numbers or letters as the passcode ) , there ’s no lock interval option , so each time your phone turns off ( about every 30 seconds when not in use ) , you ’re forced to enter the password again on arrival .
Lame .
Car Home .
What ?
You do n’t know what that is ?
Ok , it ’s a new application that ’s meant to be used , uh , in your car .
Seriously it ’s actually quite nice .
It ’s a consolidated list of icons that help you perform things ( presumably using voice commands if you ’re driving ) .
Things like doing a voice search across the internet , getting driving directions , viewing a location on a map , selecting a contact , searching through your phone , etc .
It ’s very cool that you can say , “ map of gas stations ” and that will open Google Maps and show you on the map where all the gas stations are closest to you .
Not exactly new technology , but hey , we did n’t say it was .
We said this was all about pushing Android forward , and it is .
The Amazon MP3 application seems to work over 3G instead of just Wi -Fi now , but whether that is something done because of Android 2.0 or just because of the carrier it ’s running on , we ’re not positively sure .
Contacts seem to be much more roomy and there ’s some great functionality built right in .
Instead of hitting the contact and then diving through it to find the contact information you need , just tap the contact ’s photo .
Up will spring a clean and tidy sub -menu with the pertinent information which can be clicked on .
Send someone an email instantly , open up their Facebook profile , or even call them !
Very cool and all great things that we love seeing .
Things like the music application and gallery application do n’t look to have changed too much , if at all .
There also looks to be some more flexibility when defining homescreen shortcuts and things of that nature .
That ’s all we have for you today , guys .
What do you think of Android 2.0 in its not -final version ?
We ’re loving it .
And it could help that it ’s running on a pretty bad ass piece of machinery , but hey , that ’s for another day .
The Pirate Bay is going on a road trip through Europe , one they hope to end today in a former NATO bunker .
After a move from Sweden to the Ukraine , The Pirate Bay has now arrived at CyberBunker , an ISP that can provide them with a facility that can resist a nuclear attack as well as electromagnetic pulse bombs .
After being chased by various anti-piracy groups , The Pirate Bay returned a few hours ago .
“ Nobody puts The Pirate Bay in a corner , ” they say on their frontpage , referencing Patrick Swayze ’s famous line in Dirty Dancing .
Not in a corner , no , but what about a bunker ?
Last Friday we reported that The Pirate Bay was forced to move outside of Sweden , and that the world ’s largest BitTorrent tracker had found a new home in the Ukraine .
Unfortunately this was a short - lived solution , with TPB now moving to Cyberbunker .
CyberBunker is located in a former military nuclear warfare bunker in The Netherlands .
The facility was built by NATO in the 50s to survive a nuclear war , but after the nuclear threats were over it was sold to its current owners .
The bunker is now used as a webhosting data center .
The bunker is equipped with Electromagnetic Pulse ( EMP ) shielding and Nuclear / Biological / Chemical ( NBC ) air filtration to guarantee that the servers they host stay up no matter what happens .
As of this week it is also the new home of The Pirate Bay .
CyberBunker : The Pirate Bay ’s new home
According to Sven Kamphuis , one of the owners of CB3ROB / Cyberbunker , there were some initial troubles with setting up The Pirate Bay in its new location as several carriers refused to pass on the relay information after they received threats from the entertainment industry led by the Dutch anti-piracy outfit BREIN .
Despite these troubles the site is now accessible again in most locations , and Cyberbunker will continue to host the site and does not intend to cave in to the threats of the entertainment industry .
“ I do n’t expect BREIN to do pretty much anything at this point .
The last conversation we had with them was about some mp3 site they wanted to have shut down somewhere in 2001 / 2002 .
It took around 3 hours at 2 am at night and the end result was that both parties agreed not to agree , ” Kamphuis told TorrentFreak .
Whether The Pirate Bay is actually located in one of the server racks at the bunker or another hideout was not confirmed .
Leonard Nimoy talked to the press this afternoon about his return to Fringe tomorrow as dimension - hopping mogul William Bell .
He was pretty tight - lipped about the show , but did tell us what 's wrong with today 's science fiction on TV .
Advertisement
Nimoy revealed little about his upcoming Fringe appearance , except to say that we will learn a great deal about Bell 's relationship with Agent Olivia Dunham and what Bell 's motives are ( or at least what he claims his motives are ) .
He did open up , though , when asked about his thoughts on the current state of science fiction in television and film :
Well , I 'm concerned about the positioning of story in terms of importance .
When I see a lot of explosions , a lot of chases , I 'm not terribly impressed .
I think there are three terribly important elements that must be given position — priority position — in science fiction as well as in any other kind of drama : the first is story , the second is story , and the third is story .
Story , story , story , story , story .
If the story is compelling and interesting , I think all the rest will find its place .
We have great technology in our industry and that technology can be overused at the expense of story , and that 's a problem for me .
But when the story is in place , I think the special effects can find their proper place .
I think Fringe uses the technology brilliantly , but in the service of excellent storytelling .
Advertisement
He did later go on to say that , while special effects can be a slippery slope , he is impressed at how they actually bolster storytelling :
It 's safe to say that what an audience is seeing today on screen in a television episode is far more complex than what we were doing while we were , for example , making the original Star Trek series in the sixties .
We were very , very heavy on pages and pages of dialogue and very little special effects .
But because the technology has advanced so greatly , it 's possible to do some very complex and very exciting and very useful technical stuff on the shows these days .
So we do n't have to rely quite so much on the story being told by the actors speaking .
On the other hand , there 's the danger — as I mentioned earlier — in going to far with the special effects at the expense of story .
But if the story is well done , if the story 's in place strongly , the special effects can be very useful to the actors , far more so than they were years ago when we were making the original Star Trek series .

But when asked which shows he thought balanced storytelling and effects well , he replied ( a bit single - mindedly ) : " Fringe .
Fringe .
Fringe . "
Overview
Once I started kegging my homebrew , I needed a way to keep my kegs and carboys cool .
I found
Dan Schultz 's example on the OregonBrewCrew web site of a chest freezer and thought it was a great starting point ,
so I based mine on his example .
The requirements were :
It must be big enough to hold several kegs , carboys , bottled beer , and yeast cultures .
It must be able to simultaneously serve at one pressure and carbonate at another .
I wanted to add a dedicated tap just for soda for my kids .
I wanted to be able to control temps for lagering .
I did n't want to drill through the freezer or its walls to avoid risk of puncturing a coolant line .
I wanted to put it on a dolly so that I can move it around easier .
Freezer Unit
I started with a chest freezer that I got in the classifieds for $ 25 .
It is a huge 20.5 cu. ft. General Electric Model .
Collar Construction
I built a collar out of 2x4's for a base , and put a facade over it using 1x6 " hemlock .
Just like the
OregonBrewCrew example , the 2x4's sit on the top of the freezer and the hemlock extends down by about 2 inches
over the face and side of the freezer .
I used weather stripping on the underside of the 2x4's to provide a good seal .
The existing seal stripping on the freezer cover is more than able to seal the top .
I finished this up with a couple of
coats of polyurethane cherry stain , and added a screw on bottle opener .
Temperature Controller
I went with a Johnson Controls A419 digital temp controller that I picked up at Controls Depot ( unfortunately , they are no longer in business as of Aug 2005 ) .
I love the fact that I can just set it and forget it .
It was easy to wire up .
I drilled a small hole in the back of the collar to accommodate the temp probe .
I just let it dangle in the air so that it 's
not touching anything inside .
This lets it activate according to the air temps , not the temps of my kegs / carboys ,
providing much more even cooling .
CO2 Tank & Gas Supply Lines
For the gas supply , I started with a 20 lb CO2 tank with a dual regulator .
I keep this regular set at 30psi .
This sits outside of the kegerator , and feeds the panel through a hole I drilled into the far end of the collar .
I used
red 5/8 " id for all my gas lines .
The lines are each 5 feet long from the manifold to the ball lock connector .
This way there are no spots in the freezer that the line can't reach .
Note the temperature probe hanging in the back .
Gas Lines
The gas first goes to another dual inline regulator .
This allows me to independently choose the pressures .
The first regulator is my `high pressure ' regulator .
I use it for the soda or once in a while for quickly pressurizing a keg
( which I tend to avoid .
I 'd rather let it sit for a week at serving pressure , rather than try to guess how much hi pressure
should be applied for how long ) .
The soda side goes to a 3 way manifold .
The serving side goes to the 4 way manifold .
Beer Lines
On the beer line side , I went with 5 feet of 3/16 " ID line .
This allows me to maintain 39 �F temps at 10psi and serve with no
foaming problems .
Faucets
The lines are hooked up to 5 " shanks which feed my VentMatic faucets .
The shanks are 4 " center to center .
These faucets were pricy , but the patented forward - seal design is awesome .
I never have any drips
or leaks , and they never face the sticking problems that plague so many other standard faucets .
Tap Handles
With the exception of the NewCastle tap , I picked up my tap handles from Ebay .
( I did n't pay more than 15 dollars for
any one of them . ) .
The NewCastle tap was a gift from my Aussie next door neighbor who has become my official
taste tester since my first extract kit batch 3 years ago .
Thanks ,
John !
As you can see , I tend to be partial to ales .
Note the Root Beer tap on the right for my kids .
Sources for Parts
I pretty much got all of the parts online .
I have forgotten which parts I got where , but they came from one of these online
stores .
I suggest you shop around for the best deals .
Also , my two local home brew stores were sources for a few odds and ends :
Finally , much of the miscellaneous hardware was purchased at :
Future Projects
I 'll be putting together a drip tray and probably try building the fermentation chamber similar to the
OregonBrewCrew 's example .
I 'm thinking I want to make that removeable in some way .
Thanks
I want to thank Dan Schultz of the OregonBrewCrew for putting his freezer site up on the web .
It was a great source for reference and ideas .
I also want to thank all the guys in the RealBeer.com Discussion Forums for their ideas and inputs
( especially Danno ) .
This is a great community of home brewers and other " beer nuts " .
No question goes unanswered by these
friendly people .
Feel free to give me a holler up there .
My username there is " BrewDog " .

Airships have often served as the symbol of a brighter tomorrow .
Even before the first zeppelin was invented , airships featured prominently in utopian visions of the future .
This 1898 poster advertised a musical comedy on the New York stage :
And these German and French postcards predicted air travel in the year 2000 :
Mixing the Airship and the Airplane : The View from the 1930’s
Futurists of the early 20th Century often combined lighter - than - air and heavier - than - air technology , as in this urban skyscraper airport and solar - powered aerial landing field :
World War II Vision for Hybrid Airship
This hybrid airship concept from 1943 , designed to meet the needs of war , predicted the hybrid airships that would be built in the 21st century .
Goodyear and the Future of Zeppelin Travel
Sometimes futurist airship visions were promoted by companies which were actually involved in the lighter - than - air business .
For example , the Goodyear - Zeppelin company , which built the American airships Akron and Macon , and which had a financial interest in the promotion of the passenger dirigible , frequently offered alluring illustrations of future airship travel .
Goodyear president Paul Litchfield and publicist Hugh Allen included the following pictures in their 1945 book , WHY ?
Why has America no Rigid Airships ?:
These drawings from Hugh Allen ’s The Story of the Airship ( 1931 ) imagined an Art Deco dining salon , promenade , and even a lounge with a fireplace .
Airships and Medicine
Airships could even advance medical technology , such as this airship tuberculosis hospital .
The Airship and the Soviet Future
Under the illusion that communism was the way of the future , Soviet propagandists loved images of modernity and enlisted the airship in their cause .
Unflyable Airship Fantasies
Sometimes illustrators got so carried away depicting lavish interiors that they neglected to leave room for much lifting gas , as in this illustration from The American Magazine .
The article described future airships to be built by the Goodyear - Zeppelin Company , which would be “ fitted up as sumptuously as a Palm Beach winter hotel ” :
This illustration of an atomic dirigible from a Soviet magazine in the 1960 ’s left no room for lifting gas at all :
The Iron Airship
Nancy Pelosi was flanked by top Democratic lawmakers
The Speaker of the US House of Representatives , Nancy Pelosi , has unveiled a healthcare bill that would extend coverage to 36 m more Americans .
The top House Democrat said the legislation would provide affordable healthcare to 96 % of all Americans .
It would also let the government sell insurance in competition with private companies and make insurers offer cover to those with pre-existing conditions .
The bill is the latest step in a long - running battle over healthcare reform .
President Barack Obama has made reform of the healthcare system a central plank of his domestic agenda .
Scaled - back Speaking on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC , Ms Pelosi called the bill a " historic moment for our nation and families " .
She said the legislation would also include a so - called " public option " , referring to a controversial new government - run insurance option .
HEALTHCARE IN THE US 47 million uninsured , 25 million under- insured Healthcare costs represent 16 % of GDP , almost twice OECD average
Q&A : US healthcare reform
However , the public option she unveiled was a scaled - back version , falling short of the one liberal Democrats had demanded and which had thrown the bill into a logjam .
US President Barack Obama welcomed the legislation in a written statement , saying that " a public option that competes with private insurers is the best way to ensure choice and competition that are so badly needed in today 's market " .
The bill will now go before the House of Representatives , where it could be voted on as early as next week .
Once both the House and Senate have approved their own versions , a conference committee , made up of lawmakers from both houses , will convene to reconcile the two .
If both chambers then vote in favour of the reconciled version , it will be sent to Mr Obama for his approval , and become law .

Happy Heteroween In Defense of Sexy Pirates , Sexy Nuns , and Sexy Cadavers
There 's something scary — scary in all the wrong ways — about a " sexy Jane Doe " costume .
The sexy cadaver costume is half of one of those " sexy " Halloween costume sets that drive some people nuts .
You know : Sexy Nurse & Doc , Sexy Nun & Priest , Sexy Lady Pirate & Pirate Captain .
The girls ' costumes bare a lot of flesh , the boys ' costumes do n't , and that is sexist and unfair and — wait , a sexy CADAVER COSTUME ?!?!
Yes .
Someone out there is selling a sexy CSI Halloween costume set , and it's no exception to the clothed - male / nearly - nude - female rule .
The girl gets a black , skintight , miniskirted body bag (! ) complete with a zip - up - and - over - the - head hood , while the boy gets a baggy black lab coat with the word " coroner " printed on it , presumably worn over street clothes .
There 's nothing sexy about " a man whose job is to deal with dead people looking at a sexy dead stranger , " Lilith wrote in an October 2008 post at Feministing .com , " an online community for feminists and their allies . "
No argument from me there , Lilith , and I agree that there 's definitely a " power dynamic being displayed " when a woman dresses up as a sexy cadaver for a man on Halloween and lies down on an autopsy table , per the photograph from the catalogue .
There 's nothing sexy about that .
You know what else is n't sexy ?
The grousing you hear , even in the offices of The Stranger , when ads for " sexy " Halloween costumes start appearing in early September .
People I know to be reliably pro-pleasure lefties — people who are all for recreational sex and legal drugs and strap - on dildos — sound like religious conservatives when Halloween rolls around .
A children 's holiday has been transformed into an opportunity for stupid straight people to dress up in revealing outfits and make sex-crazed spectacles of themselves in public .
And is n't that just sad ?
Nope .
It 's awesome — and long overdue .
I 'm often asked — confronted — about gay pride parades when I speak at colleges and universities .
Usually it 's a conservative student , typically someone who is n't happy about my being invited to campus in the first place .
We gay people like to pretend that we 're all about love and marriage , the conservative student will insist , but look at your pride parades !
Look at those guys in assless chaps and all those bare - chested lesbians dancing !
Just look !
The exchange almost always ends with this :
Conservative student : " Straight people do n't flaunt our sexuality like that .
We do n't have straight ' pride ' parades . "
Me : " You should . "
And it seems clearer with every passing Halloween that straight people do .
Back in the bad old days — pre-Stonewall , pre-pride - parades , pre-presidential - gay - history - month - proclamations — Halloween was the gay holiday .
It was the one night of the year when you could leave the house in leather or feathers without attracting the attentions of the police .
Halloween resonated for pre-Stonewall homosexuals because the closeted life — out to a select few friends , closeted at work and home — was a stressful masquerade that never ended .
We were good at masks , at pretense , at dressing up , because we had to be in order to survive .
Halloween took our skill set — pretending to be what we are not — and allowed us to find joy in it one night a year .
While Halloween is still celebrated by gays and lesbians , it 's no longer the most important date on the gay calendar .
Oh , we keep it , but we do n't keep holy .
It 's just another excuse for a party — and we 're always on the lookout for an excuse — but Halloween has been downgraded , displaced by other and better excuses for parties , by pride parades and Folsoms and the weekend .
There are still parties in gay bars on Halloween , of course , and you 'll see plenty of homos in costume on Capitol Hill this weekend .
But Halloween belongs to heterosexuals now .
And you need it more than we do .
Straight people in Brazil have Carnival , straight Nor-thern Europeans have Fasching , straight people in New Orleans have Mardi Gras — all big public parties where straight people show their tits , shake their asses , and flaunt their sexualities .
Booze companies attempted to make a national holiday out of Mardi Gras , without much success .
But straight people seem to have made a collective unconscious decision to adopt Halloween instead .
You made a good choice , straight people , a better one than the booze companies were trying to make for you .
Whereas the pride parade is now the big public celebration of queer sexuality with all its squalor and glamour , Halloween is now the big public celebration of straight sexuality , of heterosexual desire , every bit — tit ?— as squalid and glamorous .
We do n't resent you for taking Halloween as your own .
We know what it 's like to keep your sexuality under wraps , to keep it concealed , to be on your guard and under control at all times .
While you do n't suffer anywhere near the kind of repression we did ( and in many times and places still do ) , straight people are sexually repressed , too .
You move through life thinking about sex , constantly but keenly aware that social convention requires you to act as if sex were the last thing on your mind .
Exhausting , is n't it ?
It makes you long for moments when you can let it all hang out , when you can violate the social taboos you honor most of the rest of time , when you can be the piece of meat you are and treat other people like the pieces of meat they are .
It 's that kind of pressure — pressure to conform and maintain — that makes you want to pull on a pair of assless chaps and march down the street , the kind of pressure that cries out for some form of organized mass release .
It 's the kind of pressure that a pride parade — straight or gay , Mardi Gras or Halloween — can release .
Right now things are a little unfair — a little — on the gender front .
Straight girls are expected to show flesh on Halloween ; straight boys are n't .
Sadly , I do n't foresee that changing anytime soon .
People who want to fuck men — straight and bi girls , gay and bi guys — show flesh because it works , it will attract positive male attention .
( Well , that depends on how you feel about male attention , I guess . )
Engaging in that sort of display — here are my tits !— is perceived as feminizing , hello , and that makes it a less successful strategy for straight males than it is for straight females .
Showing off their tits is an effective way for girls to attract straight - male attention ; guys who show off their tits risk looking like fags .
Straight guys do n't have the same incentive to bare their flesh on Halloween .
It 's a shame , of course , because there are a lot of straight guys out there who have amazing bodies , and they should be encouraged to show off on Halloween , to celebrate their erotic power and do like the gay boys do : objectify and be objectified at the same time .
That would make the straight pride parades , aka Halloween , feel as egalitarian as the gay pride parades on which they were unconsciously modeled .
" Every year around Halloween , I see some columnist or blogger or other talk about how ' Halloween is just an excuse for girls and women to whore it up all night , ' " writes nicolechat on a post at Feministing .com .
" But every time I read that , I think to myself , so what ?
What 's wrong with having a night where we can say ' This is my body , and I 'm not ashamed of it , or of using it to express my sexuality . ' "
Nothing at all , nicolechat .
Heterosexuals in North America have needed a holiday like this for a long , long time .
And now you 've got one in Halloween .
It 's yours now , straight people .
Be good to it .
And remember : Wrap those bandages loosely , and by midnight your boyfriend 's " mummy " costume will be just as revealing as that off - the - rack " sexy witch " costume you bought at Champion .
Happy Heteroween .
Economic Correction Disease
It ’s a delight to be back in Buenos Aires .
It ’s springtime .
The sun is shining .
The birds are singing in the trees .
What more can you ask for ?
Another national emergency !
Terrorism … the banking crisis … now Swine Flu .
Why it is an emergency , we do n’t know .
Our sister , living in Virginia tells us that several of her grandchildren have come down with the Swine Flu .
It does n’t seem to bother them anymore than any other flu .
But every emergency is an opportunity .
The feds do n’t want to waste it .
Instead , they swing into operation with a rescue plan .
It will end up costing billions … hundreds of billions … or maybe even trillions .
We do n’t know what they ’ve got in mind .
But we know what will come of it .
It will end up extending the power and influence of the government .
So far , the feds are the only real winners from any of these crises .
Federal outlays , as a percentage of GDP have shot up from less than 20 % of GDP in 2000 to more than 26 % in 2009 .
Will it do any good ?
Public health is not central banking .
And it ’s not economic planning .
Force everyone to wear a surgical mask and maybe lives would be spared .
Or , maybe not .
Without the immunity of occasional bouts of flu , who knows ?
Maybe people would be more susceptible to the next disease .
The American Indians were almost wiped out … because they had no immunity to European diseases .
Interesting …
Ai n’t nature amazing ?
Disease works like an economic correction .
It winnows out the weak …and it toughens up survivors .
Allowing people to get sick is a little like allowing them to go broke .
It keeps the whole system from softening up … from becoming more vulnerable .
It protects people from moral and biological hazard .
In other words , it ’s the correction that really provides protection … the disease itself , not the cure .
Or , to put it another way , it ’s the crash that is beneficial , not the rescue .
David Einhorn , one of the few people to make money in the crash of sub - prime debt :
“ The financial reform on the table is analogous to our response to airline terrorism by frisking grandma and taking away everyone ’s shampoo .
It gives the appearance of ‘ doing something ’ and adds to our bureaucracy without really making anything safer . ”
The Wall Street Journal reports that even bankruptcy can be a good thing .
“ Household Debt Can Hasten Recovery … when it goes unpaid , ” says a headline .
The whole idea of a correction is to wash out mistakes .
If people can pay their debts down , the mistakes are corrected .
The system is strengthened .
If they can ’t , the process of correction can happen faster .
Bad debts are written off quickly .
Then , a real recovery can begin .
Either way , the system comes back in better shape .
Too bad the feds are getting in the way !
A decent correction should carry off those who made the biggest mistakes – in the present case , the firms on Wall Street that wagered billions on a bigger and bigger bubble .
But instead of letting them go broke , the feds rewarded them .
Wall Street profits are a ‘ gift ’ from the state , says George Soros .
But wait , what kind of gift is this ?
If you give $ 100 to your neighbor , that ’s a gift .
But what if you tax your neighbor on the left $ 100 in order to give the money to your neighbor on the right ?
That ’s a gift too… but of a special kind .
You ’re ‘ redistributing the wealth , ’ you might say .
And what if you do a quantitative easing ?
You know , you print up a $ 100 bill and give it to your neighbor ?
That ’s a gift too .
Yeah , thanks a lot .
Meanwhile , the recession is said to have come to an end in the US .
GDP growth is positive , say the papers .
But if this is a recovery , let ’s hope it comes to an end soon .
Existing house prices continued to fall in September .
Unemployment continued to worsen .
“ Signs of recovery do n’t extend to jobs , ” says the WSJ .
there must be grams upon grams of weed in my carpet .
someone needs to invent a weed magnet .
i must smoke my carpet weed .

California NORML Release – Oct 12 , 2009
Paypal , the well - known internet payment company has told California NORML that it will no longer accept payments to our “ type of business ” because we accept listing payments from cannabis - recommending physicians .
After years of offering free listings to physicians and collectives at our website http://www.canorml.org, CaNORML began charging a yearly listing fee to cover our costs last year .
PayPal froze CaNORML ’s account in June , saying that by accepting listing fees fromcollectives , we were violating their Acceptable Use policy , which says , “ you may not use PayPal in the purchase or sale of narcotics . ”
Although narcotics were not being sold over the CaNORML site , we reluctantly agreed to stop accepting listings fees from collectives that dispense medical marijuana , recognizing that even though they are legal under state law , they are illegal under federal law .
However , we continued to accept payments online from doctors , attorneys , and members .
Now PayPal has stopped accepting payments from the CaNORML site because we continued to accept listing payments from physicians .
Under a ruling upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court ( Conant v. Walters , 2003 ) , physicians have the first amendment right to discuss and recommend medical marijuana for their patients , although they may not distribute it or help patients in finding it .
PayPal was informed of this and wrote back , “ We are not arguing the legality of this issue ; we are simply stating that we have made the business decision to not be involved with this type of business . ”
Because of its discriminatory policy and disregard of physicians ’ first amendment rights , CaNORML submits that PayPal is not the “ type of business ” to be used by those who advocate for human rights .
We will file a complaint with the federal banking committee over their practices .
Located in San Jose , California , PayPal was founded in 1998 and was acquired by eBay ( California gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman ’s former company ) in 2002 .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The House of Representatives on Tuesday formally admonished Republican Rep. Joe Wilson for shouting " you lie " during President Obama 's speech to a joint session of Congress last week .
Rep. Joe Wilson , R - South Carolina , shouts " You lie ! " during President Obama 's speech Wednesday night .
The House passed a resolution of disapproval on a 240 - 179 vote that was mostly along party lines , reflecting the Democratic majority in the chamber .
Twelve Democrats voted " no , " while seven Republicans voted for the measure .
Five representatives , all Democrats , voted " present . "
According to the Office of the House Historian , it was the first time in its 220 - year history that the House has disciplined a member for speaking out during a presidential speech in the chamber to a joint session of Congress .
During debate on the resolution , Wilson called the measure a waste of time and failed to apologize to the chamber , as demanded by House Democrats .
" When we are done here today , we will not have taken any further steps toward helping " the nation deal with urgent challenges , said Wilson , of South Carolina .
" It is time that we move forward and get back to work for the American people . "
Watch House members debate the resolution »
He and other Republicans noted that Wilson apologized to Obama immediately after the speech , and that the president accepted it .
Asked after the vote if he apologized privately to House leaders such as Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Wilson told journalists it was n't necessary .
" In my view , by apologizing to the president , the most important person in the history of the world , that applied to everyone , " Wilson said .
However , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - Maryland , said Wilson 's refusal to apologize to the House for his disrespectful behavior to the chamber required admonishment .
The issue , he said , " is whether we are able to proceed with a degree of civility and decorum " that Congress requires .
The House resolution was the mildest form of discipline the chamber can exercise for misconduct on the House floor .
" Whereas the conduct of the Representative from South Carolina was a breach of decorum and degraded the proceedings of the joint session , to the discredit of the House : Now , therefore , be it resolved that the House of Representatives disapproves of the behavior of the Representative from South Carolina , Mr. Wilson , during the joint session of Congress held on Sept. 9 , 2009 , " said a text of the resolution posted earlier on Hoyer 's legislative Web site .
Before debate on the measure began , one Democrat said the disrespect shown Obama by Wilson never would have happened to a white president .
" It only happened when this country elected a president of color , " said Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia .
Another noted the heckling of the president in the House was unprecedented , and the chamber needed to enforce discipline in order to maintain civility .
Watch Johnson comment on why he supports the resolution »
" No president has been subjected to that type of treatment on the floor of the House of Representatives , and if we go down that road , then it 's the law of the jungle , and I think that 's just wrong , " said Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia .
However , House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio called the resolution " piling on . "
In the debate , Boehner and other Republicans acknowledged the mistake by Wilson while citing his military career and how his four children also served in the military .
They noted that he already had apologized to Obama and accused Democrats of a partisan stunt intended to deflect attention from what they called increasingly unpopular health care legislation .
Watch Boehner talk about health care , support Wilson 's apology »
" The American people want less politics and more jobs , " said Rep. Mike Pence , R - Indiana .
In closing the debate , Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina , the House Majority whip , noted that all Americans , especially schoolchildren , learn about civics and government by observing the House .
Clyburn , a former schoolteacher , said failing to enforce House rules against Wilson 's outburst would send the wrong message .
The House Democratic leadership agreed to move forward with the vote after meeting to discuss the issue Monday evening , according to two Democratic leadership aides .
Kristie Greco , a spokeswoman for Clyburn , said the discussion at Monday 's meeting was about " how this speaks to the breach of decorum alone , and not addressing the issue sets a precedent for bad behavior . "
" We 're not the British Parliament for a reason , " Greco added .

Wilson on Sunday described his loud retort to Obama 's statement that illegal immigrants would not be covered under the Democrats ' health care bill as " a town hall moment . "
But he made it clear he would not apologize on the House floor .
" I called immediately , I did apologize , but I believe one apology is sufficient , " he said .
Last week , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the episode " unfortunate " and told reporters at her weekly news conference , " It 's time for us to talk about health care and not Mr. Wilson . "
But when Pelosi met with Democratic leaders later that day , her colleagues argued that unless Wilson apologized on his own , they would want a formal vote on a resolution of disapproval , according to several Democratic sources .
On Tuesday , Pelosi refused to comment on the resolution to reporters outside the weekly Democratic caucus meeting , saying that journalists should be focusing on the health care reform issue .
Other Democrats offered their thoughts .
Johnson said Wilson 's comment amounted to a " wink " of approval to right - wing extremists who have brought highly charged language and imagery -- such as posters depicting Obama with a Hitler mustache or as an African witch doctor -- to the health care debate .
" He [ Wilson ] did not help the cause of diversity and tolerance with his remarks , " Johnson said .
" If I were a betting man , I would say that it instigated more racist sentiment feeling that it 's OK -- you do n't have to bury it now . "
Johnson added that failing to rebuke Wilson would bring increased racism in the public discussion on health care , saying : " You can bring it out and talk about it fully , and so I guess we will probably have folks putting on white hoods and white uniforms again riding through the countryside intimidating people . "
" That 's the logical conclusion if this kind of attitude is not rebuked , and Congressman Wilson represents it , " Johnson said .
" He is the face of it , and that 's why I support the resolution . "
To Rep. Jason Altmire of Pennsylvania , a member of the moderate Blue Dog Democratic coalition , the issue was simple : " He has not apologized to the House for the embarrassment he brought " to the chamber , Altmire said .
Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee of California , a leading member of the Congressional Black Caucus , said Wilson 's violation of House rules was " egregious enough that it warrants an apology on the floor . "
Without that , the resolution of disapproval is called for , she said .
On the Republican side , Rep. Steve King of Iowa began circulating a letter among House Republicans last weekend urging Wilson not to apologize on the House floor .
The letter stated , " We urge that you hold your ground against those who seek partisan advantage and reject all demands for additional redress .
When the president of the United States accepts an apology , no observer has an additional claim . "

Some say the case is another twist in a campaign to rehabilitate Stalin Joseph Stalin 's grandson has launched a court action claiming a liberal Russian newspaper has defamed the former Soviet dictator .
Yevgeny Dzhugashvili says an article claiming Stalin personally ordered the deaths of Soviet citizens is a lie .
A Moscow court has agreed to hear the case against the opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta .
The paper published a piece referring to declassified death warrants which it says bore Stalin 's personal signature .
Mr Dzhugashvili - who was not at the court as the case was brought on Thursday - says that is a lie , and that Stalin never directly ordered the deaths of anyone .
It is the latest bizarre twist in what many see as a Kremlin - backed campaign to rehabilitate Stalin 's reputation , says the BBC's Rupert Wingfield - Hayes in Moscow .
Respected and feared A small crowd of Stalin supporters gathered outside Moscow 's Basmmani courthouse , where lawyers for Mr Dzhugashvili presented the case .
AT THE SCENE Rupert Wingfield - Hayes , BBC News , Moscow Outside the courthouse today a group of kindly old ladies told me they honestly believe Stalin was a great man , that under his rule Russia had been peaceful , safe and , most importantly , strong .
The nostalgia for the age when Russia was a superpower is perhaps understandable , but Russia has still not taken an honest look at the horrors of the Soviet era .
In the 1990s some attempt was made to unveil the past .
The Soviet archives where opened .
People could finally learn of the gulags and the great political purges .
But in the last few years the Russian government has once again begun to draw a veil across the past .
" Under Stalin our country was respected , " said one elderly supporter .
" Now we are beggars .
In those days we were respected and feared by others . "
Yury Mukhin , a lawyer representing Yevgeny Dzhugashvili , disagreed , saying : " Stalin for many people is the symbol of an honest and fair leader . "
A victory in the libel case would vindicate that version of history , he said .
Such views are far from unusual in Russia , which is why this case is so important , says our correspondent .
Genry Reznik , for the defence , said : " If the court finds for plaintiff , it will be a massive bomb .
We should put an end to these discussions about the murderous dictator - he should be condemned .
" We should have our own Nuremberg , and not only for Stalin - for his whole regime . "
The Kremlin has professed no opinion about the case .
But in other ways Russia 's leadership has been quietly moving to rehabilitate the great dictator , adds our correspondent .
Last month a brass plaque praising Stalin suddenly reappeared in a Moscow metro station .

And last year a history textbook for Russian schoolchildren was published which referred to Stalin as an " effective manager " who led Russia to victory in World War II - not , as has been widely claimed , a brutal dictator responsible for sending millions to their deaths .
Last year in an online competition to find the greatest Russian ever , Stalin came third - even though he was not actually Russian , but Georgian .
Stalin was born Joseph Dzhugashvili in the Georgian town of Gori in 1878 or 1879 .
He adopted his nickname - which in Russian means " steel " - after joining the Bolsheviks .

STOCKHOLM — German author Herta Mueller won the 2009 Nobel Literature Prize on Thursday for her work inspired by her life under Nicolae Ceausescu ’s dictatorship in Romania .
The Nobel jury hailed Mueller , 56 , as a writer who “ with the concentration of poetry and the frankness of prose , depicts the landscape of the dispossessed . ”
Mueller was born in a German - speaking region of Romania and fled the country two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 .
She has long been rumoured to be a candidate for the award which comes just ahead of the 20th anniversary of the collapse of communism .
Herta Mueller : profile .
ADVERTISEMENT
The permanent secretary of the Academy , Peter Englund , described Mueller as “ a great artist of words , ” as he motivated the institution ’s choice to Swedish Radio .
“ One can say that her work is a combination of on the one side a fantastic language — she ’s very distinctive , you need only read half a page to realise this is Herta Mueller — and it ’s composition , it ’s short sentences , full of imagery , and it ’s also her extreme precision and how she uses the language . ”
The grim daily life under Ceausescu ’s oppressive regime and the harsh treatment of Romanian Germans has featured strongly in her works .
Corruption , intolerance and repression are also major themes in her writing .
Englund said Mueller “ has a story to tell .
And it ’s not just about daily life in a dictatorship , it ’s also about being an outsider . ”
“ Being outside the language of the majority , being outside the history that has befallen you , even being outside your own family .
And then to change countries and realise that it does n’t change all of this , ” he added .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s a very , very strong story . ”
Mueller was born on August 17 , 1953 in western Romania in 1953 to parents of the German - speaking minority .
Her father was in the Nazi SS during World War II and the Romanian communists deported her mother to a labour camp in Soviet Ukraine after the war .
Mueller was sacked from her first job as a translator in the 1970s after refusing to work for Ceausescu ’s hated Securitate secret police .
ADVERTISEMENT
She then devoted her life to literature .
Her first collection of short stories , “ Niederungen ” , in 1982 — published as “ Nadirs ” in English — was censored by the Romanian regime and only published in full two years later in Germany after being smuggled out .
Mueller depicted the exile of German Romanians in the Soviet Union in her latest novel “ Atemschaukel ” from 2009 .
ADVERTISEMENT
She fled Romania for Germany in 1987 , after being prohibited from publishing in her country , and it was then that she was fully discovered in the literary world .
Her major novels include “ The Passport ” , published in 1986 in Germany and translated in 1989 , as well as “ The Appointment ” , translated in 2001 , which describes the anxiety of a woman summoned by the Securitate .
Ioan Mascovescu , mayor of the Romanian village of Nitchidorf where Mueller came from , said that the house where she was born is now state property but she still owned land she had inherited there , though she never visited .
ADVERTISEMENT
In a 2007 article for German daily Frankfurter Rundschau , Mueller described Ceausescu , who was shot dead at the end of an uprising , as “ a parvenu with water taps and gold cutlery with a real weakness for palaces . ”
She said Romania had developed “ collective amnesia ” over its repressive past .
“ They ’re pretending that it disappeared into thin air , the whole country is afflicted by collective amnesia .
Even though it was home to the most abstruse dictatorship in eastern Europe and after Stalin , the most evil dictator , with a personality cult to rival North Korea ’s , ” she wrote .
Mueller follows French author Jean - Marie Gustave Le Clezio in winning the Nobel diploma , medal and 10 million kronor ( 1.42 million dollars , 980,000 euros ) .
In 2007 it went to Doris Lessing of Britain .

Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla. ) has been served with a lawsuit alleging he failed to pay a $ 20,000 ' win bonus ' to a Minnesota advertising firm that worked for his campaign last year , POLITICO has learned .
Ad firm suing Grayson
Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla. ) has been served with a lawsuit alleging he failed to pay a $ 20,000 “ win bonus ” to a Minnesota advertising firm that worked for his campaign last year , POLITICO has learned .
The lawsuit stems from a disagreement between the Grayson campaign and North Woods Advertising , a firm that has worked for politicians including former Minnesota Governors Jesse Ventura and Paul Wellstone .
Advertisement
Both sides agree that when Grayson hired North Woods to help promote his campaign last year , he promised them a $ 20,000 payment – commonly referred to as a win bonus – if he emerged victorious in Florida ’s eighth congressional district .
Grayson won the campaign and was elected to his first term in Congress – but never paid North Woods the $ 20,000 win bonus , both sides acknowledge .
More than a year later , North Woods has filed suit against Grayson to collect the bonus , and another $ 50,000 for breach of contract , since Grayson ’s campaign hired another advertising firm late in the campaign , allegedly violating an exclusivity clause in the North Woods contract .
Grayson chief of staff Julie Tagen said that the bonus was n’t paid because North Woods owes the campaign a refund for advertisements that were purchased but never ran on television .
North Woods “ massively overcharged us for everything – the most blatant thing was they never gave us a refund for ad - buys that did n’t run , ” Tagen told POLITICO .
“ They would n’t send us a refund check – which is unheard of – and that ’s what this all stems from .
We ’ve told them repeatedly :
When they send us our refund , we ’ll give them their win bonus . ”
But Vaughn Juares , business manager and creative director of North Woods , said that all of Grayson ’s advertisements ran – meaning no refund was given to them from the TV station – and that they had already sent Grayson evidence proving just that .
“ There are absolutely no media refunds whatsoever that are due , ” Juares said .
“ We faxed them 100 pages of affidavits from the station showing no refunds were due .
The TV station gave us an affidavit that showed that , and they ’ve had it for almost a year , so their claim is totally invalid . ”
Scott Randolph , Grayson ’s campaign manager , disputed Juares ’s assertion that documents were sent , saying the campaign repeatedly asked North Woods for them last year .
“ To my knowledge they never responded , ” Randolph said .
“ I have never seen the audits . ”
Tagen said North Woods is capitalizing on Grayson ’s newfound fame , which stems from controversial remarks he recently made about health care reform , among other things .
“ I think it ’s pretty low of them to try and do something like this , ” Tagen said .
“ I ca n’t speak for why they would try this , but I think the timing speaks for itself . ”
Juares , though , said Grayson ’s celebrity status has nothing to do with the lawsuit , and that North Woods has been trying to get Grayson to pay the win bonus for more than a year .
“ We sent him a letter long before anyone knew who he was asking him very kindly to follow his obligations – and this was way before he said anything about health care , ” Juares said .
North Woods has never filed suit against a client , Juares said , adding that Grayson ’s actions left them no choice .
“ He simply did not keep his agreement .
We have a contract that Mr. Grayson knowingly and willingly broke . ”
He added that “ We made no effort to contact the press ” about the lawsuit .
Randolph acknowledged that the campaign hired another firm but says both sides violated the contract .
“ Alan thinks they did n’t satisfy their part of the contract by not providing the refunds , so their side of the contract has n’t been fulfilled , either . ”
Randolph cited North Woods ’ lack of professionalism as the reason the campaign hired another firm for some advertising .
“ If professionalism is the question , this is a firm that quite frankly should be paying me the $ 20,000 bonus for their lack of professionalism that I had to constantly correct on the campaign . ”
But Juares said that North Woods played a key role in Grayson ’s campaign victory and should be compensated accordingly .
“ The only reason many people know Alan Grayson ’s name was because of ads we did that worked , ” Juares said .
“ We are a piece of making him who he is , and as such , we should be paid for our efforts . ”
Randolph dismissed the conflict as “ nothing more than a vendor dispute ” that should be resolved as such .
“ This is a dispute between two people over whether both sides of the contract have been fulfilled – that ’s it , ” he said .
“ Let ’s hope it does n’t turn into a personal battle . ”
It might be too late for that .
“ Grayson is literally one of America ’s super - lawyers ... he does n’t believe that people will sue him , so he sort of does what he wants , ” Juares said .
“ We do n’t care who he is or how much of a superstar he is – he owes us the money . ”
Grayson has 20 days to respond to the lawsuit , which was served Wednesday evening and is based out of a Minnesota court .
Correction : A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that North Woods had worked for the campaigns of Sens. Jim Webb ( D - Va , ) , Claire McCaskill ( D - Mo. ) and Bob Casey ( D - Pa . ) .
The group in fact produced an ad for the VoteVets independent expenditure group used by those campaigns , but did not work for them .
Karl Rove and Sean Hannity are connecting an Obama advisor to a controversial organization in an attempt to force his resignation .
On Hannity ’s Fox News show Tuesday , former Bush adviser Rove claimed that Kevin Jennings has engaged in “ high - profile , in - your - face advocacy of things like NAMBLA and gay rights and queering elementary school curricula . ”
NAMBLA is the North American Man Boy Love Association that works to remove age of consent restrictions .
ADVERTISEMENT
At issue are remarks Jennings made praising gay rights activist Harry Hay at the GLSEN Mid-Atlantic Conference on Oct. 25 , 1997 .
“ One of the people that ’s always inspired me is Harry Hay , ” said Jennings .
It ’s no secret that Harry Hay has been connected to NAMBLA .
Since Glenn Beck has been credited with the resignation of Van Jones and crusading against ACORN , Hannity has felt the need to replicate Beck ’s success .
The first segment of Hannity ’s Tuesday and Wednesday shows were devoted to Jennings .
In his most sensational voice , Hannity opened Wednesday ’s show : “ Tonight — shocking new allegations about President Obama ’s safe schools czar .
Does Kevin Jennings support the group NAMBLA ? ”
Hannity and Rove never offered any evidence directly connecting Jennings to the controversial organization .
Media Matters reports that Jennings ’ praise of Harry Hay had nothing to do with NAMBLA .
Jennings reportedly said he was inspired by Harry Hay , “ who started the first ongoing gay rights groups in America … the Mattachine Society . ”
Peter LaBarbera , president of a group that seeks to “ expos[e ] and counter the homosexual activist agenda , ” published a transcript of Jennings ’ 1997 remarks at the Gay , Lesbian and Straight Education Network ’s mid-Atlantic conference that LaBarbera said was reprinted from The Lambda Report .
In that speech , Jennings reportedly said , “ One of the people that ’s always inspired me is Harry Hay , who started the first ongoing gay rights groups in America .
In 1948 , he tried to get people to join the Mattachine Society . ” Jennings ’ remarks include no mentions of NAMBLA .
ADVERTISEMENT
The blog Zomblog chronicles Hays ’ connection to the group and calls on Jennings to release a statement condemning the activist .
Kevin Jennings , we know you do not support this kind of statement , and you are not “ inspired ” by the kind of activism Harry Hay exhibits here .
For the good of the gay community , PLEASE condemn this publicly and emphatically .

The FT - 86 ( Future Toyota 86 ) , what can we say ?
If Toyota builds a car that is 90 % of what we see here 7 Tune will be one of the first in line !
Follow the jump for 40 + new photos and some more specs .
Toyota have released some more up close and personal pics of their pride and joy and the detail and quality of the concept is stunning .
The design team put the Toyota autoclave to use highlighting features with wet carbon .
Eagle - eyed fans would have noticed Fuji Speedway ( owned by Toyota ) showing in the dash cluster .
The gorgeous 19 ″ alloys are wrapped in Bridgestone Potenza 225/40 R19 …
We have our doubts whether the production version of the FT - 86 , a rumored $ 25 k car , will roll on 19 ″ wheels which is a slight concern because anything smaller simply wont fill those guards .
The hood is an absolute work of art .
A secret message on the pedals ?
Almost retro design for the door skins , reminds us a bit of a Nintendo NES .
After looking at these pics for the best part of an hour , I really do feel like I am looking at an AE86 .
They have taken the lines , soul , and concept behind the AE86 , thrown it in a blender with a 2011 calendar and this is the result .
Toyota have provided us with a little more info :
FT - 86 Concept ( world premiere )
The FT - 86 ( “ 86 ” pronounced “ hachi roku ” ) , a compact rear - wheel - drive sports car , provides driving joy and excitement .
Compact design gives driver greater control , while body ’s lightness and low center of gravity allow racecar - like handling
Both power and environmental performance provided by 2 - liter boxer engine and light body
Flash Red body color contains hint of blue ; interior expresses modern feel with minimal coverage of the highly refined structural components evoking enthusiasm for cruising
Vehicle Length Width Height Wheelbase Seating FT - 86 Concept 4,160 mm 1,760 mm 1,260 mm 2,570 mm 4
While not exact , they do come close to the Legacy specs we reported on not long ago .
About the brakes :
ADVICS is a brake system development and marketing company founded jointly in 2001 by AISIN SEIKI Co. , Ltd. , DENSO Corporation , Sumitomo Electric Industries , Ltd. and Toyota Motor Corporation so it comes as no surprise that ADVICS would be called upon to design and manufacture the braking system for the FT - 86 Concept .
Whether or not the brake system in whole or part is carried over to the production model remains to be seen so let ’s hope that the cost cutting bug does n’t extend to downgrading the 4 - pot calipers to something more suitable for a FWD econobox .
It ’s a great time for the sports car enthusiast , we ’re seeing the concept and birth of some legendary cars that are so long overdue !
Check out the gallery below for hi-res photos .
Thanks for the tip Leo !

Bon Jovi have sold more than 120 m albums worldwide Rocker Jon Bon Jovi says he understands why Nirvana 's former members protested over the use of Kurt Cobain 's image in video game Guitar Hero 5 .
Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl said last week they were " very disappointed " that Cobain 's avatar could be used to play songs by other acts in the game .
" I do n't know that I would have wanted it either , " Jon Bon Jovi told the BBC .
" To hear someone else 's voice coming out of a cartoon version of me ?
I do n't know .
It sounds a little forced . "
Guitar Hero 5 entered the UK games charts at number one last weekend , beating its heavily - promoted rival , The Beatles : Rock Band .
The late Nirvana frontman features as an unlockable character , allowing players to see his image performing a multitude of other tracks , including Bon Jovi 's You Give Love A Bad Name .
' Breach of contract '
In a joint statement last week , Grohl and Novoselic said they " did n't know " Cobain 's image would be used in this way .
" We are dismayed and very disappointed in the way a facsimile of Kurt is used in the Guitar Hero game " .
The pair also urged game makers Activision to " do the right thing in ' re - locking ' Kurt 's character " .
Guitar
Hero allows players to recreate rock riffs on replica instruments Activision said permission to use Cobain 's image had been granted by the singer 's estate .
The company said Cobain 's widow , Courtney Love , had provided a written agreement which allowed the singer 's likeness as a fully playable character in the fifth game of the series .
Writing on Twitter , Love claimed she had " never signed " a contract on the game , and threatened legal action against Activision .
" For the record , this ... is breach of contract on a bully 's part and there will be a proper addressing of this and retraction , " she wrote .
Jon Bon Jovi , who is promoting his band 's 11th studio album , The Circle , said he had declined the offer to appear as a playable character in Guitar Hero .
" I had the paperwork , they wanted me to be on that game and I just passed , " he said .
" But no - one even broached the subject with me that I would be singing other people 's stuff .
I do n't know how I would have reacted to that .
I do n't know that I would have wanted it either . "

Climate experts agree that the seriousness of manmade global warming depends greatly upon how clouds in the climate system respond to the small warming tendency from the extra carbon dioxide mankind produces .
To figure that out , climate researchers usually examine natural , year - to - year fluctuations in clouds and temperature to estimate how clouds will respond to humanity¹s production of greenhouse gases .
When researchers observe natural changes in clouds and temperature , they have traditionally assumed that the temperature change caused the clouds to change , and not the other way around .
To the extent that the cloud changes actually cause temperature change , this can ultimately lead to overestimates of how sensitive Earth 's climate is to our greenhouse gas emissions .
This seemingly simple mix - up between cause and effect is the basis of a new paper that will appear in the " Journal of Climate . "
The paper¹s lead author , Dr. Roy W. Spencer , a principal research scientist at The University of Alabama in Huntsville , believes the work is the first step in demonstrating why climate models produce too much global warming .
Spencer and his co-author , principal research scientist William ( Danny ) Braswell , used a simple climate model to demonstrate that something as seemingly innocuous as daily random variations in cloud cover can cause year - to - year variation in ocean temperature that looks like -- but is n't -- " positive cloud feedback , " a warmth - magnifying process that exists in all major climate models .
" Our paper is an important step toward validating a gut instinct that many meteorologists like myself have had over the years , " said Spencer , " that the climate system is dominated by stabilizing processes , rather than destabilizing processes -- that is , negative feedback rather than positive feedback . "
The paper does n't disprove the theory that global warming is manmade .
advertisement
Instead , it offers an alternative explanation for what we see in the climate system which has the potential for greatly reducing estimates of mankind 's impact on Earth 's climate .
" Since the cloud changes could conceivably be caused by known long - term modes of climate variability -- such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation , or El Nino and La Nina -- some , or even most , of the global warming seen in the last century could simply be due to natural fluctuations in the climate system , " Spencer said .
While the paper 's two peer reviewers , both climate model experts , agreed that the issue is a legitimate one , Spencer knows the new paper will be controversial , with some claiming that the impact of the mix - up between cause and effect will be small .
" But we really wo n't know until much more work is done , " Spencer said .
" Unfortunately , so far we have been unable to figure out a way to separate cause and effect when observing natural climate variability .
That 's why most climate experts do n't like to think in terms of causality , and instead just examine how clouds and temperature vary together .
" Our work has convinced me that cause and effect really do matter .
If we get the causation wrong , it can greatly impact our interpretation of what nature has been trying to tell us .
Unfortunately , in the process it also makes the whole global warming problem much more difficult to figure out . "
I 've been a little down lately , because it seems too many people are in a state of learned helplessness and do n't want to participate in our democracy if it involves stepping away from the computer .
But then I saw this letter from Michael Moore and I felt a lot better .
Because it 's still our country , and we can still make a difference :
Friends ,
It 's the # 1 question I 'm constantly asked after people see my movie : " OK -- so NOW what can I DO ? ! "
You want something to do ?
Well , you 've come to the right place !
' Cause I got 15 things you and I can do right now to fight back and try to fix this very broken system .
Here they are :
FIVE THINGS WE DEMAND THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS DO IMMEDIATELY :
1. Declare a moratorium on all home evictions .
Not one more family should be thrown out of their home .
The banks must adjust their monthly mortgage payments to be in line with what people 's homes are now truly worth -- and what they can afford .
Also , it must be stated by law :
If you lose your job , you can not be tossed out of your home .
2. Congress must join the civilized world and expand Medicare For All Americans .
A single , nonprofit source must run a universal health care system that covers everyone .
Medical bills are now the # 1 cause of bankruptcies and evictions in this country .
Medicare For
All will end this misery .
The bill to make this happen is called H.R. 3200 .
You must call AND write your members of Congress and demand its passage , no compromises allowed .
3 . Demand publicly - funded elections and a prohibition on elected officials leaving office and becoming lobbyists .
Yes , those very members of Congress who solicit and receive millions of dollars from wealthy interests must vote to remove ALL money from our electoral and legislative process .
Tell your members of Congress they must support campaign finance bill H.R.1826 .
4 . Each of the 50 states must create a state - owned public bank like they have in North Dakota .
Then congress MUST reinstate all the strict pre-Reagan regulations on all commercial banks , investment firms , insurance companies -- and all the other industries that have been savaged by deregulation : Airlines , the food industry , pharmaceutical companies -- you name it .
If a company 's primary motive to exist is to make a profit , then it needs a set of stringent rules to live by -- and the first rule is " Do no harm . "
The second rule :
The question must always be asked -- " Is this for the common good ? " ( Click here for some info about the state - owned Bank of North Dakota . )
5 . Save this fragile planet and declare that all the energy resources above and beneath the ground are owned collectively by all of us .
Just like they do it in Sarah Palin 's socialist Alaska .
We only have a few decades of oil left .
The public must be the owners and landlords of the natural resources and energy that exists within our borders or we will descend further into corporate anarchy .
And when it comes to burning fossil fuels to transport ourselves , we must cease using the internal combustion engine and instruct our auto / transportation companies to rehire our skilled workforce and build mass transit ( clean buses , light rail , subways , bullet trains , etc. ) and new cars that do n't contribute to climate change .
( For more on this , here 's a proposal I wrote in December . )
Demand that General Motors ' de facto chairman , Barack Obama , issue a JFK man - on - the - moon - style challenge to turn our country into a nation of trains and buses and subways .
For Pete 's sake , people , we were the ones who invented ( or perfected ) these damn things in the first place !!
FIVE THINGS WE CAN DO TO MAKE CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT LISTEN TO US :
1 . Each of us must get into the daily habit of taking 5 minutes to make four brief calls : One to the President ( 202-456-1414 ) , one to your Congressperson ( 202-224-3121 ) and one to each of your two Senators ( 202-224-3121 ) .
To find out who represents you , click here .
Take just one minute on each of these calls to let them know how you expect them to vote on a particular issue .
Let them know you will have no hesitation voting for a primary opponent -- or even a candidate from another party -- if they do n't do our bidding .
Trust me , they will listen .
If you have another five minutes , click here to send them each an email .
And if you really want to drop an anvil on them , send them a snail mail letter !
2 . Take over your local Democratic Party .
Remember how much fun you had with all those friends and neighbors working together to get Barack Obama elected ?
YOU DID THE IMPOSSIBLE .
It 's time to re-up !
Get everyone back together and go to the monthly meeting of your town or county Democratic Party -- and become the majority that runs it !
There will not be many in attendance and they will either be happy or in shock that you and the Obama Revolution have entered the room looking like you mean business .
President Obama 's agenda will never happen without mass grass roots action -- and he wo n't feel encouraged to do the right thing if no one has his back , whether it's to stand with him , or push him in the right direction .
When you all become the local Democratic Party , send me a photo of the group - photos@michaelmoore.com - and I 'll post it on my website .
3 . Recruit someone to run for office who can win in your local elections next year -- or , better yet , consider running for office yourself !
You do n't have to settle for the incumbent who always expects to win .
You can be our next representative !
Do n't believe it can happen ?
Check out these examples of regular citizens who got elected : State Senator Deb Simpson , California State Assemblyman Isadore Hall , Tempe , Arizona City Councilman Corey Woods , Wisconsin State Assemblyman Chris Danou , and Washington State Representative Larry Seaquist .
The list goes on and on -- and you should be on it !
4 . Show up .
Picket the local branch of a big bank that took the bailout money .
Hold vigils and marches .
Consider civil disobedience .
Those town hall meetings are open to you , too ( and there 's more of us than there are of them ! ) .
Make some noise , have some fun , get on the local news .
Place " Capitalism Did This " signs on empty foreclosed homes , closed down businesses , crumbling schools and infrastructure .
( You can download them from my website . )
5 . Start your own media .
You .
Just you ( or you and a couple friends ) .
The mainstream media is owned by corporate America and , with few exceptions , it will never tell the whole truth -- so you have to do it !
Start a blog !
Start a website of real local news ( here 's an example : The Michigan Messenger ) .
Tweet your friends and use Facebook to let them know what they need to do politically .
The daily papers are dying .
If you do n't fill that void , who will ?
FIVE THINGS WE SHOULD DO TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND OUR LOVED ONES UNTIL WE GET THROUGH THIS MESS :
1 . Take your money out of your bank if it took bailout money and place it in a locally - owned bank or , preferably , a credit union .
2 . Get rid of all your credit cards but one -- the kind where you have to pay up at the end of the month or you lose your card .
3 . Do not invest in the stock market .
If you have any extra cash , put it away in a savings account or , if you can , pay down on your mortgage so you can own your home as soon as possible .
You can also buy very safe government savings bonds or T - bills .
Or just buy your mother some flowers .
4. Unionize your workplace so that you and your coworkers have a say in how your business is run .
Here 's how to do it ( more info here ) .
Nothing is more American than democracy , and democracy should n't be checked at the door when you enter your workplace .
Another way to Americanize your workplace is to turn your business into a worker - owned cooperative .
You are not a wage slave .
You are a free person , and you giving up eight hours of your life every day to someone else is to be properly compensated and respected .
5 . Take care of yourself and your family .
Sorry to go all Oprah on you , but she 's right :
Find a place of peace in your life and make the choice to be around people who are not full of negativity and cynicism .
Look for those who nurture and love .
Turn off the TV and the Blackberry and go for a 30 - minute walk every day .
Eat fruits and vegetables and cut down on anything that has sugar , high fructose corn syrup , white flour or too much sodium ( salt ) in it ( and , as Michael Pollan says , " Eat ( real ) food , not too much , mostly plants " ) .
Get seven hours of sleep each night and take the time to read a book a month .
I know this sounds like I 've turned into your grandma , but , dammit , take a good hard look at Granny -- she 's fit , she 's rested and she knows the names of both of her U.S. Senators without having to Google them .
We might do well to listen to her .
If we do n't put our own " oxygen mask " on first ( as they say on the airplane ) , we will be of no use to the rest of the nation in enacting any of this action plan !
I 'm sure there are many other ideas you can come up with on how we can build this movement .
Get creative .
Think outside the politics - as - usual box .
BE SUBVERSIVE !
Think of that local action no one else has tried .
Behave as if your life depended on it .
Be bold !
Try doing something with reckless abandon .
It may just liberate you and your community and your nation .
And when you act , send me your stories , your photos and your video - photos@michaelmoore.com - and be sure to post your ideas in the comments beneath this letter on my site so they can be shared with millions .
C'mon people -- we can do this !
I expect nothing less of all of you , my true and trusted fellow travelers !
There ’s a “ normal ” path for a fiscal crisis .
Â
Some vulnerabilities build up .Â
An external shock tips things over the edge .
Â
The country struggles along for a while but eventually refinancing or rollover risk forces the issue : new debt ca n’t be sold and the Impossible Missions Force is the only available lender .
Â
An ugly but usually effective correction takes place and eventually access to capital markets resumes .
Â
Of course there are exceptions but that ’s the broad outline and some 2009 crisis countries may already over the worst .
Â
Then there ’s Ireland .
Ireland is a much analyzed economy so there ’s little value added in another in - depth analysis .
Â
So just a few simple facts .
Â
In April , a supplemental budget that was supposed to settle things for the rest of 2009 forecast a general government balance of - 10.75 percent ( of GDP ) for 2009 and 2010 .
Â
Assuming the same package of cuts as the April budget did , the respected Economic and Social Research Institute has just forecast deficits of close to 13 percent for 2009 and 2010 .
Â 2 percent of GDP went missing from revenue projections over a few months .
Â
To give credit where it ’s due , the IMF never believed the government ’s deficit forecasts even at the time they were formulated and forecast deficits of 12 percent in 2009 and 13 percent in 2010 .
How big a deal is 2 percent of GDP ?
Â
Well , the Irish government has told the European Commission that it will have the deficit down to the Maastricht level of 3 percent of GDP by 2013 .
Â Â Since the macroeconomic framework for Budget 2010 has already been set , that ’s 3 budgets to achieve a fiscal adjustment of 10 percent of GDP , and formulated in the context of inability to reliably forecast tax revenue even 6 months ahead of time .
Â Â
And the new forecasts allow for a relatively benign global environment relative to the dire projections of earlier in the year , so this is specifically a crisis within the Irish Exchequer .
So what ’s the attitude of the Irish government ?
Â
They do n’t seem too worried .
Â
The coalition government just sorted out some internal strains with a deal that constrains , not expands , its room for manoeuvre in the forthcoming budget .
Â
More importantly , the finance ministry points to the ease with which new debt can be sold and declining CDS spreads as evidence that the market foresees no crisis , therefore there is none .
But the comfortable debt funding only tells us one thing : that the market foresees financing .
Â
It does n’t tell us who will do the financing .
Â
In particular , who would n’t blame the international bond market for concluding that when a middle to high income country with the European umbrella looks like it ’s going under , enough multilaterals are rounded up until a package is found ?
Â Â Between the IMF , the EU , backdoor ECB mechanisms , and ad hoc regional consortia ( such as for Latvia ) , large short - term deficits can be financed — in exchange for severe medium term correction measures .
Yet there is little sign that this contingency has been internalized in Irish political debate .
Â Â
There has been little public discussion of how the drift in the revenue base will be handled , the unions are outlining a leisurely schedule of days of action over the next few months , and it ’s still 2 months to budget day .
Â
It ’s all sustained by a highly divergent set of expectations about how the adjustment will come , but expectations which agree on one thing — it ’s up to someone else to move first .
Â
It ’s the classic game of chicken played at 10 miles an hour ( or should that be 16 kph ? ) .
Â
Eventually those cars still meet .
From the ' interesting to note ' files :
The issue of how long a Linux distribution will support a release is one that tends to go back and forth .
Novell 's openSUSE Linux is now revising its policy .
Starting with the openSUSE 11.2 , maintenance support will be approximately 18 months which is a reduction of 6 months from what openSUSE 11.1 and prior releases , offered users .
" OpenSUSE will shorten the maintenance period to 2 versions plus 2 months
which translates with the current release cycle of 8 months to 18 months
instead of 24 months we had with openSUSE 11.1 and previous releases , " Michael Loffler , Product Management at SUSE wrote in a mailing list posting .
" With that we now can guarantee an overlap time from a maintenance perspective
which gives enough time to update machines to newer versions . "
OpenSUSE 11.2 is codenamed ' Fichte ' and is set for release later this year .
On the maintenance side of things , the new openSUSE policy is actually closer to what its competitors , Fedora and Ubuntu offer their community users .
The current Fedora policy is that releases will live only until one month after the N - 2 ( next two ) release is out .
So if my math is correct that means that openSUSE has one month extra , but that depends on how long the actual release cycle is , which can vary a bit .
Ubuntu also has approximately 18 months of support for its releases .
Arsene Wenger is considering changing to a 4 - 3 - 3 formation this season to accommodate his young attacking talents in what would be a radical departure from the Arsenal manager 's usual 4 - 4 - 2 system .
Wenger used the 4 - 3 - 3 formation in the weekend 's two Emirates Cup games and has worked extensively with the players on that style during pre-season in Austria .
The new approach would be much more similar in style to the one used to such great success last season by Barcelona and would be spearheaded by a single centre - forward in either Robin van Persie or Eduardo da Silva .
Although it would be a culture shock for a team accustomed to playing 4 - 4 - 2 under Wenger , it explains the Frenchman 's confidence at allowing Emmanuel Adebayor to leave the club .
The feeling at Arsenal is that Wenger will give the system a more exacting test by using it against Valencia in the friendly on Saturday and if he feels that his players have sufficiently adapted then he will use it against Everton in the first Premier League game the following week .
It would mean keeping Andrei Arshavin on the left wing and using Theo Walcott on the right of an attacking three .

In terms of the midfield three , Alex Song would be favourite to play the holding midfield role behind a pairing of Cesc Fabregas and one from Denilson , Tomas Rosicky , Aaron Ramsey , Fran Merida of even Jack Wilshere who impressed over the weekend against Atletico Madrid and Rangers .
The concern for Wenger is the defensive aspect of the formation .
Talking about the change to his team 's formation on Saturday , the Arsenal manager said : " I wanted to see how it works because we have many offensive players and maybe we have to tighten up a bit in midfield to keep balance between offence and defence .
But I wanted to see how it works in a game and I am quite happy with it . "
He mentioned the importance of the " tactical cohesion " in his programme notes for the weekend .
The weakness is where Wenger finds a holding midfielder as an alternative for Song who is still some distance from establishing himself in that position .
Abou Diaby can play that role and there are still the rumblings about Patrick Vieira returning .
However , it is understood that despite Wenger 's cryptic answers on the subject he has made no move to sign him .
He has been priced out of any move for Daniele de Rossi , the Roma and Italy midfielder , who at a valuation of around £ 30 m would not be viable for Wenger .
His move for the Bordeaux striker Marouane Chamakh is starting to gain momentum with the player giving an outspoken interview in L'Equipe yesterday outlining his desire to leave .
The 25 - year - old has been the subject of one offer of around £ 6.5 m from Wenger which has been dismissed outright by Bordeaux who have priced the player at £ 15 m but would probably settle for closer to £ 12 m .
Chamakh , who was pulled out of a friendly on Sunday against Villarreal said it was his " dream " to join Arsenal .
" I am angry , I am even disgusted [ with Bordeaux ] , " he said .
" I do n't understand why people are doing this to me .
I believe I deserve more consideration .
I am a year from the end of my contract and the club [ Bordeaux ] wants to make it all about money . "
The best league in the world is back .

Was Miami Anchor Charles Perez Ousted For Being Too Gay ?
Maybe the reason Anderson Cooper is n’t so forthcoming with his sexuality is he fears a fate similar to Charles Perez , the Miami anchor for ABC affiliate WPLG claiming he was removed for being gay .
Perez was last seen pulling anchor duty on July 22 , but his descent began months ago , according to a discrimination claim filed with Miami - Dade ’s Equal Opportunity Board , alleging WPLG bosses ousted him “ because of their discomfort over the increasingly high profile of my sexual orientation . ”
Not helping things ?
Perez is in the middle of a domestic violence dispute with ex-boyfriend Dennis Ricardo Peña , who stands accused of leaking a private email between Perez and his therapist to his work colleagues .
( Peña filed his own complaint against Perez , alleging Perez is the one responsible for the threats . )
On March 16 , Perez alleges in court papers , Peña hacked into his personal e-mail , intercepting a ” confidential and sensitive ” e-mail and then forwarding it to ” every single person ” on Perez ’s e-mail address book .
Among those who received the e-mail was Perez ’s attorney , Milstein .
Perez says Peña had enough personal info to obtain his password .
Peña tells
The Miami Herald : “ I did not hack into his e-mail . ”
The e-mail in question was sent Feb. 20 to a family therapist in Los Angeles .
Perez ’s petition says the e-mail could cause ” substantial harm ” to his “ professional and personal reputation . ”
Perez also says Peña sent him threatening text messages late last month .
Peña filed a 12 - page motion to dismiss Perez ’s petition .
The motion mentions Perez ’s co-anchor Laurie Jennings and her contract negotiations ; details of the Perez - Peña sexual relationship ; and Perez ’s relationship with a new partner , accountant Keith Rinehard .
In the motion , Peña claims that Perez reached out to the therapist ‘ for counsel with his `gender identity issues . ’ ”
It seems to coincide with his removal at the network .
LANDMARK DECISION PROMISES MASSIVE RELIEF FOR HOMEOWNERS AND TROUBLE FOR BANKS
A landmark ruling in a recent Kansas Supreme Court case may have given millions of distressed homeowners the legal wedge they need to avoid foreclosure .
In Landmark National Bank v. Kesler , 2009 Kan. LEXIS 834 , the Kansas Supreme Court held that a nominee company called MERS has no right or standing to bring an action for foreclosure .
MERS is an acronym for Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems , a private company that registers mortgages electronically and tracks changes in ownership .
The significance of the holding is that if MERS has no standing to foreclose , then nobody has standing to foreclose � on 60 million mortgages .
That is the number of American mortgages currently reported to be held by MERS .
Over half of all new U.S. residential mortgage loans are registered with MERS and recorded in its name .
Holdings of the Kansas Supreme Court are not binding on the rest of the country , but they are dicta of which other courts take note ; and the reasoning behind the decision is sound .
�
Eliminating the � Straw Man� Shielding Lenders and Investors from Liability
The development of �electronic� mortgages managed by MERS went hand in hand with the �securitization� of mortgage loans � chopping them into pieces and selling them off to investors .
In the heyday of mortgage securitizations , before investors got wise to their risks , lenders would slice up loans , bundle them into �financial products � called � collateralized debt obligations � ( CDOs ) , ostensibly insure them against default by wrapping them in derivatives called �credit default swaps , � and sell them to pension funds , municipal funds , foreign investment funds , and so forth .
There were many secured parties , and the pieces kept changing hands ; but MERS supposedly kept track of all these changes electronically .
MERS would register and record mortgage loans in its name , and it would bring foreclosure actions in its name .
MERS not only facilitated the rapid turnover of mortgages and mortgage - backed securities , but it has served as a sort of �corporate shield � that protects investors from claims by borrowers concerning predatory lending practices .
California attorney Timothy McCandless describes the problem like this :
� [ MERS ] has reduced transparency in the mortgage market in two ways .
First , consumers and their counsel can no longer turn to the public recording systems to learn the identity of the holder of their note .
Today , county recording systems are increasingly full of one meaningless name , MERS , repeated over and over again .
But more importantly , all across the country , MERS now brings foreclosure proceedings in its own name � even though it is not the financial party in interest .
This is problematic because MERS is not prepared for or equipped to provide responses to consumers � discovery requests with respect to predatory lending claims and defenses .
In effect , the securitization conduit attempts to use a faceless and seemingly innocent proxy with no knowledge of predatory origination or servicing behavior to do the dirty work of seizing the consumer�s home .
. . .
So imposing is this opaque corporate wall , that in a �vast� number of foreclosures , MERS actually succeeds in foreclosing without producing the original note � the legal sine qua non of foreclosure � much less documentation that could support predatory lending defenses . �
The real parties in interest concealed behind MERS have been made so faceless , however , that there is now no party with standing to foreclose .
The Kansas Supreme Court stated that MERS � relationship �is more akin to that of a straw man than to a party possessing all the rights given a buyer . �
The court opined :
� By statute , assignment of the mortgage carries with it the assignment of the debt .
. . .
Indeed , in the event that a mortgage loan somehow separates interests of the note and the deed of trust , with the deed of trust lying with some independent entity , the mortgage may become unenforceable .
The practical effect of splitting the deed of trust from the promissory note is to make it impossible for the holder of the note to foreclose , unless the holder of the deed of trust is the agent of the holder of the note .
Without the agency relationship , the person holding only the note lacks the power to foreclose in the event of default .
The person holding only the deed of trust will never experience default because only the holder of the note is entitled to payment of the underlying obligation .
The mortgage loan becomes ineffectual when the note holder did not also hold the deed of trust .�
[ Citations omitted ; emphasis added . ]
MERS as straw man lacks standing to foreclose , but so does original lender , although it was a signatory to the deal .
The lender lacks standing because title had to pass to the secured parties for the arrangement to legally qualify as a �security .�
The lender has been paid in full and has no further legal interest in the claim .
Only the securities holders have skin in the game ; but they have no standing to foreclose , because they were not signatories to the original agreement .
They cannot satisfy the basic requirement of contract law that a plaintiff suing on a written contract must produce a signed contract proving he is entitled to relief .
The Potential Impact of 60 Million Fatally Flawed Mortgages
The banks arranging these mortgage - backed securities have typically served as trustees for the investors .
When the trustees could not present timely written proof of ownership entitling them to foreclose , they would in the past file �lost - note affidavits � with the court ; and judges usually let these foreclosures proceed without objection .
But in October 2007 , an intrepid federal judge in Cleveland put a halt to the practice .
U.S. District Court Judge Christopher Boyko ruled that Deutsche Bank had not filed the proper paperwork to establish its right to foreclose on fourteen homes it was suing to repossess as trustee .
Judges in many other states then came out with similar rulings .
Following the Boyko decision , in December 2007 attorney Sean Olender suggested in an article in The San Francisco Chronicle that the real reason for the bailout schemes being proposed by then - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson was not to keep strapped borrowers in their homes so much as to stave off a spate of lawsuits against the banks .
Olender wrote :
� The sole goal of the [ bailout schemes ] is to prevent owners of mortgage - backed securities , many of them foreigners , from suing U.S. banks and forcing them to buy back worthless mortgage securities at face value � right now almost 10 times their market worth .
The ticking time bomb in the U.S. banking system is not resetting subprime mortgage rates .
The real problem is the contractual ability of investors in mortgage bonds to require banks to buy back the loans at face value if there was fraud in the origination process .
�. . .
The catastrophic consequences of bond investors forcing originators to buy back loans at face value are beyond the current media discussion .
The loans at issue dwarf the capital available at the largest U.S. banks combined , and investor lawsuits would raise stunning liability sufficient to cause even the largest U.S. banks to fail , resulting in massive taxpayer - funded bailouts of Fannie and Freddie , and even FDIC . . . .
� What would be prudent and logical is for the banks that sold this toxic waste to buy it back and for a lot of people to go to prison .
If they knew about the fraud , they should have to buy the bonds back . �
Needless to say , however , the banks did not buy back their toxic waste , and no bank officials went to jail .
As Olender predicted , in the fall of 2008 , massive taxpayer - funded bailouts of Fannie and Freddie were pushed through by Henry Paulson , whose former firm Goldman Sachs was an active player in creating CDOs when he was at its helm as CEO .
Paulson also hastily engineered the $ 85 billion bailout of insurer American International Group ( AIG ) , a major counterparty to Goldmans� massive holdings of CDOs .
The insolvency of AIG was a huge crisis for Goldman , a principal beneficiary of the AIG bailout .
In a December 2007 New York Times article titled � The Long and Short of It at Goldman Sachs , � Ben Stein wrote :
� For decades now , . . .
I have been receiving letters [ warning ] me about the dangers of a secret government running the world . . . .
[ T ]he closest I have recently seen to such a world - running body would have to be a certain large investment bank , whose alums are routinely Treasury secretaries , high advisers to presidents , and occasionally a governor or United States senator . �
The pirates seem to have captured the ship , and until now there has been no one to stop them .
But 60 million mortgages with fatal defects in title could give aggrieved homeowners and securities holders the crowbar they need to exert some serious leverage on Congress � serious enough perhaps even to pry the legislature loose from the powerful banking lobbies that now hold it in thrall .
i Suppli thoroughly dampened any PC industry euphoria in the wake of Intel 's happy results yesterday , predicting that this year will show the first overall contraction of PC shipments since the dot com crash .
Intel reported a better than expected second quarter yesterday , with the fastest revenue climb in 20 years , and predicted a return to seasonal growth for the rest of the year .
However , iSuppli forced the corks back into the bottle by predicting that overall PC shipments for the year will drop four per cent to 237.3 million units .
The firm had previously forecast a 0.7 per cent rise in shipments this year .
The main damage appears to have occurred in the first half , with flat shipments in the second quarter , and sequential rises in the third and fourth quarters .
The third quarter will be down year on year , but the fourth quarter should show year on year growth of 3.6 per cent .
Next year should rise 4.7 per cent on 2009 .
As the firm 's principal analyst for computer platforms Matthew Wilkons pointed out : " An annual decline in unit shipments is highly unusual in the PC market .
He said the last year on year decline was back in 2001 , when the market dropped 5.1 per cent in the wake of the dot com bust , as VC - engorged web startups suddenly keeled over en masse .
Unsurprisingly , it is desktops which are showing the biggest decline , with shipments expected to plunge 18.1 per cent to 124.4 million , while entry level servers will slip 9.5 per cent to 6.9 million units .
That leaves notebooks - and netbooks - as the only segment likely to show growth , specifically by 11.7 per cent to 155.97 units .
Which the sharp - eyed among you will have noticed means notebooks will have outstripped desktop shipments - a first , said iSuppli .
Years ago , this would have been a cause for celebration for PC vendors and their silicon suppliers .
This is not necessarily the case now , as notebook prices - specifically netbook prices - have come down so low .
At best , vendors might comfort themselves with the fact that netbooks have gotten so small and light that people are likely to lose them , necessitiating replacement purchases .
Still , the PC industry is looking for anything that looks like good news right now , and even the imminent launch of a Microsoft operating system is seen as a beacon of hope .
But iSuppli points out , the crucial enterprise sector is still looking anaemic .
Until those big spending corporates loosen their purse strings , PC vendors will still be on short rations . ®
Cougar
Town has really grown on me since the pilot episode .
I may actually continue watching .
I still do n't like the premise or the plot of the episodes ; however , the acting on Cougar Town , especially by Courtney Cox is top notch , and the jokes are well - written .
Bill Lawrence is very talented and I am looking forward to the Scrubs redux next year .
There 's not much else to say about the show .
Everyone involved in the show took a pretty stupid concept and turned it into a genuinely funny show .
If I had to point out one bright spot , it would be Dan Byrd who plays Travis , Jules 's son .
He did a great job in the last episode and works well with Courtney Cox .
The plot was dumb again , but there were many funny moments .
Jules does n't have any good stories about her twenties and goes out partying .
She gets wasted and her friends have all kind of things to say to her .
I know it does n't sound funny , and it's hard to convey the hilarity when the situation is so stupid , but just watch the first 2 episodes .
You 're guaranteed to see something you like .

The Rise of Heavy Metal In Electronic Music
In the last few years , DJs and producers have been sublimating their societal anxieties into blood - curdling vocals , grating distortion , and pummeling blast beats .
Early birds may get worms but not chicks .
That is , according a recent study by Davide Piffer at the University of Pisa , the mean number of sexual partners for morning - oriented men was 3.6 versus 16.3 for evening - oriented men .
This means that guys who are night owls have about four times as many sexual partners as morning birds .
Drawing on evolutionary psychology , Piffer offers a few theories :
1. ) Throughout human history social activities have taken place at night .
( In fact >60 percent of the people Piffer polled met their latest partner in the evening or night . )
The evening is commonly reserved for courtship activity — dancing , drinking , having sex .
Over time , the male night owl attends more social events , meets more women , and has more sex .
2. ) “ Eveningness ” is a sexually dimorphic trait .
Across cultures , “ more males than females stay up late at night ( due to biological differences involving the timing of peak melatonin levels ) .
Piffer speculates that men evolved to stay up late because , in the deep past , the most reproductively successful males were night owls and they passed along their genes to subsequent generations .
In terms of Darwinian sexual selection , evening orientation benefits males more because it gives them an increased opportunity to acquire multiple lovers — all at one go , or over time .
Women , however , do n’t achieve greater reproductive success by having sex with more men ( it only takes one to get pregnant ) , which is why fewer women are evening - oriented .
Men with an evening orientation have a competitive advantage over men with a morning orientation .
3. ) Evening - orientation , Piffer speculates , may also be a direct product of sexual selection .
That is , women may actively choose night owls over morning birds .
Piffer draws on the “ cads- versus - dads ” theory ; that is , women often go for bad boys , especially at a certain stage of life , and men who stay up into the night are likelier to fall into this category .
4. ) Being a night owl may also be a form of “ handicap signaling . ”
Staying up late at night ( possibly drinking and smoking ) can take a toll on one ’s health .
Only a man who is fit and healthy would be able to compensate for his lifestyle .
Assuming a man seems unaffected by little sleep , his evening orientation indicates a strong constitution — a sexy quality .
Mind you , Piffer ’s theories are allextremely speculative ( but fun ! ) .
Of course there are many unanswered questions :
By nature , is there something about a night bird ’s personality that makes him more promiscuous than a morning bird — or is it only that he has more opportunities to meet women ?
Do night owls in all cultures get more sex ?
The study took place in Italy — it would be interesting to repeat the same experiment in non-Western cultures .
At least this may explain the otherwise inexplicable female obsession with vampires .
P&G Wants You to Take A Dump and Blog About It
When did we arrive at a point in time when it was OK for a brand to essentially say , " Please take a shit in public and tells us about how it felt , what it looked like and how effective the toilet paper was at wiping it off your ass ? "
Thanks to Charmin's Enjoy the Go promotion , we 're in that moment right now .
The toilet paper brand is seeking five people to spend five weeks in a Charmin - branded bathroom in Manhattan and blog about dropping a log .
According to a story in the Cincinnati Business Courier , participants ' " requirements include interacting with hundreds of thousands of bathroom guests , maintaining their own blogs and content on Charmin - branded Web sites and popular social media sites , and sharing family - friendly video from the restroom space and surrounding areas . "
Open auditions ( seriously ?
we do n't even want to envision that ! ) for the job will take place November 5 at New York 's Hilton Hotel .
Oh damn .
We 've stayed there before .
Damn !
We can't even imagine staying there again after this what with the possibility of " audition leftovers " hiding in a corner .
Gross .
The effort follows last year 's Plush Potties for the People promotion during which a Charmin - branded public restroom made a tour from Santa Monica to Times Square .
So what can we expect next year ?
A live action defecation contest shot with a Charmin Shitcam and piped to the Jumbotron ?
Who can take the biggest shit ?
The longest ?
The thickest ?
The loudest ?
The smelliest ?
The possibilities are endless , Charmin .
We simply can't wait .
I ’ve been off the air for several days due to a hosting - site failure last Friday .
After several months of deteriorating performance and various services being sporadically inaccessible , Berlios ’s webspace went 404 and the Subversion repositories stopped working … taking my GPSD project down with them .
I had every reason to fear this might be permanent , and spent the next two days reconstructing as much as possible of the project state so we could migrate to another site .
Berlios came back up on Monday .
But I do n’t trust it will stay that way .
This weekend rubbed my nose in some systemic vulnerabilities in the open - source development infrastructure that we need to fix .
Rant follows .
1. Hosting Sites Are Data Jails
The worst problem with almost all current hosting sites is that they ’re data jails .
You can put data ( the source code revision history , mailing list address lists , bug reports ) into them , but getting a complete snapshot of that data back out often ranges from painful to impossible .
Why is this an issue ?
Very practically , because hosting sites , even well - established ones , sometimes go off the air .
Any prudent project lead should be thinking about how to recover if that happens , and how to take periodic backups of critical project data .
But more generally , it ’s your data .
You should own it .
If you ca n’t push a button and get a snapshot of your project state out of the site whenever you want , you do n’t own it .
When berlios .
de crashed on me , I was lucky ; I had been preparing to migrate GPSD off the site due to deteriorating performance ; I had a Subversion dump file that was less than two weeks old .
I was able to bring that up to date by translating commits from an unofficial git mirror .
I was doubly lucky in that the Mailman adminstrative pages remained accessible even when the project webspace and repositories had been 404 for two days .
But actually retrieving my mailing - list data was a hideous process that involved screen - scraping HTML by hand , and I had no hope at all of retrieving the bug tracker state .
This anecdote illustrates the most serious manifestations of the data - jail problem .
Third - generation version - control ( hg , git , bzr , etc. ) systems pretty much solve it for code repositories ; every checkout is a mirror .
But most projects have two other critical data collections : their mailing - list state and their bug - tracker state .
And , on all sites I know of in late 2009 , those are seriously jailed .
This is a problem that goes straight to the design of the software subsystems used by these sites .
Some are generic : of these , the most frequent single offender is 2.x versions of Mailman , the most widely used mailing - list manager ( the Mailman maintainers claim to have fixed this in 3.0 ) .
Bug - trackers tend to be tightly tied to individual hosting engines , and are even harder to dig data out of .
They also illustrate the second major failing …
2. Hosting Sites have Poor Scriptability
All hosting - site suites are Web-centric , operated primarily or entirely through a browser .
This solves many problems , but creates a few as well .
One is that browsers , like GUIs in general , are badly suited for stereotyped and repetitive tasks .
Another is that they have poor accessibility for people with visual or motor - control issues .
Here again the issues with version - control systems are relatively minor , because all those in common use are driven by CLI tools that are easy to script .
Mailing lists do n’t present serious issues either ; the only operation on them that normally goes through the web is moderation of submissions , and the demands of that operation are fairly well matched to a browser - style interface .
But there are other common operations that need to be scriptable and are generally not .
A representative one is getting a list of open bug reports to work on later – say , somewhere that your net connection is spotty .
There is no reason this could n’t be handled by an email autoresponder robot connected to the bug - tracker database , a feature which would also improve tracker accessibility for the blind .
Another is shipping a software release .
This normally consists of uploading product files in various shipping formats ( source tarballs , debs , RPMs , and the like ) to the hosting site ’s download area , and associating with them a bunch of metadata including such things as a short - form release announcement , file - type or architecture tags for the binary packages , MD5 signatures , and the like .
With the exception of the release announcement , there is really no reason a human being should be sitting at a web browser to type in this sort of thing .
In fact there is an excellent reason a human should n’t do it by hand – it ’s exactly the sort of fiddly , tedious semi-mechanical chore at which humans tend to make ( and then miss ) finger errors because the brain is not fully engaged .
It would be better for the hosting system ’s release - registration logic to accept a job card via email , said job card including all the release metadata and URLs pointing to the product files it should gather for the release .
Each job card could be generated by a project - specific script that would take the parts that really need human attention from a human and mechanically fill in the rest .
This would both minimize human error and improve accessibility .
In general , a good question for hosting - system designers to be asking themselves about each operation of the system would be “ Do I provide a way to remote - script this through an email robot or XML - RPC interface or the like ? ”
When the answer is “ no ” , that ’s a bug that needs to be fixed .
3. Hosting Sites Have Inadequate Support for Immigration
The first ( and in my opinion , most serious ) failing I identified is poor support for snapshotting and if necessary out - migrating a project .
Most hosting systems do almost as badly at in - migrating a project that already has a history , as opposed to one started from nothing on the site .
Even uploading an existing source code repository at start of a project ( as opposed to starting with an empty one ) is only spottily supported .
Just try , for example , to find a site that will let you upload a mailbox full of archives from a pre-existing development list in order to re-home it at the project ’s new development site .
This is the flip side of the data - jail problem .
It has some of the same causes , and many of the same consequences too .
Because it makes re-homing projects unnecessarily difficult , it means that project leads cannot respond effectively to hosting - site problems .
This creates a systemic brittleness in our development infrastructure .
Addressing the Problems
I believe in underpromising and overperforming , so I ’m not going to talk up any grand plans to fix this .
Yet .
But I will say that I intend to do more than talk .
And two days ago the project leaders of Savane , the hosting system that powers gna.org and Savanna , read this and invited me to join their project team .
Description :
In this video , Sneaky Simian shows us how to systematically break into computers using a combination of BeEF and Metasploit .
He first finds a site which is vulnerable to injection flaws .
He then injects the BeEF JS script link into the page .
Now any user who comes to the site , will execute the BeEF javascript and will allow for more advanced attacks to be executed on his browser using the BeEF framework .
Sneaky now uses a combination of BeEF and Metasploit to break into the user 's computer .
This is a nice end to end video on how hackers can compromise victims , who only have to visit a vulnerable site .
One can imagine the magnitude of the problem if a large site like Facebook falls victim to such as flaw .

West did n’t even wait until the next morning to apologize for his bizarre behavior during Taylor Swift ’s Best Female Video win at tonight ’s MTV Video Music Awards .
“ I ’M SOOOOO SORRY , ” the superstar wrote in a characteristically all - caps entry on his personal blog , posted before the VMAs broadcast even ended , adding , “ I ’M IN THE WRONG . ”
While acknowledging that the 19 - year - old Swift is “ VERY TALENTED , ” West also sought to explain his actions , writing , “ WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD !!!!
EVERYBODY WANNA BOOOOO ME BUT I ’M A FAN OF REAL POP CULTURE !!! ”
West ’s apology post read as follows in full : “ I ’M SOOOOO SORRY TO TAYLOR SWIFT AND HER FANS AND HER MOM .
I SPOKE TO HER MOTHER RIGHT AFTER AND SHE SAID THE SAME THING MY MOTHER WOULD’VE SAID .
SHE IS VERY TALENTED !
I LIKE THE LYRICS ABOUT BEING A CHEERLEADER AND SHE’S IN THE BLEACHERS ! ……………………
I ’M IN THE WRONG FOR GOING ON STAGE AND TAKING AWAY FROM HER MOMENT !……………..
BEYONCE’S VIDEO WAS THE BEST OF THIS DECADE !!!!
I ’M SORRY TO MY FANS IF I LET YOU GUYS DOWN !!!!
I ’M SORRY TO MY FRIENDS AT MTV .
I WILL APOLOGIZE TO TAYLOR 2MRW .
WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD !!!!
EVERYBODY WANNA BOOOOO ME BUT I ’M A FAN OF REAL POP CULTURE !!!
NO DISRESPECT BUT WE WATCHIN ’ THE SHOW AT THE CRIB RIGHT NOW CAUSE … WELL YOU KNOW !!!!
I ’M STILL HAPPY FOR TAYLOR !!!!
BOOOYAAAWWWW !!!!
YOU ARE VERY VERY TALENTED !!!
I GAVE MY AWARDS TO OUTKAST WHEN THEY DESERVED IT OVER ME … THAT’S WHAT IT IS !!!!!!!
I ’M NOT CRAZY YALL , I ’M JUST REAL .
SORRY FOR THAT !!!
I REALLY FEEL BAD FOR TAYLOR AND I’M SINCERELY SORRY !!!
MUCH RESPECT !!!!! ”
It ’s not easy to find nuance in hate .
Sounding like a country death ballad banged out by factory machinery , “ Prayer to God ” is a double - death wish with revealing specificity .
The setup is simple enough :
There are two people
here , and the narrator wants God to kill them .
Over clamoring chords and the dead - air breaks in between , any other information comes slowly , and the same goes for the blustering climax and teeth - gritting tension from the lyrics ’ repetition– all to be deflated by its grim punchline : the most disarming “ amen ” put to tape .

why we need evidence - based politics
A poll of New Jersey residents shows a very disturbing trend in politics : a steep rise in conspiracy theories substituting for news and facts in potential voters ' minds .
A new poll of New Jersey found that conspiracy theories with absolutely no basis in fact , and some reaching in the realm of the supernatural , are very prevalent among the state ’s residents , prompting a very disturbing an important question about the current state of , and the future of political discourse .
How do you govern and maintain a high level of public discourse when the conversation in the news is dominated by people who steadfastly refuse to get a grasp on reality or educate themselves on the facts involved ?
Now , the interesting thing not mentioned about the poll in question is that it did n’t just ask conservatives why , or if , they think Obama is the anti-Christ .
The pollsters were actually looking to evaluate how many people on the right and on the left had what could be considered irrational beliefs , like religious gloom and doom and Birtherism on the conservative side , and 9/11 Truthism on the liberal end of the spectrum .
The full results are pretty disturbing on both sides .
While 35 % of self - identified Republican voters are either sure or think that it ’s possible for Obama to be the incarnation of temporal evil and 52 % think he either was n’t born in the U.S. or that Birthers could have a plausible theory , some 51 % of Democrats think that the Bush administration had “ advance knowledge ” of the 9/11 attacks .
Unfortunately , the poll did n’t try to find out whether there was a full blown
Truther on the other end of the line , something it should ’ve done to get an accurate proportion .
Of course we know there are plenty of Truthers out there along with all sorts of liberal movements who vocally rebel against science .
The proponents of alternative medical woo and anti-vaccination activists are great examples of the left ’s rarely mentioned disdain towards scientific reality .
And while Schaeffer and Maddow so narrowly focused on fundamentalists in their political subjectivity , they missed the chance to discuss how the country could be governed despite millions of people who ardently refuse to accept facts and believe that their opinions matter more than objective data .
Even worse , today ’s news shows only serve to stoke their fires and make them louder and more rabid about their dearly held beliefs , turning bad ideas into even worse dogmas that are being pushed on us from every other current events headline .
This disturbing trend has taken a firm hold on politics where everything seems to be a controversy , or a conspiracy , or fuel for outrage that tends to be so ill - informed and logically baseless , you can physically feel your IQ dropping after being exposed to it .
What will be the biggest challenge in trying to return some objectivity to public debates , is to convince people who grew up on the idea that every opinion is as good and as valid as another no matter what , that this is not the case and never was .
When scientists talk about evolution or cosmology , they have good evidence for their theories .
Someone who would n’t know matter from antimatter if the latter exploded behind his rear end , is not going to have a valid opinion on the topic .
However , rather than recognize experts and facts , we glorify opinion and angry polemics .
The result gives us entertainers instead of news analysts , most of them egomaniacal , self - serving and unapologetically loudmouthed , especially on topics they know nothing about .
They ’re good at scaremongering , spewing hate and interviewing people who agree with them .
And pretty much nothing else .
Surely there are conservatives out there who oppose certain liberal policies on nuances more detailed than screams of “ death panels !
communism !
Soviet Russia ! socialism ! totalitarianism ! booga booga booga ! ” but you ’re not going to hear them on Fox News or any other news network .
Droning on about policy matters and detailed statistics is boring for TV execs who want to see political talk shows be more Jerry Springer than a nightly news program and today ’s crop of blathering heads on the tube lack the patience and skill to develop these sorts of discussions .
But these are exactly the discussions we need to be having .
Yes , in the words of the late George Carlin , some crazy people should be kept around for entertainment .
But not every crazy person should have his own little media empire …
Look what i’m found in my candy , instead of tasty toppings i’m got live meat !
I mean , really , what more i can expect from these unknown candy ’s ?
Be careful when you buy some suspicious products you ca n’t know what is inside of the box …
And also check expire date !
Candy , specifically sugar candy , is a confection made from a concentrated solution of sugar in water , to which flavorings and colorants are added .
Candies come in numerous colors and varieties and have a long history in popular culture .
The word “ candy ” comes from Arabic qandi , derived from Persian qand , meaning “ sugar ” probably from Sanskrit khanda “ piece ( of sugar ) , ” which again perhaps from Dravidian ( cf. Tamil kantu “ candy , ” kattu “ to harden , condense ” ) . ”
In North America , candy is a broad category that includes candy bars , chocolates , licorice , sour candies , salty candies , tart candies , hard candies , taffies , gumdrops , marshmallows , and more .
Vegetables , fruit or nuts glazed and coated with sugar are called candied .
NEW YORK , Sept 24 ( Reuters ) - A New York man was indicted on Thursday for allegedly seeking training from Islamic militants to fight U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan , authorities said .
The FBI said Betim Kaziu , a U.S. citizen and New York resident , sought to acquire weapons and training to fight U.S. troops abroad .
Kaziu traveled to Cairo in February , the FBI said , and later to Kosovo , where he was arrested by Kosovar authorities in August .
Along the way , Kaziu allegedly sought to join Al - Shabbab , an armed movement listed as a terrorist group by the U.S. State Department , and train in Pakistan to fight U.S. troops in Afghanistan , Iraq and the Balkans , the indictment said .
Kaziu sought to purchase weapons in Egypt , according to the indictment filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn .
" This case is a textbook example of a successful international effort to investigate and apprehend those who would engage in terrorist acts and preempt their plots , " said U.S. Attorney Benton Campbell in a statement .
The National Hockey League and its games are nearing their last leg in the United States .
There are several reasons behind this , but it should be mentioned that with only six teams in the league , there was very little interest in hockey in the United States to begin with .
While there are die hard fans in the original cities with teams , such as New York , Chicago , Detroit , and Boston , the die hard interest of 20,000 fans is not enough to support an entire league .
Television is what drives the success of many sports to the top of the entertainment industry .
To the untrained eye , hockey is perhaps the worst sport to watch .
The natural progression of the game is lightening fast , which can leave many newcomers to the sport blinking and wondering just what transpired .
Often times , the puck is too small to be picked up by the camera , and it always disappears during goals , which means several replays recounting different angles of many plays have to be shown in order for people to under stand exactly what happened .
Another problem with hockey is the US announcers during these matches .
For any veteran hockey fan , some of the commentary which is supplied by these men can border on televised journalism , instead of comments on the match at hand .
In addition , the nomenclature which surrounds a hockey game is confusing , and to man first time watchers , it can be entirely foreign .
Comments such as back - checking , half - boards , and others make no sense to hockey newbies , and often times , many of the American announcers themselves are entirely unfamiliar with how to call the game .
Canadian announcers do n’t seem to have this problem , but there are relatively few of them who announce American hockey , and so this is a major problem in the sport .
Another problem which exists is that all of the players are pretty much Anglo - Saxon , Scandinavian , or Russian , with very difficult names to pronounce .
After the season ends , these players disappear back to their homeland and are not heard of again until it is time for training camp .
Because of the high ratio of Hispanic and African - Americans in the United States , its clear why hockey is not a popular sport with these groups .
They traditionally do not play hockey as children , and as such , they feel no fan loyalty to the game , and there is no reason for any of them to take up watching it as a hobby or a past time .
Aside from these demographics , the entire game of hockey is a mess which is very hard to follow unless you ’re a coach , former players , or a referee .
Fans who have grown up watching and playing games may have no trouble following along , but for the majority of Americans who have never been exposed to a hockey game , it can be downright boring to watch , no matter how exciting the action is supposed to be .
These reasons work to compound onto one another , and slowly , they ’re choking the life out of hockey in the United States .
Sen .
John McCain is working behind - the - scenes to reshape the Republican Party in his own center - right image .
McCain 's mission : A GOP makeover
Fresh from a humbling loss in last year ’s presidential election , Sen . John McCain is working behind - the - scenes to reshape the Republican Party in his own center - right image .
McCain is recruiting candidates , raising money for them and hitting the campaign trail on their behalf .
He ’s taken sides in competitive House , Senate and gubernatorial primaries and introduced his preferred candidates to his top donors .

When the death of Sen .
Ted Kennedy created a vacant Senate seat in Massachusetts , McCain went so far as to solicit former Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling to run for the seat .
It ’s all part of an approach that is at odds with most other recent failed presidential nominees , whose immediate response to defeat was to retreat from the electoral arena .
But those familiar with McCain ’s thinking say he has expressed serious concern about the direction of the party and is actively seeking out and supporting candidates who can broaden the party ’s reach .
In McCain ’s case , that means backing conservative pragmatists and moderates .
“ I think he ’s endorsed people with center - right politics because he has an understanding that the party is in trouble with certain demographics and wants to have a tone that would allow us to grow , ” said Sen.
Lindsey Graham , the South Carolina Republican who is McCain ’s closest friend and ally in the Senate .
“ At a time when our party is struggling and has a lot of shrill voices and aggressive voices , he ’s one that can expand our party , ” said John Weaver , a longtime McCain friend and strategist .
“ John remains the titular head of the Republican Party and he will be until there ’s a new nominee , ” he said .
“ Most of the people that ran and lost you never heard from again , ” he said .
“ He ’s not going to be like Ed Muskie or Hubert Humphrey . ”
For moderate Rep. Mark Kirk of Illinois , the Arizona senator has been a trusted source of counsel , and a generous benefactor .
Before Kirk announced he would seek the Illinois Senate seat formerly held by President Barack Obama , McCain frequently encouraged him to run .
“ The key quote was , ‘ Service in the House in the minority is worth a warm bucket of … ’ ” Kirk told POLITICO , smiling as he recalled his conversations with McCain about a prospective Senate campaign .
“ I actually love service in the House , whether it ’s in the minority or not , ” Kirk said .
“ So I disagreed with him on that .
But his strong encouragement and backing — and he ’s a personal hero of mine — did have an impact on my thinking . ”
Yet McCain has offered much more than just inspiration .
He has endorsed Kirk in the GOP primary , released his entire donor list to him and made Kirk the beneficiary of a $ 500,000 McCain - sponsored fundraiser earlier this year .
And Kirk now counts Steve Schmidt , one of McCain ’s top staffers on the 2008 campaign , as an informal advisor .
“ [ McCain ] has told us that , with regard to my campaign for the Senate , what you need from us you will get , ” said Kirk .
McCain , it turns out , has emerged as a political godfather of sorts to a number of other candidates aside from Kirk , providing them with unfiltered access to a national fundraising network he has cultivated over a span of two decades .
In mid-September , McCain invited his favored candidates to the St. Regis Hotel in midtown Manhattan to rub shoulders with 40 of the senator ’s top donors at a reception for the Arizona Republican .
Last week , McCain formally endorsed GOP Rep. Jerry Moran in the Kansas Senate primary campaign against his more outspoken conservative opponent , Rep. Todd Tiahrt , and hosted a Capitol Hill fundraiser for Moran .
“ He…tells me that he has been very circumspect in what races to get involved in .
From my vantage point , it ’s not a broad scale ‘ I ’m for everybody , ’ ” said Moran .
“ It ’s ‘ I ’m picking candidates that I feel very comfortable with , ’ candidates that I think share some of his beliefs and philosophies of governing , and the largest part of that , I think , was fiscal responsibility . ”
McCain ’s increasingly active role — and his attempts to advance candidates cut from his own ideological mold — is n’t necessarily welcomed in all corners of the party .
“ John McCain is a moderate .
Birds of a feather fly together , ” said Family Research Council President Tony Perkins .
“ It ’s not surprising . ”
Erick Erickson , founder of the influential conservative blog , RedState , was even sharper in his criticism of McCain ’s initiative .
“ I ’m sure John McCain has a lot of political favors he wants to return in 2010 , but I do n’t trust his views of who a winning candidate is anymore than I trust his ability to pick a winning campaign staff , ” he said .
“ McCain has never really been a conservative , so I would n’t be surprised if he ’s picking non-conservative candidates . ”
McCain told POLITICO in a brief interview that he was determined to play a major role in the GOP ’s rebuilding effort — beginning with the party ’s 2010 campaign .
“ I think it ’s important , at this stage in my career , to try to support candidates that I think represent the next generation of leadership in the Republican Party , ” the 73 - year - old McCain said on his way to the Senate floor for a vote last week .
Loyalty also factors into the equation .
His campaigning for former eBay CEO Meg Whitman , a moderate facing a contested California primary , comes after she served as his presidential campaign co-chair .
McCain has also helped Florida Gov. Charlie Crist , who provided a key endorsement on the eve of his state ’s presidential primary .
Another McCain endorsee , Vaughn Ward , is a former Marine who ran McCain ’s Nevada campaign .
Ward , who is now running for the House in Idaho , said he plans to have McCain come out to campaign with him and raise money for his bid .
California Assemblyman Van Tran , a Vietnamese American who is challenging Democratic Rep. Loretta Sanchez in Orange County , said McCain does n’t forget his friends .
After endorsing the senator in 2008 against the urging of a local party establishment that preferred Mitt Romney , Tran said McCain was ready to return the favor when Tran visited him in his Senate office earlier this year .
The first words out his mouth , Tran said , were “ How can I help ?
“ It ’s a matter of personal loyalty and friendship , ” said Tran .
“ This is basic reciprocity for the support and friendship I had given him . ”
Those close to McCain say that , as much as anything else , his burgeoning political role reflects a determination he reached shortly after the conclusion of the presidential contest — that he would remain a factor on Capitol Hill .
“ This is John ’s way of staying in the game , ” said Graham .
“ I guess he could have taken the ball home and said , ‘ Well , I ’ve had my shot . ’ ”
“ McCain spent about one day thinking about the presidential race and then was thinking about the Senate , ” said Charlie Black , who was McCain ’s senior advisor on the campaign .
“ Nobody should be surprised that McCain is as engaged in politics as he ’s ever been — presidential race or no presidential race . ”

The Yule - Walker Equations and Algorithms for Their Solution
" Every cell phone call solves the Yule - Walker equations every ten microseconds . "
Thierry Dutoit
The Yule - Walker equations are pervasive in science and technology , and , even though we are most concerned with their role in financial time series , we would be like ostriches with our heads in the sand if we chose to ignore the huge investment that the scientific community has made to master the understanding of these equations .
Here you will find some of the resources that I found on the web that provide additional background on the Yule - Walker equations , their solutions , and the competing methods for the fitting of AR ( p ) models .
As usual , I give a brief introduction to the link and suggest how the material fits into our course , but , if you have the time , it is always best to let each article speak for itself .
Links suffice to get you to the good stuff , but for citation purposes you may eventually need complete references .
I am sure that you can get these when the need arises , so , for the moment , I take the liberty of being brief .
Eventually , I ( or a work - study student ! ) will flush out the incomplete references .

Car Buyer
There has to be some practice processes before you become a great car buyer really .
With all of that understanding different types of car and car markets really make you a pro in choosing and buying the best kind of cars .
New as well as used car research is quite a grand business .
One needs to be passionate about cars or at least interested in the greater details to become an expert .
This cannot be a process promised overnight though there are some really handy manuals out there in the market !
Here are six hot tips that will make you quite advanced in your area of car buying !
1. Determine the Practical Services that You Need from Your Car :
Determining our practical necessities from our cars really puts things into perspective .
You would not feel overwhelmed or bogged down when you finally get to car shopping and with the plenty of options around .
You must have a clear picture of what it is you are looking for in a car and why !
2. Determining Your Overall Budget :
This just does not mean car budget , mind you !
A good analyst who helps you in maintaining car budget or a professionally qualified car insurance dealer would be able to see you the whole picture of the total cost you derive from your car .
This mean along with the value you pay for the car , you have to include fuel , maintenance charges , insurance rates , etc .
The overall picture of values plus assets you derive from the car , gives you the full budget rate .
3. Test Driving Your Car :
Using your car for test drive should be one of the very first things you should be doing after choosing your car .
Most people do not test drive a lot .
Insist your company for longer extensions of test drive before plunging in .
Everyone likes to sell but very few offer value .
Take your time and allow yourself to ease into a car through real test driving .
4. Determining Your Emotional Needs :
Now it is really good to have a family car and reach a balance for this but if you are going for your own car , then you need to find the kind that really makes you happy when you are driving it .
The car should reflect your character and be an extension of your self .
Even in case of family car , strive to look for balance and harmony that totally determines the kind of family you have !
5. Test Driving Alone :
You have to test drive alone as you are relating to the car yourself .
You have to establish a solid relationship with the car you would drive regularly and so let that be completely your preference !
6. Use Internet Resources as Well as Visit Showrooms :
It is really important to compare different places and scan the market well in order to know what are on offer .
You do not want to buy in haste but grab the best deal !
So go ahead and utilize these processes .
Do n’t settle for anything less when you know that you can grab the best .
Do your researches well and then really get into working for them !
Three statesmen who oversaw the crumbling of the Berlin Wall 20 years ago gathered Saturday in Germany 's capital .
Former U.S. president George H.W. Bush ; the last Soviet leader , Mikhail Gorbachev ; and former German chancellor Helmut Kohl were honoured at a ceremony in Berlin marking the end to the concrete barrier that once snaked across the city .
Helmut Kohl , the first chancellor of reunified Germany , had a thorny relationship with the Soviet Union , a ceremony in which he partook Saturday heard .
(( Associated Press / Herbert Knosowski ) )
Kohl , 79 , who went on to become the first chancellor of a reunited Germany , appeared the most visibly moved by the moment , recalling the heady days that led up to the Nov. 9 , 1989 , collapse of the wall and Washington 's and Moscow 's willingness to let it fall .
" We achieved reunification together , with peace and freedom and with the support of our neighbours , " Kohl recalled .
" We do n't have many reasons in our history to be proud , " Kohl said .
" But those years when I was chancellor , ... I have every reason to be proud .
I have nothing better , nothing to be more proud of than German reunification . "
In his speech , Bush , 85 , said the wall 's collapse was possible because of people " who so long had to strive for their God - given rights . "
Gorbachev , 78 , recalled the efforts of the many political leaders who fought throughout the decades of the Cold War for reconciliation between Russia , Germany and the West in small steps and tiny concessions .
" How difficult it all was ! " he said , noting that even the initial working relationship between him and Kohl was thorny .
Gorbachev referred to his campaign in the 1980s of promoting economic restructuring and called on the U.S. to carry out its own set of reforms .
" America also needs a perestroika , " Gorbachev said , noting the push for change with the election of U.S. President Barack Obama .
" A lot will now depend on America .... Leadership will have to be proven . "
For 28 years , the divisive landmark split the German capital between parts held by East and West Germany and came to symbolize the barrier separating European communist countries from Western capitalist democracies .
East Germans were not allowed to leave their country without permission .
It 's estimated several hundred people were killed trying to escape to the West .
Mr Dzhugashvili's legal team argued that Stalin did not personally sign the warrants , that many of the people killed really were enemies of the state and that ill - wishers had besmirched the dictator 's image unfairly since his death in 1953 .
For the Oxford Union , the recent controversy over the BBC 's invitation to Nick Griffin to appear on Question Time is nothing new .
In 2007 , there was a similar eruption of moral outrage when then union president Luke Tryll invited Griffin to speak in a debate about freedom of speech , and I was assigned to debate against him .
The debate made headlines around the world .
A variety of senior politicians wrote angry articles complaining that by inviting Griffin we were legitimising him and his party .
The evening Griffin came he and the audience had to fight their way through hordes of screaming protesters to even get into the building .
Inside , I found myself facing a figure who in no way reflected his media image .
The most surprising thing about Griffin is how intelligently , and even normally , he comes across .
We , in common with most of the media commentators then and now , were expecting him to be a bitter , resentful , hate - filled Little - Englander who would stand up and rant about blacks , Asians and homosexuals .
His supporters certainly lived up to these expectations – one of his bodyguards actually told me I should leave the country and go back home ( I was born in South Africa ) .
Griffin , though , is much cleverer than that .
The Oxford debate was about the limits of freedom of speech .
Griffin gave an intelligent , thoughtful and well - researched talk about restrictions on free speech throughout western history , drawing on Voltaire , Locke and Mill .
He spoke about Galileo being persecuted by the Catholic church for his heretical scientific theories , and compared him to the modern far right , demonised and prevented from speaking by a liberal metropolitan elite , blind to the fact that its principal concern – the alienation of the white working class from the political process – is a real , and dangerous , problem .
He drew a picture of a middle - class establishment concerned only with London and the south - east , and desperate to marginalise those sectors of society they considered un - PC .
His speech was accompanied by the low , rhythmic sound of chanting coming from the protestors outside : " Kill Tryll , Kill Tryll , Kill Tryll , " they chanted in impeccable Received Pronunciation .
To most of the audience in the room , it was they who sounded like the extremists , and Griffin who appeared the voice of reason .
Yet when I pushed him to talk about race , challenging him to really compare his views on blacks , Asians and homosexuals to Galileo 's theories on heliocentrism , the facade broke down .
Under pressure , not from an angry rabble but from a small squad of world debating champions , he reverted to snarling , racist type .
He claimed that in the north of England gangs of Asian men roamed the streets kidnapping and raping white girls .
He claimed that most non-white immigrants would welcome repatriation to their ancestral homelands .
He demanded an end to mixed - race marriages , and questioned the accepted history of the Holocaust .
Under a barrage of criticism and probing questions , his false air of respectability disappeared , and he revealed the racist reality that he prefers to keep hidden .
And herein lies the lesson for Jack Straw , Sayeeda Warsi and Chris Huhne .
The way to beat Griffin is to force him to talk about the issues and policies he does n't want to talk about .
He will not , as is sometimes assumed , politically hang himself if merely given enough rope ; the panelists and audience will have to do it for him .
On Question Time , he will try to speak the same , reasonable - sounding language he spoke at the Oxford Union ; as we did in 2007 , the panelists must force him to speak the angry , racist language of demagoguery that he prefers to keep for BNP supporters ' meetings .
Or , failing , that , they should just stick a camera in front of his bodyguards .
From the ' First in Africa , now in the U.S ' files :
A few weeks , back IBM and Canonical ( the lead sponsor of Ubuntu Linux ) announced a plan to deliver Linux desktops and software to Africa .
At the time , I questioned why the offer was n't being made available in the U.S .
That changes today as IBM and Canonical are now announcing the launch of Linux and cloud - based desktop software in the U.S .
The effort was originally announced more than a year ago , in August of 2008 as the Microsoft - Free PC effort .
The basic idea is to have an Linux OS , with IBM smart client applications called Open Collaboration Client Solution software ( OCCS ) ( Lotus Symphony and Notes ) for enterprise apps .
The solution that has now been announced for the U.S , leverages the IBM Client for Smart Work which includes the same set of IBM 's collaboration software .
As to why IBM is marketing the solution to the U.S now , the answer is simple : Windows 7 .
IBM and Canonical in their press release have stated that the cost of migrating to Windows 7 will be as much as $ 2,000 for most PC users , with hardware accounting for much of the expense .
Linux ( and specifically Ubuntu ) together with the IBM software is according to the two partners , cheaper to deploy .
Gratitude and Grief
As Ahmed , my brother - in - law , limped out of the Islamabad Airport Thursday evening , his appearance alone was enough to relay the ordeal he had endured just one day earlier in Kabul .
His ears and hands were burned , his cheeks bruised .
The usually care - free Ahmed had escaped death twice during the two - hour gun-battle between the three Taliban suicide bombers and security forces early Wednesday morning .
From a nearby window , Ahmed watched as the attackers mowed down no fewer than eight people including five foreign U.N. staff .
Then , as he made his escape from the building , Ahmed found himself caught in a rain of deadly shrapnel after one of the attackers blew himself up .
Only minutes earlier , Ahmed had locked himself in his room , despite pleas from two other residents to run for his life .
But within minutes , the room caught fire , and he exited the rear of the house for safety , with no way of knowing that he was jumping from the pan into the fire .
Mistaking him for a militant accomplice , Afghan police began to chase him , shooting their guns at him .
He survived the gunfire but officers managed to catch up , pouncing upon him like starving dogs , and bundled him off to one of the intelligence facilities .
Ahmed , distraught , has been rendered nearly mute from this traumatic experience .
For now , he refuses to divulge what happened to him during the few hours he spent under interrogation , but his bruised and swollen face says it all .
Luckily for our family , one of Ahmed ’s colleagues saw him being grabbed by Afghan security officials .
This eyewitness account helped his employers locate and win him freedom by verifying his identity after hours of being held .
Sensing imminent death , Ahmed had made frantic calls while he was locked in that room to my sister telling her that he was trapped and that she should take care of their three kids .
He also phoned his brothers in Peshawar , telling them that his time was up and asked for forgiveness " If I ever offended you . "
But soon after his cell phone connection was lost and the entire family here in Pakistan had almost given up hope until his employers called to say that they had retrieved him from interrogation and he was OK .
This information came roughly five hours after he made his last call .
He is now resting at home .
October 28 turned out to be an equally gory day for hundreds of people of my birth place — Peshawar .
Only about two weeks after killing approximately 50 innocent citizens at the city center , terrorists targeted yet another market , crowded with women and children , with at least 150 kg of lethal explosives laden on a car ; the carnage left over 100 dead , mostly women and children .
Two of my close relatives barely survived the fatal attack and lost their shops and all the merchandise within .
In another attack on a bus stop at the crowded Soekarno Square two weeks earlier , my cousin ’s mother - in - law suffered injuries .
It was a day both of great personal gratitude and of immense grief ; gratitude because my brother - in - law returned from Kabul in one piece , albeit shaken and horror - struck .
Grief because the ugly minds and hands behind his ordeal — and behind the two deadly Peshawar attacks on women and children — make no distinction between innocent civilians and the ones hunting them — military security forces .
It is very likely that the attacks in Kabul and Peshawar — occurring within three hours of each other — were timed with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’s visit to the Pakistani capital .
In response to the attacks in Kabul , Clinton struck a defiant note , issuing a statement condemning the terrorists , calling them " cowardly . "
Such defiant and rhetorical statements by U.S. and Pakistani leaders alike notwithstanding , the bitter reality stalking the roads in Peshawar and elsewhere in northwestern Pakistan , denotes the growing menace of ideologically - driven terrorists who use the name of Islam to wreak death and destruction .
So far this year , terrorists have carried out dozens of suicide attacks , and acts of terror that have killed and maimed hundreds of Pakistanis .
In October alone , faceless terrorists have struck at least 10 different locations in northwestern Pakistan .
The pain and trauma these attacks are inflicting on people at large is immense .
The socio- psychological impact of the terror campaign — ostensibly conducted by the al Qaeda - inspired Tehreeke Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) and fuelled by speculation of other external factors gunning for Pakistan ’s mighty military establishment — is one of insecurity and uncertainty , the underlying current which constitutes an essential part of the terrorists ’ agenda ; create panic thereby destabilizing the country .
While people at large feel helpless , Pakistan ’s civilian state institutions have yet to match their response to the alarming level of threat .
The army continues its push against terrorist stronghold in South Waziristan , but the government lacks trust and authority among the people .
It has yet to devise a counter - terror strategy that reinstates public confidence in state institutions .
Someone asks Atli Mar Sveinsson if DUST 514 , the console shooter that will share a universe with sci-fi MMO EVE Online , will have character classes .
You know , like engineer , medic , or assault .
" That stuff is for computer games , " the game 's creative director says , dismissively .
" This is not a computer game .
This is a world .
If you want to be a medic , take some stuff with you . "
If CCP is different from other developers in one way above all others - and CCP is definitely different from other developers in more than one way - it 's philosophical .
And that philosophy can be boiled down to one central principle , pithily put by Sveinsson just then .
" This is not a computer game .
This is a world . "
So DUST 514 is more than it appears to be - which , on the surface , is a large - scale , strategic multiplayer FPS in the style of Battlefield .
Battlefield 2142 to be precise , not just because of the futuristic setting and vehicles , but also because victory hinges on the destruction of huge , mobile , airborne command points .
The comparison is exact , but also misleading , because Battlefield is just a computer game , and DUST 514 is a world - or rather , half of one .
The Command Pit is a lobby aboard the War Barge where players can assemble and plan ahead of a battle .
The other half is EVE , the immense , complex , political game of space trading and warfare that CCP has been running and steadily growing for some six years now .
EVE is unusual among MMOs in that it presents an undivided , " single - shard " world in which all 300,000 players can interact with each other on one giant server ; they all inhabit the same universe , New Eden .
DUST 514 will put console gamers in that same single universe , as mercenaries fighting for control of planet surfaces just as EVE 's spaceship pilots , organised into Corporations and Alliances , vie for sovereignty in space .
The two games will be linked , and the players of each will be able to interact - predominantly via CCP 's New Eden social network , which launches early next year - and join forces to influence events in the galaxy .
Initially , EVE players will be able to hire DUST players to attack planets or districts of planets for them , and players of both games will be able to join the same Corps and Alliances .
" The link is something we will expand over time , " says Sveinsson , mentioning the possibility that EVE and DUST players will eventually be able to walk around in the same social areas .
You 'll be able to watch Mobile Command Centres deploying from War Barges ' hangars .
But we 're getting ahead of ourselves , because EVE 's all - consuming social metagame will be introduced to DUST players - and indeed , to the game itself - gradually .
CCP is making DUST 514 in order to expand the appeal and player - base of its notoriously hardcore online world , but it understands it has to do so with care - both to avoid intimidating the new arrivals , and to avoid destabilising the economy and power structures enjoyed by its loyal EVE players .
" The majority of DUST players , at first , will not be engaged in the political arena , " says Sveinsson .
Instead , they will engage in a factional warfare system where it 's NPCs , rather than players , engaging them to fight .
" This is mainly for the new player experience and the first few months of DUST players ' lives , a training area in a way , " he says .
" We understand that EVE players do n't want total noobs in their world .
It 's also there to ensure there 's a battle to be had if you just want quick fun . "

The Wall Street Journal reports that the good times are rolling again :
Major U.S. banks and securities firms are on pace to pay their employees about $ 140 billion this year — a record high that shows compensation is rebounding despite regulatory scrutiny of Wall Street ’s pay culture .
…. Total compensation and benefits at the publicly traded firms analyzed by the Journal are on track to increase 20 % from last year ’s $ 117 billion — and to top 2007 ’s $ 130 billion payout .
This year , employees at the companies will earn an estimated $ 143,400 on average , up almost $ 2,000 from 2007 levels .
I sort of feel like I ’ve run out of things to say about this .
There ’s an insanity here that ’s almost beyond analysis .
Wall Street can spark an economic slowdown that misses destroying the planet and causing a second Great Depression only by a hair ’s breadth — said hair being an 11th hour emergency infusion of trillions of taxpayer dollars — and then turn around and use those trillions to return to bubble levels of profitability within a year .
And they can do it even though the rest of the economy is still suffering through the worst recession since World War II .
It ’s mind boggling .
Is there any silver lining here ?
Probably not , but I ’ll try : If Wall Street can shrug off the worst recession of our lifetimes as if it ’s a minor fender bender and get the party rolling all over again in less than 12 months , it means the next bubble is already in the works and its collapse will be every bit as bad as this one .
That in turn means it will almost certainly happen while today ’s politicians are still in office .
So maybe news like this will finally spur lawmakers to realize once and for all that the financial industry needs to be cut down to size .
Half measures wo n’t do it .
Self - regulation wo n’t do it .
Compensation limits wo n’t do it .
Byzantine , watered - down rules wo n’t do it .
Something like a Morgenthau Plan for Wall Street is the only thing that has even half a chance of working .
Will Congress finally get this ?
Probably not .
The financial lobby is just too strong .
But we can hope .

“ The real sky is knowing that samsara and nirvana are merely an illusory display . ”
Mipham Rinpoche , Quintessential Instructions of Mind
The Basic Steps to Star Gazing Meditation
Assume a comfortable meditative posture outside ( during the day or night ) .
Look outward at the sky – observe it and inquire about it .
Recognize it is vast beyond concept .
As mind observes the sky , look inward at mind – observe and inquire about it .
Recognize it is vast beyond concept .
With the understanding that both mind and universe are inconceivably boundless entities , allow their space to begin to merge .
Be one with the experience .
Rest in this natural , pristine awareness .
Sky gazing is consider an important meditation practice in the recognition of Dzogchen , the primordial state of pure awareness that is present in every sentient being .
If you would like to dive deeper into the theory and practice of Dzogchen sky gazing , then I also recommend you read Lama Surya Das ( an American - born lama in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition ) describing Dzogchen sky - gazing and the essential point of it in his talk on “ Sustaining Present Awareness ” .
Other than that , it is simply recommended that you spend your time practicing this meditation .
The sky itself can be quite mesmerizing , especially on a clear lit night with the stars , moon , satellites and all .
Allow yourself to become bewildered and awed by this marvelous spectacle that we so often take for granted .
In many ways , star gazing can become a process of psychological healing and can improve one ’s mental health by alleviating stress and making us more aware of our interconnectedness with everything in the universe .
Studies done by psychology researchers have also shown that when we spend more time with nature we improve our mood , cognition , and memory .
Spending time with nature is a great way to tune ourselves into our natural state of present awareness and see the bigger picture in life .

As Mr. Homme must have expected , lusty cheers arose in response to some of the titles he announced , like “ Mind Eraser ” and “ Dead End Friends . ”
This crowd was hardly fumbling through the dark , even if that would have fit the menacing bluster of the tunes .

Beyond that , what sort of surprise could this have been ?
Them Crooked Vultures is unswervingly faithful to its pedigree : along with Mr. Homme , best known as the frontman of Queens of the Stone Age , it features Dave Grohl , the former drummer in Nirvana , and John Paul Jones , the former bassist in Led Zeppelin .
That their output delivers a punch to the gut can only be seen as the fulfillment of a promise .
The band does n’t feel like naked derivation , but its parentage is hammered home with every fat and bruising riff .
Dozens of those cropped up in Thursday ’s show , which was all the better for it .
“ Nobody Loves Me and Neither Do I ” amounted to a Zeppelinesque bombshell of heavy - gauge blues - rock ; “ Scumbag Blues ” dropped some head - wagging funk , punctuated by a thumb - slapped bass interlude .
Image Josh Homme , also known as the frontman of Queens of the Stone Age .

“ New Fang , ” one of the more buoyant tunes , hinted at Southern boogie rock , with slide work by the band ’s rhythm guitarist , Alain Johannes .
In roughly every song there was a heavy emphasis on chromatic tension , offbeat syncopation and tyrannical propulsion ; Mr. Homme ’s guitar solos were mostly brief and to the point .

I do n’t usually post clips of myself when I go on TV .
But I ’m posting this one , where I talk about trying to get an abortion in Wisconsin and end up with a miscarriage at work instead .
It was a difficult interview , which is why I like it .
And , remarkably , I have good hair without trying , which is another reason I like watching the clip .
For those of you who have no idea what I ’m talking about .
Here ’s my twitter that caused uproar .
And here ’s my post about it .
To give you an idea of the recent coverage , here ’s the link that is , right now , on the front page of AOL , and here ’s a link to an article by Lara Salahi at ABC News — I really like that one .
If you are new to my blog , and you ’ve gotten this far , maybe you ’ll like staying here for a while .
Here ’s a good page to begin on : About this blog .
I know I said that that this week is Asperger ’s at work week on my blog .
Maybe me talking about my miscarriage to newscasters is part of this series .
I ’m not sure .
But I ’ve been learning a lot about women from the comments about the miscarriage twitter — on my blog and on other sites .
So I ’m sure that other people are learning a lot about the lives of women — at work and at home .
And that has to be good .

Fedora is a leading edge , free and open source operating system that continues to deliver innovative features to many users , with a new release every six months .
We have reached the Fedora 12 Beta , the last important development milestone of Fedora 12 .
Only critical bug fixes will be pushed as updates leading up to the general release of Fedora 12 , scheduled to be released in mid-November .
We invite you to join us and participate in making Fedora 12 a solid release by downloading , testing , and providing us your valuable feedback .
http://fedoraproject.org/get-prerelease
Of course , this is a beta release , some problems may still be lurking .
Should you trip across one of them , be sure it gets fixed before release by reporting your discovery at : https://bugzilla.redhat.com/
Thank you !
What 's New in Fedora 12 ? * Optimized performance - All software packages on 32 - bit ( x86_32 ) architecture have been compiled for i686 systems with special optimization for Intel Atom processors used in many netbooks but without losing compatibility with the overwhelming majority of CPUs .
There is a list of the rare CPUs which will no longer be supported .
* Smaller and faster updates - In Fedora 11 , the optional yum - presto plugin , developed by Fedora contributor Jonathan Dieter , reduced update size by transmitting only the changes in the updated packages .
Now , the plugin is installed by default .
Also , RPMs now use XZ rather than gzip for compression , providing smaller package sizes without the memory and CPU penalties associated with bzip2 .
This lets us fit more software into each Fedora image , and uses less space on mirrors , making their administrators ' lives a little easier .
Thanks to the Fedora infrastructure team for their work in generating delta RPMs .
* NetworkManager broadband and other enhancements - NetworkManager , originally developed by Red Hat 's Dan Williams , was introduced in Fedora 7 and has become the de facto network configuration solution for distributions everywhere .
Enhancements to NetworkManager make both system - wide connections and mobile broadband connections easier than ever .
Signal strength and network selection are available for choosing the best mobile broadband connection when you 're on the road .
Bluetooth PAN support offers a simple click through process to access the Internet from your mobile phone .
NetworkManager can now configure always - on and static address connections directly from the desktop .
Policy Kit integration has been added so configuration management can be done via central policy where needed .
IP v6 support has also been improved .
* Next - generation ( Ogg ) Theora video - For several years ,
Theora , the open and free format not encumbered by known patents has provided a way for freedom - loving users to share video .
Fedora 12 includes the new Theora 1.1 , which achieves near - H.264 quality , meeting the expectations of demanding users with crisp , vibrant media in both streaming and downloadable form .
Thanks to the work of the Xiph .
Org Foundation 's Christopher " Monty " Montgomery , sponsored by Red Hat , other Xiph developers , and the contribution of Mozilla.org , Firefox 3.5 can deliver free media on the web out of the box , using the Theora video and Vorbis audio formats even better than the previous release of Fedora .
* Graphics support improvements - Fedora 12 introduces experimental 3D support for AMD Radeon HD 2400 and later graphics cards .
To try it out , install the mesa - dri - drivers - experimental package .
On many cards , this support should allow desktop effects to be used .
Kernel mode setting ( KMS ) support , which was introduced on AMD hardware in Fedora 10 and extended to Intel hardware in Fedora 11 , is now extended to NVIDIA hardware as well , meaning the great majority of systems now benefit from the smooth , fully - graphical startup sequence made possible by KMS .
The Fedora graphical startup sequence now works better on systems with multiple monitors .
Also on multiple monitor systems , the desktop will now automatically be spread across all monitors by default , rather than having all monitors display the same output , including on NVIDIA chips ( where multiple monitor spanning was not possible without manual configuration changes in Fedora 11 ) .
Systems with NVIDIA graphics chips also gain initial support for suspend and resume functionality via the default Nouveau driver .
Initial support for the new DisplayPort display connector has been added for Intel graphics chips .
Support for Nvidia and ATI systems is already under rapid development and will be included in the next release of Fedora .
Thanks to the Red Hat Xorg team including Adam Jackson ( X server ) , Kristian Høgsberg ( Intel driver ) , Dave Airlie and Jerome Glisse ( Radeon driver for AMD ) , and Ben Skeggs ( Nouveau driver for NVIDIA ) .
* Virtualization improvements -
Not content with all the improvements in Fedora 11 , we 've kicked virtualization based on KVM up another notch in Fedora 12 .
There are extensive improvements in performance , management , resource sharing , and still more security enhancements .
A new library ( libguestfs ) and an interactive tool ( guestfish ) are now available for directly accessing and modifying virtual machine disk images .
* Automatic reporting of crashes and SELinux issues - Abrt , a tool to help non-power users report crashes to Bugzilla with a few mouse clicks , is now enabled by default .
Abrt collects detailed information automatically and helps developers identify and resolve issues faster , improving the quality of individual upstream components and Fedora .
The SELinux alert monitoring tool has also added the ability to report SELinux issues to Bugzilla quickly and easily with just a couple of clicks .
* New Dracut initrd generation tool - Up until Fedora 11 , the boot system ( initial ram disk or initrd ) used to boot Fedora was monolithic , very distribution specific and did n't provide much flexibility .
This has been replaced with Dracut , an initial ram disk generation tool with an event - based framework designed to be distribution - independent thanks to the Dracut team including Harald Hoyer , Jeremy Katz , Dave Jones and many others .
It has been also adopted by OLPC which uses Fedora ; OLPC modules for Dracut are available in the Fedora repository .
* PackageKit plugins - PackageKit now has a plugin which can install an appropriate package when a user tries to run a command from a missing package .
Another new plugin allows installation of software packages from a web browser .
Thanks to Red Hat 's Richard Hughes and the Package Kit team .
* Bluetooth on - demand - Bluetooth services are automatically started when needed and stopped 30 seconds after last device use , reducing initial startup time and resource use when Bluetooth is not in active use .
Thanks to Red Hat 's Bastien Nocera .
* Moblin graphical interface for netbooks -
The Moblin graphical interface and applications are fully integrated thanks to Peter Robinson , a Fedora Project volunteer , and others .
To use it , just install the Moblin Desktop Environment package group using yum or the graphical software management tools , and choose Moblin from the login manager .
A F12 Moblin Fedora Remix ( installable Live CD ) will also be available .
* PulseAudio enhancements - Red Hat 's Lennart Poettering and several others have made significant improvements to the PulseAudio system .
Improved mixer logic makes volume control more fine - grained and reliable .
Integration with the Rygel UPnP media server means you can stream audio directly from your system to any UPnP / DLNA client , such as a Playstation 3 .
Hotplug support has been made more intelligent , so if you configure a device as the default output for a stream , unplug that device -- causing the stream (s ) to be moved to another output device -- and later replug it , the stream is moved back to the preferred device .
Finally , Bluetooth audio support means pairing with any Bluetooth audio device makes it available for use through PulseAudio .
* Lower process privileges -
In order to mitigate the impact of security vulnerabilities , permissions have been hardened for many files and system directories and process privileges have been lowered for a number of core components that require super user privileges .
Red Hat 's Steve Grubb has developed a new library , libcap - ng , and integrated it into many core system components to improve the security of Fedora .
* SELinux sandbox -
It is now possible to confine applications ' access to the system and run them in a secure sandbox that takes advantage of the sophisticated capabilities of SELinux .
Dan Walsh , SELinux developer at Red Hat , explains the details at http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/31146.html
* Open Broadcom firmware -
The openfwwf open source Broadcom firmware is included by default .
This means wireless networking will be available out of the box on some Broadcom chipsets .
* Hybrid live images -
The Live images provided in this release can be directly imaged onto a USB stick using dd ( or any equivalent tool ) to create bootable Live USB keys .
The Fedora Live USB Creator for Windows and the livecd - tools for Fedora are still recommended for data persistence and non-destructive writes .
Thanks to Jeremy Katz . * Better webcam support - While Fedora 11 improved webcam support , in Fedora 12 you can expect even better video quality , especially for less expensive webcams .
Red Hat 's Hans de Goede , developer of the libv4l library , has more details on his continuous upstream webcam support enhancements at http://hansdegoede.livejournal.com/6989.html.
* GNOME 2.28 - The latest version of the GNOME desktop includes the lighter Gnote replacement for Tomboy as the default note application , and Empathy replaces Pidgin as the default instant messenger .
The new volume control application , first seen in Fedora 11 , has been improved to restore some of the popular functionality from earlier releases without making the interface too complex .
* GNOME
Shell preview - Fedora 12 includes an early version of GNOME
Shell , which will become the default interface for GNOME 3.0 and beyond .
To try it , install the gnome - shell package , and use the Desktop Effects configuration tool to enable it .
It will only work correctly from the GNOME desktop environment , not others such as KDE or Xfce .
This is a preview technology , and some video cards may not be supported .
* KDE 4.3 - The new KDE features an updated " Air " theme and fully configurable keyboard shortcuts in Plasma , improved performance and new desktop effects in the window manager , a new bug reporting tool , and a configuration tool for the LIRC infra-red remote control system .
*
Cool new stuff for developers beginning with Eclipse Galileo , which includes more plugins than ever before .
Perl 6 is now included , along with PHP 5.3 .
For Haskell developers , the Haskell Platform now provides a standardized set of libraries and tools .
But one of the biggest changes for developers is that most of the nice new features of Fedora 12 , from Bluetooth to WebCams is implemented through underlying libraries , and many of the improvements will be included simply by relinking your application .
Also available in this release are SystemTap 1.0 for improved instrumenting and debugging of binaries , complete with Eclipse integration , and the newest NetBeans IDE for Java development .
*
Cool new stuff for sysadmins includes added functionality for clustered Samba services ( including active / active configurations ) over GFS2 ; and the ability to boot a cluster of Fedora systems from a single , shared root file system .
* Multi-Pointer X - The update to X. Org server 1.7 introduces the X Input Extension version 2.0 ( XI2 ) , with much work contributed by Red Hat 's Peter Hutterer .
This extension provides a new client API for handling input devices and also Multi-Pointer X ( MPX ) functionality .
MPX functionality allows X to cope with many inputs of arbitrary types simultaneously , a prerequisite for ( among others ) multitouch - based desktops and multi-user interaction on a single screen .
This is low - level work that applications and desktop environments will incrementally take advantage of in future releases .
More details are available in the Release Notes and in the XI2 tag of Peter Hutterer 's blog at http://who-t.blogspot.com/search/label/xi2

Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard says she is not offended by Opposition frontbencher Tony Abbott 's use of bad language to criticise her .
Leaving Federal Parliament on Thursday night , Mr Abbot said Ms Gillard had been sporting a " shit- eating grin " during Question Time .
Ms Gillard , who spent much of the parliamentary week defending the Government 's $ 16 billion stimulus spend on schools amid claims of mismanagement and wasteful spending , has laughed off the comments .
" Tony 's made a remark - he can explain it , " she said .
" Does n't particularly concern me .
I think I was doing what I normally do in Question Time , which is I spent a bit of time laughing and joking with some of my colleagues . "
Earlier , Government Minister Craig Emerson told Mr Abbott to focus on the economy instead of " hurling foul - mouthed abuse " .
This morning Mr Abbott 's boss , Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull , declined to condemn his colleague 's choice of words .
" Everyone expresses themselves in their own terms , but I 'll leave it at that , " he said .
It is not the first time Mr Abbott has courted controversy with his colourful language .
He infamously used the word " bullshit " when , as health minister in the previous Howard government , he responded to comments by Labor frontbencher Nicola Roxon criticising him for being late to an election debate .
It was all caught on camera and broadcast nationally .

A 37 - year - old teacher accused of creating a “ secret society ” to lure teenage girls into having sex with him was arrested Monday evening after a girl he allegedly wanted to recruit into the group complained to police , authorities said .
Robert Louis Rosseau taught Bible classes — among other subjects — to eighth - graders at Christian Academy of San Antonio .
Rosseau , who is n't certified by the state to teach , remained in Bexar County Jail on Tuesday on a charge of aggravated sexual assault of a child .
He was being held on $ 100,000 bail .
Jim Bazar , secondary principal at the Christian Academy of San Antonio , said Rosseau “ was terminated effective ( Tuesday ) . ”
“ He has not been on our campus for several weeks , ” Bazar said , adding the instructor was placed on administrative leave when the allegations were made early this month .
The principal said none of the alleged sexual acts occurred on campus and that only one of the three girls involved attends the school .
Authorities said Rosseau 's secret society , which included him and two of the girls , began to unravel last month , when the third teen balked at joining the group .
That teen told authorities that the two girls who were members of the society , which they referred to as an “ order , ” attempted to recruit her into the group on two weekends in September .
To become a member , the two girls told the teen , she had to be “ intimate ” with Rosseau to establish trust , according to an arrest affidavit .
The teen 's resistance led to a fight Oct. 5 with the two girls , who allegedly attacked her after she tried to reveal the relationship to classmates at a local high school , which was not named in the affidavit .
Police were called to the school , and that 's when the girl told authorities that Rosseau was trying to enlist her into the order and accused the teacher of having sex with the other two girls , the affidavit states .
The teen said the other girls told her that Rosseau had seen both of them nude , adding “ this was a part of the trust that was needed for the ‘ order ' to operate , ” the affidavit states .
She also told authorities that the girls told her that Rosseau was in a lot “ of pain ” because she would n't join the group .
Initially , the two girls denied they were having sex with Rosseau .
But on Oct. 21 , one of the two told her parents that Rosseau had been sexually assaulting her since Jan. 9 , when she was 16 , according to the affidavit .
That teen told authorities she was persuaded into joining the order after being told it was “ geared to help mankind , ” the affidavit states .
She also acknowledged to authorities that she was encouraged to “ demonstrate her trust and strict adherence to the society by engaging in sexual intercourse with ( Rosseau ) , ” the affidavit states , and that a sexual relationship ensued .
The affidavit states Rosseau would read Bible passages to the two girls “ to legitimize his believed ability ” to have sex with them .
Rosseau told the two girls they would need to engage in sexual activity with him if they wanted to maintain their friendship , and the girls complied , according to authorities .
The first teen to join the group denied that Rosseau was ever sexually active with her and discontinued an interview with police Oct. 20 .
Police Department spokesman Matt Porter said the testimonies of the teen who refused to join the society and the teen who was allegedly assaulted helped provide evidence for authorities to arrest Rosseau .
Rosseau could face more charges , Porter said , as the investigation continues .
I do n't know if it 's a competition , or some crazy way to recover experimental chips — but LG is on a global hunt for 5 of its Chocolate phones .
They 've placed newspaper ads across 12 countries with specific serial numbers :
If you 're listed , well I guess you have the golden ticket ( Willy Wonka , chocolate , see what I did there ? )
Anyway , you have until tomorrow to let LG know .
It all seems quite cryptic and strange .

We could find out about a week after the hunt closes .

There are some very serious problems with the X3 .
In semi-automatic mode while engaging multiple targets , it is very easy for the police officer to deliver either multiple shocks or even multiple prongs ( prongs ... this is what they call them .
I call them barbed meat - hooks ) into a single victim .
In fact , this happened at the above mentioned gala in Arizona .
Semiautomatic Mode :
... Every trigger pull will deploy a Smart Cartridge until all the loaded have been deployed .
This happened during the Master Instructor training program .
While demonstrating and teaching tactical operations of the X3 , an experienced TASER ECD instructor deployed X3 probes into a Master Instructor candidate .
The X3 was in the semiautomatic mode .
After telling the candidate to move , the instructor pulled the trigger to reenergize the ECD .
The candidate was struck with the second set of probes and reenergized through the first set of probes ( recall the X3 was in semiautomatic mode ) .
Yes , you could hear the candidate 's loud objections throughout the building .
After a very sincere apology , the instructor gave the candidate two " Challenge Coins " - one for each deployment .
Police & Security News ( p.55 )
The article goes on to report that the settings are confusing and it would be easy for an officer in the field to make this same mistake .
The problem is that in the field , the target might not be a healthy police officer but a member of a " High Risk Population " .
This is double speak for " pregnant , infirm , elderly , small children or low body mass persons " .
The X3 instruction manual cautions users that these people may have a greater risk of serious injury or death from the use of an ECD .
The X3 manual also warns users to " avoid intentionally targeting the head , throat , known preexisting injury area , chest area or genitals without legal justification " .
The instructors also advise that when shooting people in the back , to avoid the neck and head areas .
If Master Instructors cannot operate this torture device at a sales convention , it is highly unlikely that a cop on the beat under stress can .
If deployed the list of deaths will continue to grow .
July 1 , 2009
The total number of people on this list who died after they were tasered has risen dramatically by 18 , from a total of 415 yesterday to a revised total of 433 today .
~ TNT - TRUTH ... not TASERS
Of the 152 Taser - related deaths documented by Amnesty International : o Most of those who died in custody were unarmed and were not posing a serious threat to police officers , members of the public , or themselves
o Those who died were generally subjected to repeated or prolonged shocks
o Use of the Taser was often accompanied by the use of restraints and / or chemical incapacitant sprays
o Many of those who died had underlying health problems , such as heart conditions or mental illness , or were under the influence of drugs
o Most of those who died went into cardiac or respiratory arrest at the scene
If this topic is of interest to the community , I will publish another story about how these damned things kill , the training of police public affairs officers on how to use double - speak with the press , and bogus medical conditions like " Excited Delirium " used by the TASER industry to avoid responsibility for many TASER deaths .

FluidHtml selected as one of the top 50 technologies of 2009
MG Siegler - Adobe ’s
Flash product has obviously been an integral part of the web for many years now .
But it still has a major weakness when it comes search engines and complexity .
While Adobe and others have been working on solutions to make Flash - based website more Google - friendly , they ’re still nowhere near as crawl - able as regular HTML - based pages .
FluidHTML or “ Fhtml ” is a new server - side markup language that hopes to merge Flash - like functionality with the easier - to - use HTML language .
Obviously , trying to create what would essentially have to be a new web standard is no small task .
But the group behind Fhtml thinks they have a shot to do it because Flash is so widely used by millions of sites on the web who want a better visual appearance than HTML can offer .
Aside from just Flash , Fhtml is also going up against Silverlight another Adobe framework , Flex .
But Fhtml claims to be not only simpler than both Flash and Silverlight , but more powerful than Flex .
Another downside to Flex , Silverlight , and Flash is that they all must be compiled .
Fhtml , like HTML , does not need to be .
This makes it a lot easier to edit on the fly .
And because all of those are more complex , they often require a special developer with just those skills to create a site using those technologies , Fhtml promises to be much simpler .
And because it ’s server side , the company says that Java developers , PHP developers , Ruby developers , .NET developers and Python developers can all write Fhtml in their native language .

La capital del país no estuvo siempre en el Distrito Federal .
En distintos momentos de su historia reciente hubo que trasladarla a ciudades como San Luis Potosí o Guanajuato .
La toma de Zacatecas fue clave en el triunfo de la Revolución .
El recorrido une tres enclaves históricos que vivieron su época de grandeza bajo el brillo de los preciosos metales que ocultaba su subsuelo .
Guanajuato , entre dos alturas
Es una de las ciudades más sorprendentes de México .
Declarada Patrimonio de la Humanidad en 1988 , Guanajuato está construida en dos niveles .
La calle subterránea , antiguo cauce del río , cuenta con 23 túneles y supera los mil metros de longitud .
Esta arteria , que atraviesa el casco antiguo de la ciudad , fue inaugurada en 1964 y es la vía más aconsejable para recorrerla en coche , pues el centro histórico , en la superficie , es exclusivamente peatonal .
Tiene accesos tanto peatonales como vehiculares y sus paredes se han aprovechado para la construcción de algunas viviendas .
La ciudad " donde abundan las ranas " , como dice su nombre en tarasco ( " quanas " = ranas ; " huato " = montañoso ) , experimentó su máximo esplendor durante la colonia española , gracias al auge minero desarrollado entre los siglos XVI y XVIII .
Más adelante sería clave en la lucha por la independencia - aquí se acuñó la primera moneda insurgente en 1810 - , y en 1858 fue capital provisional de la República bajo el gobierno de Benito Juárez .
El Monumento al Pípila homenajea a un héroe de aquella lucha , Juan José Martínez , el Pípila , quien prendió fuego a la alhóndiga , el granero municipal que servía de arsenal a los españoles ... con éstos dentro .
La estatua , que incluye un mirador de 360 grados , ofrece una privilegiada panorámica de toda la ciudad .
En la parte más antigua de la localidad destaca la cantera verde de la Universidad , fundada por los jesuitas en 1732 como hospicio donde formar a la juventud y que adquirió rango universitario en 1945 .
Muy cerca se levanta el Teatro Juárez , de estilo mozárabe e inspirado en la Alhambra de Granada , en cuya escalinata se reúne la estudiantina los viernes y sábados por la noche .
Entre curioso y chocante resulta escuchar " Málaga , bonita Málaga " a nueve mil kilómetros de distancia .
Una cita cultural imprescindible y de gran renombre es el Festival Internacional Cervantino , que se celebra cada mes de octubre desde 1972 y reúne en Guanajuato a destacados representantes de la cultura iberoamericana .
Los más morbosos no pueden dejar Guanajuato sin visitar su famoso Museo de las Momias , con más de 100 cuerpos momificados de forma natural que fueron encontrados en 1865 al hacer trabajos de ampliación en el antiguo cementerio .
Las exhumaciones continuaron hasta 1989 .
Zacatecas , vestigio de una época plateada
Siguiendo hacia el norte se llega a Zacatecas , que en náhuatl significa « lugar donde abunda el zacate ( hierba , pasto , forraje ) » .
Aquí ya se empieza a percibir el paisaje y aroma que caracteriza al desértico norte del país , sembrado de rocas , cactus y típicos sombreros charros , imprescindibles para aplacar el inclemente sol .
Poblada por los primeros españoles en 1531 , no fue hasta quince años después cuando se descubrió que su subsuelo estaba cubierto de plata , lo que la convirtió en una de las ciudades más importantes de la Nueva España .
Vestigio de aquella época de esplendor es la Mina El Edén , cuyos 520 metros de profundidad suministraron auténticos ríos de tan preciado metal durante cerca de cuatro siglos ( hasta 1950 ) .
En la visita se puede aprender sobre las condiciones extremas que sufrían los indígenas esclavizados , aunque hoy en día su interior está especialmente habilitado para el turismo e incluso incluye una discoteca a la que se accede mediante un tren minero .
Por su situación geográfica la villa funcionó también como centro colonizador y evangelizador del norte del virreinato , y en 1585 recibió el título de " Muy Noble y Leal Ciudad de Nuestra Señora de Zacatecas " de manos del rey de España , Felipe II .
Muchos de sus edificios , en los que predomina la cantera rosa propia de la zona , son muestras vivientes de la riqueza artística de aquella época colonial .
Destaca la catedral , cuya fachada , extremadamente ornamentada , conforma el mejor ejemplo del barroco mexicano .
Varios de los antiguos monasterios franciscanos son ahora museos , como el de las máscaras Rafael Coronel , que ocupa el antiguo convento de San Francisco , el primero del norte de México ( siglo XVI ) , o el de su hermano Pedro Coronel , que alberga pintura contemporánea , litografías y objetos precolombinos y africanos .
Una versión sintetizada de la historia de Zacatecas se encuentra en el Palacio de Gobierno , ejemplo de la arquitectura civil barroca del periodo colonial .
Concretamente , en el mural que domina la escalera principal .
Y es que Zacatecas también fue clave en la Revolución Mexicana .
El 23 de junio de 1914 , Pancho Villa recuperó en un solo día la ciudad ocupada por el ejército huertista .
La gesta se interpreta en el Museo de la Toma de Zacatecas , en lo alto del Cerro de la Bufa , donde también se encuentra la Plaza de la Revolución , dedicada a los generales Francisco Villa , Felipe Ángeles y Pánfilo Natera .
Este cerro está unido al Cerro del Grillo por un teleférico que recorre la ciudad en 7 minutos con inmejorables vistas .
La rosa de México
Rumbo al este , a medio camino entre el bullicio de México D.F. y la industrial Monterrey , se encuentra San Luis Potosí , la rosa .
Como las anteriores , esta región estaba poblada por chichimecas , tribus errantes y rudas debido a las condiciones inhóspitas del lugar , por lo que tardó en ser ocupada por los españoles .
Los primeros en llegar , frailes franciscanos que lo hicieron hacia 1589 , fundaron varias misiones , como la de San Luis .
Los yacimientos de plata y oro descubiertos al tiempo atrajeron a innumerables colonos españoles , quienes bautizaron la ciudad con el sobrenombre de Potosí , en alusión a las gloriosas minas bolivianas .
Como Guanajuato , también San Luis fue capital provisional de México ( 1863 -1867 ) , cuando el emperador Maximiliano intentó gobernar el país en manos de los franceses y Benito Juárez se vio obligado a trasladar el Gobierno .
En la actualidad , el casco histórico ha sido restaurado y es un lujo pasear por sus amplias calles peatonales y admirar los edificios de cantera rosa , huella imborrable de la antigua majestuosidad del lugar .
La Plaza de Armas o Jardín Hidalgo comprende el Palacio de Gobierno , el Palacio Municipal justo en frente y la catedral .
Esta última , barroca en el exterior y neoclásica en el interior , es la única en el país que tiene 24 apóstoles .
En medio de todo ello , un kiosco de música rinde homenaje a ocho músicos mexicanos .
Uno de los puntos emblemáticos de San Luis Potosí es la Plaza del Carmen , escenario de todo tipo de eventos culturales y artísticos , y donde siempre pueden verse músicos y mimos .
El templo del mismo nombre , de mediados del XVIII , es un ejemplo del barroco estípite y presenta una fachada churrigueresca de factura indígena , con espectaculares retablos .
A unos pasos de allí se encuentra el Teatro de la Paz , uno de los más suntuosos de México , y en frente , el Museo Nacional de la Máscara , que alberga la colección más completa del país .
El recorrido muere en el punto exacto donde nació la ciudad un 3 de noviembre de 1592 : la Plaza de los Fundadores , espacio habitual de conciertos y exposiciones , que , además , acoge la Universidad .

n Media is the first company to deliver a mass - produced wooden case to our labs .
A mechanically - distressed finish adds to the HTPC 8000 's nostalgic radio look , with reduced production costs allowing for a mass - market - friendly $ 120 Web price .
A short 14.4in. depth allows the unit to sit on narrower shelves and tables compared to a standard hi-fi-style case , and its dimensions accurately replicate the scale of the old radios it resembles .
Likewise , its 19.7in. width and 11.0 in. height will look great anywhere !
Simulated speaker holes at the front offer intake ventilation , while a simulated radio - tuning indicator hides a mount for a digital - display panel , such as the nMedia part sold here .
The simulated knob is a stylish power button .
Casual glances may not reveal the DVD cover or button , but there 's nothing retro about the case 's memory card reader or front panel USB , eSATA , and FireWire ports .
Front - panel microphone and headphone mini- jacks are also of the handy , non-retro variety .
Anyone who does not get close enough to the front panel to notice the modern conveniences probably wo n't notice the clever Phillips # 3 top screws , which detract slightly from an otherwise stylish panel .
A 140 mm low - speed fan draws warm air out the back .
Reportedly manufactured by Dong Guan Hengli Hongsheng Electronics Factory ( UL E225507 ) , this 0.20A 140 mm fan is unlisted at the manufacturer 's site and its A14025L12S part number is n't carried by other suppliers .
A rack six inches above the motherboard supports four 3.5in. hard drives and one 5.25 in. optical drive .
There 's enough room beneath it for most CPU coolers , except for 120 mm tower - design coolers .
A card - reader and front - port connectors reside under the drive rack .
The HTPC 8000 supports full ATX and micro-ATX motherboards , with just enough room in front to support long graphics cards ( such as the GeForce GTX 285 ) in six of its seven expansion slots .

Sexy teenage witches or nature - worshipping environmentalists , not Republican politicians , serve as our popular images of contemporary Pagans .
But as fall campaigns for New York City ’s City Council heat up , a Republican candidate from Queens has been forced “ out of the broom closet . ”
Given that Republicans are typically linked with conservative Christianity , both the Neopagan community and some Republicans are a bit puzzled by Dan Halloran , who is running on Republican , Libertarian , Conservative , and Independence lines for City Council .
Halloran ’s campaign
Web site counters the assumption that Neopagans dress and act differently from other Americans .
Photos on his official site show a clean - cut and conservatively dressed Halloran speaking out against “ Obamacare , ” supporting youth baseball programs and the Boy Scouts , and presenting a Police Officer of the Month Award .
In contrast , the Queens Tribune story played up his alter identity as Pagan priest by running a photo from his page on the “ Paganspace ” Web site that shows a blue - robed Halloran kneeling before his ritual tools .
“ So , who do you think is going to win that City Council race between ‘ Democratic Victor ’ Kevin Kim and ‘ Pagan Lord ’ Dan Halloran ? ” asked Reid Pillifant in his story in the New York Observer on September 18 , 2009 .
A day earlier , a news story identifying Halloran as a King ( priest ) of Theodism , a form of Norse Paganism , ran in the Queens Tribune and attracted attention to Halloran ’s unorthodox religious identity .
Theodism is a branch of Heathenism ( also known as Norse religion and sometimes referred to as Àsatrù ) , one of the many religious traditions under the broad umbrella of Neopaganism , a religious movement that includes Wicca , Druidism , and other religions that recreate and reconstruct ancient pre-Christian traditions .
Halloran ’s identity may have surprised some New Yorkers , but local Republican party officials already knew about his involvement with Neopaganism before he was outed in the news .
In the media and in popular imagination , contemporary Pagans are often linked with progressive politics , sexual liberalism , environmentalism , the anti-war movement , gay rights , and other causes associated with the political left .
But in fact , Neopagans fall everywhere on the political spectrum , serve in the military and as police officers , and work in other professions that do not seem to fit their countercultural image .
For this reason , they appear in news headlines when their presence in certain realms of American life ( conservative politics In Halloran ’s case ) comes as a surprise .
In 1999 , Congressman Bob Barr ’s ( R - Texas ) highly publicized attempts to oust a Wiccan circle from a military base alerted the news - reading public to the fact that Neopagans were serving throughout the military .
More recently in 2006 , a group of Wiccans sued the US Department of Veterans Affairs in order to get Wicca ’s symbol , the pentacle , listed as an approved symbol for VA memorials .
For the past couple of decades , Neopagans have advocated publicly and vocally for religious freedom .
Conservative politics is just the latest foray in their ongoing campaign to be taken seriously as full participants in American religious , cultural , and political life .
“ I believe in God , ” said Halloran in an October 1 story in the Queens Chronicle : “ Faith is a cornerstone of my life . ”
Responding to his critics , he described his Catholic upbringing and avoided discussing his Pagan identity , calling for his opponent “ to disavow the Queens Tribune ’s attack on religion .
I am running a campaign on the issues . ”
But Halloran has another history that seemingly contrasts to his current political campaign : an earlier stint in the New York Police Department , and his career as an attorney .
He received his BA from the City University of New York in History and Anthropology , and conducted archaeological field research in Ireland on the Norman and Viking periods .
Like many Neopagans , who tend to read more and have higher levels of education than the average American , Halloran was drawn to the mythology and lore of ancient cultures that exposed him to an entirely different religious world than the one in which he was raised .
Halloran ’s particular fascination with ancient Germanic culture led him to Heathenism , a branch of contemporary Paganism devoted to the beliefs and practices of Northern European cultures .
Like other Neopagans , Heathens usually interact with a pantheon of deities and celebrate the changing seasons .
Many forms of Heathenism are also linked to ethnic European identities and draw from ancient Northern European texts for inspiration .
Adherents of Theodism worship deities , the land , and ancestors and value honor , oath - taking , family , and tribe .
Common ritual practices in Theodism include feasting , seasonal celebrations , and animal sacrifice ; all done as closely as possible to the reconstructed traditions of ancient Normans .
If feminist Witchcraft with its emphasis on egalitarianism and individual spirituality is at one end of the Neopagan spectrum , then Theodism ’s hierarchy and tribalism is at the other .
According to the Pagan Census ( 2003 ) , conducted by sociologist Helen Berger and her colleagues , followers of Norse religion tend to be slightly less politically liberal and slightly less supportive of women ’s issues than the general Neopagan population .
On Neopagan blogs , Halloran ’s political identity and representation of his faith have been debated since he made the headlines .
Some praised him for running as a Pagan in a party typically linked with conservative Christianity , while others criticized him for going on the defensive and asserting his belief in “ God ” instead of “ gods . ”
In a letter to The Wild Hunt , a popular Neopagan blog , Halloran clarified his response to the media : “ I honor my Ancestors and cling to my Hiberno - Norse Culture ’s Worldview .
I revere my God ( Tiw ) - and henotheistically I may add …
I have never hidden my religion — it ’s on my Facebook , in courts — judges and counsels in the Courts I practice are aware , I ’ve been the corporate counsel for a variety of pagan groups — and have lectured and discussed theology all over the U.S. ”
It would have been impossible to find a Neopagan like Halloran running for political office twenty years ago , when most Neopagans kept their identities carefully guarded for fear of losing jobs or child custody battles .
In neighborhoods all over the country , Neopagan communities have been treated suspiciously and outright persecuted by some Christian neighbors , law enforcement , and government agencies .
Since for many Americans , the Republican Party is inseparable from conservative Christianity , Neopagans were surprised that the party stood by Halloran , and took it as a sign that not only is the makeup of the religious left and the religious right shifting , but that the country as a whole is becoming more receptive toward their religion .

Grammy Award - winning hip - hop star Method Man turned himself in to authorities this morning after failing to pay nearly $ 33,000 in back personal income taxes , officials said .
The Wu Tang member — whose real name is Clifford Smith — walked into the Staten Island DA ’s office at about 8 a.m. to face felony charges in connection with neglecting to pay $ 32,799 dating back to 2004 , according to DA Daniel Donovan .
The investigation was conducted by the DA ’s office and the state Department of Taxation .
“ Failure to properly report and pay your taxes is a crime against all citizens and will be aggressively investigated and prosecuted , ” said Donovan .
Authorities said the rapper , who lives on Staten Island , had failed to pay taxes for three years .
Sunlight streams through the upper windows and domes , creating shadows across the vaulted ceiling and the aisles , arches and floor .
The alternating areas of light and shadow , and the complex combination of vertical , diagonal and curved lines , lead us deeper into the scene .
Panini has beautifully captured the church ’s lavish decoration , from the ornate gilding of the ceiling and the elaborate design of the floor to the sculpted figures that adorn the upper arches .
Panini specialised in architectural views and painted about 30 pictures of the monumental interior of St Peter ’s Basilica in Rome over several decades .
This is a view of the main entrance , looking down the nave towards the tomb of Saint Peter .
We look out over the church from an elevated positioned , with figures scattered across the vast tiled floor beneath us and piers and arches soaring above .
Panini specialised in architectural views and painted about 30 pictures of the monumental interior of St Peter ’s Basilica in Rome over several decades .
This is a view from the left of the main entrance , looking down the nave towards the east end and high altar .
At the far end is Gian Lorenzo Bernini ’s famous sculpted bronze canopy , erected between 1624 and 1633 over the tomb of Saint Peter .
The basilica is an enormous building , and the viewpoint Panini has adopted here emphasises its scale and the splendour of the architecture .
We look out over the church from an elevated positioned , with figures scattered across the vast tiled floor beneath us , and piers and arches soaring above .
Panini has manipulated perspective to create a dramatic effect in his painting : the angle of vision is far wider than the human eye would be able to see in one glance .
Sunlight streams through the upper windows and domes , creating shadows of varying depth across the vaulted ceiling and the aisles , arches and floor .
It is these alternating areas of light and shadow , and the combination of vertical , diagonal and curved lines , that lead us deeper into the scene .
Panini has beautifully captured the church ’s lavish decoration , from the ornate gilding of the ceiling and the elaborate design of the floor to the sculpted figures that adorn the upper arches .
Among the visitors you can see a cardinal in red with his party just right of centre , surrounded by members of various religious orders and lay people who kneel in prayer .
Around the dome at the end of the central nave you can make out part of the Latin inscription , which in full reads ‘ Of the Heaven , thou art Peter , and upon this rock I will build my Church ’ , the words of Christ taken from the Gospel of Matthew .
The circular emblem set into the vaulted ceiling is inscribed in Latin , ‘ Pope Paul V , 1615 ’ , while other inscriptions above the doors at the right refer to Pope Innocent IX , who served during the late sixteenth century , and Pope Innocent XIII , who served from the early eighteenth century .
This painting is large : it measures 1.5 metres high by just over 2 metres wide .
It seems to be derived from an earlier version of this scene , now in the Louvre , Paris , which was commissioned in around 1730 by Cardinal de Polignac , French ambassador to the Vatican .
The pictures Panini made of St Peter ’s Basilica were fine mementos for visiting tourists , but also serve as historical documents recording architectural changes to the building between the 1730s and early 1750s .
In spite of Panini ’s signature , which appears here on the base of the pier at the extreme left , this painting was probably made with much assistance from his studio .
I say “ default editor ” in quotes because Gentoo really does not have a default editor , but rather a fallback - editor for whenever the users had n’t chosen one themselves .
And this is why stuff like the stage3 , sudo , openrc and so on default to that when $ EDITOR is unreliable ( that is , until we can move to a full - fledged wrapper script ) .
Paul , in the previous post explained it quite well , albeit briefly , but since some other people asked me about that again , I ’ll quote him and then go in a bit more of details :
… Third nano was kept as the default because it is small , straightforward , and easy to get out of when you do n’t know it ( let ’s face it neither vi(m ) nor ( x ) emacs is that easy to get out of ) .
Fourth , by having the EDITOR / VISUAL variables point to nano ( which is installed by stage2 as well as stage3 ) things would be working ( although probably not optimal ) out of the box . …
Indeed Paul speaks well : neither vi ( or vim ) nor emacs ( or xemacs ) is going to work .
Why is that ?
Some people even goes as far to say that “ it ’s called * vi*sudo “ and “ vi is the default Unix editor ” .
At the same time , I would n’t be surprised to hear “ Emacs is the default GNU editor ” .
Well , let ’s decompose it in two different problems .
Technical problem : the system set is messy already ( and this is also “ thanks ” to my own pambase creation — which is , though , a solution to a previous problem ) .
The packages that do enter the system set should be , whenever possible , small and with little dependencies .
This includes , obviously , USE - optional dependencies , since when they are enabled , the dependencies also become part of the system set ( like it happens with gnome and pambase ) .
The dependency tree of nano is near invisible , while those of both vim and emacs are quite long ( sure there are things like elvis , nvi , zile and jove , but this will bring us to the next point … ) .
Reality problem ( or flame - retardant method ) : there is no way on Earth that any average number of people will be accepting to use the same editor as default , when taken from the list of “ most popular ” editors .
Hey we cannot even find consensus among the three developers of lscube ( I ’m using Emacs – yeah I ’m an Emacs user , burn me – and my colleagues using VIM and Eclipse ) .
If we were to choose vim , all Emacsen users will complain , if we were to use GNU Emacs , both vim and XEmacs users will complain , and so on so forth .
So we use nano , which is likely to make unhappy the most people , but all in the equal amount .
There ’s a corollary to the reality problem above : if we were to choose any of the lightweight variants that I named above , or more of them , most likely the problem would be more or less the same , since almost all people would be pretty unhappy with the choice and would then unmerge that and install their editor of choice .
But it would most likely upset the two “ main factions ” unequally , which would make one feel discriminated against .
Newbie problem : finally , there is another note : both Emacs and VI ( and respective clones ) are n’t exactly the most user - friendly editors .
A newbie user who has no clue how to work in Gentoo is unlikely to guess at first sight how to use either of them , while nano is pretty much the easiest thing you might find around .
You can fight as much as you want about powerfulness ( Emacs and VI are obviously much more powerful than nano ) and you can fight about relative easiness of use ( :w versus C-x C-w ) but nano is going to win over both of them in that regard .
So no , we ’re not going to change the default anytime soon .
Sol Campbell 's much publicised stay with League Two Notts County has ended after one appearance , it was reported last night .
The former England centre - back is said to have told the club that he wants to leave after making his debut in a defeat at Morecambe on Saturday .
Campbell joined County last month on a four - year deal , with an option for a further year to be added , having agreed to join an ambitious project headed by his former international manager Sven - Goran Eriksson .
He finally made his first appearance at the weekend after working on his fitness and it appears it could also be his last .
It is believed that Campbell 's decision to walk away was made for sporting reasons , though County are said to want to try to persuade him to continue .
The player 's representative , Sky Andrew , has not been available for comment .
Oct. 22 , 2009  --
Nearly four in 10 parents do not plan to have their children get the swine flu vaccine this year , with doubts about its safety overwhelmingly cited as the chief reason , underscoring safety concerns as potentially a major impediment to vaccination efforts .
Other results in the latest ABC News / Washington Post poll buttress the point :
Three in 10 adults are not confident the vaccine is safe ( including one in three parents ) , and 22 percent believe it 's " very " safe .
These attitudes heavily influence intentions to get vaccinated , with views of the vaccine 's safety a stronger factor than the perceived risk of getting the flu itself .
Click here for PDF with charts and questionnaire .
Even though concern about catching the flu has risen sharply since August , only 35 percent of adults plan to get vaccinated ( including 2 percent who say they 've already done so ) ; 62 percent say they probably will not get vaccinated .
More parents , 56 percent , intend to have their children vaccinated ( including 4 percent who say they 've done so ) , but even among parents , 39 percent say they probably wo n't .
WHY NOT ? –
This poll asked those parents , open - endedly , why they do n't plan to have their children vaccinated , a robust approach because it does n't prompt for predetermined answers .
Far surpassing other mentions , 53 percent in this group raised safety concerns , citing worry about side effects or doubts whether the vaccine 's been sufficiently tested .
Far behind that reason , 18 percent of parents who intend not to have their children vaccinated said they 're not worried about the flu or do n't believe getting the vaccine is worth the trouble ; 15 percent said they do n't believe the illness is serious enough ; 3 percent were unsure about the vaccine 's availability ; and 1 percent were unsure about its cost .
The rest gave scattered other answers .
Swine Flu Vaccine : Parents and Kids
The outcome 's similar when comparing views of the vaccine 's safety with the intention to get vaccinated .
Among parents who are very or somewhat confident the vaccine is safe , 72 percent plan to get their children vaccinated .
By contrast , among those who suspect it may not be safe -- again , one in every three parents -- only 13 percent plan to get vaccinations for their kids .
Safety concerns likewise influence personal intentions .
Among people who are very confident about the vaccine 's safety , 60 percent plan to get it themselves .
Among those who are " somewhat " confident , this drops to 40 percent .
Among those less confident than that , a mere 6 percent plan to get vaccinated against the swine flu .
Worry about getting the flu , naturally , pushes intention to get vaccinated in the other direction -- up -- but less strongly .
In a statistical model testing these relationships , concern over vaccine safety and concern about getting the flu both independently predict intention to get vaccinated , but concern over vaccine safety does so with nearly twice the predictive power .
These results suggest that encouraging vaccinations depends not merely on warning people about getting the flu but as much on persuading doubters that the vaccine is safe .
It should be noted that vaccination intention is naturally based on current information -- how extensive and how serious people perceive the flu to be , what they 've heard about the safety of the vaccine and the need to get it , its availability and more .
If and when these change , intention to get vaccinated may well move too .
( The ABC / Post poll in August , for instance , found a sharp rise in intention to get vaccinated if people 's doctors recommended that they do so . )
CONCERN and RESPONSE –
As noted , concerns about getting the flu are up ; 52 percent in this poll are very or somewhat worried they themselves or someone in their immediate family will get the swine flu , up from 39 percent in August .
Many less , though , 21 percent , say this is something that worries them " a great deal , " possibly reflecting a sense ( or hope ) that , if contracted , the flu might be mild .
Concern , Vaccine Safety and Plans to Vaccinate
Concern is higher than for two previous incidents :
In March 2006 , 41 percent were concerned about catching bird flu ; in April 2003 , 38 percent expressed worry about getting severe acute respiratory syndrome , or SARS .
Worry about swine flu is considerably higher .
Among people who are very concerned about someone in their family contracting swine flu , 50 percent plan to get vaccinated ; this declines to 34 percent of those who are somewhat worried , about a quarter of those who are not too worried and a fifth of those who are n't worried at all .
There 's less of a relationship , though , between worry about contracting the flu and parents ' intentions to get their children vaccinated .
In another factor , faith in the ability of the federal government and local hospitals and health agencies to deal with an outbreak of swine flu remains high -- 69 and 79 percent are they 're confident in these entities , respectively , although much less are " very confident . "
People who are confident in federal and local authorities also are somewhat likelier to plan to get vaccinated , because they 're also more confident in the safety of the vaccine .
GROUPS –
There are some differences across groups , with plans to get vaccinated higher among older adults ( despite the government 's advice that younger people are at greater risk ) , and higher among better - educated adults ; 51 percent with post - graduate educations plan to get vaccinated ( or have done so ) versus 32 percent of those with less formal schooling .
One reason , again : Post - graduates are more apt to think the vaccine is safe .
Worry about someone in the household getting swine flu is 11 points higher among parents of children under 18 than among those with no kids at home .
Also , women are 17 points more apt than men to worry that they or someone at home may get swine flu , 60 percent versus .
43 percent .
Women are a bit more likely than men to plan to get vaccinated , but just slightly so , because they 're also 8 points less apt to be confident that the vaccine is safe .

SALT LAKE CITY --
One day after Latter - day Saint Church leader Elder Dallin Oaks spoke on religious freedom and discrimination following the passage of California 's Proposition 8 , a federal judge in San Francisco has refused to dismiss a lawsuit to overturn it .
We spoke Wednesday to people on both sides of the issue .
In his speech , Elder Dallin H. Oaks said , " We must not be deterred or coerced into silence by the kinds of intimidation I have described . "
Elder Oaks was referring to reaction following the passage of California 's Proposition 8 .
LDS meetinghouses were vandalized , LDS businesses were boycotted , and some church members lost their jobs , he says , because of the faith 's support of Prop 8 .
Will Carlson of Equality Utah says what Elder Oaks is talking about are two distinct kinds of discrimination .
Latter - day Saints have recourse under existing laws he says ; gays and lesbians do not .
" Unfortunately gay and transgender people can legally be evicted from their homes or fired from their jobs and have no recourse .
And , so , there is a real difference in the discrimination that one group may be facing , which is wrong and illegal , and another group that 's facing , that 's wrong and completely legal , " Carlson said .
Californians who were proponents of Prop. 8 had support from many LDS members in Utah .
Prop 8 proponent Keith Kuder says he understands Elder Oaks ' comments about discrimination .
" Right now , I feel I 'm taking a backseat in society because of my religion .
That is n't fair .
That is n't fair for what country I 'm in .
That is n't fair for the constitution that we have , " he said .
Wednesday , a federal judge in San Francisco said there are significant questions about whether Prop 8 discriminates against gays and lesbians in violation of the U.S. Constitution .
Will Carlson agrees .
" The question is , does this fundamental right that exists for Americans , apply to all Americans ? " he said .
The U.S District Chief Judge Vaughn Walker in San Francisco told attorneys that Prop 8 sponsors will need to show that allowing gay couples to wed threatens traditional male - female unions .

Today I read an interesting article in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists , addressing a way to slow climate change – reproductive rights .
A neglected climate strategy : Empower women , slow population growth .
Ms. Mazur presents an interesting case and analysis , one that I largely agree with .
However , I would like to see some more solid numbers behind this .
Even ballpark figures could give us an idea of comparative costs and benefits .
For example , earning a college degree typically results in almost double the lifetime income earned .
( $ 1.2 million to $ 2.1 million ) .
If smaller families equates to greater investment in children ( PDF ) , then having smaller families will lead to a more educated population , and a more educated population tends to lead to fewer children .
( This relationship is not necessarily causal , but countries with higher levels of education tend to have smaller families .
It could be because there is less need for extra hands “ on the farm ” per say , and is probably somewhat related . )
I would also have liked to see the cost of attaining the reducing in unwanted pregnancies ( lets assume it costs $ 5 / year , and at 200 million pregnancies , that would be $ 1 billion per year ) , then compare it to the benefits stated in the article : higher levels of education for the parent , reduced death from childbirth , lower risk of STD ’s ( assuming condom use or abstinence ) , lower levels of consumption and hence lower GHG emissions .
Now , since the focus is on climate change , I ’ll look at some numbers for carbon costs .
Today , the European Markets were trading at ~ 14 euros per ton ( ~$ 20/ton ) .
The EIA ( ~ 1/2 way down the page ) has for Africa listed current emissions of 1 metric ton per capita in 2006 , staying flat to 2030 .
China , by comparison is at 4.6 in 2006 , rising to 8.0 by 2030 .
Taking this 1 metric ton , and comparing it with the carbon markets , a reduction of 200 million pregnancies would cost $ 4 billion , or 4 times the cost of reducing unwanted pregnancies .
This number swells if you think of future projections .
Namely , if these reductions were all assumed for China alone in 2030 , it would be $ 32 billion assuming carbon prices remained at their current levels ( not at all likely ) , or about 32 times the cost .
Lets put this into perspective .
A quick look at a carbon offset aggregator ( Ecobusinesslinks ) , shows an average price of around $ 15.00 per ton through a variety of measures ( some such as carbon offsets through reforestation may not deliver , as carbon sinks need to remain in place for ~ 70 years to get their claimed value ) .
This generates around the same value as the market - based value above ( or ~ 4 – 32 times the cost of preventing unwanted population growth ) .
Similarly , a 277 kw system is projected to save 11.7 million tons of emissions over 25 years .
Taking about $ 1 per watt , this installation would cost $ 300,000 .
Over the 25 years , it comes out to about $ 39 per ton of emissions reductions ( or twice what carbon is currently trading for on the markets ) .
By doing this back of the envelope calculations , I believe I have made the case that Ms. Mazur ’s argument does hold up when some rough numbers are thrown in .
To address climate change , we should look at all solutions .
Addressing population growth is one way to do this , that may also have a multitude of other benefits , not strictly related to climate change alone .
WTF !
– Missing killer dolphins surface to fight Pirates ?
August 22 , 2009
Its 2005 , New Orleans has just been hit by Hurricane Katrina , and you ’re a Navy Commander charged with the duty of telling the President that uhh ….
somehow three dozen highly trained dolphins are lost …err , went rogue .
( Yes , highly trained dolphins )
Absorb the absurdity that is now floating around in your head and imagine the awkwardness of having to brief the President on this .
Fortunately , President Bush was in office and he ’ll believe just about anything …
Navy Guy : “ No , well you see … Mr. President , 36 killer dolphins abandoned their posts and escaped from the Gulf of Mexico . ”
Bush : “ GODAMN !!
SH*T !!!
Wait a second , did Rummy or Condey put you up to this ? ”
FACT # 1 – Dolphins have long been trained by the military
Ok back to reality , military animals have long been used by militaries all over the world .
The U.S. and Russian militaries have generally used them to find lost divers or to locate underwater mines .
Military dolphins are currently deployed all around the world , and have been used in many conflicts including the Vietnam and the First Gulf War .
Recently the use of military dolphins has expanded to include attack - and - kill missions .
The US Navy admits it has trained dolphins for “ light - offensive ” warfare ; which I interpret to mean dolphins were trained to swim into enemy waters with with signs / flags strapped to their dorsal fin containing anti-enemy propaganda and / or ethic slurs .
During Vietnam “ warrior porpoises ” were the centerpiece of the “ Swimmer Nullification Program ” , which protected strategic Vietnamese harbors against infiltration by enemy frogmen .
After detecting an enemy , they were trained to pull off his face mask and flippers , tear the air - supply tubes , and finally “ capture him for interrogation . ”
I do n’t know if that qualifies as “ heavy - offensive ” but it sounds awesome .
I contacted the Navy but they declined my request for an explanation , but they did not confirm nor deny the use of dolphins in “ heavy - offensive ” warfare .
FACT # 2 – Dolphins kill for fun , and have killed humans before
Dolphins are the only known animals other than humans that kill other species for pleasure or sport .
Scientists have unsuccessfully tried to find out why dolphins kill for fun but have narrowed it to two possible explinations - they kill to impress female dolphins , or they kill because they think its freaking hilarious .
In Vietnam , killer dolphins were actually responsible for the deaths of 40 Vietcong divers .
As one former dolphin trainer for the CIA put it , they were taught to kill , initially with knives attached to their flippers and snouts .
Later many dolphins were equipped with large hypodermic syringes loaded with pressurized carbon dioxide ; and when the needle was rammed into an enemy frogman the rapidly expanding gas would cause the victim to literally explode .
Awesome right ?
No , too much friendly fire .
Apparently an alarming number of dolphins ended up exploding by ramming each other .
FACT # 3 – Escaped Dolphins are armed & dangerous
The Navy has refused to confirm that any are missing , but do you think the Navy would really tell us if they ’ve misplaced 36 highly trained and armed dolphins .
Interestingly , intelligence gathered by experts close to the U.S. ’s marine fisheries service , who study the US navy ’s dolphin training exercises , have confirmed the dolphins escaped .
The missing dolphins were equipped with cameras and remotely fired ‘ toxic dart ’ guns .
The military planned on shooting terrorists and spies underwater .
FACT # 4 – Thousands of dolphins unite to stop pirate ship
Thousands of dolphins blocked the suspected Somali pirate ships when they were trying to attack Chinese merchant ships passing the Gulf of Aden .
The Chinese merchant ships escorted by a China ’s fleet sailed on the Gulf of Aden when they met some suspected pirate ships .
Thousands of dolphins suddenly leaped out of water between pirates and merchants when the pirate ships approached to board the Chinese vessels .
Either Aquaman is now working for the Chinese , or the dolphins are finally getting the Somalis back for all the years they dumped toxic waste into the ocean .
Conclusion & Hypothesis
Take a minute to process all that yummy ridiculousness floating around in your brain .
Did the Navy trained dolphins plan their escape ?
Let ’s see …they are super smart , and highly trained .
It is a little weird that none of the trained dolphins stayed .
Even weirder is that they escaped at precisely the time when the Navy was distracted by Hurricane Katrina .
Finally , I do n’t know if the AWOL dolphins were responsible for the hit on the Somali pirates , but the possibility ( however minuscule ) that they did is freaking awesome !!
More pictures of military animals , enjoy !

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy was killed when his helicopter crashed on top of a hillock in the dense Nallamalla forest .
The chopper was found nearly 24 hours after Reddy went missing .
Reddy , who was traveling with his Principal Secretary P Subramanyam and Chief Security Officer A S C John Wesley and pilots Group Captain SK Bhatia and Captain MS Reddy in the twin - engined government helicopter , had taken off from old Begumpet Airport at 8.35 am on Wednesday to Chittor district .
The four other passengers on board the helicopter have also been killed .
The helicopter carrying Reddy from Hyderabad to Chittoor on Wednesday deviated 18 km from its path towards east , near Rudrakoduru in the Nallamala forest range in Kurnool district , before it hit a cliff and crashed .
" The chopper hit the cliff , crashed and exploded .
All the five persons in the ill - fated helicopter were burnt to death , " state Finance Minister K Rosaiah and Chief Secretary P Ramakanth Reddy said in Hyderabad on Thursday .
Hailing him as a tall leader who brought tremendous development to Andhra Pradesh , the Union Cabinet condoled Reddy and announced a state funeral for him .
The chopper might have drifted from its path because of a large cloud formation due to inclement weather and ended up hitting the cliff , they said .
Except the tail portion , the body of the Bell - 430 helicoper of AP Aviation Corporation was reduced to bits and pieces in the mishap .
The helicopter crashed 10 km away from Rudrakoduru on a hostile terrain and army commandos had to slither down with the help of a rope from a rescue helicopter , they said .
" Initially , three bodies were traced and then the fourth one .
It took a while to locate the fifth body .
We have identified the bodies from the dresses , " Director General of Police S S P Yadav said .
The highly - charred and decomposed bodies of Reddy and four others were shifted to an Indian Air Force helicopter a short while ago and the chopper has lifted off from the Kurnool air base for its onward journey to Hyderabad .
" The national flag will fly at half mast in Andhra Pradesh on Thursday and Friday and all Central and state government offices in the state will remain closed on Friday , " Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni told media persons after the cabinet meeting .
The Cabinet meeting , chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , adopted a resolution highlighting various welfare schemes implemented by him during his first tenure as Chief Minister .
" He gave a new thrust to the women 's self - help group movement and made Andhra Pradesh the leading state in enrolment and empowerment of women , " it said .
Describing Reddy , a qualified doctor , as a " natural reformer and moderniser " , the resolution said the overwhelming support of the poor and the middle classes as well as those belonging to SC , ST and OBC people , ensured his victory in the assembly elections held in May this year , and enabled him a second term in office as chief minister .
" Reddy has passed away in tragic circumstances .
He was at the peak of his political career and popularity when the hand of fate intervened .
In his death , the country as lost an eminent political leader , an astute administrator and above all a friend of the poor and downtrodden , " it said , adding that the Cabinet has placed on record its deep sense of grief and loss and extended its condolences to his family .
The chief minister 's body will be kept at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium from Friday morning till about 1 pm to allow the general public and the political leadership to pay their last respects .
It will then be flown to his native village in Cuddapah district for final rites .
The wreckage has been located between Rollapenta and Rudra Koderu in Kurnool district .
The Indian Air Force had sent five choppers to the area , while some IAF personnel were reportedly airdropped on the hillock to reach the helicopter .
A top - level security source in New Delhi told rediff.com that one of the IAF choppers , which had located the missing helicopter , had informed the authorities that " the chopper was in a very bad condition .
Only the wreckage can be seen .
There is no human movement around the chopper " .
As the news of YSR 's death reached Hyderabad , scenes of mourning were witnessed across the city .
Hundreds gathered near his residence in Hyderabad and the state secretariat .
On Wednesday , soon after the CM 's chopper lost contact , multiple agencies of the state had launched a massive hunt to locate possible wreckage in the desolate terrain .
By evening , it had expanded into the country 's biggest - ever search operation with satellites in the sky joining remote sensing aircraft , fighter jets , unmanned aerial vehicles , troops on the ground and even barefoot deer - hunting tribals with bows and arrows .

In the wide world of supplements , vitamin D is the superstar .
For the last few years , this humble nutrient has been featured prominently in allopathic and alternative circles alike .
It has basked in the rays of media publicity , and has survived an onslaught of scientific scrutiny .
And while such widespread publicity is often good cause for skepticism in the realm of health and medicine , vitamin D appears to be the real deal .
Whether we`re talking about heart disease , cancer , diabetes , multiple sclerosis , or Alzheimer`s disease , the " sunshine vitamin " delivers benefits unseen before our time ( 1 ) .
Given the remarkably powerful benefits of vitamin D , many find themselves wondering how to actually go about obtaining it .
We know that vitamin D is good for us , but how much do we need , and where do we get it ?
Most people know that sunlight is somehow involved in vitamin D production , but is sunlight alone sufficient to produce the incredible results demonstrated by recent vitamin D research ?
What about supplements ?
There are so many different preparations - with doses ranging from 400 IU to 50,000 IU - that it can get a little confusing .
Are such supplements necessary , and if so , how much should we be taking ?
One might suppose that this question is as easily answered as saying , " Everyone needs to spend 15 minutes in the sun every day . "
Or , " Everyone needs to take x amount of vitamin D per day . "
But it`s not like that .
Not at all .
There are a multitude of variables unique tothat determine how much vitamin D is required on a daily basis ( 2 ) .
And because there are so many individual variables , it really is impossible to recommend a single amount for everyone .
Fortunately , however , there are many circumstantial clues to look for that will suggest whether you need to be paying better attention to your vitamin D status .
Furthermore , personally optimizing your vitamin D level is fairly easy and inexpensive .
Are you at risk for vitamin D deficiency ?
- How much sun exposure do you get every day ?
- Where do you live ?
Above or below the 35 N latitude line ?
( 3 ) - What is your age ?
Over 40 ?- Is your skin light , dark , very dark ? - Are you overweight ?
- Do you have a chronic illness ?
How do each of these factors affect vitamin D status ?
Catching some rays each day is definitely desirable , and healthy young people can usually get the vitamin D they need from around 10 to 30 minutes of sun exposure per day - depending on their location and the time of year .
Most adults in today`s modern world , however , do not even attempt to get this much sun exposure - much less achieve it .
But even if theywould it matter , or are there other variables standing in the way ?
Vitamin D is produced in the skin from a cholesterol derivative when we are exposed to UVB radiation from the sun .
However , because of the axial tilt of the earth , the further north one lives , the less the sun`s UVB rays will be able to activate vitamin D in the skin .
So sun exposure does not necessarily equal optimal vitamin D status if you`re living in the wrong location .
Living down south is better , of course ( south of the 35 N latitude line seems to be the best ) , but there is still more to consider .
Say you do live close to the equator , or are significantly below the 35 N latitude line .
That`s a good thing , and it probably helps .
If you`re around 35 - 40 years old or above , however , you`re likely losing the ability to activate sufficient levels of vitamin D in your skin , even in the unlikely event that you`re getting adequate UVB sun exposure ( 4 ) .
What if you have dark skin ?
If you have a lot of pigment in your skin , this is going to shield you from the UVB radiation you need , and you`re probably deficient in vitamin D.Vitamin D requirements are also relative to body weight .
If you`re overweight , your body requires more vitamin D than if you are not overweight .
If you get a lot of sun , but are on the heavy side , you`re probably still not getting enough vitamin D.Chronically ill ?
Have cancer ?
The body demands more vitamin D when you`re sick , and is probably using it up faster than you can get it from the sun .
When one considers that many Americans are victims of not just one but many of the above drawbacks , it becomes readily obvious as to why there is such a widespread vitamin D deficiency epidemic .
Not getting enough sun is bad enough , but lack of sun exposure combined with being middle - aged , overweight , and chronically ill is an absolute disaster - and it is the devastating situation that many ( most ? )
Americans find themselves in today .
Yes , sun exposure is a good thing , but too often , it`s simply not sufficient to achieve the kind of levels necessary for disease prevention and treatment .
This applies even in places like Hawaii , where individuals get plenty of sun exposure , and the latitude is around 21 ( 5 , 6 ) .
The role of sunlight should not be downplayed too much , however .
If you`re healthy , young , and live in a subtropical region , then you might have sufficient vitamin D levels .
In fact , some young people in the subtropics who get sun exposure all day long have levels between 80 - 100 ng / ml .
This is incredible , and it means that sun exposure really does work provided the conditions are right .
*The point being made in this article is simply that not everyone is young , not everyone is healthy , not everyone lives in Houston , and not everyone gets enough sun exposure every day .
It is those people who need to supplement with vitamin D . This also happens to be most people .
How do you know if you`re getting enough vitamin D , and how much is enough ?
Theway to know is by testing your blood .
Fortunately , testing vitamin D , as far as blood testing goes , is pretty cheap .
You can set this up with your doctor , order tests online and get blood drawn at a local lab , or order a vitamin D home test kit , whereby you simply order the test , prick your finger , send in the blood , and wait for the results to come back to you .
Here are some basic guidelines : - Make sure you are getting the right test .
You must test for 25 ( OH ) D,1,25 ( OH ) D .
They look similar , but 1,25 ( OH ) D is a measure of kidney function , and is not the test you want for measuring vitamin D levels .
- Ideally , your blood level should be around 60 - 80 ng / ml , as this allows the body to have some vitamin D in reserve , and it duplicates the higher levels found in young , healthy individuals who spend a decent amount of time in a sun-rich environment .
- Begin taking vitamin D at least eight weeks prior to being tested .
This will help you customize your dose once you receive your test results .
To determine a basic , starting dose , it has been suggested , as per Dr. John Cannell of the Vitamin D Council ( 7 ) , that you take 1,000 IU per 25 pounds of body weight .
A person who weighs 150 pounds , for instance , would take 6,000 IU per day as a starting dose ( 150/25 = 6 . 1,000 x 6 = 6,000 ) .
Do this for at least eight weeks , and then test .
Perhaps this dose will put you in the ideal range , but there`s no guarantee since we are all so different , and have unique vitamin D receptor genotypes .
The idea is to hopefully get somewhere in the ballpark with this method and then tweak your daily dose once the test results come back .
If your results are still suboptimal , Dr. Cannell has estimated that each 1,000 IU increase in supplemental vitamin D will generally produce a 10 ng / ml increase in the vitamin D blood level ( 8 ) .
For example , if you have been taking 5,000 IU per day for 8 + weeks , and your results come back at 40 ng / ml , you would want to increase your dose to at least 7,000 IU ( 2,000 IU = ~ 20 ng / ml rise in blood level ) to achieve a minimum of 60 ng / ml .
Again , keep in mind that this is necessarily generalized , and additional blood testing every several months is recommended to further customize the dose appropriate to you .
In order to achieve consistent and predictable results , it is important to use the proper carrier form of vitamin D supplements .
The absolute best form is an oil - based vitamin D preparation .
Dry preparations , like tablets and capsules , should be avoided .
Vitamin D is fat soluble , and needs to be taken with fat in order to be properly absorbed - hence the oil - based recommendation .
Oil - based versus dry preparations aside , there are two common types of vitamin D : Vitamin D3 ( cholecalciferol ) and Vitamin D2 ( ergocalciferol ) .
You will need to avoid supplementing with vitamin D2 ( 9 ) , which is a synthetic product made by exposing certain plants to ultraviolet radiation .
D2 is not what the human body naturally uses , and compared to D3 it falls far short in terms of efficacy ( of course , D2 happens to be what many vitamin D prescriptions are made of ) .
D3 is what your body uses and prefers .
No prescription necessary .
You can buy D3 in oil - based softgels , or , if you don`t like taking pills or have trouble doing so , you can get it in liquid drops .** Vitamin D status is important year around , but whenever fall and winter are upon us , the importance of evaluating this vital nutrient is even more urgent .
In summary , here are the steps you should take if you are wanting to optimize your vitamin D level : 1 ) Start taking oil - based vitamin D3 according to your body weight , as explained above .
2 ) After at least 8 weeks , have your blood tested by a good lab .
There are home finger - prick test kits that are also very good .
3 ) Remembering that the goal should be blood levels of 60 - 80 ng / ml of 25 ( OH ) D , adjust your vitamin D3 dose to achieve this level .
Each 1,000 IU increase will generally lead to a 10 ng / ml increase in blood levels .
4 ) Recheck blood levels every several months to make sure you are still in the optimal range and taking the proper dose .
* It is beyond ironic that for quite some time now , everyone has been encouraged by the " authorities " to avoid the sun in order to keep from getting cancer , yet it isthat would help in avoiding cancer in the first place !
" Avoid midday sun , or you`ll get melanoma ! " we`re told .
But melanoma is mostly triggered by UVA rays from the sun - UVB .
When is cancer - causing UVA exposure the lowest ?
Right aroundWhen is UVB exposure the highest ?
Also right around midday .
A high UVB : UVA ratio ( high UVB and low UVA ) is the best for creating vitamin D in the body , and this occurs when the sun is highest in the sky - exactly the time ( ironically ) that is often suggested to be avoided .** Supplementation is not recommended for everyone .
Certain conditions , such as sarcoidosis and some lymphomas , can produce excessive amounts of vitamin D , and in these instances , one should move forward cautiously under the supervision of a healthcare professional .

The Maryland Zoo spent $ 500,000 to make an escape - proof prairie dog habitat , called Prairie Dog Town .
The prairie dogs escaped within 10 minutes of being introduced to their new habitat .
Zookeepers caught the escaped prairie dogs with nets .
Aircraft wire , poured concrete and slick plastic walls proved no match for the fast - footed rodents , the stars of a new exhibit that opens today .
As officials were promoting the return of the zoo's 28 prairie dogs – their former digs had been out of sight in a closed section of the animal preserve for more than four years – some of the critters found ways to jump , climb and get over the walls of their prairie paradise , a centerpiece exhibit just inside the zoo 's main entrance .
Since H.R. 1207 was introduced by Dr. Ron Paul in Congress this February , there has been a growing movement questions whether the Fed should continue to operate without more oversight and some question whether or not the Federal Reserve should continue to operate at all .
Currenty , Paul ’s “ Audit the Fed ” legislation has 282 co-sponsors and there are two similar pieces of legislation in the senate .
If the legislation is passed , it will allow the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) to review the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheets and their policy deliberations and monetary transactions .
Currently Federal Reserve Chairman , Ben Bernanke , opposes the plan , saying it would undermine the Fed ’s independence .
The “ Audit the Fed ” act has a real chance in passing , but some supporters of the legislation , including Ron Paul , want to take it further than that by ending the Federal Reserve all together .
Paul introduced a piece of follow - up legislation , entitled H.R. 833 : The Federal Reserve Board Abolition
Act which would wind down and eliminate the Federal Reserve over the course of the year .
Currently , the act has no co-sponsors , but is gaining a lot of grass - roots support .
Paul hopes that members of Congress will join his movement to end the Federal Reserve after they see the results of a full audit of the Federal Reserve .
Paul also authored a book about his proposal to end the Federal Reserve , entitled “ End the Fed . ”
Although the movement is in its infancy and still gaining momentum , it ’s not too crazy to think that the United States would n’t be better off without the Federal Reserve .
Since the Federal Reserve System was brought into force into 1914 , the United States economy has grown at a slower pace than it did before 1914 , despite significantly improved productivity .
The rate of inflation has been substantially worse since the introduction of the Federal Reserve , despite the fact that the Federal Reserve was around during the greatest period of deflation in US History — the Great Depression .
Apologists for the Fed would certainly have a different take .
They would note that the United States was in recession half of the time between the Civil War and 1914 and only 21 % of the time since the Fed came into force .
However , the frequent down - turns before 1914 were n’t the result of a lack of a central bank , but more - so because of poorly thought government regulations , such as bans on branch banking making it so that banks could not survive localized economic trouble .
The Federal Government also forced banks to trade notes at a discount whenever the bank offering the note was from another area .
Throughout the Civil War , state bank notes were taxed into oblivion to make the way for nationalized banks .
Since national banks were forced to accept each other ’s notes at their face value , the currency was uniformed , but those national bank notes had to be backed by Federal bonds .
That requirement proved disastrous after the Civil War because of a shortage of bonds , which resulted in 4 currency panics between 1873 and 1907 , which prompted the establishment of the Federal Reserve .
Until 1907 , many reformers simply hoped to abolish the restrictions placed on banks during the Civil War , and allowing them to issue notes and allowing banks to branch nationwide to standardize currency instead of the requirement to have the backing of government bonds .
Reformers looked to Canada where a similar system had been functioning successfully for several decades .
Although Congress did consider several pieces of legislation similar to what Canada had , none of those made it out of Congress because local bankers were determined to block any proposal for branch banking that would threaten their local monopolies .
After the adoption of a system similar to Canada ’s failed , only then did reformers consider the establishment of a central reserve bank .
As a result , the Federal Reserve Act allowed for the creation of 12 new banks to do what other banks were prevented from doing themselves , establishing branch networks and issuing currency backed by commercial assets .
The Federal Reserve was a poor substitute for deregulation .
Since the Fed had monopoly privileges in issuing currency , it allowed them to cause unchecked inflation .
By 1919 , the US Inflation rate jumped to nearly 20 % .
Since the Federal Reserve had a monopoly on currency , it also had to make sure that there was enough currency in the market to avert a crisis .
Soon after , two of the worst monetary contractions in history , the first in 1921 , and the second between 1929 and 1933 took place .
Would a Canadian - style asset - based currency have survived the Great Depression any better ?
It turns out that Canada ’s did .
Between 1929 and 1933 , 1/3rd of the United States ’ money stock was wiped out and Canada ’s monetary supply only dropped by 13 % .
In Canada , there were no bank failures , where as there were over 6,000 in the United States !
Although Canada fared better during the great depression , it moved to Central Banking in 1935 because of a movement to get more easy money .
If it were 1934 , a call to end the Federal Reserve would not have been considered anywhere close to crazy .
75 years and several crisis ’s later , we ’ve all but forgotten what the world would look like without the Federal Reserve system , but that does n’t mean the idea is any less valid than it was during the Great Depression .

It goes without saying that Nick Griffin is a hateful , slippery character .
Unfortunately he and other BNP members are getting good at running rings around journalists and others who want to ask them questions .
To help anyone wondering what to ask the BNP leader when he appears on the BBC's Question Time on Thursday , I 've prepared , with the help of my co-bloggers , a list of 20 questions that should be asked of the BNP and its leadership .
So without further ado ...
1 . Which parts of Hitler 's book Mein Kampf does Nick Griffin agree with , considering that he is on record as stating that he has " learned a lot " from it ?
2. Specifically which policies and ideology of the historical German Nazi party does the BNP as a whole renounce or support , considering the confirmed admiration for Hitler and his organisation among several senior members of the BNP ?
3 . What is the BNP 's official position on the Holocaust , given Griffin 's claim that " I am well aware that the orthodox opinion is that 6 million Jews were gassed and cremated and turned into lampshades . "
Does he not believe the 6 million figure ?
4. Griffin has been pictured with and rubbed shoulders several times with high - ranking members of the American Ku Klux Klan .
Does he agree with their vision of Aryan supremacy ?
Would he renounce their policies and ideology ?
5. Would Griffin , Andrew Brons and all other members of the BNP be willing to submit to multiple independent DNA tests to confirm that none of them have any non-European ancestry ?
6 . How will a BNP government ensure the safety of Britain 's female population , considering that a senior member of the BNP ( Nick Eriksen ) has been on record as stating that he believes " rape is simply sex .
Women enjoy sex , so rape cannot be such a terrible physical ordeal . "
7 . Does Griffin agree with the senior member of the BNP who is on record as stating that he supports forced euthanasia of people with disabilities and others deemed to be " a waste of time , money and resources " , including the very old and ( especially ) newborn babies ?
8. Griffin said previously that he believed white and black people could not live together .
Is he still against mixed - race relationships ?
How will he stop people from having them ?
9 . What would be the status of British citizens ( both minors and legal adults ) who are the children of one white / Caucasian parent and one non-white parent ?
10 .
The BNP 's constitution says that it wishes to restore " the overwhelmingly white makeup of the British population that existed in Britain prior to 1948 " .
Does that still remain his aim ?
11 . Does he still believe in voluntary repatriation of ethnic minorities in the UK ?
What if they do n't want to move to another country ?
12 . Should ethnic minority Britons have any lesser rights or legal status than white Britons ?
Given the choice between a white Briton and a non-white Briton for a job – would you choose the white Briton because of their race ?
13 . Non-white Britons represent Britain internationally in sporting events and academia and in other fields all the time .
Yet you say these people are not " British " .
Would you deny them the chance to represent the UK ?
14 . Would you be OK with a mixed - race or non-white Briton being prime minister of Britain ?
15 .
Do you think white people are genetically more intelligent than black people ?
16 . During an interview in May 2009 , Griffin clearly stated that he would use the current Saudi Arabian policy on non-Islamic places of worship as a guideline for official policies towards non-Christian places of worship under a BNP government , thereby effectively turning Britain into a Christian version of Saudi Arabia .
Is that still the case ?
17 .
Does he have any problems with Christians converting to any other religion ?
18 . Will the BNP 's proposed policies in relation to non-white British citizens also be applicable to Jewish British citizens ?
If the answer is " Yes " , then all further queries in relation to non-white British citizens should be interpreted to also include Jewish British citizens .
19 .
During its various references to Britain 's historical participation in the first and second world wars , why does the BNP never mention the fact that millions of non-white soldiers from the former British Empire fought alongside white / Caucasian soldiers on the side of the Allied powers in both world wars , including 2.5 million volunteer soldiers from the Indian subcontinent during the second world war ?
20 .
How will a BNP government ensure the safety and welfare of Britain 's disabled , considering that a senior member of the BNP ( Jeffrey Marshall ) has been on record as stating that " We live in a country today which is unhealthily dominated by an excess of sentimentality towards the weak and unproductive .
No good will come of it " , in response to the death of David Cameron 's baby in spring 2009 ?
Think I 've missed something out or you can do better ?
Let me know below .
A trans woman who was denied breast enlargement surgery is taking her primary care trust to court .
The patient , known only as ‘ C’ , has been living as a woman for ten years and has undergone hormone treatment , although she has not had any other surgery .
According to the Daily Telegraph , she argues that she will suffer great distress if Berkshire Primary Care Trust will not provide the surgery , saying it is essential to her identity as a woman .
Her case will be heard at the High Court on October 20th .
Berkshire PCT will only fund breast enlargement in “ exceptional circumstances ” and has only funded one such procedure in the past three years , for a woman who was deeply distressed at the size of her breasts .
It decided that C ’s case was not exceptional .
Stephanie Harrison , C ’s barrister , told a preliminary hearing that the patient had been discriminated against because she had been treated exactly in the same way a biological woman without gender dysphoria would have been treated .
She argued : “ Breast augmentation is not cosmetic surgery , it is a treatment for gender dysphoria .
This is a treatment for a recognised medical condition .
“ The fact that someone is transsexual is treated as irrelevant by the PCT .
It is a legal error to say that you must treat transsexual females and natal females the same ” .
Harrison claims that the PCT ’s refusal to fund the operation is a violation of her human rights .
C is claiming direct discrimination under the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act .
However , barrister for the PCT David Lock argued that C’s case was fundamentally flawed because it could not be shown that she was treated any less favourably than a biological woman .
He said she had been considered under the PCT ’s trans policy , rather than as a biological woman .
Lock also expressed frustration at the “ huge ” costs of the case , estimated to be tens of thousands of pounds .
He said : “ Public bodies who have to make rationing decisions , like PCTs , face enormous difficulties .
Wherever you draw the line , there will be those who are disappointed .
“ It would make the job of PCTs virtually impossible if their decisions were constantly attacked .
We are a public body that prefers to spend its money on treating patients .
The costs and complexity of this case are already huge . ”
After a five - and - a - half - year fight , Google and its attorneys have managed to convince federal bureaucrats to bestow a patent on the company 's iconic home page .
We always thought the page was brain - dead simple , but apparently it's an innovative " graphical user interface . "
Google had more luck patenting the design of its search results , which were submitted along with the home page in early 2004 and cleared the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office at the end of 2006 .
The home page , in contrast , was split off into a separate application , receiving its design patent for a " Graphical user interface for a display screen of a communications terminal " just yesterday .
The document ( see below ) is as minimalist as the interface , containing a single illustration of Google.com , with the company logo depicted in dotted lines to indicate it is not an integral part of the patent .
In other words , subject to how the patent is enforced , Google owns the idea of having a giant search box in the middle of the page , with two big buttons underneath and several small links nearby .
Since the time of the patent application in 2004 , the company has moved some links , for searching News and Groups and other alternate databases , from directly above the search box to the top of the home page .
But Google presumably believes its patent is broad enough to cover the variation .
It 's not clear how the company , already under scrutiny from antitrust regulators , will wield the patent against competitors .
The Yahoo Search page , depicted at left , bears a striking resemblance to Google.com , while Microsoft 's Bing , which features a photo and several headlines , is more distinct .
But there mere existence of the patent should create enough uncertainty to scare some worried startups away from Google 's stripped down look .
So while people may flock to the search engine for its clean , minimalist design , in so doing they are supporting a company that is poised to retard the spread of such an aesthetic online .
Google 's shareholders will be more pleased , of course , as will staff .
Google diva Marissa Mayer , the overachieving VP of search , added another patent to her trophy case with the decision .
Powerful executive ; athlete ; fashionista ; and genius inventor of this totally unprecedented rendering of HTML .
Is there anything Mayer can't do ?

A major anti-corruption crusade has taken shape in Nigeria , formed in the hopes of cracking down on Internet scammers throughout the country .
The campaign recently shut down 800 scam websites and busted 18 networks used by email fraudsters .
According to Farida Waziri , Economic and Financial Crimes Commission ( EFCC ) boss , " Over 800 fraudulent email addresses have been identified and shut down .
There have also been 18 arrests of high profile syndicates operating cyber - crime organizations . "
( Source : com.au )
Epicenter of Email Scamming
Nigeria carries the undesirable reputation of being the epicenter of email scamming .
In recent years , these online deviants have wreaked havoc on international web users .
While scammers have long experienced a relatively safe buffer zone in Africa , combined with previous " laissez - faire " enforcement officials , now anti-corruption police have responded to a worldwide call to action in an effort to stamp out cyber crime .
If everything goes according to plan , within the next six months , " operation eagle claw " will have forewarned a quarter of a million potential victims .
Nigerian Scammers Caught in Spain
Last March , police in Spain arrested 23 ( mostly Nigerian ) scammers accused of running an email and letter ring .
The operation was believed to have defrauded 150 people across the U.S. and in Europe .
( Source : yahoo.com )
This particular operation operated by submitting thousands of letters each day to prospective victims , claiming that these people had just received millions of dollars in inheritance funds .
The scam turned to criminal behavior when these people were asked to pay a " small " processing fee and / or supply their bank account information so that the funds could be deposited into their accounts .
Of course , the victims never inherited their fortunes , but were the recipients of dry bank accounts and hefty credit card statements .
In recent years , scammers have become much more brash in choosing their prospective targets .
Some operations were even known for sending out emails to certain celebrities and other prominent personalities , pretending to be helpless and stranded people asking for emergency cash .
The Nigerian anti-corruption police hope to change that .
Dragon Age : Origins is an action RPG by BioWare slated for release next month .
Only a couple months ago , the PlayStation 3 version of the title was delayed to later November , while the PC and Xbox 360 counterparts are still aimed for an early November release .
At any rate , there ’s no telling which version might be favored , so until then consumers will have to wait a few extra weeks to cop the PlayStation 3 version of the title .
However , there might be a bonus for those patiently awaiting the PlayStation 3 release of the title .
According to BioWare , there is an “ exciting announcement ” planned for the PlayStation 3 version of Dragon Age : Origins .
What the announcement may or may not be is only drawn by speculation at this point , but there are a variety of rumors already circulating .
One rumor is that the announcement might be a PlayStation Home space for Dragon Age , while others speculate that perhaps the PlayStation 3 version might be getting exclusive DLC .
With that said , hopefully the announcement is something that consumers can enjoy .
The announcement is said to be revealed during a live chat with Lead Designer Mike Laidlaw and Executive Producer Mark Darrah on the PlayStation .

Percent of Permanent Job Losses at Highest in Over 30 Years
The Atlanta Fed ’s macroblog has compiled a roundup of evidence showing that the economy is in a jobless recovery .
It shows that jobs are scarce , that a higher than average number of jobs have been lost in small businesses ( which is a bad sign ) , and that many workers have been forced into part time status .
However , the data point that really jumps out is this one — the dominant reason for unemployment in the current economy is permanent separation .
Permanent separation is when a job is cut and it ’s never coming back … versus temporary layoffs , quitting , and other types of job losses .
It ’s a unique point because the percent of permanent job losses have n’t been this high in over 30 years , and as the article goes on to say , “ Never , in the six recessions preceding the latest one , did permanent separations account for more than 45 percent of the unemployed .
The current percentage stands at 56 percent as of September and appears to be still climbing . ”
The post came to our attention via Calculated Risk which , in looking at the finding commented , “ So far the current recovery is even worse than “ jobless ” ; it is a “ job - loss ” recovery . ”
This data provides more proof that the economy is n’t really recovering .
It ’s important to look at the numbers behind the headline statistics to understand how this depression really is different from other , previous times of economic turmoil .
The post from Calculated Risk highlights permanent separations and macroblog has more details about a variety of joblessness stats .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
The world ’s oldest person , a woman who was born in 1894 and gained a measure of fame when she voted for Barack Obama for U.S. president , died on Friday at the age of 115 .
Gertrude Baines died peacefully in her sleep sometime between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. local time ( 1300 and 1400 GMT ) at the Western Convalescent Hospital in Los Angeles , where she had spent the past decade of her life .
“ She ’s a very dignified lady , ” Emma Camanag , the hospital ’s administrator , told Reuters .
“ It has truly been a blessing and an honor for us to take care of her over the last 10 years and we will greatly miss her .
It ’s just like we lost a relative . ”
Baines had no living relatives , Camanag said , but was popular at the home and at her church , where she attended services every Sunday until she became too ill to leave her room .
Camanag said parishioners at the church often visited Baines , who was born on April 6 , 1894 in Shellman , Georgia , and became the world ’s oldest person when 115 - year - old Maria de Jesus of Portugal died in January .
Japan ’s Kama Chien , 114 , is now the oldest person in the world .
As a Black woman who grew up in the South during the time of Jim Crow laws , which required Blacks to use separate and often inferior public facilities , Baines was celebrated in the media when she voted last November for Obama , the first African American elected president of the United States .
She had only voted once previously , for John F. Kennedy , and told the Los Angeles Times at the time that she supported Obama “ because he ’s for the colored . ”
She kept a signed picture of Obama on her wall , the Times reported .
Baines , who was born during the administration of Grover Cleveland , married young and later divorced .
Her only child , a daughter , was born in 1909 and died of typhoid at the age of 18 .
She worked as a maid in Ohio before moving to Los Angeles and lived on her own until she was well over 100 .
According to the Times , when Baines was asked by reporters her secret for living a long life , she would reply “ Ask God . ”

NEW DELHI : Olympic and World Championship bronze medallist Vijender Singh has achieved yet another first for Indian boxing by becoming the world 's top - ranked pugilist in the middle weight ( 75 kg ) category .
( Watch Video )
The 23 - year - old Bhiwani boxer , who won India 's maiden World Championships medal in Milan earlier this month , has 200 points and is ranked higher than the reigning champion Abbos Atoev of Uzbekistan .
Atoev , to whom Vijender lost in the World Championship semifinals , is third in the list with 2100 points and Olympic silver medallist Emilio Correa Bayeux ( 2500 ) of Cuba occupies the second spot in the International Boxing Association 's ( AIBA ) list updated after the Milan event .
" I am obviously elated at being ranked the highest in the world .
It 's a fantastic feeling and would motivate me to do better in future events , " Vijender , who broke India 's Olympic jinx with his bronze in the Beijing Olympics , said .
Among the other Indians , former world youth champion Thokchom Nanao Singh has slipped three places to eighth with 1400 points in the light fly weight ( 48 kg ) category .
Nanao , a silver medallist in this year 's Asian Championships in China , lost in the second round of the World Championships .
Olympian Akhil Kumar , whose World Championships campaign was cut short in the first round itself due to a wrist injury , has gone down a rung to 10th in feather weight ( 57kg ) category with 1050 points .
Fellow Olympian Jitender Kumar ( 54kg ) also lost some ground because of his first - round exit in Milan as he dropped a place to 14th with 838 points .
Suranjoy Singh was 17th in the fly weight ( 51kg ) category rankings .
World Championship quarterfinalist Dinesh Kumar held on to his sixth spot with 1550 points in the light weight ( 81kg ) category .
Mr Mitterrand , who joined the cabinet in June , was considered a great catch for Mr Sarkozy and proof of his “ open ” style of government ; the minister comes from a grand Socialist family and is admired by many in the Left - wing cultural establishment .
Carla Bruni-Sarkozy , the first lady , was said to have had a hand in his nomination .
NEW YORK -- NFL ratings are at their highest in 20 years .
Through the first four weeks of the season , games are drawing their best average viewership since 1989 at 17.4 million , up 14 percent from the same point in 2008 .
The average was 18.1 million in 1989 through four weeks .
Sunday doubleheader games this year on CBS and Fox have averaged 22.3 million viewers , which ranks as television 's most - watched show on a weekly basis .
Monday night 's Packers - Vikings matchup on ESPN was the most - watched show in cable TV history with 21.8 million viewers .
Meanwhile , “ we knew we would have to sacrifice some things , ” said Ms. LeCount , who works in public relations .
“ So we sacrificed  we did n’t think of the day - to - day lifestyle things we were going to miss . ”
They missed them badly .
Street parking was so scarce they sometimes had to park five minutes away .
Their car got nicked and dinged , so they bought a bumper guard .
After shopping for groceries , they often had to double - park their car in front and run their bags inside .
Without a washer - dryer , laundry consumed their weekends , even after they stopped doing it themselves at the laundromat .
They scheduled weekend trips around their laundry drop - off .
Mr. LeCount stocked up on gym shorts and T - shirts to ensure he would always have clean workout clothes .

Worst of all , the building required numerous upgrades .
Ms. LeCount , vocal at her first condo board meeting , quickly found herself the board president .
She was in charge of fixing the cracked stoop , which was in danger of collapse .
It had to be demolished and reconstructed .
“ Who knew a stoop would be $ 50,000 ? ” she said .
“ I had no idea . ”
Because the building had no reserve account , the stoop project required a special assessment to each unit .
The LeCounts had to take more than $ 5,000 from their savings .
Fixing the stoop took months .
“ It totally changed the curb appeal in a positive way , ” Mr. LeCount said .
But “ it was a significant amount of work and very stressful .
It really took its toll on us .
It caused us anxiety and sleepless nights . ”
Those nat service providers ' fears were actually quite justified .
Google today unveiled Maps Navigation ( beta , of course ) , an extremely upgraded version of its current Maps software that 'll be free and , from what we understand , available by default on all Android 2.0 devices .
All the usual Maps features are present , including the ability to search by name of business and have it suggest the closest matches , both semantically and geographically , and traffic data .
We 're also now looking at turn - by - turn navigation , female robotic voice and all , and integration with satellite and street view , the latter of which will be able to show you what lane you need to be in when exiting the highway , for example .
Instead of just searching nearby , it 'll also now search along the route for when you 're looking for upcoming gas stations or fast food joints that wo n't take you too far off your beaten path .
Select addresses can be added to the Android home screen as their own icons , and given the limits of living in the cloud , trips and their respective visual feeds will be cached just in case you hit dead spots along the way .
Still no multitouch , but as VP of Engineering Vic Gundotra noted at a press conference , there 's nothing stopping a company like HTC from adding that feature à la Sense UI .
In addition to demonstrating the basic navigational functions , Gundotra also showcased a new user interface that appears when the device hooked up into a car dock , one that is intended for use " at an arm 's length away . "
Essentially , it means much larger iconography and a convenient " voice search " option front and center .
We later got confirmation from a Google product manager that car dock detection was definitively a hardware - based feature , which we take to mean Android devices currently on the market wo n't necessarily have the same convenience .
If Android 2.0 takes off how Google ( and Verizon ! ) hope it does , companies like TomTom and Garmin are going to seriously need to worry about their bottom line .
Watch Gundotra demonstrate the app after the break .
Navigation for the iPhone ?
Gundotra said the ball 's in Apple 's court , so no telling if / when that 'll happen .
Remember how well Latitude integrated
A box of leaflets dropped by an RAF plane in Afghanistan landed on and killed a young girl , the Ministry of Defence said .
The box should have broken apart in mid-air but struck the young girl intact .
She was taken to a hospital in Kandahar where she died .
The leaflets were dropped over a rural area of Helmand province by an RAF C130 Hercules on June 23 .
" It is a matter of deep regret that one of the boxes failed to fully open and on landing caused serious injuries to an Afghan child , " said a spokesman .
" The child was treated at a local medical facility in Kandahar where , despite the best efforts of staff , she died as a result of her injuries .
An investigation into the incident is under way . "
Defence sources said the girl was taken to a local hospital in Kandahar instead of to an International Security Assistance Force hospital , which may have been better equipped .
The MoD would not comment on what type of leaflet was involved but said the air drops were common and in the past had included public information on the presidential elections and basic warnings about explosives .
The news of the death came as Gordon Brown told Sky News that where the military wants new equipment " they have got it " and refused to rule out sending more troops to Afghanistan .
" I can say that we will do whatever is necessary and that does not rule out doing what is necessary for our troops , " Brown said .
" Where they want new equipment – and there have been a thousand new vehicles gone into the defence department costing a billion pounds – where they need refurbishment or new helicopters , where they need new equipment like night vision equipment , they have got it .
" I defy you to say that any urgent operational requirement that is needed by the military has been turned down by the Treasury . "
A UN report published on Saturday said August was the deadliest month of the year for civilians in Afghanistan because of violence from the insurgency .
About 1,500 civilians died from January through August this year , up from 1,145 for the same period of 2008 .
The Motorola Droid is certainly one of the most discussed new non-Apple smartphones to come out in some time .
It launches November 6th on Verizon , but you can already pre-order it from Best Buy .
Is it worth switching to if you already carry an iPhone or another device ?
To provide some guidance , BillShrink has produced a detailed chart looking at Droid , iPhone , Palm Pre , and MyTouch 3G .
Going by the chart , there does n’t appear to be much Droid is lacking – other than the 93,200 apps ( 100,000 + by recent estimates ) that the iPhone ’s app store offers .
You also get Verizon ’s network as opposed to AT&T ( a fact you ’ll no doubt be reminded of in advertising ) .
As you can see , cost of ownership over 24 months works out exactly the same for both products , while Pre and MyTouch are more affordable .
In all , it certainly seems like the Droid will add an interesting new twist the smartphone debate , which to - date has primarily involved iPhone and BlackBerry .
How do you think Droid stacks up ?

There ’s some good news for Phoenix - area folks ( and visitors to the area ) who love craft brew : Sleepy Dog Brewing and Dave ’s Electric Brewpub will open soon in Tempe .
This bodes well for a metro area ranking low nationwide on craft brewers per capita .
We ’ve still got a long way to go , but Sleepy Dog and Dave ’s Electric are welcome additions .
In recognition of their opening , let ’s take a look at other craft brewers in the area .
I ’ve not included chains such as BJ’s , Gordon Biersch or Rock Bottom here because I want to emphasize local above all else .
I ’ve ranked them , and included some reasoning for their rankings .
Enjoy !
1. Sun Up Brewing –
This is a terrific craft brew pub in uptown Phoenix .
Yes , it ’s incredibly friendly , both in terms of its knowledgeable staff and regular customers .
Yes , it has quality food .
Yes , you can carry on a conversation .
Yes , its brews are all great examples of each genre represented .
But one of the big factors in its favor is that you can walk in there at anytime and get a real ale , also known as a cask ale .
Unlike brews carbonated with CO2 , real ales have silky textures and wonderful floral hop characters .
They ’re also unpasteurized .
Sun Up also offers outstanding seasonal and high - strength selections .
If I could ask them to do anything differently , I ’d want some envelope - pushing brews a la Dogfish Head , and some better desserts .
But overall , it ’s a notch about the rest .
Aside from the cask ales , its standout is The Trooper IPA .
2. Four Peaks – An Arizona original !
It is much less mellow than it used to be , but the food is excellent .
There ’s also a nice selection of ales .
If you get there on Thursday or early Friday , you might get a taste of their cask ale .
Otherwise , you ’ll miss it .
Once the cask blows , it ’s gone until next week , unlike Sun Up .
The original warehouse location has a great atmosphere , but parking is a total hassle during the busy times .
The Scottsdale location is a bit easier that way .
If I had to pick a standout , it would be between Hop Not and the oatmeal stout .
I should say that I never liked any beer before until back in about 1997 , when I tried the oatmeal stout .
3. Papago Brewing –
There ’s an extensive menu here , along with a very nice array of bottled beers .
And you can take those bottled selections home or drink them on - site .
You ’ll also find nearly 30 taps offering some of Papago ’s own concoctions ( which are made by Sun Up according to Papago ’s recipes , I believe - if you know better , feel free to speak up ) and some unusual selections from around the world .
On the down side , Papago can get really loud with a large space , concrete floors and a blaring jukebox .
Service is also inconsistent , with some really great staff members and others who are pretty indifferent .
Sometimes they have a cask brew , sometimes they do n’t .
If they ’re offering their Elsie ’s Stout when you visit , give it a try .
4. Pinnacle Peak Brewing –
It ’s way out in the sticks and a bit hard to find .
It also has a narrow selection .
And to me , only one is worth the drive , and it ’s only served in the winter .
That ’s the Gunslinger Stout , a monstrous imperial - style beast .
Unfortunately , it ’s served in a pint glass at far too cold a temperature .
An imperial stout needs to be served slightly chilled in a snifter , or you ’re going to miss a lot of the complex flavor .
Â I ’m not big on the country - western vibe , either .
5. Old World Brewery –
It ’s a brewery .
No , it ’s a music venue .
No , it ’s both .
Kind of .
There ’s barely any seating .
It ’s buried in an industrial park .
And frankly , the beer is lackluster .
Each selection I tried had a sour tang , as if it were coming out of a line that had n’t been cleaned recently .
The brewmaster is considerably too self - satisfied and needs to focus less on how many barrels he intends to brew and distribute , and do more to execute his recipes well .
Here ’s another funny :
The bar staff was pouring its craft crew into the infamous red plastic cups like you ’d see at a frat house .
That should never happen anywhere brewing is taken seriously .
I did n’t rank Sonoran Brewing Company ( not to be mistaken for Sonora , which was Sun Up ’s name until a few months ago ) because I have n’t had any of their products for quite awhile .
If you ’re planning to visit Arizona and travel throughout the state , be sure to check out :
Beaver Street Brewery ( Flagstaff ) – terrific food and decent brews .
Prescott Brewing Company ( Prescott ) – Both the beers and the food are equally awesome .
Thunder Canyon Brewing ( Tucson ) – Owned by the same folks as Prescott Brewing , so count on them to be just as awesome .

Fear not , they ’re non-spammy and benign .
Hey , I have to keep this thing running somehow !

Belgrade is full of posters telling participants : " We 're expecting you "
A Gay Pride march in Serbia has been called off after police told organisers they could not guarantee its safety .
One of the organisers said Serbia 's prime minister had urged them to switch Sunday 's rally from central Belgrade , but the proposal was " unacceptable " .
President Boris Tadic vowed on Friday to protect the participants .
Anti-gay groups had threatened violence if the march were allowed to go ahead .
" We 're expecting you " posters had been stuck around the Serbian capital .
" Pride parades are traditionally organised in the main streets of big cities , " said one of the organisers , Dragana Vuckovic .
It is " unacceptable " to stage the parade in a " field " , she told the media .
The Republic of Serbia has capitulated .
We have not
Gay Pride organising committee
Gay march plan tests Serb feelings
The decision had been taken after a meeting on Saturday with Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic .
Nationalist and religious leaders have opposed a Serbian bill banning discrimination against homosexuals .
The ultra-nationalist Serb Popular Movement 1389 hailed the cancellation of Sunday 's march as " a great victory for normal Serbia " .
" In our city infidels and Satanists will not pass , " it added .
Homosexuality in Serbia is still far from accepted , says the BBC's Mark Lowen in Belgrade .
The gay scene is underground and members of the community are regularly the target of discrimination .
Belgrade 's first gay parade in 2001 descended into chaos amid widespread violence by mobs of protesters - with television images of bleeding participants and police firing rubber bullets broadcast around the world .
The organising committee of the planned Sunday march will certainly keep up the pressure , says our correspondent .
" The state has failed the fundamental test , " it says in a statement .
" The next exam period is approaching fast .
The Republic of Serbia has capitulated .
We have not . "
At First It Was Hard To Feel Sorry For Them
Thomas and Amanda Stansel were having trouble conceiving so they opted to undergo fertility treatments .
Hospitals , doctors , hormone shots , sperm injected directly into Mrs. Stansel 's uterus .
And Mrs. Stansel wound up pregnant — with six fetuses .
Their doctors urged them to " reduce , " or selectively abort , some of the fetuses or risk losing them all .
It was hard to feel sorry for them when I read this ...
The Stansels rejected Dr. Grunert ’s advice and , since then , their vision of a family has collapsed into excruciating loss : the deaths of four children after their premature births on Aug. 4 , including one who died late Sunday night .
The two other infants remain in neonatal intensive care , their futures uncertain .
“ I feel like we bonded with all of them , the short time they were here , ” Mr. Stansel said .
“ We were able to hold them before they passed away . ”
And it was really hard to feel sorry for them when I flipped the paper over and saw the picture of the Stansels that was under the fold : they 're posing with the casket containing the remains of three of their children — and they could n't look more pleased with themselves .
And then I read the rest of the story and I wanted to kill the Stansels with my bare hands ...
When Dr. Grunert discovered that Mrs. Stansel was carrying multiple fetuses , he handicapped her odds of delivering six healthy infants at practically zero .
Eliminating some of the fetuses would give the others the best chance for survival ....
For the Stansels , the decision was influenced by their membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .
The church generally opposes abortion .
After learning that Mrs. Stansel was carrying sextuplets , the Stansels decided to meet with church elders and consult with a reduction specialist .
“ It just never felt right , ” Mr. Stansel said .
“ We prayed many nights .
A lot of sleepless nights .
Originally we thought we might do the reduction .
We chose to carry all six and , we believe , let God do what he ’s going to do . ”
What ?
If you were gonna let God do what He 's going to do , you should n't have sought out fertility treatments .
Here 's what God was gonna do : God was gonna make you infertile .
God did that , actually , and then you thwarted God 's plan for you — that you be infertile — and availed yourselves of the latest medical technologies and sought the help fertility specialists .
Then you ignored the advice of your doctors and refused to reduce the number of fetuses you were carrying and now four premature infants have died in great pain and two more will very likely die — but , hey , you 'll get another smug , self - satisfied , just - letting - God - do - what - he 's - gonna - do photo op out of it , so it 's not a total loss .
And it 's all material for the blog you 're writing about " your journey , " and there 'll probably be a book deal in it for you when it 's all over ( " Thom & Amanda Minus 6 " ) .
Mrs. Stansel delivered the sextuplets on Aug. 4 , about 14 weeks premature .
The babies were born so early that no medical care would have been rendered unless the parents requested it .
Dr. Jarriel , the neonatologist , said the survival rate of babies at the stage they were born was about 60 percent to 65 percent .
If they survived , the Stansels were told , there was a 100 percent chance that they would have problems .
But the couple asked the hospital for the most extraordinary measures to save them .
“ We wanted to do all we could for them , to save them , ” Mr. Stansel said .
“ Give them that chance , ” Mrs. Stansel added .
“ That ’s the doctors giving their statistics .
God does n’t work in statistics . ”
Four of their six babies are now dead .
So it looks like God does work in statistics after all — if
He did n't , Mrs. Stansel , then the world would be an entirely random / miraculous place and we would n't be able to make any predictions about anything and there would n't be stats about anything .

Camels are highly prized in Arabia and can fetch huge sums of money
A $ 250,000 compensation claim has been made against Saudi Arabia 's oil giant Saudi Aramco for causing the death of a prized camel , local press reports say .
The case , to be heard on Monday , involves a three - year - old black camel which fell into a large hole dug in the desert to store crude oil .
The camel 's owner is quoted saying the beast had been entered in one of the region 's popular camel beauty pageants .
The compensation claim is based on the value experts put on the camel .
The owner , Abdullah Al - Saiari , said the she - camel was grazing in a desert pasture , about 150 miles ( 250 km ) west of Ahsa , when the accident happened .
" She was part of the Camel Beauty Contest , " he said , the Saudi Gazette reported .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Even after the “ abortion pill ” RU - 486 made it possible for all doctors to provide early abortions , access to abortions did not improve as dramatically as women had hoped .

When RU - 486 , also called mifepristone , was approved by the FDA in 2000 for early pregnancy termination , it was expected to improve access to early abortion because pregnancies could be terminated more privately , within a few days after conception , without surgery , and with only a prescription for the medication from a woman ’s personal physician , no matter where in the country she lived .
New research from across the U.S. shows , however , that early visions of broader geographic access to abortions have not been fulfilled .
Dr. Lawrence B. Finer and Dr. Junhow Wei from the Guttmacher Institute in New York City report that in 2005 , 96 percent of providers who penned prescriptions for RU - 486 were located in metropolitan areas , just 3 percent were in “ micropolitan ” areas , with 10,000 to 50,000 inhabitants , and only 1 percent were in smaller cities and towns .
Furthermore , their research shows that RU - 486 is being prescribed mainly at health care facilities that also provide surgical abortions .
In fact , of the 902 health care facilities ( including doctors ’ offices , clinics , and hospitals ) where RU - 486 was prescribed in 2007 , only 5 nonsurgical providers who regularly prescribed the pill were located more than 50 miles away from a surgical clinic .
In the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology , Finer and Wei also report that roughly 158,000 RU - 486 abortions were performed in 2007 , accounting for 14 percent of all abortions and 21 percent of eligible early abortions , according to the article .
This is up from about 55,000 in 2001 .
Family practice doctors account for only 11 percent of RU - 486 prescribers .
The proportion of providers in each state who prescribed the abortion pill in 2005 varied from 0 percent to 100 percent .
South Dakota , Hawaii , Idaho , Oklahoma , West Virginia and the District of Columbia had the lowest proportions , and Wyoming , South Carolina , Kentucky , Louisiana , North Dakota and Kansas had the highest proportions .
Also in 2005 , out of a total of 3,141 counties in the U.S. , RU - 486 prescriptions were written in only 307 ( 10 percent ) .
Of the 62 million girls and women of childbearing age , an estimated 36 million ( 58 percent ) lived in a county with an RU - 486 provider .
These results , the researchers conclude , indicate that RU - 486 “ has not brought a major improvement in the geographic availability of abortion . ”

Pretty sure everyone already knows the food is great here .
We come here when family is in town and everyone is always pleased .
Drinks are great .
It 's a very cool building with an interesting history ...
Management consultant Jackie Slater thought she was completing a normal shopping trip to Morrisons until the checkout assistant demanded to see her ID before scanning two bottles of wine .
" I told her I was really flattered , but I was the wrong side of 50 , " she said .
But the assistant pointed to her 17 - year - old daughter , Emily , and her 18 - year - old niece , Annice , who were standing at the end of the checkout chatting .
" She asked : ' Are they with you ? '
I said they 'd come to help me carry the bags back to the car .
The assistant said : ' You could be buying the wine for them .
It 's the policy – I have to see everyone 's ID to make sure they are all over 18 ' . "
In vain , Mrs Slater insisted that the wine was for herself and her husband , Peter .
But the assistant and then the store manager refused to budge .
Nor was their decision deemed an over - enthusiastic interpretation of company rules .
Morrisons ' head office last week backed the store – a move that suggests new guidelines , introduced to limit access to alcohol among youngsters , could soon cause chaos if other shops follow Morrisons ' lead .
" Under current licensing laws , stores are unable to sell an alcoholic product to a customer they believe could be buying for a minor or for someone who is unable to prove their age , " said a spokesman for Morrisons , citing the Think 25 scheme that has been put in place by major retailers to prevent the sale of prohibited items to under - age shoppers .
Morrisons does not contest Mrs Slater 's version of events .
The assistant even agreed that she would have sold the wine to a mother who had younger children with her because " no one would buy wine for a 12 - year - old " .
However she still refused to scan the wine without seeing Mrs Slater 's daughter 's ID – which she did not have with her .
" I was embarrassed , there was a huge queue building up and my daughter found it all excruciating , " said Mrs Slater , who describes the incident as " the silliest bit of jobsworth nonsense " she had ever come across .
" It comes to something when a mother can't take her daughter shopping without being made to feel like a criminal . "
Last week Asda had to apologise to Gill Power who was told that her 14 - year - old son was not allowed to help her carry shopping bags containing a bottle of wine .
Mrs Power was told by the cashier : " Sorry he is n't allowed to take it because he is under age . "
Asda later said its staff had been " overly cautious " .
Morrisons is unrepentant about its Leeds store 's decision .
" We take our responsibility with regard to selling alcohol very seriously . " said the spokesman .
" The rules are in place to protect our customers and their families , as well as local communities who , in the majority of cases , appreciate our vigilance in the sale of age - restricted products . "
Mrs Slater 's MP , Greg Mulholland , a health spokesman for the Liberal Democrats , said : " Whoever thinks this policy will do anything to stop antisocial drinking by kids is in cloud - cuckoo - land .
" This is simply absurd and Morrisons should be ashamed of themselves .
" We need a more mature and sensible approach to alcohol in general – and refusing a mum a bottle of wine with the weekly shop because she has her 17 - year - old daughter with her is ridiculous .
Morrisons need to think again and this time do so with just a little common sense . "

The prize will be shared equally between the three winners
The 2009 chemistry Nobel Prize has been awarded to Venkatraman Ramakrishnan , Thomas Steitz and Ada Yonath .
The prize is awarded for the study of the structure and function of the ribosome - the cell 's protein factory .
The ribosome translates genetic code into proteins - which are the building blocks of all living organisms .
It is also the main target of new antibiotics , which combat bacterial strains that have developed resistance to traditional antibiotic drugs .
These new drugs work by blocking the function of ribosomes in bacterial cells , preventing them from making the proteins they need to survive .
It 's above and beyond my dreams and I am very thankful
Ada Yonath
The DNA - reading machine Their design has been made possible by research into the structure of the ribosome , because it has revealed key differences between bacterial and human ribosomes .
Structures that are unique to bacteria can be targeted by drugs .
The announcement was made during a press conference at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , during which the three winners were described as " warriors in the struggle of the rising tide of incurable bacterial infections " .
Professor Ramakrishnan is based at the Medical Research Council 's Molecular Biology Laboratories in Cambridge , UK .
Thomas Steitz is based at Yale University in the US , and Ada Yonath is from the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot , Israel .
The prize is to be shared equally between the three scientists , who all contributed to revealing the ribosome 's huge and complex molecular structure in detail .
Professor David Garner , president of the Royal Society of Chemistry , described the three as " great scientists " and said their work was of " enormous significance " .
' Molecular machine '
These scientists and their colleagues have helped build a 3D structure of the ribosome .
In doing so , they solved an important part of the the problem posed by Francis Crick and James Watson when they discovered the twisted double helix DNA structure - how does this code become a living thing ?
Ultimately , when you look at any biological question it becomes a chemical problem
Venkatraman Ramakrishnan DNA is made available to the ribosome by " transcription " of genes into chunks of messenger RNA .
In the ribosome , these are read and translated into the various amino acid sequences that make up an organism 's proteins .
By looking closely at its structure , scientists are able to study how this translation process works .
The work is based on a technique called x-ray crystallography - where molecules are removed from cells , purified and made into crystals that can be examined using x-rays .
Professor Ramakrishnan told BBC
News that until the ribosome 's atomic structure was determined , " we knew this was a large molecular machine that translated genetic code to make proteins , but we did n't know how it worked " .
" We still do n't know exactly how it works , but we have made a tremendous amount of progress as a direct result of knowing what it looks like .
" It 's the difference between knowing that when you put gasoline in a car and press on a pedal , it goes .
But if you know that the gasoline gets ignited and pushes down pistons and drives the wheels , that 's a new level of understanding . "
Work together Addressing the Nobel press conference by telephone , Professor Yonath said that modern techniques were allowing scientists to look at the structures on the atomic scale - individual bond after individual bond .
New drugs targeting the ribosome will help fight resistant bacteria
This is the 101st chemistry Nobel to be awarded since 1901 , and Professor Yonath is only the fourth woman to win .
She joins an illustrious list of female chemists that includes Marie Curie , who also won the physics award .
During the press conference , Professor Yonath said : " It 's above and beyond my dreams and I am very thankful . "
President of the American Chemical Society Thomas Lane told the BBC that the award was " a wonderful example of leaders in their disciplines - people from around the world - working towards a common goal and being able to achieve it .
" It shows that as scientists we do n't just sit in our dark labs , we come together and share our research . "
Professor Ramakrishnan paid tribute to the many generations of talented researchers who he said had contributed to this entire field .
Some scientists have commented negatively that the research recognised by this year 's chemistry Nobel has a biological focus .
But Professor Garner pointed out that " when you get down to looking at biology at the molecular level - understanding the fundamental processes of life - it's all chemistry " .
Professor Ramakrishnan said : " Ultimately , when you look at any biological question it becomes a chemical problem , because bio is done by molecules and molecules use chemical laws . "
He concluded : " It 's often the way with science that people study fundamental problems , like the ribosome , and they lead to important medical applications in completely unpredictable ways .
" It 's important to realise that support for basic science is the seed that allows the medical applications and technology to grow . "

The Orkin Design Rolltop would definitely be an item in the must - have list of most geeks , even if it is but a concept at point of publishing .
Why do we say so ?
This " notebook " comes with a flexible OLED display which also handles multitouch for those who are head over heels with the iPhone .
When fully rolled out , it ends up as a 17 " flatscreen display but can also be folded into a 13 " tablet when required .
No idea on whether it will run on wireless power or not , but it seems as though the detachable stand will hold the tablet 's stylus , power adapter and USB ports .

Herschel trains two eyes , Pacs and Spire , on our Galaxy 's centre
Enlarge Image
A remarkable view of our Galaxy has been obtained by Europe 's billion - euro Herschel Space Observatory .
The telescope was put in a special scanning mode to map a patch of sky .
The images reveal in exquisite detail the dense , contorted clouds of cold gas that are collapsing in on themselves to form new stars .
Herschel , which has the largest mirror ever put on an orbiting telescope , was launched in May as a flagship mission of the European Space Agency .
It is tuned to see far - infrared wavelengths of light and is expected to give astronomers significant insights into some of the fundamental processes that shape the cosmos .
Herschel 's great advantage is that its sensitivity allows it to see things that are beyond the vision of other space telescopes , such as Hubble .
A prime goal is to understand the mechanisms that control the earliest phases of stellar evolution .
Rich data return Herschel 's special scanning mode means it has to shift its gaze back and forth across an area of sky , which in this case was about 16 times as big as the size of the Moon as viewed from Earth .
HERSCHEL SPACE TELESCOPE
The observatory is tuned to see the Universe in the far - infrared Its 3.5 m diameter mirror is the largest ever flown in space Herschel can probe clouds of gas and dust to see stars being born
It will investigate how galaxies have evolved through time
The mission will end when its helium refrigerant boils off
The telescope was looking towards the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy , in the direction of the Southern Cross constellation .
The scanning mode works with two of Herschel 's three instruments operating in tandem .
The UK - led Spire camera responds to longer wavelengths of light ( 250 - 500 microns - that is about 500 - 1,000 times longer than the wavelengths of light we detect with our eyes ) .
The German - led Pacs camera covers shorter wavelengths ( 70 - 170 microns ) .
Their pictures reveal a chaotic scene of gas and dust , and stars in all stages of development .
The material being observed is very cold - typically less than minus 170C ( 100 kelvin ) .
Anomaly investigation Scientists say the images are information - rich .
" Our wavelength coverage is telling us details about the physics , " explained Professor Matt Griffin , of Cardiff University , who is the Spire principal investigator .
" Spire is particularly good at seeing the cold and extended material which might correspond , for instance , to the earliest stages of star formation .
" Pacs is slightly more sensitive to what we would call warmer material , although by any normal standards it is still extremely cold ; and that material might be closer to regions where stars have already formed and have been heated up by the young stellar objects . "
Herschel intends to study large regions of the Milky Way in its combined Spire - Pacs scanning mode .
The instruments will , of course , also work independently .
The mission is due to go into routine operations in the next few weeks .
However , its third instrument is currently down after experiencing a fault .
Engineers can switch to a back - up system to reactivate the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared ( HiFi ) , but they do not intend to do that until they have satisfied themselves the cause of the anomaly is properly understood .
The Dutch - led HiFi is a spectrometer that will identify elements and molecules in the clouds of gas and dust which give rise to stars .

Taking stock of Yes on 1's families
by Jeremy Hooper
Interested in knowing what " real " Maine families are working to take away you rights ?
Well , in Stand For Marriage Mains ' latest ad , there are five of them .
First up is the " A father gives his daughter a piggy - back ride while his wife kisses their daughter lovingly on the cheeks " family :
And of course there 's the " Panning - shot of grandparents posing with their grandchildren " family :
Not to mention the " Panning - shot of a family walking together on a summer day " family :
Or the " A happy family poses for a portrait " family :
And last but not least is our favorite :
The " A family poses in front of their home as their young children act silly " family :
Model citizens , all of them .
Literally .
***
* The pertinent point of the ad , for reference 's sake :
Your thoughts
Awesome find , Jeremy .
I would have never guessed that there was such a site like Thought Equity Motion .
I just have picked up on it after reading this posting and noticed in the commerical that there were n't any foot notes about the names of the families and what city they are from like No on 1 does .
I can't believe Stand for Marriage Maine would go so low as to use families that have nothing to do with gay marriage to push their bigotry .
Posted by : Sam | Oct 27 , 2009 5:57:41 PM
I 'm convinced .
Supporters of opposite marriage in Maine are demonstrably more photogenic and WHITE !

Posted by : Dell | Oct 27 , 2009 6:53:46 PM
Usually I do n't like puns , but you knocked this one out of the park !
I notice that SFMM / NOM went for cheaper stock on this last one .
Hmmm ...
Posted by : Matt Algren | Oct 27 , 2009 7:07:18 PM
Jeremy , I am so glad you found this info .
Bill Nemitz ( columnist for the Portland Press Herald ) had a column a few weeks ago about the clip art on their website .
I just KNEW that all the families in their ads were fake , too , but did n't have any evidence .
Now I do .
These people do n't even look like Mainers !
While Maine is not the most diverse state in the US , we are not lily - white like those pictures would have you believe .
I think the only " real " Mainers in their ads have been Charla , Jen , and the social worker / guidance counselor guy from Newport ( blanking on his name ) .
Everyone else is from away or fake .

So I guess they can't actually find any bigots in ME who are willing to put their faces in ads ?
Are there that few bigots or are the bigots just complete cowards ?

If No on 1 does n't send this to the Maine press , then we should !

Go To Community College - You 'll Make More Money ( Especially Women )
Education quality is a moving target these days .
With college education a right since the early 1990s and student loans unlimited to pay for it , costs and claims have expanded , as hot air must , to fill the available money space .
Because everyone with good grades can afford to go to Stanford with enough loans or rich parents , lower ranked schools have no reason to charge less because the pool of high - ranked schools can accept is limited - they just have to wait .
Where does that leave students who performed more poorly in high school , come from more disadvantaged backgrounds ( family incomes less than $ 50,000 ) , and were less likely to have parents with a bachelor 's degree and encourage college ?
Much better off if they opt for community college , says a study by Dr. Dave Marcotte from the University of Maryland Baltimore County .
And in women the advantage is even greater .
Marcotte found that women with a 2 - year community college degree earn 45.8 % more annually than high school educated women while men who enroll at a community college and attain a 2 - year degree earn , on average , 12.2 % more annually than male peers who merely graduate high school .
To advance understanding of the economic benefit of community college education for young Americans , Dr. Marcotte studied data from the National Education Longitudinal Survey ( NELS ) , which follows the educational and work histories of sample members throughout the U.S. Data were analyzed for 11,559 NELS subjects who were employed at the time of the 2000 survey , eliminating those who earned graduate or professional degrees .
The sample was balanced between men and women .
The National Center for Education Statistics reports nearly 40 % of all students enrolled in postsecondary education are at 2 - year institutions ( 2005 ) .
More people tend toward community colleges due to easier enrollment policies , lower tuition costs , and varied course selection .
The author found that of those who left 2 - year institutions without a degree , 53.3 % completed more than 30 credits , half of the required credits needed for an associate degree .
Further analysis of the NELS data indicates that women earn an additional 9.6 % annually by completing one year of full - time study at a community college , even without earning a degree .
Men earn 5.1 % more annually for each year of full - time equivalent coursework completed , even though no degree was obtained .
" The findings illustrate that the labor market returns to education at community colleges are substantial , " noted Marcotte .
" Clearly , enrolling in classes to improve skills , even without obtaining a degree , has considerable economic benefit .
There is consistent evidence that average wages and salaries for young men and women who earn associate degrees from community colleges are substantially higher than for those without postsecondary education . "
According to the American Association of Community Colleges , the average expected lifetime earnings for a graduate with an associate degree is $ 1.6 million — about $ .4 million more than what a high school graduate earns .
He says the findings of this research confirm this finding and illustrate the benefits by gender and that there are significant benefits even if the person does n't graduate .
Full details of the study appear in the upcoming issue of Contemporary Economic Policy .
On fascism
" I am not a Nazi and never have been . "
Griffin was convicted in 1998 of inciting racial hatred for articles that denied the Holocaust and praised the Waffen - SS .
On immigration
" The indigenous people of Britain have been victims of a genocide in recent months " .
The BNP leader first publicly referred to a " bloodless genocide ' ' when commenting in April on the language in the party 's " Language and Concepts Discipline " manual , which says that black and Asian Britons should be called " resident foreigners ' , saying recent mass immigration was denying the English their ownidentity , and that the children of migrants did not become British simply by being born in Britain : " In a very subtle way , it 's a sort of bloodless genocide . "
Analysis :
The BNP claims that within 60 years the " indigenous British will become an ethnic minority in their own country " .
While it is true that 24 % of births in 2008 were to non-UK mothers , foreign - born people make up no more than 11 % of the UK 's total population .
Britain has just experienced the largest wave of immigration in recent history – mostly from Poland – but it is thought that half have already gone home .
On deportation
Griffin told a black member of the audience : " I am very happy for you to stay here .
We have said it is time to shut the door because this country is over - crowded , that criminals , bogus asylum seekers and people who are not loyal to this country should be deported .
Everyone else can stay . "
Analysis : BNP policy says it would deport 2 million people it claims are in Britain illegally , and stop all immigration , bar exceptional cases .
But it would also " encourage " voluntary repatriation of legal migrants and " those of foreign descent to return to their lands of ethnic origin " .
This would cover many millions of British citizens , including presumably Sir Trevor McDonald , whom Griffin professes to admire .
On Churchill and the use of a Spitfire and other wartime imagery
Griffin said : " If Churchill was alive he would belong to the BNP " .
Analysis : Churchill 's grandson , Nicholas Soames , said in May this year : " They have behaved in a disgusting manner .
They should not take my grandfather 's name in vain .
He would have been appalled by their views and the way they claim to represent the wartime generation .
It 's nonsense .
Were it possible to take action , we would .
We find it offensive and disgusting . "
The BNP uses second world war imagery to propagate an " invasion " thesis : that Britain is being occupied by foreigners , as the Nazis threatened in 1940 .
On Israel and Islam
Griffin said the BNP was the only party which , in the clashes between Israel and Gaza , " stood full square behind Israel 's right to deal with Hamas terrorists . "
Analysis :
He has replaced antisemitic rhetoric with Islamophobia .
Perhaps the most curious BNP policy is its " ironclad offer " to the Muslim world to give them a free hand in the Middle East if they will take back " all their people currently colonising this country " .
On Holocaust denial
He said EU law stopped him from explaining his beliefs on Holocaust denial and that he would be prosecuted in the French and German courts .
Analysis Holocaust denial is not illegal in Britain .
He told a court in 1998 that orthodox opinion was that 6 million Jews were gassed : " Orthodox opinion also once held that the Earth is flat " .
As the U.S. Federal Communications Commission moves toward developing formal net neutrality rules , some U.S. lawmakers and telecom - related companies have told the agency that new regulations will cause more problems than they 're worth .
FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski announced last month that he would seek to develop formal rules prohibiting Internet service providers from selectively blocking or slowing Web content and applications .
On Oct. 22 , the commission is scheduled to vote on a notice of proposed rulemaking for net neutrality rules , the first step toward developing those regulations .
But 44 companies sent a letter , dated Wednesday , to the FCC saying new regulations could hinder the development of the Internet .
" Until now , the innovators who are building the Internet and creating the advancements in telemedicine , education and the vast array of other online products and services have done so in an environment driven by competition and innovation , " said the letter , signed by Cisco Systems , Alcatel - Lucent , Corning , Ericsson , Motorola and Nokia .
" We believe government 's role in the Internet should be to support investment , jobs and new technologies , especially if they increase the opportunity for all Americans to connect online . "
Instead , new net neutrality rules could prohibit broadband providers from offering advanced and well - managed networks , the companies said .
" Public policy should encourage more investment to expand access to the Internet , whether it is access through a cell phone , a laptop , a PC or any new device that we have yet to imagine , " the letter said .
" If the FCC takes a prescriptive approach to new regulations , then it could place itself in the position of being the final arbiter of what products and services will be allowed on the Internet . "
A day earlier , a group of 18 Republican U.S. senators also sent a letter to Genachowski raising concerns about net neutrality regulations .
Broadband is growing while other segments of the U.S. economy are struggling , and there have been only a couple of examples of broadband providers blocking or slowing Web content , said the letter , spearheaded by Senator Sam Brownback , a Kansas Republican .
" When the government picks winners and losers in the marketplace , the incentive to invest disappears , " the letter said .
" We fear that the proposals you announced ... will be counterproductive and risk harming the great advancements in broadband speed and deployment that we have witnessed in recent years and will limit the freedom of the Internet . "
Net neutrality backers say new rules are necessary to protect the open nature of the Internet .
The FCC in 2005 relaxed rules requiring network providers to share their networks with competitors and without a net neutrality rule , powerful , large broadband providers could shut out Web sites or applications , net neutrality advocates say .
Net neutrality rules would protect innovators and small businesses that want equal access to broadband networks from large companies that can enter into deals with network providers , said Art Brodsky , communications director for Public Knowledge , a digital rights advocacy group .
Since 2005 , the FCC has enforced a set of net neutrality principles on a case - by - case basis , but it has never made formal regulations .
Broadband provider Comcast filed a lawsuit challenging the FCC 's authority to enforce the principles after the agency ruled in August 2008 that Comcast had to stop slowing peer - to - peer traffic in the name of network management .
Broadband providers and others opposed to net neutrality are engaged in a coordinated effort to stop the FCC effort in its tracks , Brodsky said .
Arguments that net neutrality rules will stop telecom investments in networks are " nonsense and insulting , " he said .
" All [ some ] industries do is threaten and bully .
It 's like they 're saying , ' If we do n't get what you want , then you 're not going to get your network . ' "
Telecom providers operated under network neutrality - like rules for more than 70 years and investment continued , Brodsky said .
Telecom providers and their allies " have all the resources , Democrats and Republicans , that they 've traditionally called upon , and it will obviously be incumbent on those of us who want a free and open and nondiscriminatory Internet to make the case , " he added .
BANGKOK ( Reuters ) - Norway has retained its status as the world ’s most desirable country to live in , according to U.N. data released on Monday , which ranks sub -Saharan African states afflicted by war and HIV / AIDS as the least attractive places .

Data collected prior to the global economic crisis showed people in Norway , Australia and Iceland had the best living standards , while Niger , Afghanistan and Sierra Leone scored worst in terms of human development .
The United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) index was compiled using 2007 data on GDP per capita , education , and life expectancy , and showed marked differences between the developed and developing world .
“ Despite significant improvements over time , progress has been uneven , ” UNDP said in a statement .
“ Many countries have experienced setbacks over recent decades , in the face of economic downturns , conflict - related crises and the HIV / AIDS epidemic , and this was even before the impact of the global economic crisis was felt . ”
Life expectancy in Niger was 50 , about 30 years shorter than Norway , according to the index .
For every dollar earned per person in Niger , $ 85 was earned in Norway .
Half the people in the poorest 24 countries were illiterate , compared to 20 percent in nations classed as having medium levels of human development , the index showed .
Japanese people lived longer than others , to 82.7 years on average , with life expectancy in war - ravaged Afghanistan just 43.6 years .
Liechtenstein has the highest GDP per capita at $ 85,383 in a tiny principality home to 35,000 people , 15 banks and more than 100 wealth management companies .
People were poorest in the Democratic Republic of Congo , where average income per person was $ 298 per year .
Five countries -- China , Venezuela , Peru , Colombia and France -- climbed three or more places from the previous year , driven by greater earnings and longer life expectancy .
China , Colombia and Venezuela also scored better due to improvements in education .
UNDP , which has published the index annually since 1990 , said human development had improved globally by 15 percent since 1980 , with China , Iran and Nepal the biggest climbers in the chart .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In the end , pay czar Kenneth Feinberg 's hardest case was AIG .
The troubled insurer lobbied hard to let three of its executives keep their bonuses .
AIG told Feinberg that three executives , who were entitled to large retention payments , were particularly critical to the company 's long - term financial success and should be able to keep their bonuses .
Feinberg said Thursday that he relented in the case of AIG even though he was able to pare down similar pay clauses at the other six companies in his purview .
Feinberg was appointed by President Obama in June to oversee executive compensation at companies getting bailout funds .
On Thursday he unveiled a sweeping plan to rein in pay for top executives at the seven most heavily bailed out companies .
When it came to AIG 's request , Feinberg said he thought long and hard .
In finally agreeing to the special cases , he said that paying those employees bonuses was in the public interest , since they were needed to help AIG pay back the government .
" We listened very , very carefully to [ AIG CEO Robert ] Benmosche , " said Feinberg on Friday at George Washington Law School in Washington .
" AIG compensation practices are unique .
They are on the cusp .
We took into account independent , very credible opinions of others to come up with a package that we think will help AIG thrive . "
In exchange for allowing them to keep their retention bonuses , Feinberg trimmed their 2009 salaries for the last two months of the year and for 2010 .
" AIG had one very thorny situation , " said Feinberg at a media briefing on Thursday .
" In that particular case , I gave a it a lot of thought and decided that if AIG wants these contracts enforced in cash , they 're entitled to those contracts enforced in cash . "
It appears from a table provided by Feinberg 's office that the three employees will receive bonuses of about $ 4 million , $ 5 million and $ 7 million .
Feinberg did not identify the executives by name or salary .
" The fact of the matter is , I met with AIG officials ; there is clearly an understanding that the contracts are valid , " Feinberg told CNN on Thursday .
" Since those contracts are valid , I did take dollars into account for setting compensation for 2009 and 2010 . "
A spokeswoman for AIG said Thursday the company was still looking into the matter .
CEO pay OK , other bonuses get dropped
In addition to those three executives , Feinberg also ruled on ten others at AIG .
One of them was chief executive Robert Benmosche , who joined AIG in August .
The pay czar had already approved the CEO 's pay package on Oct.
2 . The new CEO will receive $ 10.5 million in annual compensation , including $ 3 million in cash , $ 4 million in stock options and $ 3.5 million in annual performance bonuses .
For executives at AIG 's Financial Products division , the unit that was responsible for the insurer 's near - collapse , Feinberg ruled that they should only receive their base salaries and no other compensation " of any kind . "
AIG had proposed bonuses for those employees , but Feinberg shot them down .
" The performance of AIG Financial Products has contributed significantly to the deterioration in AIG 's financial health , " Feinberg wrote in his letter to AIG explaining his pay decisions .
" Accordingly , the Special Master has determined that AIG 's proposed compensation structures for these employees are inconsistent with the public interest . "
CEO tells employees pay czar 's reach ' quite limited '
The news comes a day after Benmosche sought to assure his staff that the pay czar 's reach will be limited , according to a memo that the CEO sent employees late Wednesday .
In the memo , Benmosche said that Feinberg does not have the jurisdiction to adjust the compensation of the vast majority of AIG employees .
Benmosche said early reports on Feinberg 's ruling on AIG 's compensation were inaccurate but did not say which contracts in particular he was referring to .
" It is important for all of you to know that the Special Master 's jurisdiction is quite limited , " said Benmosche in the memo .
" He specifically has advised us that he is not requiring any retroactive salary adjustments . "
Separately , AIG has asked Feinberg to make a recommendation on how to proceed with the remaining $ 198 million in controversial bonuses to employees of its Financial Products division .
There was a great deal of public uproar after AIG paid employees of that division $ 168 million in bonuses in March , and AIG indicated it wanted the government 's seal of approval for the next payment .
Those bonuses were contracted in late 2008 , with half to be paid in 2009 and half in 2010 .
Even though those bonuses fall outside his jurisdiction , Feinberg has the ability to issue recommendations on bonuses that were contracted before February 2009 .
According to a recent report from Neil Barofsky , the special inspector general of the $ 700 billion bailout program , Feinberg has recommended to AIG that the full $ 198 million not be paid out in full .
Feinberg has not yet made a specific recommendation to AIG about how much the insurer should reduce the payments , according to Barofsky .

Report : CIA closes bin Laden search unit
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The CIA says efforts to hunt down Osama bin Laden are as strong as ever , despite a report that the agency has shut down a unit that hunted for the al - Qaeda leader and his top lieutenants .
The New York Times reports two dozen analysts in the unit were re-assigned to other counter - terrorism duties late last year .
Officials tell the newspaper the move came amid growing concern in the agency about al - Qaeda - inspired groups carrying out attacks independent of bin Laden .
But officials stress that finding the elusive terror leader remains a high priority .
The recent book Ghost Wars says some in the CIA were uncomfortable with the unit , saying its zeal for capturing bin Laden took on a cult - like atmosphere .
A former senior CIA official who once headed the unit tells the Times that the move reflects the view that bin Laden is no longer the threat he once was .
But he says that view is mistaken .
