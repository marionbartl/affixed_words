Be careful what you wish for .
Barack Obama wanted the American presidency , and with a brilliant campaign he won it .
As late as early this summer , disbelief could still be suspended .
Cartoonists were still depicting him as Superman , leaping over every problem mere mortals might put in his way .
But he too has now been exposed as a mere mortal .
He 's not soaring over problems .
Rather , he may be crushed by them .
" America – we are passing through a time of great trial , " he told the assembled cadets at West Point as he presented his new strategy for Afghanistan , and never was a truer word spoken .
His country is struggling to cope with unprecedented deficits and debt , stretching as far as the eye can see .
Iran grows more truculent by the day .
His signature issue of healthcare could well die a slow death in the Senate .
We knew the chalice he inherited was poisoned .
We just did n't realise quite how venomous was the brew inside .
And then there 's Afghanistan .
Watching Obama make the most important speech of his presidency on Tuesday was a profoundly depressing experience – and not just because the man who will receive the Nobel Peace Prize next week is plunging deeper into war .

Yes , the address was deftly calibrated .
The generals have got most of what they want ; if Nato chips in as promised , General Stanley McChrystal 's request for 40,000 men will roughly be met .
Liberals , and not only liberals , in his own party can be consoled at the prospect of a withdrawal starting in mid-2011 , just when Obama 's re-election campaign will get going in earnest .
But it 's virtually impossible to believe this timetable .
The goal is to " disrupt , dismantle and defeat " al - Q'aida , and to break the momentum of the Taliban .
That however is a huge gamble , however intense the pressure on the Karzai government and however skilful the suborning of tribal leaders .
Can either the central or local Afghan authorities really start taking over from the US within 18 months , even if the extra troops put the Taliban on the back foot ?
And then there 's the even huger gamble of Pakistan , without which a durable success in Afghanistan is impossible – but whose size , nuclear weaponry and instability make it even less susceptible to American influence .
Yet he failed to convince that this rolling of the dice was worth it .
Watching and listening to Obama , you felt this was a commander - in - chief whose heart ( and stomach ) were not in this war , but whose head , guided by political realities , had convinced him he must continue .
You can't blame him for that : politicians who ignore political realities have a very short shelf - life .
But in a deeper sense , that 's why the spectacle was so sad .
Right - wing commentators in Washington have been praising Obama for his " courage " in deciding to escalate an unpopular war .
They point out how in late 2006 , when his presidency was at a far lower ebb than Obama 's is now , President George W Bush ordered his surge in Iraq , in the teeth of fierce opposition , including from within his own party .
And it is true that the surge has at minimum allowed the US to start the withdrawal now under way ( though whether it has brought real stability to Iraq is quite another matter ) .
That is the most Obama can hope for in Afghanistan .
But real courage this time would have been to declare , if not a withdrawal , at least that no more troops would be sent .
Despite his despatch of more soldiers earlier this year , a window was still open to reverse course .
Afghanistan until Tuesday night was still Bush 's war .
No longer .
The logic of the address did n't add up .
Everyone knows that Afghanistan was a punitive war , to eradicate the al - Q'aida presence from the country after 9/11 and capture Osama bin Laden and his high command .
But that last goal failed , and though al - Qa'ida seems to have been weakened there , the virus it carries has spread much further afield .
If Afghanistan , then why not Somalia , Yemen , or somewhere else ?
A direct no to the generals , or a massive boost in troops , would both have made more sense in military terms .
Instead , Obama presented a plan that split the difference .
The immediate reaction has been relatively favourable .
Remarkably , according to a new Gallup poll , 51 per cent of Americans support the new strategy .
But that surely reflects the lingering popularity of Obama the man , rather than any new embrace of a war of which the country is heartily fed up , and about whose outcome it remains pessimistic .
And this fragile approval may well evaporate when the Afghan war season returns in the spring , when a larger American force starts to sustain larger casualties .
What then ?
What happens if this surge produces no measurable results ?
Come 2011 , it is far more likely he 'll be announcing a delay in withdrawal 's start , or even be facing demands from his generals for even more men " to finish the job . "
More than 40 years ago , an earlier Democratic president named Lyndon B Johnson , with a no less ambitious domestic agenda than Obama , was confronted by the same choice .
We all know how Vietnam ended .
No two conflicts are exactly alike .
But with every passing month , the similarities between Vietnam and Afghanistan grow .
George Orwell once observed that the quickest way to end a war is to lose it – but losing a war is also the quickest way to lose a presidency , too .
That reasoning prevailed with LBJ , though Vietnam forced him out of the White House regardless .
For Obama , the stakes are as high now .
An open - ended commitment to nation - building in Afghanistan was out , he said at West Point , " because the nation that I am most interested in building is our own . "
Obama 's quest is for a fairer society , offering health care for all and an end to financial excesses , , and an America whose future has not been hopelessly mortgaged to pay for the feckless present .
The great promise of this presidency was that it would usher in a new way of doing politics .
It would , as they say , break the mould .
But the Afghan speech , so full of politics as usual , gave the lie to that .
We all should be careful what we wish for .

It does not necessarily have to feed to the computer until it is done ( like a digital record of the game and then upload to computer ) I am open to any suggestions .
There 's a great article in TIME magazine by Amanda Ripley ( I wrote a review of her great book , " The Unthinkable " in the City Journal ) on one of the most under covered security lessons of 9/11 : that an aware citizenry can defend itself .
It ends with this telling para which depicts the government reasserting its authority to prop up its legitimacy :
After the passengers [ heroes ] of Flight 253 deplaned in Detroit , they were held in the baggage area for more than five hours until FBI agents interviewed them .
They were not allowed to call their loved ones .
They were given no food .
When one of the pilots tried to use the bathroom before a bomb - sniffing dog had finished checking all the carry - on bags , an officer ordered him to sit down , according to passenger Alain Ghonda , who thought it odd .
" He was the pilot .
If he wanted to do anything , he could 've crashed the plane . "
It was a metaphor for the rest of the country : Thank you for saving the day .
Now go sit down .
The same spirit of being in control , regardless of government inaction / incompetence , should be true for other aspects of our lives under a similar assault by a global system run amok .
What am I talking about ?
Our economic and societal future .
If it 's not clear to you already after seeing a global economic meltdown caused by the gluttony of financial parasites , it should be .
But it 's worse than that .
The entire system has failed to produce anything resembling improvement in our lives for years :
Median male incomes today are the same as they were in 1974 in the US ( and likely all over the western world ) .
No progress has been made despite a doubling of productivity and massive top line GDP growth .
Worse , given that female incomes are n't on par with male incomes yet , the typical American family makes much less per hour worked than in 1974 .
as they were in 1974 in the US ( and likely all over the western world ) .
No progress has been made despite a doubling of productivity and massive top line GDP growth .
Worse , given that female incomes are n't on par with male incomes yet , the typical American family makes much less per hour worked than in 1974 .
All of the requirements for entry into the middle class are now private expenses .
From health care to a college education , if you can't afford the minimum ( let alone high quality versions ) , you are n't allowed entry .
Worse , those expenses are spiraling out of control at rates many times the rate of inflation .
Nothing is being done to address this .
The system is geared to make us fail .
Not only has outsourcing / off - shoring just started ( everything that can be moved offshore to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity in wage disparities between western and workers in developing countries will be ) we are being laden with un -repayable debt .
To wit : there 's been NO job growth in the last decade ( despite tens of millions in population growth ) and total debt from all sources is still near ALL time historical highs .
To add insult to injury , efforts to correct any of the above through governmental or regulatory reform have failed miserably ( the government and both parties have been captured by transnational business interests ) : from endless bailouts to industries actually writing the legislation that covers them to guarantee rich profit growth while solving nothing meaningful ( as we saw with both the recent health care and finance bills ) .
We are at a dead end .
So , take control .
NOTE : My solution is to form a tribal layer .
Resilient communities that are connected by a network platform ( a darknet ) .
A decentralized and democratic system that can provide you a better interface with the dominant global economic system than anything else I can think of .
Not only would this tribe protect you from shocks and predation by this impersonal global system , it would provide you with the tools and community support necessary to radically improve how you and your family does across all measures of consequence .
Of course , this may not be the right solution for you , but if it is ...
NOTE2 : Seems like the term darknet is confusing people .
Going to need to rethink the branding and terminology .

Vesta Near Opposition
Credit & Copyright : Jimmy Westlake
Explanation : Main belt asteroid 4 Vesta is at its brightest now .
The small world is near opposition ( opposite the Sun in the sky ) and closest to Earth .
But even at its brightest , Vesta is just too faint to spot with the naked - eye .
Still , over the next few days it will be relatively easy to find in the constellation Leo , sharing a typical binocular field of view with bright star Gamma Leonis ( aka Algieba ) .
In fact on February 16 Vesta passed between Gamma Leonis and close neighbor on the sky 40 Leonis .
Gamma Leonis is the brightest star in these two panels , while the second brightest star , 40 Leonis , is directy to its right .
As marked , Vesta is the third brightest " star " in the field .
Vesta shifts position between the two panels from well below 40 Leonis on Feb. 14 to near the top of the frame from Feb. 16 , shooting the gap between the close Gamma / 40 Leonis pair .
Of course , premier close - up views of the asteroid will be possible after the ion-powered Dawn spacecraft arrives at Vesta in August of 2011 .
I have to thank Jeremy Grantham for referencing Albert Bartlett ’s talk , “ Arithmetic , Population , & Energy ” , in his semi annual letter to partners .
It inspired me to track down Professor Bartlett and interview him for our readers .
Introduction / Background
Professor Albert Bartlett Emeritus Professor of Physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder .
In the public space Professor Bartlett is most well known for his lecture titled Arithmetic , Population , and Energy .
A Lecture he has given over 1,600 times since September , 1969 .
Bartlett joined the faculty of the University of Colorado in Boulder in September 1950 .
His B.A. degree in physics is from Colgate University ( 1944 ) and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in physics are from Harvard University ( 1948 ) , ( 1951 ) .
In 1978 he was national president of the American Association of Physics Teachers .
He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
In 1969 and 1970 he served two terms as the elected Chair of the four - campus Faculty Council of the University of Colorado .
Question & Answers ( Copyright 2009 - 2010 Miguel Barbosa & Albert Bartlett )
You have become very famous for your talk , “ Arithmetic , Population , and Energy . ”
What motivated you to create this talk ?
In the late 1960 ’s I began to realize that people did n’t understand the large numbers that result from steady growth rates .
So , forty years ago I developed the talk ; I ’ve given it an average of once every 8.7 days for 40 years .
Why do you think people have such difficulty understanding ( compounding ) growth rates ?
It ’s arithmetic ; people do n’t like arithmetic .
You hear it at cocktail parties .
People say , “ Oh , I ’m terrible at arithmetic . ”
You never hear anyone say “ I ca n’t read or write . ”
My impression is that after my talk people understand it very quickly .
Years ago I gave it very slowly and in two parts to junior high school students .
After the second part , two little kids came up and said , “ We can understand it , why ca n’t grownups ? ”
You ’re a physicist ; how did you become interested in physics ?
And how did you land a job at Los Alamos ?
I had a high school physics course that I enjoyed very much .
After high school I went to college , but dropped out to work on steamboats in the Great Lakes .
After working for a while , I transferred to Colgate University , took my first college physics class , did well , and stuck with it .
Richard Feynman once said , “ If there was anything more fun than physics I ’d be doing it . ” … He could n’t seem to find anything more fun .
The same applies to me .
Did you meet Richard Feynman ?
Yes .
I was at Los Alamos during the war …whenever he would lecture the entire lab would stop to listen to him .
He was simultaneously a great physicist and a great clown .
What about Niels Bohr ?
Tell us about your experiences meeting with him .
“ I was sitting at the lunch counter and Niels Bohr sat down beside me .
I was amazed . ”
What was it like being around these scientists ?
I was in constant awe .
I ’d often ask myself how ended up in such a place .
I barely had a Bachelors degree .
But that was sufficient to get me into these secret meetings .
I went religiously to those meeting and one thing led to another .
Do you think most politicians understand growth rates , but prefer to look the other way ?
These are chamber of commerce types : promoters , builders , architects .
Their business is promoting growth .
But the single thing to note is that , both at the community level and national level , growth does n’t pay for itself .
The more you grow the greater your debt load .
Colorado has had decades of wild and largely uncontrolled growth and is now practically bankrupt .
People become fed up with the constant increases in taxes needed to pay the costs of growth and they vote for tax limitation measures .
Unfortunately , the growth promoters seem to find ways around these limitations , so the growth continues and the consequent problems escalate rapidly .
We can see this happening in California and we have a similar situation brewing in Colorado .
What you are implying is that true growth would lead to profitability and thus state governments could accumulate reserves ?
Rational people ( leaders ) would have reserves for lean years .
In fact this reminds me – there ’s a little book called , “ Better Not Bigger ” by Eben Fodor .
He looks at the municipal costs of growth in various communities .
He estimates that every new house built in Oregon costs the Oregon taxpayer something in the order of $ 25,000 in costs not paid by taxes on the construction of the home itself .
This reminds us of utilities companies …
Utilities right now are fighting around the country to get more coal and nuclear plants around the country .
What they are really fighting for , and what they normally get , is the right to tax customers for the costs of planning and construction . .
In a more rational world the investors would bear these responsibilities , and when the plant was finished you could figure the cost into the rate system - so that the people that built it would be reimbursed .
Now , rather than going out and borrowing money they want to get money from rate payers while they are planning .
Often state regulators are allowing utilities to charge payers for planning costs - and it is n’t even clear that the plants will be built .
This is a perpetual growth promoting situation .
If companies grew for very long periods at high rates ( say 15 % plus ) within a matter of years we would all be working forthem .
Some investors fail to realize that growth eventually undoes itself .
That is to say growth is mean reverting .
For you or me any additional physical growth would either be ; obesity or cancer .
There ’s a time to grow , yet when you reach maturity any further growth is detrimental .
Your book titled , “ The Essential Exponential for the Future of our Planet , ” contains a chapter called , “ Democracy Cannot Survive Overpopulation , ” in which you argue convincingly that overpopulation , by raising the number of constituents per elected official , makes it harder for individuals to gain access to representatives and have a voice in politics .
Also , overpopulation breeds government regulation to cope with problems caused by population pressure .
Yes , this is a very important issue .
To be exact , I took the title of the chapter from Issac Asimov .
Here ’s an example :
When I moved to Boulder Colorado ( in 1950 ) the population was 20,000 and there were 9 city members on the council .
Today the population is 100,000 and there are still only 9 city members on the council .
So in effect today we only have 20 % of the democracy we use to have in 1950 .
In essence , it ’s harder for the individual to have access to a representative ?
Of course .
In the decade of the 1990 ’s the US population grew by 13.1 % , while the number of members in the House of Representatives did n’t grow at all .
So we can say that at the national level , democracy declined by 13.1 % Furthermore , the Constitution requires that the government perform what is called redistricting .
This happens after every census .
Redistricting ensures that the populations of districts are equal across the country .
In our example , the average district needed to have 13.1 % more constituents after the 2000 census than after the 1990 ’s census .
This means that every district went from approximately 600,000 constituents to approximately 700,000 constituents .
Compare that with the first Congress where the makeup was 30,000 constituents per member of Congress .
It ’s true that women did n’t vote and thus the electorate makeup was different , but you can imagine one person in Congress representing 30,000 .
It ’s much harder to imagine one person representing 700,000 people .
Every district in the country had to grow by 100,000 people .
There ’s no way you can represent that many people .
So it ’s much easier as a politician to take your ideas from the lobbyist who has plenty of money .
As a result we now often get one dollar - one vote versus what use to be one person - one vote .
Are you suggesting there ’s a crowding out effect ?
That is to say , in a time of many important issues ( global warming , health care , and financial crises ) people are alienated ?
Yes , that ’s right .
You say the terms “ sustainable ” and “ sustainability ” are popularly used to describe “ activities that are ecologically laudable , ” but unsustainable .
How can the average reader interested in learning about sustainability decide whether publications are seeking to illuminate or obfuscate ?
Slogans are seemingly designed to “ sustain ” optimistm and vagueness .
There are a few organizations devoted to alert people of the dangers of population growth .
There ’s a group called Californians for Population Stabilization .
There ’s a real good group in Washington called Negative Population Growth ; they have the best series of monographs of any group I ’m aware of .
You can find them on the web at npg.org .
How do you approach reading periodicals that present confusing growth rates ?
I approach periodicals with skepticism and look for absurdities .
Remember that politicians will try to claim that there is n’t a conflict between saving the environment and smart growth .
Unfortunately , both smart growth and dumb growth destroy the environment .
The only difference is that smart growth destroys the environment with good taste .
It ’s like buying a ticket on the Titanic , if you ’re smart you go first class .
But the outcome is the same … the boat still sinks .
Well if the outcome is the same , then most sustainable solutions are pseudosolutions .
Tells us about pseudosolutions …
It ’s so discouraging when you see Al Gore ’s book & film , “ An Inconvenient Truth . ”
Early in his book he says population growth has changed our whole way of life .
With those words he is saying that he understands that population growth is the cause of the problem .
Unfortunately at the end of his book when outlining the things you can do to avoid environmental problems ( changing bulbs etc ) , Gore never mentions curbing population growth .
This behavior is what Mark Twain would call a “ silent lie . ”
If you have information that would help other people if you shared it , but you kee it hidden .
Then you are guilty of what Mark Twain would call a silent lie .
In 1994 , you wrote “ In the manner of Alice in Wonderland , and without regard for accuracy or consistency , ‘ sustainability ’ seems to have been redefined flexibly to suit a variety of wishes and conveniences . ”
How are you seeing sustainability used by current politicians and businesses ?
Has it gotten worse ?
And what are the most recent clear examples of misuse of sustainability by politicians ?
I could n’t quantify it , but I believe so .
Everything now is called “ sustainable . ”
It ’s the “ in ” thing to do , whether it ’s sustainable or not .
According to your interpretation of the Tragedy of the Commons ( Hardin 1968 ) your writings suggest that there will always be large opposition to programs of making population growth pay for itself .
Those who profit from ( uneconomic ) growth will use their considerable resources to convince the community that the community should pay the costs of growth .
How does the tragedy of the commons relate to launching wars ?
The world ’s oceans are a perfect example of the tragedy of the commons .
By and large they are unmanaged commons and they are destroyed by high tech fisheries .
This is tragic for local fishermen who have lived off the oceans for centuries .
Small conflicts over resources can lead to wars . ”
When it comes to war … look at Iraq .
The poor GIs getting shot and killed are paying an enormous cost .
Bush seems to think there is a law of conservation of terrorists , that is to say , “ There are a certain number of terrorists in the world and you kill them all and you solve the problem . ”
Unfortunately , this does n’t solve the problem at all .
We are n’t reducing terrorism ; rather , we are increasing it .
Where does the role of economist , Kenneth Boulding , play into the topic of population growth ?
He ’s one of the few economists that I can respect .
He was a colleague at the University of Colorado .
He is known for saying that , “ Anyone who thinks that steady growth can continue indefinitely , is either a madman or an economist . ”
I once asked Boulding if he said that , he gave me a funny smile and said , “ Yes , I think so . ”
Boulding ’s three laws are related to sustainability .
In fact , in my opinion , they say it all .
The second law is the important one .
It says , the solution to problems create more problems .
“ The main source of problems is solutions .
Excerpt of Boulding ’s Three Laws :
First Theorem : “ The Dismal Theorem ”
If the only ultimate check on the growth of population is misery , then the population will grow until it is miserable enough to stop its growth .
Second Theorem : “ The Utterly Dismal Theorem ”
This theorem states that any technical improvement can only relieve misery for a while , for so long as misery is the only check on population , the [ technical ] improvement will enable population to grow , and will soon enable more people to live in misery than before .
The final result of [ technical ] improvements , therefore , is to increase the equilibrium population which is to increase the total sum of human misery .
Third Theorem : “ The moderately cheerful form of the Dismal Theorem ” Fortunately , it is not too difficult to restate the Dismal Theorem in a moderately cheerful form , which states that if something else , other than misery and starvation , can be found which will keep a prosperous population in check , the population does not have to grow until it is miserable and starves , and it can be stably prosperous .
Until we know more , the Cheerful Theorem remains a question mark .
Misery we know will do the trick .
This is the only sure - fire automatic method of bringing population to equilibrium .
Other things may do it .
This is reminiscent of Eric Sevareid ’s Law – The Chief Cause of Problems is Solutions .
In a society as complex as ours is there a way around this issue ?
I do n’t believe there is a way around this issue .
In a society as complex as ours it ’s impossible to anticipate the interaction of all agents .
It ’s very much like the operation of the National Electric Grid .
No one knows exactly how it operates .
So if a squirrel crosses the wrong power line the east coast can go without power .
These things do in fact happen .
More importantly , because our system is so complex it ’s vulnerable .
If we are talking about a war on terror we would n’t want such a vulnerable system .
In preparation for this interview you sent us a book review .
My favorite quote from this review is the following : “ A society that is totally dependent on high tech for the functioning of every aspect of the lives of its people is vulnerable to disruption by acts of God and acts of people .
The complexities of our pres¬ent infrastructure predictably lead to unpredictable failures .
More complex infrastructures anticipated for the future will probably experience larger unpredictable failures . ”
There is big talk in Europe right now about putting large fields of solar collectors in the Sahara Desert and then transmitting the power under the Mediterranean Sea to Europe .
It looks good on paper , but the long extended transmission lines will be vulnerable to the forces of nature and to terrorists .
A small group of individuals could deprive Europe of a big fraction of its electricity for long periods of time .
“ Insanity ” is the only word I can think of to describe plans to build this incredibly expensive system that is so transparently vulnerable to sabotage . ”
In other words , complex infrastructure (s ) translate into unpredictable failures .
When it comes to alternative energy , most solutions are complex .
What ’s your opinion of alternative energy sources ?
If alternative energies are to replace existing technologies very sizable investments would be required .
I often wonder if there is enough capital in the world to replace this existing energy production , that is , to go from coal & natural gas to geothermal , wind or or solar .
I do n’t know the answer to the investment question .
What I do know is that it ’s very difficult to manage wind energy .
Currently , coal plants provide base loads and then natural gas ( or hydroelectric ) turbines are used to meet peak loads .
But when you factor wind into your management scheme things become very difficult .
You do n’t know where the wind is blowing , how much , when , or in what direction it ’s blowing .
Then you have to factor this into your management .
With 5 % of your electricity coming from wind this “ might ” be manageable but to increase it to 50 % or 60 % it ’s very difficult .
Most people do n’t pay attention to the difficulties of managing electrical demand .
Is the culprit of global warming population growth ?
Are you suggesting that unless we have major breakthroughs in technology population growth will undermine most current energy initiatives ?
Al Gore understands that population growth is the problem .
But he does n’t recommend doing anything to reduce overpopulation which is the cause of the problems ..
It is politically incorrect to talk about population growth .
The last US president that worried about population was Richard Nixon .
He charted a major study called “ The Rockefeller Commission Report . ”
This study was put together by some very talented people .
Their conclusion was simple ; they could n’t see any benefit to further population growth in the US .
Unfortunately , the study was put on the shelf and forgotten .
This reminds me of the Red Queen … the more she runs the more the walls / scenery catch up .
What can we do ?
This is something Malthus understood years ago .
We still have economists and politicians that claim that Malthus was wrong .
This is nonsense .
I ’ve read Malthus three times and he presents population problems very clearly .
The message of Malthus , translated to today ’s problems would be something like this : “ Population growth has the potential to outstrip the growth in production of any of the resources that are necessary to sustain our population .
This is as true today as it was a hundred years ago when he wrote his essay .
I ’d like to ask you a question from the title of your own piece , “ Why have scientists succumbed to political correctness ? ”
I do n’t know .
I think there is a widespread feeling amongst scientists and certainly among the population that science and technology will save us , so why worry about it ?
Here ’s a story …
I was once met with a state senator ; he said to me “ I ’m not worried about running out of petroleum , you ( pointing to me ) scientists will figure out what ever we need . ”
So I asked him what was the last new source of energy scientists found ?
He did n’t have an answer ,
so I suggested nuclear power – the process was discovered in Germany in 1939 .
Enrico Fermi had a reactor operating in 1942 .
By 1956 we had first commercial nuclear power reactor in this country .
Since then , we have spent billions of public and private dollars and we only receive 20 % of our electricity from nuclear power .
Innovation on the large scale required by our overpopulated society will take time and costs billions of dollars ..
Even if science / technology develops the appropriate energy solutions .
These solutions would have to be developed and implemented at the same rate as the population growth ?
What you must realize is that technological improvements by design allow for and encourage more growth .
This is like prescribing aspirin for cancer .
As for the timing you ’re absolutely right : while technology develops populations keep compounding .
And because the scale is so large it ’s impossible to implement changes quick enough .
In other words , it ’s very difficult to get 30 % of the population using hybrid electric cars in anything short of 20 years .
Let ’s talk about employment .
Does growth solve unemployment problems ?
If creating jobs reduced unemployment , Colorado would have negative unemployment ( or whatever that means ) .
For decades we have been creating jobs and we still have unemployment .
No matter how many jobs you create you ca n’t get off unemployment .
This is a consequence of people moving around – a constitutionally protected right .
Newly created jobs in a community temporarily lowers the unemployment rate ( say from 5 % to 4 % ) , but then people move into the community to restore the unemployment rate to its earlier higher value ( of 5 % ) .
Yet this is 5 % of the no larger population , so more individuals are out of work than before .
What ’s your opinion of national unemployment rates and the recent crisis ?
For years , we have promoted an insane policy of exporting jobs and importing people .
So now it ’s catching up with us .
Any country that has to import people to do the work of the country is unsustainable .
One cannot sustain a world in which some regions have high standards of living while others have low standards of living .
All countries cannot simultaneously be net importers of carrying capacity .
World trade involves the exportation and importation of carrying capacity .
Tell us more about carrying capacity and trade .
Carrying capacity is a measure of how many people can be supported indefinitely .
Therefore if any fraction of global warming is due to the actions of humans , this alone proves that human populations are larger than the carrying capacity of the earth .
Sustainability requires that the size of the population be less than or equal to the carrying capacity of the ecosystem for the desired standard of living .
Many economists have raised concerns over countries particularly European countries which have experienced zero population growth rates ( or negative population rates ) .
They claim that these rates will burden “ entitlements ” such as social security …
So clearly the answer is to have higher birth rates … unfortunately this only exacerbates the problems of “ sustainability . ”
What ’s your take ?
Social Security and such projects are Ponzi schemes .
They depend on having more and more people paying every year or they collapse .
In effect , Social Security will collapse when there are n’t enough young workers .
Getting the population back on the growth curve is n’t a long term answer .
That makes all the other problems more difficult .
So what you have to do is refinance social security – by raising taxes , reducing benefits , or altering the retirement age .
It ’s so sad to see European politicians offering bonuses to couples to have more children because they are afraid of slowing growth rates .
What people do n’t realize is that declining growth rates are the way to sustainability .
You talk about how zero or negative population growth rates translate into higher standards of living .
Can you comment on this ?
Thirty years ago when the Chinese put their one child per family policy , there statement of justification was that population growth interferes with economic development .
In 30 years , they have proven this is true .
We in the U.S. have n’t learned this lesson – if you spend all your resources to take care of new people you have no resources to take care of existing citizens .
That ’s interesting ; we look at China as an economic miracle .
Not many attribute much of this success to controlled population growth .
This brings me to my next question : many population problems will not be solved unless Americans are consistently implementing plans for the next 70 years .
How do we manage this given our political structures ?
Does China have an advantage ?
That ’s a great difficulty .
Planning horizons in a democracy are based in term years ( 2 , 4 , 6 years ) .
Unfortunately , if you change fertility rates it can take 50 - 70 years before you see the full effects of a change in fertility .
This is called population momentum which is a mismatch to our democracy .
Politicians implement changes that benefit us in the short term over the long term .
Have you ever calculated the required population for all countries to enjoy the standard of living experienced by Americans ?
I have n’t done that , and there is n’t any specific formula .
It depends on the standard of living .
The most I can do is quote David Pimentel who is a global agricultural scientist at Cornell University .
He says that a sustainable world population living at current US dietary level would consist of two billion people .
Furthermore , he suggests that a sustainable US population at current dietary levels would have to be around 130 - 150 million people , which is the population of the US around World War II .
So , how do we get there ?
My answer is that the government should bring the issue to the forefront and ask ; how large do we ( as a nation ) want to be and what benefit is there from population growth .
Then , we need to set goals and plan accordingly .
The key is to make family planning available widely throughout the US and the world – with the goal that every child is a wanted child .
You ’ve written that , “ The benefits of population growth accrue to a few ; while the costs are borne by all of society . ”
Let ’s enumerate some of the costs borne by society and a potential solution .
Individuals who benefit from growth will continue to exert strong pressures supporting and encouraging both population growth and growth in rates of consumption of resources .
The individuals who promote growth are motivated by the recognition that growth is good for them .
In order to gain public support for their goals , they must convince people that population growth and growth in the rates of consumption of resources are also good for society .
[ This is the Charles Wilson argument : if it is good for General Motors , it is good for the United States . ]
( Yates 1983 ) As for the costs borne by society – with increased growth you have to provide police , fire , schools , waste removal , clean water , and a variety of other infrastructure projects .
These services have to be paid for – but they are n’t paid for by growth .
Schools in particular suffer .
The school systems get their operating expenses from the taxes and to get capital expenses they have to issue bonds .
Thus , all tax payers have to pay higher taxes to accommodate schools for new kids .
The solution is to tax growth , put a tax on real estate transactions ( both at local levels and state levels ) and use this tax to fund new projects .
Where are most economists confused on this issue of growth rates & consumption ?
Economists think of infinite substitutability .
They cite the example of shifting out of whale oil to petroleum or from wood to coal .
Economists suggest that this can continue indefinitely .
Unfortunately there are no close substitutes for petroleum .
Furthermore , we already know which substitutes exist and they are very costly to access .
The substitutability age is no longer as prominent .
What books would you recommend we read to understand population growth rate issues ?
I recommend reading Richard Heinberg ’s books , “ Peak Oil ” and “ Peak Everything . ”
He clearly understands the issues .
Is there any hope given the actions of the current administration ?
I certainly welcome the new administration , but the problem is we have the same Congress .
This Congress enjoys the status quo , they are protective of their own interests , and tey listen to lobbyists .
So as someone once said , “ we have the best government money can buy . ”
Growth never pays for itself .
One of the biggest culprits is the federal government .
Almost all states have requirements for a balanced budget .
The federal government does not have this requirement .
As a consequence the federal government is now paying for state schools , highways , sewage systems , bridges .
This has happened because the local economy can’t support local population growth .
Therefore , the main responsibility of members of Congress is to bring home federal grants to pay for the results of population growth in their representative district .
Another thing to remember is that inflation is a tax on everyone .
So if the federal government issues bonds to pay for the consequences of growth ( infrastructure , etc ) this is likely to result in inflation .
Thus , we will all bear the costs .
Having looked at our national debt levels , I ’m worried that the inflation could be very severe .
That said , stopping population growth is a necessary condition for sustainability , but it is n’t a sufficient condition .
Let ’s assume we could implement population growth constraints .
What else must be done ?
Assuming you can constrain population growth rates , you have to implement every possible efficiency improvement ( meaning energy , design , etc ) .
In addition , you would have to create an environmental agency to stop polluters and require existing sources of pollution to be removed .
The US population growth rate is the highest of any industrial nation .
The US ca n’t preach for other countries to limit population growth unless we are willing to set an example and do so first .
Key Points to Remember : By Albert Bartlett :
When applied to material things , the term “ sustainable growth ” is an oxymoron .
( It is possible to have sustainable growth of non-material things such as inflation . )
Perhaps this is why inflation rates are sustainable or as some politicians would say hopefully sustainable in moderate amounts .
We have seen how major national and international reports misrepresent and downplay ( marginalize ) the quantitative importance of the arithmetic of population sizes and growth .
1 . One has to ask if it is possible to have an increase in economic activity ( growth ) without having increases in the rates of consumption of non-renewable resources ?
If so , under what conditions can this happen ?
Are we moving toward those conditions today ?
2 . What courses of action that could be followed to meet the needs of the present , but which , in doing so , would not limit the ability of generations , throughout the distant future , to meet their own needs ?
3 . The size of population that can be sustained ( the carrying capacity ) and the sustainable average standards of living of the population are inversely related to one another .
“ This runs counter to most traditional entrepreneurial myths of sustainable growth and rising standards of living ”
I come back to an Eric Sevareid quote : “ The chief cause of problems is solutions . ”
That is so important .
For example , as long as there ’s population growth , urban planning is bound to make everything worse .
Here ’s why .
Essentially all the problems planners must deal with are caused by population growth .
And planners are trained to solve problems .
For a planner , a problem is anything that inhibits population growth .
So when you solve the problem you are encouraging more population growth , and this makes everything worse .

We will continue to track your progress .
I wish you the best of health .

A generative data- visualisation of all the scientific evidence for popular health supplements by David McCandless and Andy Perkins .
I ’m a bit of a health nut .
Keeping fit .
Streamlining my diet .
I plan to live to the age of 150 in fact .
But I get frustrated by constant , conflicting reports and studies about health supplements .
Is Vitamin C worth taking or not ?
Does Echinacea kill colds ?
Am I missing out not drinking litres of Goji juice , wheatgrass extract and flaxseed oil every day ?
In an effort to give myself a quick reference guide , I dove into the scientific evidence and created a visualization for my book .
And then worked with the awesome Andy Perkins on a further interactive , generative “ living image ” .
Play with interactive version |
See the still image
This visualisation generates itself from this Google Doc .
So when new research comes out , we can quickly update the data and regenerate the image .
( How cool is that ? ? )
Hopefully then this should be a useful web resources for years to come .
About the image
This image is a “ balloon race ” .
The higher a bubble , the greater the evidence for its effectiveness .
But the supplements are only effective for the conditions listed inside the bubble .
You might also see multiple bubbles for certain supps .
These is because some supps affect a range of conditions , but the evidence quality varies from condition to condition .
For example , there ’s strong evidence that Green Tea is good for cholesterol levels .
But evidence for its anti-cancer effects is conflicting .
In these cases , we give a supp another bubble .
The evidence
We only considered large , human , randomized placebo - controlled trials in our data scrape – wherever possible .
No animal trials .
No cell studies .
Many of the health claims made by the $ 23 billion supplements industry are based on non-human trials .
We wanted to cut through that .
This piece was doggedly researched by myself , and researchers Pearl Doughty - White and Alexia Wdowski .
We looked at the abstracts of over 1500 studies on PubMed ( run by US National Library Of Medicine ) and Cochrane.org ( which hosts meta- studies of scientific research ) .
It took us several months to seek out the evidence – or lack of .
You can see our key results in this spreadsheet .

Ferfal ,
So I 've read every post on your blog .
I have your book , about half way through it .
Implementing as much as I can , as money become available .
My question is this :
If you had to pick three things that you did , three pivotal events that occurred to you , or three circumstances you & your family were in ; that helped you & your family keep your head above the water , that keeps you in a better position than your fellow countrymen , what would you answer ?
In all my reading the conclusion I 'm coming to , is survival is n't so much about what you have , or where you are , but more where you are headed .
Surviving is a direction , not a condition .
I 'm sure having as little debt as possible & owning your own business / having your own stream of income would be on that list , but I 'm hoping maybe you could point out a few other small discriminators to success .
Thanks for all your work & advice .
I check the blog daily for new posts .
Richard
Hi Richard , you pretty much nailed it there .
Its not what you have , but the way you decide to live you life .
There are of course some material things that simply cannot be improvised , but mindset is more important .
The three pivotal differences between me and most Argentines ; While growing up I had a family that was pretty unique in many ways .
Economically speaking we were middle class , maybe just a bit above average middle class income .
The big difference was that while our neighbors went out for dinner every weekend , while they bought expensive cars , toys , quads , jetsky , my parents invested their money .
We also had traveled some , you could say that was our only real luxury , and we had lived in Boston for three years when I was little .
That gave us a different perspective of things regarding a )
We knew better than our own country B )
The idea of moving somewhere else and starting over was n’t something that scared us or was beyond our limits .
Education was also a priority .
Bad grades where simply not accepted and we were expected to always be among the top students of our classes .
We also knew the value of a second language , and its has been by FAR the most valuable tool we took form school .
My brother , my sister , they both got their jobs within their different lines of work thanks to their fluent English .
I sure ended up using English a lot as well .
:-) Tip :
You want to do something for your kids that will give them an invaluable tool when they grow up ?
Get them Spanish lessons .
Unless you are a certain way , you do n’t think about preparing for difficult times .
The mindset you have , the way your brain is wired leads you to prepare for blackouts , store supplies , batteries , food , water , so having certain mindset is crucial and leads to other preparations .
I also had lots of luck regarding firearms training .
When I was 15 years old I took my first shooting course .
One on one with an Army Major , the complete course lasted about 3 months or so , several times a week learning to fire autos and revolvers of various calibers and models , as well as shooting under stress and target recognition .
These days classes such as that are almost non existent .
They usually last a day or two , if not just a couple hours .
So that gave me a good edge as well .
I was n’t winning shooting tournaments or anything , but at that age I could handle firearms safely for self defense .
Mindset also makes you learn new things , plan ahead for problems , learn from history and prepare for events .
Thanks to smart family investment , when things got ugly , we had financial investments that allowed us to get by .
Please understand what I mean by family investment :
While our “ rich ” neighbors spend their weekend partying , going to restaurants or spending a couple days on some cabin somewhere , we would spend our weekend working to restore a small “ fixer - upper ” house to resell , painting , carpeting , polishing floors and gardening .
We all worked pretty hard .
I also learned to use tools and fix just about any thing in a house as well .
When you teach your kids these lessons at an early age , they understand the value of money , investing and hard work .
When there was no jobs to be found , there were still things that could be done in the family .
We had a small accounting office , and that ’s were my sister and I worked for some time when there were no jobs around .
Not much money to be made , but some is always better than none .
Currently I ’m self employed .
Thanks to the success the book had , the blog and other projects , I do n’t suffer the inflation and unemployment as much as others in my country do .
This is a huge difference and certainly a key point to keep in mind .
For an American , this would be the equivalent of being able to work for UK or European countries as the local economy goes down .
Of course its not easy , but having the ability to do so makes all the difference during a crisis .
Tip : Having a family business of some sort or being your own boss and being self employed is a key element during times like these .
People will generally go for it once things get ugly or they already got fired .
Trust me , its better if you start right away , before you ’re desperate for income .
Even if its part time or just done on weekends , its better to start right now .
Get your minimum supplies sorted out .
The ones I made reference to before , the ones you simply cannot do without such as a generous water and food supply ( 6 months minimum , at least a couple weeks worth of water already stored )
If you do n’t have a firearm , do get a good handgun and learn how to shoot it .
Air , food , water and shelter keep us all alive on daily basis .
But having a gun has saved me before more than once .
So did antibiotics , by the way .
Improve your home security and your security habits .
As things slowly change world wide you can expect more crime in most places round the globe .
Get your finances in order .
Maybe you ’re paying for your home but get set financially , and get rid of unnecessary debt that will slowly kill you .
Work towards having an emergency fund .
Yes , even before you pay off all your house loan .
Its also important to at least have some investment .
You can read a bit , talk with a frined in realestate , and invest in a small appartment that will give you rent some day .
There 's more than enough cheap places on the market these days .
Learn the skills needed both for preparedness and better financial possibilities .
At the very least , self defense , CPR and basic first aid .
Knowing Spanish or a trade that could earn you a living would be nice too .
DO ALL THIS STUFF .
Its of no use just reading it here guys , if you do n’t put these things into practice it will do you no good .

All my pre-hybrid sketchy experiences with NYSE have left me with a sour taste .
If you were to sit at my desk , you would hear how I ’d pay higher ECN fees to EDGX or get worse fills rather than to give any business to NYSE .
I refuse to send any orders through them .
And it is not like my 50 Mln shares a year would really make a huge difference .
Call me loco but I just do n’t give them my business .
Although , while reviewing my numbers from last year I realized that being overly stubborn about this cost me close to 40 - 50 k — and that ’s just a low ball .
Talk about a self - imposed rip .
In the words of Chaz played by Will Ferrell in Wedding Crashers : “ What an Idiot ! ! ”
So , coming into this year I made changes to my execution hotkeys .
I added NYSE sweep keys and I moved them up the ECN toggle list for bidding and offering stock .
And while my ECN fees have come down slightly , I am disturbed by the shenanigans of how my orders are treated .
Let me give you a couple of examples .
First , I must admit I have never been a fan of stop orders .
But now that I have way too many positions riding at the same time , it is the only way I can manage my risk .
Nonetheless , I only use orders triggered by prints locally on my computer to route through ARCA .
I have always felt that stop orders that reside at the NYSE exchange can be manipulated .
The exchange can argue all they want about the floor specialist not being able to see the orders , but I find it to be too big of a coincidence that stops too often go off at some mysterious prints .
Check out what happened to the trader who sits next to me who put in a NYSE buy - stop at 45.24 for 100 shares to cover his short .
Someone please explain how it is possible for a buy - stop that is hosted at the exchange to go off when 45.24 prints but does so only by printing the 100 shares that were in the buy stop .
Coincidental ?
Maybe .
Sketchy ?
Very !
But wait let me show you my personal favorite these days .
Getting my orders front run by NYSE .
Let me illustrate what this looks like on the tape with the following short clip :
The Bad Company 2 beta on the PC has been one of the larger time sinks for shooter fans in recent years .
While the code is slightly rough , the mechanics and gameplay are polished and tight if played with a good group of players .
If you hide inside a building , mortar rounds can take it down .
If you see an enemy creeping towards an objective , call him out to your squad mates and have your friends hunt him down .
The question on the lips of PC gamers : is this going to be better than Modern Warfare 2 ?
What 's the server situation ?
We tracked down Anders Gyllenberg , who is the the producer of the PC version of Battlefield : Bad Company 2 , to get our questions answered .
The Modern Warfare question
We asked Gyllenberg if Bad Company 2 would be defined by its differences from Modern Warfare 2 , and he seemed confident of the strength the Battlefield name has with gamers .
" For us it was n't any discussions regarding if one studio does this then we have to do that .
What we offer with Battlefield : Bad Company 2 is the same base experience as we have offered all the way back since Battlefield 1942 , " he said .
He sees the mix of sandbox design as well as land , air , and sea vehicles as the key to the franchise .
" Combined with the focus on squad play , we believe we have our recipe for our own success .
The server structure , which I assume you are thinking of , is only one of the components in what we feel is needed to offer a good PC experience . "
The server issue is key here , as Modern Warfare 2's closed match - making system rubbed many PC gamers the wrong way .
Gyllenberg laid out the details .
" All servers are dedicated , hosted by some of our partners .
If you have a clan or if you are a bunch of friends who want a safe haven where you can meet up , our server partners offer the possibility of controlling your own server , " he told Ars .
" Reserved slots is one of the features .
As an admin you will also have the option of enabling several features such as friendly fire ratio , Minimap on / off , 3D spotting on / off , etc .
You can also password - protect your server if you want to do some serious practice prior to an important game . "
Almost all the options you have after renting a server will allow it to continue to be a ranked server , but password - protected servers will be unranked to cut down on cheating and padding stats .
Frostbite engine comes to the PC
The beta was important for a number of reasons , but chief among them was the fact that the first Bad Company title was limited to consoles ; this is the first time the Frostbite engine was brought to the PC .
" The code itself is from late December , which is why we see some oddities with the server browser and stabilities , " Gyllenberg told Ars .
" Only through this type of massive testing can we can find the more rare issues that the beauty of PC gaming can create . "
Gyllenberg points out that both the client and server have been patched multiple times since the beta 's beginning , and they 've learned a lot about what hardware players are using to play the game .
If you want the game in 3D , or you have multiple monitors , you 'll really see something special .
Bad Company 2 supports flagship technology from both ATI and NVIDIA .
" In BC2 we support the NVIDIA 3D - vision technology .
It is an awesome feeling to actually play the game in true 3D .
We have had several incidents when someone who has tried it for the first time actually hits the screen when they want to point at something , " Gyllenberg said .
" We do also support the Eyefinity tech where you can experience the game on several monitors .
Besides that , we also have a support for the new keyboards from Logitech where you will get all the multiplayer stats you need displayed on the small monitor on the actual keyboard . "
The PC has some love coming its way
After playing the PC beta with a mouse and keyboard , it 's hard to imagine playing this game on consoles ... but that 's just us .
So far the game is slick and fun , and it's only getting better ; the fact the beta code is already so out of date gives us a lot of hope for the final product .
It 's good to see a game from a developer that 's embracing what the PC has to offer , not running from it .

FOR many Japanese the boom years are still seared on their memories .
They recall the embarrassing prices paid for works by Van Gogh and Renoir ; the trophy properties in Manhattan ; the crazy working hours and the rush to get to the overcrowded ski resorts at the weekend , only to waste hours queuing at the lifts .
The bust , when it came , was less perceptible .
The world did not come crashing down after December 29th 1989 , the last trading day of that decade , when the stockmarket peaked .
The next year Japanese buyers were still paying record prices for Impressionist art at Christie's .
It was not until 1991 that the property bubble burst .
There was no Lehman - style collapse or Bernie Madoff - type fraud to hammer home the full extent of the hubris .
But once the Nikkei 225 hit 38,916 points 20 years ago this week , life began to leach out of the Japanese economy .
In the third quarter of 2009 nominal GDP — though still vast by global standards — sank below its level in 1992 , reinforcing the impression of not one but two lost decades .
Deflation is back in the headlines .
On December 29th the Nikkei stood at 10,638 , 73 % below its peak , though an expansionary budget drafted on December 25th has given it a recent lift .
Urban property prices have fallen by almost two - thirds .
Some ski apartments are worth just one - tenth of what the “ bubble generation ” paid for them .
What effect has this steady erosion of value had on the psychology of Japanese people ?
The bust did not lay waste to Japan , after all , as the Depression did to America in the 1930s .
Homelessness and suicide have risen , and life has got much harder for young people seeking good jobs .
But Japan still has ¥ 1,500 trillion ( $ 16.3 trillion ) of savings , its exporters are world - class , and many of its citizens dress , shop and eat lavishly .
As a senior civil servant puts it : “ Japanese people have never really felt that they are in crisis , even though the economy is slowly withering away . ”
For individuals the damage lies below the surface .
One of the first bubbles to pop , says Peter Tasker of Arcus Research , who has written several books on the bust , was a psychological one : confidence .
Instead of getting angry , people lost faith in Japan 's economic prowess .
“ It became all about declining expectations and how society coped with it , ” Mr Tasker says .
The mood among investors swiftly turned risk - averse .
Remarkably , retail investors were among the first to get out of the stockmarket and were net sellers of equities from 1991 to 2007 , says Kathy Matsui , chief strategist for Goldman Sachs in Japan .
Though there have been four bear - market share - price rallies since 1989 , they have all been driven by foreigners .
The Japanese parked their money instead in government - backed shelters such as the post office , which in turn invested in safe bonds .
The result has been a 78 % rally in ten - year government bonds since their trough in 1990 ( see chart ) .
“ Fixed income has been one of the longest - duration bull markets in the world , ” Ms Matsui notes .
A deflationary mindset started to take hold .
With prices falling , even inert money in the bank or post office earned , in real terms , a small tax - free return .
Once the banking system began to look frail , there was a boom in the sale of safes for people to keep their cash at home .
A long period of zero interest rates led a few to hunt for higher yields abroad .
The mythical figure of Mrs Watanabe — housewives in Japan manage the family money — invested in New Zealand dollars and Icelandic kronur .
These days she is placing large bets on Brazilian bonds , leading to the quip that although Tokyo failed to secure the 2016 Olympics , the Japanese will finance the games in Rio de Janeiro anyway .
Yet individual Japanese investors are still only gingerly returning to their own stockmarket .
The most pernicious effects of the bust , economists say , have been transmitted via banks and businesses .
Banks found themselves loaded down with non-performing loans .
Belatedly they faced up to many of their losses , restructured and consolidated .
But according to Takuji Aida , an economist at UBS in Japan , long - term yields remained very low because of deflationary expectations , thereby flattening the yield curve ( the difference between short - and long - term interest rates ) .
That prevented banks from earning their way out of crisis , so lending remains weak .
Companies , meanwhile , have been focused on paying down debt , as well as coping with deflation in the domestic economy and competition from cut - price imports .
Large exporters were forced to restructure and enjoyed a long boom from 2002 to 2007 .
But firms in more protected areas of the domestic economy have fared badly : profitability , wages and investment have declined in the past decade .
This has fed back to households .
As firms cut back , the proportion of full - time contract jobs has fallen from almost 80 % of the labour force in 1990 to 66 % in 2007 , according to the OECD .
The proportion of lower - paid non-regular jobs has risen correspondingly .
This is partly down to the increasing role of women in the workforce , as declining wages and benefits force families to rely on two incomes .
But there are long - term social costs to this extended income drought .
“ The slow wear - and - tear of the recession has made people much less confident of their ability to finance children , ” Mr Tasker says .
A weak culture of consumer borrowing means that people have been forced to rely even more on their savings — or those of their parents .
But as society ages , growth in the stock of savings has dwindled .
Savings are bound to fall as more people retire .
For the younger generation the next decade may be even tougher than the past two .
Recently , Apple removed Wobble — an app that adds animated jiggles to photo breasts — from the App Store .
Other removals followed .
Now , a developer who talked to Apple says the future of iPhone titillation is bleak .

This devastating news comes by way of TechCrunch , who has been following this story closely ( but not in a weird way ) .
Initially it seemed that Apple 's new policy was to ban " overtly sexual content , " which was disappointing , but , you know , understandable .
Now TC has received word from a developer who has discussed the matter with " multiple App Store reviewers , " and things are n't looking too hot .
Not even close to hot , in fact .
Said developer was told " there will be no more applications that are for any purpose of excitement or titillation . "
Huh ?
I get pretty excited playing Tapulous — are they going to ban that too ?
Well , if you 're thinking that maybe behind the hyperbole things are n't actually so bad , think again .
Here 's the full shakedown , as recapped by the developer of Wobble , an individual who has been standing in the shower since Apple first turned on the cold water on Thursday night :
1 . No images of women in bikinis ( Ice skating tights are not OK either ) 2 .
No images of men in bikinis !
( I did n't ask about Ice Skating tights for men ) 3 .
No skin ( he seriously said this ) ( I asked if a Burqa was OK , and the Apple guy got angry ) 4 .
No silhouettes that indicate that Wobble can be used for wobbling boobs ( yes – I am serious , we have to remove the silhouette in this pic ) 5 .
No sexual connotations or innuendo : boobs , babes , booty , sex – all banned 6 .
Nothing that can be sexually arousing !!
( I doubt many people could get aroused with the pic above but those puritanical guys at Apple must get off on pretty mundane things to find Wobble " overtly sexual ! )
7 . No apps will be approved that in any way imply sexual content ( not sure how Playboy is still in the store , but … )

This can't be life !
Of course , the glimmer of hope here is that Apple is still reviewing their policy and taking a hard line while doing so , just to be safe .
On the other hand , this could it , the real deal , the Puritanical future of apps on the iPhone .
Even if this is n't a permanent policy , it 's hard to believe this is an issue at all .
It makes me glad for the relative chaos of the marketplaces of other OSes .
And the freedom .

At 41 he has been in the fashion game since the mid nineties , having graduated from the renowned Central Saint Martins which launched him , along with Alexander McQueen , Hussein Chalayan and Marc Jacobs , as one of the decade 's new breed of designers .
Sicilian - born , he inherited a love of fine tailoring and undergarments from " my very strict mother " who influenced him to create dresses and jackets with near architectural accuracy .
" I always start with the underpinnings , it 's something I grew up with .
I had a very fierce Sicilian mother and three sisters and ... we were taught that underneath was just as important as the outside . "
He believes psychologically " you feel good about what 's underneath and so I 'm playing ... with underwear and for Spring / Summer 2010 we did underwear really as outerwear . "
Berardi's superbly cut garments have attracted the likes of Beckham and Paltrow , causing a chain - reaction of opportunities for the designer .
Having the former Spice Girl step out in his gravity - defying boots led to an avalanche of high profile red carpet moments .
The Berardi buzz has since converted into a major Milan fashion house signing him on as its creative director .
He admits the compliments and attention are welcome , but remains circumspect about his latest fifteen seconds of fame .
" Its kinda odd because I 've always been doing what I do but I said to someone recently 'it 's like a prawn cocktail , one minute it 's kind of in vogue and the next minute its not ' and its something you 've always known and then suddenly its palatable again , " he says .
" I guess we have a fast turn - around of designers as well in fashion and there is someone new every season and so sometimes you do have to go on the back - burner and give someone else the opportunity ... but I guess after so many year it 's nice to be still considered . "
Despite his intensive schedule Berardi made time to visit Australia as the guest of honour for the inaugural Peroni Young Designer Awards , held in conjunction with at the Museum of Contemporary Art on December 4 .
Berardi proved a gracious presence , reassuring rather than lecturing the young designers in competition .
A veteran of now two recessions , one in the early nineties and the recent economic crisis , Berardi is wise to the fickle side of design .
" It 's the same in any industry whether it 's music , film and literature , there are fashions of the time , " he says .
" Things come in and things go out and in all creative industries it 's exactly the same . "
His advice on the night to the winner Andrew Aloisio , a Hunters Hill based industrial designer was simple : " As long as you have a vision and continue to take that vision forward eventually it will come to fruition at some point and maybe it will fade away for a while , but it will come back . "
The fashion comeback of 2010 is the return to the catwalk of underwear as outwear .
For Berardi , the attention to detail on the female form has being an integral part of his designs ' DNA .
Suddenly the rest of the fashion world is experimenting with stripping away the outer layers to reveal underwear and suggest nudity by adopting flesh tone shades .
" It 's more about the inner self , it 's more about the person , " reflects Berardi .
" It 's fundamental because from the moment you put on an undergarment that sets the tone for your day .
If you are going to wear a fabulous dress you have to make sure that your underwear is just as fabulous . "
He also views the nude trend as a palate cleanser to wipe the fashion plate clean ready for the beginning of a new decade of style .
" I think the feminine side is coming through and I think it is almost to put things into perspective and its 360 degrees of womanhood if you want , " he says .

" It is that idea that everything has a beginning and you can dress that up , or you can dress that down , but at the end of the day the fundamentals are how you view yourself and so from the moment you consider your underpinnings ... the idea is deep down there is that part of us we know is totally ours and we do it for ourselves rather than someone else .

New research on lizards supports an old idea about how species can originate .
Morphologically distinct types are often found within species , and biologists have speculated that these " morphs " could be the raw material for speciation .
What were once different types of individuals within the same population could eventually evolve into separate species .
A new study conducted by researchers at the University of California , Santa Cruz , supports this idea .
The study documents the disappearance of certain morphs of the side - blotched lizard in some populations .
The researchers reported their findings in a paper published February 17 in the online early edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
The side - blotched lizard , Uta stansburiana , has three morphs differing in color and mating behavior .
Barry Sinervo , a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC , has studied a population of side - blotched lizards near Los Baños , Calif . , for over 20 years .
Ammon Corl , now a postdoctoral researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden , led the new study as a graduate student at UCSC and is first author of the paper .
Previous work by Sinervo and his colleagues showed that competition among male side - blotched lizards takes the form of a rock - paper - scissors game in which each mating strategy beats and is beaten by one other strategy .
Males with orange throats can take territory from blue - throated males because they have more testosterone and body mass .
As a result , orange males control large territories containing many females .
Blue - throated males cooperate with each other to defend territories and closely guard females , so they are able to beat the sneaking strategy of yellow - throated males .
Yellow - throated males are not territorial , but mimic female behavior and coloration to sneak onto the large territories of orange males to mate with females .
" My goal when starting my Ph.D. thesis research was to understand how this fascinating mating system evolved , " Corl said .
" We studied lizard populations from California to Texas and from Washington State down to Baja California Sur in Mexico . "
Corl found the three color morphs in many places , but not everywhere .
Some populations were missing some of the color morphs .
For example , populations in the northwest only have orange - throated lizards , while only orange - and blue - throated morphs are found on Anacapa Island in the Channel Islands .
In the field , the researchers captured lizards to collect tissue samples for DNA analysis and then released them back into the wild .
In the lab , they used the tissue samples to get DNA sequences from all of the lizard populations in the study .

" Based on these sequences , we reconstructed the ' family tree ' of the lizard populations and figured out which populations were more closely related to one another .
This let us figure out how the mating strategies evolved , " Corl said .
The results showed that all three color morphs existed millions of years ago and have persisted since then in many populations .
Over time , however , some branches of the lizard family tree lost some of the color types .
" What was particularly interesting was the pattern in how color morphs were lost , " Corl said .
" Any time there was a loss , the yellow type -- the sneaky males that mimic females - - was the first to go .
Thus , the rock - paper - scissors game can break down on an evolutionary timescale .
Something about the game must change so that , for instance , both the rock and scissors strategies are able to beat paper . "
Sinervo has documented the cycling of the rock - paper - scissors game at his main study site for 22 years , with the dominant morph in the population changing every four to five years .
" It 's like an evolutionary clock ticking between rock , paper , scissors then back to rock , " he said .
" Ammon 's research indicates that the game has been cycling for millions of years at some sites , and yet at other sites it collapses on one or two strategies and begins to create new species .
It is simply mind - boggling to think about deep time and these evolutionary cycles . "
Many aspects of the evolutionary history of these lizards are consistent with the theory that morphs can be involved in speciation , Corl said .
Evolutionary theory predicts that new species could arise from particular morphs originally found in a population containing multiple morphs .
Side - blotched lizards started off with three color morphs .
If just one or two types occur in a population , they look just like the original morphs .
advertisement
The theory was also supported by patterns in the formation of subspecies , which are the precursors to new species .
Two subspecies of side - blotched lizard that originated from populations with three morphs now have only a single color morph .
Thus , populations that lose morphs are not transitory , but can persist and eventually become a different species .
The study also found evidence to support the hypothesis that rapid evolutionary change occurs when particular morphs are lost from the system .
" Imagine the three lizard morphs playing rock - paper - scissors , " Corl explained .
" They have very specific adaptations for fighting one another .
Now imagine that some morphs are lost , leaving a population of all rock morphs .
Their adaptations for fighting the paper and scissors morphs are no longer useful .
Therefore , rapid evolutionary change is expected in a population of rock morphs as they adapt to a new game in which they only fight other rock morphs . "
The study showed clear evidence of very rapid evolution of body size when morphs are lost from a population .
" Such rapid evolution could eventually cause populations to evolve into distinct species .
We are the first group to provide a statistical test of this hypothesis , " Corl said .
The idea of morphs being involved in speciation is an old one .
Charles Darwin conducted experiments with different reproductive morphs in flowers to try to gain insight into the process of speciation .
However , the new paper by Corl and colleagues is one of the first studies to use modern techniques to tackle the problem of morphs and speciation .
" My hope is that the paper will inspire other researchers to consider a role for morphs in the evolution of the species that they study , " said Corl .
" For most species , the speciation process is thought to begin only after populations are geographically separated .
Our study shows that the distinctive morphs that build up within populations are important for understanding speciation .
Thus , the first stages of new species may occur within and not between populations .
This idea could fuel lots of interesting research for many years to come . "
In addition to Corl and Sinervo , the other coauthors of the paper are Alison Davis , a graduate student in Sinervo 's lab now at UC Berkeley , and Shawn Kuchta , a postdoctoral researcher in Sinervo 's lab now at Dartmouth University .
This research was supported by a Mildred Mathias grant , a Gaige Fund award , a Sigma Xi grant , a National Geographic Society grant , and multiple grants from the National Science Foundation .

Georgia
Tech is a recognised world leader in translational research and we are excited about the prospects of working with them .
Teaching and Learning
There are many collaborative projects planned in the area of teaching and learning , across all Faculties .
One new development is the ?
Link - to - Learn ?
student exchange programme which will facilitate students at either university who wish to avail of specialist opportunities at the other institution on a module or even semester basis .
Lifelong Learning
Strong links already exist between UL and NUI Galway in the area of adult and continuing education .
These links will be extended as both units work together to provide programmes focused on upskilling the national workforce and meeting the needs of the newly unemployed .
Shared Services

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States should consider using air strikes , such as attacks by unmanned drones , to battle militants in Yemen that threaten American security , a senior U.S. senator said on Wednesday .
Sen .
Carl Levin said that air strikes , clandestine actions , and stepping up U.S. military aid to Yemen are among options that should be considered for dealing with the threat from al Qaeda militants in the Gulf Arab state .
U.S. officials say the Nigerian man accused of trying to blow up a Detroit - bond airliner on December 25 received al Qaeda training in Yemen .
Levin , a Democrat , is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , making him one of Congress ’ most influential voices on military matters .
“ I think that these are proven threats to the United States , and if we identify them , it ’s appropriate for us to act against them , ” Levin said in a conference call with reporters .
He said “ most options ought to be on the table , ” but not a U.S. invasion of Yemen .
President Obama has said the United States does not plan to send U.S. troops into Yemen or Somalia as those countries struggle to contain Islamist militants .
The CIA under Obama has expanded attacks using unmanned aerial drones against al Qaeda and Taliban targets along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border .
Levin said any air strikes in Yemen would need to be done with either the support or the acquiescence of Yemen ’s government .
He spoke by phone from Dubai , where he had stopped on the way home from a trip to Afghanistan .

( Adds background and details on negotiations )
SHANGHAI , Jan 18 ( Reuters ) - Google GOOG.O is investigating whether one or more employees may have helped facilitate a cyber - attack from China that the U.S search giant said it was a victim of in mid-December , two sources told Reuters on Monday .
Google , the world ’s most popular search engine , said last week it may pull out of the world ’s biggest Internet market by users after reporting it had been hit by a “ sophisticated ” cyber - attack on its network that resulted in theft of its intellectual property .
The sources , who are familiar with the situation , told Reuters that the attack , which targeted people who have access to specific parts of Google networks , may have been facilitated by people working in Google China ’s office .
“ We ’re not commenting on rumour and speculation .
This is an ongoing investigation , and we simply cannot comment on the details , ” a Google spokeswoman said .
Security analysts told Reuters the malicious software ( malware ) used in the Google attack was a modification of a trojan called Hydraq .
A trojan is malware that , once inside a computer , allows someone unauthorised access .
The sophistication in the attack was in knowing whom to attack , not the malware itself , the analysts said .
Local media , citing unnamed sources , reported that some Google China employees were denied access to internal networks after Jan. 13 , while some staff were put on leave and others transferred to different offices in Google ’s Asia Pacific operations .
Google said it would not comment on its business operations .
TALKS SOON
Google , which has denied rumours that it has already decided to shut down its China offices , said on Monday it contacted the Chinese government last week after the announcement .
“ We are going to have talks with them in the coming few days , ” Google said .
Google is also still in the process of scanning its internal networks since the cyber - attack in mid-December .
China has tried to play down Google ’s threat to leave , saying there are many ways to resolve the issue , but insisting all foreign companies , Google included , must abide by Chinese laws .
[ ID :nTOE60E00I ]
Washington said it was issuing a diplomatic note to China formally requesting an explanation for the attacks .
The Google issue risks becoming another irritant in China ’s relationship with the United States .
Ties are already strained by arguments over the yuan currency ’s exchange rate , which U.S. critics say is unfairly low , trade protectionism and U.S. arms sales to Taiwan .
Washington has long been worried about Beijing ’s cyber - spying programme .
A congressional advisory panel said in November the Chinese government appeared increasingly to be penetrating U.S. computers to gather useful data for its military .

You know , I think this is a very good chart .
It lays it out pretty well .
What it does not account for is that regardless of the number of actual deaths , the goal of terrorism is to strike fear in those who live , and to cause the enemy to look for enemies from within and to let go of freedoms of privacy and civil rights .
One can make the case that the airplane deaths due to terrorism amount to nothing , if you look at it from the standpoint of those eho want to spread fear .
They 've been able to co-opt the governments and travel safety offices of dozens of nations around the world to their cause — by making them agents of the fear , presenting it to the traveling public as a credible threat , making it bigger than the statistics would indicate .
I 've just spent the last week with all the right - wingers in my family , and they fully expect that all Americans will be forced to be chipped and have their movements tracked everywhere they go ... a true manifestation of Orwellian fiction .
They believe this because of the big - government threat that the current president represents to them , and strangely enough , - =shockingly = - , they are OK with it .
I am not .
I fly home tomorrow , and I 'm dreading the whole thing , and I hope that the current congress and executive does not take the latest incident as an excuse to buckle down even harder on civil liberties .
I am unafraid , and I believe the fear is unwarranted .
Thanks , Jesus , for putting this together .

One went into action at Sylvia Browne ’s appearance at Universal Amphitheatre last night .
Tagged as the Together Again tour , I sat through enough of this woman ’s unutterable prattle until I just could n’t stand it another moment .
I knew before going in my conscience would likely force me to act , but I was n’t sure how things would transpire until after I had had a earful of some of the most trite and at times ugly rap I think I have ever heard in my life .
This was nearly two hours of unbelievable arrogance matched with a crudity that was brazenly passed off as comedy relief .
It was n’t funny .
Forget that this is a person who employs a rough street talking variety of cheap spirituality .
She ’s the closest thing we have in our age to compare with the Witch of Endor .
This is a brash , classless and very unhappy person .
I was more than appalled by her complete lack of courtesy and simple good manners .
Her attitude and demeanor came off as a tired old woman with nowhere else to go carrying a huge load of her own personal baggage .
She might as well have been doing Howard Stern fart jokes .
Arriving early , I did a sweep of the crowd to get a feel for the demographic .
Not surprisingly ; these were your garden variety Jerry Springer low - brow thrill seekers with a smattering of up - scale 30 - 40 ’s single women with their girlfriends in tow .
Trailer trash ?
Yessirree .
You betcha .
To see people like this prostrate themselves before the throne of such a base individual defies imagination .
But I was n’t surprised aftre glancing over the popcorn stands and cheap silver jewelry Sylvia ’s husband of five months was hawking in the lobby .
I ’m afraid this all points out the dire situation we face as human beings in need of leadership and real answers .
People seem to be approaching serious life issues as if they are going to a side - show .
If this is the best we can do for guidence , we are in worse trouble than I thought .
Here is the video :

Part 2 of this blog will give the real dirt and what I think anyone with a conscience should be doing to fight back against these criminals .
I advise people to TAKE ACTION .
To whet your appetiete for now , here ’s some of the gems that I remember : Many people asked who their spirit guides were .
Sylvia dashed off names without a moments hesitation ; literally off the top of her head with such abandon , you would have thought she was bored with the whole thing .
I think she is .
Unfortunately , her all - consuming greed that has kept her wealthy wo n’t allow her to stop .
Names like Veronique and Michael stick in my mind .
Anyone could do this and if it was me , I would have taken my sweet time .
She does n’t care .
She does n’t use any cold reading methods .
Like her peers Van Praagh and John Edward , she doe n’t have to .
She can get away with simply making bold statements as if they are facts .
Welcome to the lazy form of doing psychic readings .
Just say whatever comes into your head .
No mentalism methods are needed .
.
When met with a reply from a questioner such as , “ Oh really … ? ”
Sylvia would bark , “ I ’m the psychic here ! ” or “ You came to see a psychic did n’t you ? ” with the same rough intonation .
Many times she would give an answer before the question was even half - finished coming out of the mouth of the questioner , such as :
QUESTIONER : “ In terms of my new career , will I …. ”
SYLVIA : “ You are going to be very happy with your job .
… Next ! ”
This went on for nearly a hour .
It was like being in a delicatessen line , when your number was called , you trotted by the microphone and were given your sausage - style reading in one short utterance , usually in one or two syllable responses .
Some of these were just pathetically rude and had the air of obnoxiousness that I would have previously thought to be inappropriate .
Being insulted is hardly worth paying a dime for :
QUESTIONER : “ Will I ever have a child ? ”
SYLVIA : “ No . ”
and ;
QUESTIONER : Is my boyfriend ( who happened to be sitting right next to the young lady ) right for me ? ”
SYLVIA : “ No .
You can do better … ”
When it came to medical questions , Sylvia takes the cake .
She rattled off off - hand pop-wisdom as if it was second nature to the crowd in her rasping croak of what ’s left of her emphysema - ravaged voice and punctuated her dialogue with scatological phrases .
Not very lady - like :
QUESTIONER : “ Will they be able to cut away all the cancer ? ”
SYLVIA : “ Yes , ( this bark delivered in the rapid - fire style that characterized her entire deameanor ; dismissive and abrupt )
and ,
QUESTIONER : ( weeping uncontrollably )
“ My brother and his best friend both died in a car accident … and I ….. ”
SYLVIA : “ Yeah I know .
I ’m seeing something about his head .
Was his head crushed or something ? ”
QUESTIONER : ( Whose voice had by then become a yelping bray ) “ No !
He was burned alive , … so I do n’t know ! ”
SYLVIA : “ Well , I ’m seeing a crushed head … or something .
Anyway , it was quick , … that ’s all . ”
What a cold bitch .
.
When people asked , “ What kind of signs do my spirit guides give me when he / she is near ? ”
“ When your lights go on and off , that ’s him / her . ”
“ Coins . ” ( I assume she means when you find a penny on the street of something … )
and an old standard :
‘ When your phone rings and there ’s no one there … that ’s him / her . ”
These sort of shenanigans went on all night after Montell ’s 30 minute diatribe about himself and all his accomplishments .
One of the most amazing things about this monologue was his proud insistence ( after giving the crowd some warm - up feel good induction techniques familiar to hypnotists and motivational speakers ) that everyone should follow his example of eschewing anyone ’s attempts to “ define your personality or tell you what or what not you can be . ” Brilliant .
Within five minutes of making this statement , Montell proudly introduced , “ … The only psychic I will go to … Sylvia Browne ! ”
Who then proceeded to spend the next hour and a half telling people what their personalities are and precisely what they need to do ( and not do ) in their future to become happy and successful !
What hypocrisy .
Do you think there was a critical thinking mind in all those hundreds of seekers who managed to put two and two together and see this incredible contradiction ?
I hope so , but probably not .
These were overwhelmingly Sylvia worshippers and there was nary a skeptic in the crowd .
Simple logic completely escapes these yokels .
They are totally focused on Sylvia ’s folksy attitude .
She is so blunt and crude , people figure she must be real .
Nobody could be that callous unless they were for real , right ?
Her predictions bordered on lunacy and were either boringly faciule or totally uninteresting , here ’s few I remember hearing :
. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt will break up .
And Jennifer Anniston wo n’t take him back , to which Sylvia added sagely , “ Why should she ? ”
This is certainly the sort of earth shattering news anyone would be happy to plunk down $ 35.00 to hear huh ?
She ’s also seriously worried about Elizabeth Taylor and says she ’s lonely .
Boo Hoo .
In one of the more revealing Hollywood star tales told , she spoke about a very famous personality who , “ We would know from the stage and screen ” who calls her all the time .
She went on to say that when she gets a call from this person , she takes the phone off her ear and sets it down on the table , then comes back fifteen minutes later and says , “ … Is that so ? ”
She then sets the receiver back down on the table , vacuums her carpet and comes back in like fashion over and over until the call is finished .
Now here ’s the kicker :
After a week or two passes , Sylvia gets a phone call back from this person telling her how absolutely accurate she was !
Does that tell us a little more about how she works and what she thinks about her clients who are paying upwards of $ 700.00 for a reading ?
She croaks out these stories about people close to her ( including family members ) with an air of detached condescension or as if they are a bother to her .
It reminded me of early Phillis Diller routines , only without Fang and good punch lines .
If Sylvia ever wanted to , she could make the leap from psychic to stand - up comedienne with only a little re-tooling and a decent writer .
I wo n’t go so far as to predict that just yet …
. Cures will be found for cancer and diabetes .
Really ?
When ?
.
There will be no terrorist attcaks against the United States in 2010 .
I ’m sure the CIA , Interpol and the Mossad would love to hear about how and where she gets her info on that from .
Where ’s Bin Laden anyway Sylvia ?
You did so well with all those murdered dead bodies , right ?
He should be an easy find .
Why not help the WHOLE WORLD Sylvia ?
Nope .
She ’s just like Rosemary Altea when I interviewed her .
Like Dear Rosemary , Sylvia prefers to work ; “ one on one ” where she can really be of service .
I ’m sure most of these “ one - on ’ one ” clients were given preferred seating in the first three rows of the performance .
So all in all we are looking at a woman who has reached the top of the dung - heap that is psychic - stardom by merely telling people who are abused , neglected , bereaved and desperate just how stupid they are – and from her easy - chair on the stage , rubbed everybody ’s nose in it .
And they ate it up .
There was no compassion or great cosmic empathy on display as with many of the other bright lights of the psychic world .
Just a brusque bitchy old woman talking down to the masses .
I would rather listen to Roseanne Barr .
At least she ’s funny .
I could n’t help but wonder what the Oracle of Delphi must have been like .
There is much , much more to this story and I will be picking it up next week with the nitty - gritty and details about how I stuck it to Sylvia .
I can tell you now that my attack was two - pronged :
One was to set the crowd wondering and the second and most important aspect was to let Sylvia herself know ( without messing with the belief systems of the crowd and setting them against skepticism – which would have been pointless and self - defeating ) in no uncertain terms ; that if she plans to continue her career ( which she shows every intention of doing ) there will be people like myself lying in wait to embarrass her .
Big Time .
You have to fight fire with fire .
Anything less is just talk .
Please forward the video with your own comments to anyone in the media .
BOTTOM LINE : How could Sylvia Browne give such profound advice to me about my hearing the spirit voices of the dead children she herself was wrong about ?
Opal Jo Jennings , Terence Farrell , Holly Kershon and Linda Macallum are DEAD .
How come she did n’t know right off that I was a fraud ?
Seems simple to me .
She ’s a liar – and now we have the proof .
More Soon .
.
It all began with a stop at a red light .
Kevin Salwen , a writer and entrepreneur in Atlanta , was driving his 14 - year - old daughter , Hannah , back from a sleepover in 2006 .
While waiting at a traffic light , they saw a black Mercedes coupe on one side and a homeless man begging for food on the other .
“ Dad , if that man had a less nice car , that man there could have a meal , ” Hannah protested .
The light changed and they drove on , but Hannah was too young to be reasonable .
She pestered her parents about inequity , insisting that she wanted to do something .
“ What do you want to do ? ” her mom responded .
“ Sell our house ? ”
Warning !
Never suggest a grand gesture to an idealistic teenager .
Hannah seized upon the idea of selling the luxurious family home and donating half the proceeds to charity , while using the other half to buy a more modest replacement home .
Eventually , that ’s what the family did .
The project  crazy , impetuous and utterly inspiring  is chronicled in a book by father and daughter scheduled to be published next month : “ The Power of Half . ”
It ’s a book that , frankly , I ’d be nervous about leaving around where my own teenage kids might find it .
An impressionable child reads this , and the next thing you know your whole family is out on the street .

With hindsight , Nicky Clark says early signs of autism were present in both her children .
The elder one , though very bright , had a love of routine and was not interested in fantasy games like other children .
The younger one liked to line things up in rows and would watch the same video clip over and over again for hours .
When she got the diagnosis it came as a huge shock , as it would be for any parent .
But there was an additional reason why it was unexpected – both her children are girls .
Autism is an overwhelmingly male diagnosis – it has been described as the " extreme male brain " .
Boys with the diagnosis outnumber girls by between 10 and 15 to one .
The typical high functioning male , if he is lucky , finds a secure post in a university where he can use his exceptional powers for academic study , shunning most social contact as the " eccentric professor " , and relaxing at home with his train set in the attic .
But in the developing story of autism – interest in which has increased hugely in the last decade – girls have been neglected .
That omission will be remedied this week with the first conference on autistic spectrum disorders in women and girls .
One aim will be to examine whether the condition has been underdiagnosed in females – and what links there may be with eating disorders .
According to Janet Treasure , professor of psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry , King 's College , London , around a fifth of girls diagnosed with anorexia have autistic spectrum features and 20 to 30 per cent may have exhibited rigidity and perfectionism in childhood .
Anorexia has been called the female Asperger 's ( the mild version of autism ) .
Professor Treasure says : " When I was training at the Maudsley 30 years ago , anorexic girls were treated as little more than malfunctioning machines .
The view was that it was an illness that mainly affected middle - class intelligent white girls and was little more than an awkward phase of adolescence .
Today there has been a huge change in the understanding of the disease .
People with eating disorders find it difficult to change self - set rules and learnt behaviour once fixed in the brain .
They also see the world in close up as if looking through a zoom lens , and get lost in the detail .
There is a strong similarity to autistic spectrums . "
She will tell the conference that there are two aspects to the link .
First , people with autistic spectrum disorder are more at risk of getting anorexia .
" If girls are obsessed with systems and rules then the rules governing eating become very attractive .
They grab them very much . "
Second , being undernourished and underweight as a result of an eating disorder exaggerates any autistic traits .
The effect of starvation on brain function impairs set - shifting – the ability to think flexibly and to multi-task instead of focusing on one thing – and the ability to read other people 's minds .
" They become more socially isolated , withdraw more and more into their own world and become cut off and lonely , " she says .
The task for therapy is to bring them out of their obsession with eating , or avoiding it .
But they have to make " big choices that require a lot of courage " .
The autistic features are reversible in the majority of sufferers once they regain full weight but it requires " a leap so they stop listening to their eating disorder voices " .
Girls whose autistic traits predated their anorexia face a harder task , even supposing they conquer the eating disorder .
" For those with high functioning Asperger 's they can work out what they have to do – to remember to smile , to ask , ' How are you ? '
They need to work at it because autistic traits make them uncharming and can cause heartache throughout life .
If they remember the social rules it makes them a bit more charming , " Professor Treasure says .
Nicky Clark 's daughters do not have eating disorders but , like all those with autistic traits , they struggle with the complex rules that oil the wheels of social intercourse .
The eldest , Lizzy , 15 , is bright , able and verbally confident .
She was progressing well at school until the age of 10 , when she was ostracised by her peer group and bullied .
Nicky says : " I had always known she had to have a routine .
She never really played with dollies or liked imaginative games like other girls .
She asked very complicated questions , constantly seeking and clarifying her perception of the world .
I had to be very careful with expressions like " he will bite your head off " because she would understand it literally and be frightened . "
" She was my first child and I assumed all children were like this .
But it became more apparent when she was 10 that there were differences .
She moved to secondary school but the bullying became much worse and she started self - harming – biting the backs of her hands till they were raw because of her frustration .
Things really spiralled down . "
It took 18 months for her to be diagnosed with Asperger 's Syndrome – " we really had to fight for a diagnosis , " says Nicky – and by that time she had developed head nodding and a mild version of Tourette 's syndrome .
Eventually Nicky and her husband Phil , who come from Shrewsbury , moved Lizzy to an independent school , with small classes where she has since thrived .
In 2008 she appeared in the award - winning BBC film Dustbin Baby , playing Poppy , a character with Asperger's .
Nicky says : " She has a small group of friends ; they realise her take on things is different and they back off .
That is all it takes .
She has the maturity to say , ' This is the way I like to do things .
I am who I am and you do things differently from me . ' "
Emily , aged 12 , was diagnosed as a toddler – long before Lizzy – with autism and learning disabilities .
Nicky says : " She was n't speaking and my mum , who was a health visitor , said I should take her to the GP who referred her to the child development centre .
She was diagnosed the day before her third birthday .
I did n't see it coming and all I could think of was Rain Man , the movie with Dustin Hoffman .
Nothing the doctors were saying to me was going in .
I left the consulting room and collapsed .
" Emily was terrifically affectionate and interested in things but had no language – that was the only symptom .
She went to mainstream school and gradually her language started to come through .
But around the age of five her friends started to drift away . "
They moved her to a special school where things improved .
" She is still affectionate but she has grown and matured .
Puberty has set in – she is becoming a teenager and there is a natural withdrawal .
As long as she has her Teletubbies and Thomas the Tank Engine DVDs she is happy .
But there is the huge challenge of her learning disabilities , which can lead to temper tantrums and what I call serious meltdown . "
Visitors to the Clark household are often surprised when they learn the girls are on the autistic spectrum .
" People say , ' Is n't that a boy thing ? ' or want to know if she can draw Westminster Abbey .
Someone once said they could n't have autism because it only affected boys . "
Ignorance about the condition in the female sex extends to professionals , adding to the distress it causes .
Research suggests that even when girls are screened autistic traits are not picked up .
In one study of 60 patients at a psychiatric hospital in England , none were diagnosed as autistic but 11 were later shown to have autistic traits .
They were diagnosed with other conditions such as personality disorder and schizophrenia .
Charities say a growing number of adult women are coming to them , having recognised themselves in autistic characters on television or in print .
Often they are relieved to discover why they are " different " .
The explanation for their delayed diagnosis , in addition to medical ignorance , is that girls tend to be better at masking the condition .
They are better with language , more advanced than boys , less disruptive and better able to compensate for their problems .
Judith Gould , psychologist and director of the Lorna Wing Centre of the National Autistic Society , says : " We are definitely seeing an increase in women and girls being diagnosed .
Girls are diagnosed later than boys at age 12 upwards .
It is when they hit puberty that it becomes more obvious .
Often they are on the periphery of social groups .
They have learnt their social skills by intellect , not naturally or instinctively .
Teenage girls are very socially demanding on each other and can be marginalised , teased and bullied .
Often girls do not show difficult or aggressive behaviour but are shy or passive and depressed . "
Greek tax collectors and customs officials went on strike on Thursday , beginning a spate of anticipated strikes in the country to protest at government budget plans .
Revenue employees began a two - day walk out , which comes ahead of strikes planned by civil servants and doctors on February 10 .
A general strike could take place later this month , if agreed by members of the country 's main private sector union GSEE which has 600,000 members .
Unions are angry with the government over an austerity program to cut back the country 's huge deficit from 12.7 percent last year to less than 3 percent by 2012 .
The country is struggling to grapple with a deficit problem
Some workers fear that the country 's economic plan is too harsh and is being made even worse by market speculation that has damaged Greek finances .
The European Commission endorsed the Greek plan to cut the deficit on Wednesday and said that Athens must cut public sector wages and trim public spending .
Strike date for private employees
Members of the GSEE are expected to approve a February 24 strike date recommended by union head Yiannis Panagopoulos .
" I deeply regret that the government has bowed to the wishes of the markets , " said Panagopoulos on Wednesday .
Public sector unions ADEDY has called a nationwide strike on February 10 to protest against a wage and hiring freeze .
The Greek government has urged the nation to accept the measures , warning that the country could not afford strikes or recent road blockades by farmers demanding subsidies .
In December , several thousands of people walked through Athens to protest against proposed cuts .

Chen , a researcher at Arizona State University ’s Biodesign Institute and professor in the PolyTechnic Campus ’ College of Technology and Innovation , is the first to demonstrate a plant - derived treatment to successfully combat West Nile virus after exposure and infection .
The research appears in this week ’s issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( advanced online edition ) .
There are currently no available vaccines against West Nile , nor effective therapeutics for human use , so the current findings are a considerable advancement and may offer the best hope thus far that the West Nile virus infection can be stopped , even several days after viral infection .
West Nile virus has made alarming inroads in North America , causing disease outbreaks throughout the U.S. , as well as in areas of Canada , Mexico , the Caribbean and South America .
Elderly individuals and those with depressed immunity are particularly vulnerable to West Nile , a mosquito - borne illness which can cause a potentially lethal inflammation of the brain .
Chen ’s group demonstrated the versatility of plant - based biotechnology .
“ The goal of this research was twofold , ” said Chen .
“ First , we wanted to show proof - of - concept , demonstrating that plant - made antibodies can work as effective post - exposure therapeutics .
Secondly , we ’ve sought to develop a therapeutic which can be made inexpensively so that the health care systems in developing countries can afford it . ”
Issues of affordability for such antibody - based treatments are central to the challenge , Chen stresses , with the costs for development of a traditional pharmaceutical mammalian cell line production facility often running into the tens of millions of dollars .
Besides being inexpensive , plants offer other advantages .
Mammalian cell lines may run the risk of harboring animal pathogens such as viruses or infectious protein agents known as prions , not found in plants .
Plants also allow production of pharmaceutical products to be easily scaled up to whatever quantities are required .
“ With mammalian cells systems , the physical size of the bioreactor is limiting , ” said Chen , “ whereas with plants , we can just plant another acre . ”
The study examined antibodies against West Nile virus derived from mammalian cell lines and compared their effectiveness with those extracted from plants .
The plants used to produce the antibodies are a relative of common tobacco , a member of the Solanceae family of plants , which produce abundant leaves for harvesting material and are also prolific seed producers .
Seven days after the introduction of antibody genes into plants , the leaves are harvested , homogenized and purified to remove extraneous material .
The strategy for gene insertion is to use the specific machinery of the tobacco mosaic virus and potato virus X ( PVX ) to carry the genes of interest into the plants , where they can be expressed , yielding a human monoclonal antibody known as hu-E16 .
The gene expression occurs in just a week ’s time , making the production process highly efficient .
The monoclonal antibody , once injected into the recipient , binds to a particular surface protein of the virus .
That binding site is also the one used by the virus to attach itself to mammalian host cells , and once it is occupied , the virus ’ cell - binding ( and infectious ) capacity is neutralized .
Cell - derived versions of this antibody have already demonstrated impressive effectiveness , protecting mice from WNV - induced mortality even several days after infection .
Chen ’s research shows comparable effectiveness using tobacco - plant derived monoclonal antibodies .
Indeed , the results in the groups of mice tested , were essentially indistinguishable .
The therapeutic , Chen emphasizes , is effective in very small dosages , ( 50 -200 micrograms ) , and only one dose is required to clear the virus from an infected individual ’s system .
The effectiveness of the plant expression system is dependent in part on the optimization of the antibody DNA sequence , which helps to ensure a high level of expression in the plants .
“ The goal is to make more of the protein and for it to persist longer before it is degraded , ” said Chen .
“ Optimization helps . ”
The strategy permitted the group to set a record for the antibody yield produced by the transgenic tobacco plants — an increase from 500 micrograms of antibody per gram of leaf tissue to 800 micrograms per leaf .
Because the monoclonal antibody therapeutic binds to a conserved region of the viral surface , it can be effective against a variety of West Nile virus stains and potentially against other flaviviral strains .
Here , another advantage of plant - derived as opposed to animal - derived antibodies becomes important .
If an individual is exposed to a variant strain of virus differing in some particulars from the antibody used to treat it , there is a chance in the case of the mammalian cell - derived therapy to actually worsen the condition , through an effect known as antibody dependent enhancement .
The process has been studied in some detail in dengue fever , a related flavivirus .
Chen emphasizes that plant - based antibodies lack the capacity to bind with a critical receptor implicated in the antibody dependent enhancement effect , making them potentially safer for use .
The completion of this research relied on the efforts of a large , interdisciplinary team , including lead author Huafang “ Lily ” Lai .
Michael Diamond of Washington University collaborated in studies with the mouse model .
In addition to Chen ’s ASU scientist colleagues , Thomas Keller , an undergraduate in ASU ’s School of Life Sciences Undergraduate Research program appears as a co-author of the PNAS paper , having carried out much of the critical protein expression and characterization work .
“ This was a very remarkable achievement for an undergraduate student , ” Chen points out .
The research was supported by grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , and Keller ’s work was supported in part through the Howard Hughes Fellowship for Undergraduate Research .
While the group ’s focus has been on West Nile Virus , Chen believes the plant - based antibody approach could provide highly effective , cost efficient therapeutics for other diseases , including related flavivirus infections such as dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis , if the successes in mice can be replicated in humans .
One challenge in treating a virus like West Nile , which targets the central nervous system , is that current antibody therapeutics are unable to pursue the virus into its sanctuaries in the human brain , due to the existence of the blood brain barrier .
If this obstacle can be overcome , it may be possible to produce therapeutics capable of eradicating the infection even after 6 or 7 days , when a significant amount of virus has colonized brain tissue .
Toward this end , Chen is now working on bifunctional antibodies , capable of binding with virus particles as well as attaching to receptors in the brain , allowing the antibody to migrate past the blood brain threshold .
If successful , the technique may allow treatment of other , currently intractable infectious and neurological diseases .
“ If we can find a way to deliver therapeutics of this sort into the brain it will be really significant , ” said Chen .

Bernie Ecclestone says he would have no problem with Flavio Briatore returning to Formula 1 now that his ban from motorsport has been overturned by a French court .
But the Formula 1 supremo doubts that Briatore would resume his former role as a team boss - and also suspects that there will be further legal arguments with the FIA already investigating its appeal options .
Ecclestone had been critical of the decision to give Briatore an indefinite ban when the World Motor Sport Council held its hearing into the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix scandal last autumn .
" I said at the time that even murderers do n't get life sentences these days and the court seems to agree , " Ecclestone told the Daily Express newspaper .
" He is welcome to come back to the paddock .
He was a great character in F1 but I am not sure if that is what he wants to do now .
I think he will move on from that .
" It 's good for him but it is not good for the FIA when you read the verdict . "
Ecclestone suspects that Briatore 's main motorsport involvement from now on will be via driver management .
He has already told the Italian press that he intends to resume this business .
" There 's no reason he can't carry on as a manager if he wants , " Ecclestone told the Daily Mail .
" I did n't want to see him go in the first place , but it would be difficult for someone who has done something wrong to return in his old job or something similar . "
He expects the FIA to press ahead with its appeal plans , but hopes that a further court case can be averted .
" It 's not over by a long way , " said Ecclestone .
" Just because a bloody judge has said what he 's said does n't make any difference .
Nothing 's happened .
" The court said it was wrong , so the FIA can start all over again with a new hearing , and it will go on and on and on .
That 's the worst thing .
It would be better if they all get round a table and see what they can do . "
An FIA statement issued in the wake of the French court verdict suggested that it could take other regulatory measures to ensure Briatore and Pat Symonds ' bans were enforced .
The court had ruled that as the team bosses were not FIA licence - holders , it did not have the jurisdiction to prevent them working in the paddock .
" The FIA intends to consider appropriate actions to ensure that no persons who would engage , or who have engaged , in such dangerous activities or acts of intentional cheating will be allowed to participate in Formula 1 in the future , " said the governing body .
Ecclestone believes a further FIA hearing is therefore possible .
" I guess the FIA will have to appeal and maybe change their rules and bring Flavio and Pat Symonds before them again , which is what I suggested they should do some time ago , " he told the Independent .
" We 'll have to see what happens . "
A hacker who took down top Chinese search engine Baidu.com last month broke into its account with a U.S. domain name registrar by pretending to be from Baidu in an online chat with the registrar 's tech help , according to a lawsuit filed by Baidu .
Support staff at the registrar , Register.com , then refused to aid Baidu when first contacted about Baidu.com redirecting users to a Web page that declared , " This site has been hacked by the Iranian Cyber Army , " the Baidu complaint alleges .
The complaint was filed last month in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York , but the court only recently released an unredacted copy of the complaint .
The complaint says Baidu 's service was disrupted for five hours by the hack and seeks millions of dollars allegedly lost in revenue and other costs .
The attack began on the afternoon of Jan. 11 when the hacker contacted Register.com tech help via online chat and claimed to be from Baidu , the complaint alleges .
The attacker asked a support representative to change Baidu 's e-mail address on file .
The representative then sent a confirmation code to Baidu 's e-mail account even though the hacker answered a security question incorrectly , the complaint alleges .
The attacker could not access Baidu 's e-mail account , so instead made up a confirmation code and sent it to the support representative when asked , the complaint alleges .
Without comparing the two codes , the support representative took the bogus answer to be correct and agreed to the attacker 's request to change Baidu 's e-mail address on file to " antiwahabi2008@gmail.com " , the complaint alleges .
" Incredibly , " the complaint says , Register.com " thus changed the e-mail address on file from one that was clearly a business address and contained the name of the account owner , to an e-mail address that conveyed a highly politically charged message ( ' antiwahabi ' ) , with the domain name ( ' gmail.com ' ) of a competitor of Baidu , at the request of an individual who not only could not produce the correct security verification , but actually produced false information twice . "
It 's unclear exactly what ' antiwahabi ' refers to , but the spelling matches that of the strict Wahabi Muslim religious sect .
Baidu did not immediately reply to a request for comment .
The attacker then used the reset function for forgotten passwords to have Register.com send a new password for Baidu 's account to the changed e-mail address , the complaint alleges .
The attacker then changed the settings in Baidu 's account to reroute visitors to a different Web page -- completing a process that took less than one hour , the complaint says .
Register.com did not immediately reply to a request for comment , but the company last month called the Baidu lawsuit " completely without merit " and said it was working with law enforcement officials investigating the crime .
Domain registrars like Register.com sell domain names , such as Baidu.com , and provide the setup needed for them to lead visitors to the correct Web site .
The release of the unredacted complaint was reported earlier by Domain Name Wire , which posted a copy of the document .
" It 's as if they asked you the last four digits of your Social Security number and you made something up and they did n't verify , " said Andrew Allemann editor of Domain Name Wire , in an interview .
A registration service that requires extra authentication could have prevented the attack , he said .
Similar attacks have hit other companies in the past .
In 2008 , for instance , an intruder altered the domain records of payment processor CheckFree after logging into an account that belonged to it .
" The sad thing is that companies do n't think about this until it 's happened to them and then they go scream bloody murder , " said Allemann .
Baidu is by far the top online search provider in China and accounts for as much as three out of four searches in the country , according to local consultancies .
Google takes a distant second place and its future in the country is unclear .
Google last month said it planned to stop censoring results on its China - based search engine , even if that means being thrown out of the country .
Google.cn is still censoring search results , but the company has said it is in talks with the government .
No matter how many troops President Obama orders to Afghanistan , victory will also require a surge across the Pakistan border that the Taliban and al Qaeda — but not American GIs — cross easily .
The President knows this , but he has n't made Pakistan 's help any easier to obtain by signalling his intention to draw down a mere year after his surge troops arrive in Afghanistan .
Pakistan has slowly expanded its cooperation this year as its public and military have awakened to the threat from their own Islamist ...

This bike is from 50's I guess , but I 'm planing to customize it more in early 1900 's style , so I will build it with big 28 " ( 635 ) wheels in every corner .
This bike belong originally to SOK - market in Sysmä .

In Sunday ’s New York Times , Damon Darlin has now weighed into a debate which I am suddenly making a career of noticing , that of publicly lambasting locavores .
Normally a tech writer ( and perhaps better suited to it ) , Darlin has wheeled out some of the same tired points that others have recently , making them officially clichéd .
It takes only 12 words before he drops Michael Pollan ’s name , whose best - selling books argue eloquently for a better food system , and in the next paragraph he mentions Michelle Obama ’s organic garden at the White House , though he makes no mention of her new “ Let ’s Move ! ” campaign against childhood obesity , for which this garden is a tool .
I was going to dismiss Mr. Darlin ’s piece as not worthy of notice despite its prominent placement in the Paper of Record and thus avoid writing my third column lamenting this misplaced disrespect for eaters who care what they eat ( I swear I do have better , more enjoyable things to write about ) , but then he said this :
Some of these so - called locavores may think they are part of a national movement that will replace corporate food factories with small family farms .
But as much of the East Coast lies blanketed beneath a foot or more of snow , it ’s as good a time as any to raise a few questions about the trend ’s viability .

What struck me first about this statement was that it came the same week that talking heads in the media and politics ( And even Donald Trump ? ) were blindly arguing that all this snow was proof that climate change was a hoax ( perpetrated to what end ?
I ’ve always wondered ) .
The irony is that these bigger storms are likely a symptom of that same climate change , caused in no small measure by industrial agriculture .
Then I noticed the condescension .
These so - called locavores may think they are part of a national movement .
Mr. Darlin , we are part of a national movement , an international movement in fact , led by dozens of very worthy organizations working hard to create a food system that is good , clean , and fair .
Our current system is none of these things .
I happen to sit on the board of directors of one such organization , Slow Food USA , which has 26,000 members nationwide and over 100,000 members worldwide .
Pretty sure that alone qualifies as a movement , but as I said we are not alone .
What Mr. Darlin seems not to understand though is that there is so much more to this movement .
We are not a bunch of yuppie foodies stuffing our craws with foie gras , as he and others might have their readers believe .
The system we envision , as I said , is one that is :
1. Good – meaning that the food tastes good and is nutritious
2. Clean – meaning that producing the food has only beneficial and not negative effects on the environment in which it is produced , and that there is nothing in the food that is n’t food ( and if it was n’t food 100 years ago , it is not food now )
3 . Fair – meaning that the people who produce the food should be justly compensated for their work .
This is not an effort to create some Utopian state , nor is it a recreation of Mao ’s “ Great Leap Forward , ” ( another accusation Darlin hurls ) .
It is a wholehearted effort to improve the lives of everyone who eats .
We do not say : good food for us , we say good food for all !
And when Darlin states , “ People who grow vegetables in empty lots and schoolyards have a nice , wholesome hobby –but one that can make little sense economically , ” he needs to do a bit more research than reading William Alexander ’s “ The $ 64 Tomato . ”
In fact , during World Wars I , II and the Great Depression for example , more than half of America ’s produce came from privately held or community - based “ Victory Gardens . ”
But Americans have been sold a bill of goods , by Big Ag and other industrial interests , that has us all thinking that cooking , much less growing our own food , is a chore akin to washing windows , one to be avoided whenever possible and then done grudgingly only when absolutely necessary .
In fact cooking is far more important .
It is an almost spiritual act to provide nourishment to our loved ones , yet as a society we have come to mistake frenzy for efficiency , which has led to believing we are satisfied with expedient mediocrity , and in the balance as always it ’s the children who suffer .
Meanwhile , with respect to making “ little sense economically , ” I ’ve often pointed out that where I live in Johnson County , Iowa , there are about 50,000 households .
If each of them redirected just $ 10 of their existing weekly food budget toward getting something locally –from a farmers market , a CSA , a local brewery , or eggs from the farmer down the road , it would keep $ 26 million in our economy every year .
Now imagine same statistic in a major metro like Mr. Darlin ’s native San Francisco .
We are not idiots and none of us expects to see the brick - by - brick dismantling of McDonald ’s worldwide ( well OK , some may wish it , but that ’s different ) .
But there is a massive amount of room for improvement and we want to see it .
No health care system , no matter how it is reformed , can deal with the $ 157 billion we spend annually in the US alone on obesity - related illness .
We live in a world with a billion people starving and another billion overweight and yet undernourished .
Children born in the US have a one - in - three chance of developing diabetes before they are old enough to vote , and among minorities that ratio rises to one - in - two .
Clearly the industrial model , which may work just fine for Darlin ’s primary field of computers , is not working for food .
There must be a better way and we are out to find it .
Trying to stick us with an elitist tag when we are trying to help farmers and raise healthy children simply wo n’t wash .

THE great hope of transplant surgeons is that they will , one day , be able to order replacement body parts on demand .
At the moment , a patient may wait months , sometimes years , for an organ from a suitable donor .
During that time his condition may worsen .
He may even die .
The ability to make organs as they are needed would not only relieve suffering but also save lives .
And that possibility may be closer with the arrival of the first commercial 3D bio-printer for manufacturing human tissue and organs .
The new machine , which costs around $ 200,000 , has been developed by Organovo , a company in San Diego that specialises in regenerative medicine , and Invetech , an engineering and automation firm in Melbourne , Australia .
One of Organovo 's founders , Gabor Forgacs of the University of Missouri , developed the prototype on which the new 3D bio - printer is based .
The first production models will soon be delivered to research groups which , like Dr Forgacs 's , are studying ways to produce tissue and organs for repair and replacement .
At present much of this work is done by hand or by adapting existing instruments and devices .
To start with , only simple tissues , such as skin , muscle and short stretches of blood vessels , will be made , says Keith Murphy , Organovo 's chief executive , and these will be for research purposes .
Mr Murphy says , however , that the company expects that within five years , once clinical trials are complete , the printers will produce blood vessels for use as grafts in bypass surgery .
With more research it should be possible to produce bigger , more complex body parts .
Because the machines have the ability to make branched tubes , the technology could , for example , be used to create the networks of blood vessels needed to sustain larger printed organs , like kidneys , livers and hearts .
Printing history
Organovo's 3D bio-printer works in a similar way to some rapid - prototyping machines used in industry to make parts and mechanically functioning models .
These work like inkjet printers , but with a third dimension .
Such printers deposit droplets of polymer which fuse together to form a structure .
With each pass of the printing heads , the base on which the object is being made moves down a notch .
In this way , little by little , the object takes shape .
Voids in the structure and complex shapes are supported by printing a “ scaffold ” of water - soluble material .
Once the object is complete , the scaffold is washed away .
Researchers have found that something similar can be done with biological materials .
When small clusters of cells are placed next to each other they flow together , fuse and organise themselves .
Various techniques are being explored to condition the cells to mature into functioning body parts — for example , “ exercising ” incipient muscles using small machines .
Though printing organs is new , growing them from scratch on scaffolds has already been done successfully .
In 2006 Anthony Atala and his colleagues at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in North Carolina made new bladders for seven patients .
These are still working .
Dr Atala 's process starts by taking a tiny sample of tissue from the patient 's own bladder ( so that the organ that is grown from it will not be rejected by his immune system ) .
From this he extracts precursor cells that can go on to form the muscle on the outside of the bladder and the specialised cells within it .
When more of these cells have been cultured in the laboratory , they are painted onto a biodegradable bladder - shaped scaffold which is warmed to body temperature .
The cells then mature and multiply .
Six to eight weeks later , the bladder is ready to be put into the patient .
The advantage of using a bioprinter is that it eliminates the need for a scaffold , so Dr Atala , too , is experimenting with inkjet technology .
The Organovo machine uses stem cells extracted from adult bone marrow and fat as the precursors .
These cells can be coaxed into differentiating into many other types of cells by the application of appropriate growth factors .
The cells are formed into droplets 100 - 500 microns in diameter and containing 10,000 - 30,000 cells each .
The droplets retain their shape well and pass easily through the inkjet printing process .
A second printing head is used to deposit scaffolding — a sugar - based hydrogel .
This does not interfere with the cells or stick to them .
Once the printing is complete , the structure is left for a day or two , to allow the droplets to fuse together .
For tubular structures , such as blood vessels , the hydrogel is printed in the centre and around the outside of the ring of each cross-section before the cells are added .
When the part has matured , the hydrogel is peeled away from the outside and pulled from the centre like a piece of string .
The bio-printers are also capable of using other types of cells and support materials .
They could be employed , Mr Murphy suggests , to place liver cells on a pre-built , liver - shaped scaffold or to form layers of lining and connective tissue that would grow into a tooth .
The printer fits inside a standard laboratory biosafety cabinet , for sterile operation .
Invetech has developed a laser - based calibration system to ensure that both print heads deposit their materials accurately , and a computer - graphics system allows cross-sections of body parts to be designed .
Some researchers think machines like this may one day be capable of printing tissues and organs directly into the body .
Indeed , Dr Atala is working on one that would scan the contours of the part of a body where a skin graft was needed and then print skin onto it .
As for bigger body parts , Dr Forgacs thinks they may take many different forms , at least initially .
A man -made biological substitute for a kidney , for instance , need not look like a real one or contain all its features in order to clean waste products from the bloodstream .
Those waiting for transplants are unlikely to worry too much about what replacement body parts look like , so long as they work and make them better .

What they found was Tina Fey .
When Adam was made Head writer , he suggested Fey should send a submission packet over the summer with six sketches , 10 pages each .
Tina took the advice and sent them .
After Lorne Michaels met her and saw her work she was offered a job a week later .
She admitted that she was extremely nervous working in the legendary Studio 8H ; being a foot shorter than everyone else , younger , and being one of the only female writers at the time .
After a few years , Tina made history by becoming the first female head writer in the show 's history .
Tina also made her screen debut as a featured player during the 25th season by co-anchoring Weekend Update with Jimmy Fallon .
Since Tina and Jimmy have taken over Weekend Update it has been considered the best ever .
This year she made it to full fledged star by becoming a regular cast member , though she is hardly on the show , besides Update .
And during the past two summers , Tina and Rachel Dratch performed their two - woman show to critical acclaim in both Chicago ( 1999 ) and New York ( 2000 ) and made their Aspen Comedy Festival Debut .
Tina is married to Jeff Richmond , a Second City director and lives in New York City .

Thanks ,
Time magazine , this is just what I need - another article so depressing that I can actually hear my ovaries curling up .
Prostitutes in Lyons , France , sent a fax to the government to complain that they are losing business to Eastern European women who are protected by the Albanian mafia .
Okay , first of all , how rough - looking are these French prostitutes that all their customers are running to the Albanians ?
Secondly , why did they send a fax , and from whence ?
Do they have a fax machine in the whorehouse , or did they all trundle down to Kinko's - " You fax these , I 'll let you shave me . "
Thirdly , how come French whores know how to work a fax machine , but every time I try to use it , I hit Powersave , or I forget to dial 9 ?
This just proves what my boyfriend always says - that I am dumber than a French whore .

A portion of 30 Rock ( 2006 ) is autobiographical .
Our world is a little more bent , but the relationships reflect the kind of over familiarity and competitiveness mixed with friendship mixed with contempt .

The one thing about our show was that we could never portray writers as heroic .
They 're the least heroic , most cowardly , lazy group of people you could spend time with .
30 Rock ( 2006 ) 's fast - talking style comes from the fact that our show needs to be two and a half minutes longer than it is - I 'm trying to fit five pounds ' worth of ideas into a two - pound bag .

Advertisement Police were left with just minutes to clear the area around Newry courthouse before a car bomb weighing up to 250 lbs exploded on Monday night .
No -one was killed or injured in the blast which was heard two miles away .
But police said that was a " sheer miracle " .
Dissident republicans are being blamed for the attack in which a number of buildings were damaged .
Newry centre could be closed for two days as a security operation continues .
" We could have been looking today at multiple deaths , " Police Chief Superintendent Alisdair Robinson said .
People were still being moved to safety at the time of the explosion .
" It was very significant , " he said .
" It was certainly big enough to have caused multiple casualties to anyone passing . "
He said the blast happened just 17 minutes after a telephone warning which said that it would go off in half an hour .
Buildings in New Street including Downshire Road Presbyterian Church were damaged in the explosion .
The gates of the courthouse and a security hut were destroyed in the attack which is thought to be the work of dissident republicans opposed to the peace process .
Most of the roads near the courthouse have reopened to traffic , although New Street remains cordoned off .
Diversions have been put in place .
Windsor Hill Primary School in Newry will remain closed to pupils on Wednesday .
ANALYSIS Mark Simpson , BBC Ireland correspondent
The Newry bomb attack is the most serious incident involving dissident republicans in Northern Ireland since the recent political breakthrough at Hillsborough Castle .
The dissidents are making it clear they want to wreck any political progress .
Politicians at Stormont will be disappointed and disgusted at the bomb attack - but they wo n't be surprised .
Gradually in recent weeks , the dissidents have been stepping up their activities .
Since they tried to kill a Catholic police officer , Peader Heffron , in Co Antrim last month , they 've targeted three police stations in Co Armagh and now they 've exploded a bomb in Co Down .
By striking in three different counties , they are trying to increase the range and intensity of their violence .
But they still have very little support and a limited amount of weaponry .
Without that , they cannot mount a full - scale campaign .
Chief Constable Matt Baggott rejected suggestions that the police and the government had become complacent about the threat posed by dissident republicans .
" We have put many more police officers back on the streets , we are continuing to invest in the right capabilities and technology to tackle the dissident threat , and we are fully behind the devolution of power to Stormont , because again that 's about the political consensus that we need , " he said .
Chief Superintendent Robinson said : " We did n't get any calls warning of the bomb until 10.20 pm which was from a third party .
" That stated that we had around 30 minutes to clear the area .
The explosion went off at 10.37 pm which was 17 minutes later .
" At the time we were still clearing the area .
But for the fact there was divine intervention , there could have been multiple casualties . "
Clinton Later , the US Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , condemned the car bomb and insisted it would " not destabilise the peace process " .
" I strongly condemn the bombing last night , it was another cowardly act of violence by those who would prefer to plant bombs than to argue for votes and participate in the political process , " she said .
" The parties in Northern Ireland have similarly condemned that action in the strongest terms and I urge that everyone continue to work towards seeing the devolution of authority and a better future for Northern Ireland . "
The attack comes days after a mortar bomb was abandoned near a police station in the village of Keady , about 20 miles away .
It is thought to be the first time a large car bomb has exploded in Northern Ireland since the bombing of Stewartstown police station in 2000 .
In the last few years a number of large car bombs been have planted but have either failed to detonate or only partially detonated .
There have also been several attacks with smaller under - car bombs such as the one which almost killed a police officer in County Antrim in January .
BBC NI Home Affairs correspondent Vincent Kearney said police had been bracing themselves for some kind of response to the Hillsborough Agreement , signed just over two weeks ago .
" The fact that it has taken them so long to respond tells us something about their capabilities , " he said .
Prime Minster Gordon Brown 's official spokesman condemned the attack .
" Such acts are entirely unrepresentative of the views of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland ... we will not allow a tiny minority to turn the clock back , " he said .
Sinn Fein MP for Newry and Armagh Conor Murphy said : " The fact that we 're in the process of devolving policing and justice powers and there 's an attack on a courthouse will not be lost on people .

" These people are trying to drag us backwards and ensure we have the British army back on the streets . "
DUP MLA William Irwin said the bomb was " a cowardly action by those who want to drag Northern Ireland back to the past " .
SDLP MLA Dominic Bradley said : " People are saying that they got enough of this sort of thing during the Provo campaign , it was wrong and senseless then and it is wrong now . "
Ulster Unionist assembly member Danny Kennedy said the bomb was " proof of a deteriorating security situation in Northern Ireland " .
" It represents a clear attack on security services and government institutions .
It shows a very worrying level of capability that these dissidents now have . "
The attack was also condemned in the Northern Ireland Assembly before it started hearing debates on Tuesday morning .

We might think of sub -Saharan subsistence economies when we think of Fairtrade , but the biggest recipient of Fairtrade subsidy is actually Mexico .
Mexico is the biggest producer of Fairtrade coffee with about 23 % market share .
Indeed , as of 2002 , 181 of the 300 Fairtrade coffee producers were located in South America and the Caribbean .
As Marc Sidwell points out , while Mexico has 51 Fairtrade producers , Burundi has none , Ethiopia four and Rwanda just 10 – meaning that " Fairtrade pays to support relatively wealthy Mexican coffee farmers at the expense of poorer nations " .
The article offers many other points of interest .
For instance :
By guaranteeing a minimum price , Fairtrade also encourages market
oversupply , which depresses global commodity prices .
This locks
Fairtrade farmers into greater Fairtrade dependency and further
impoverishes farmers outside the Fairtrade umbrella .
Economist Tyler
Cowen describes this as the " parallel exploitation coffee sector " .
Coffee
farms must not be more than 12 acres in size and they are not allowed
to employ any full - time workers .
This means that during harvest season
migrant workers must be employed on short - term contracts .
These rural
poor are therefore expressly excluded from the stability of long - term
employment by Fairtrade rules .

Unlike in most other countries , people in China will use only one hand to signify numbers one to 10 .
This is very useful for bargaining , not least because in China the words for basic numbers vary between regions .

The sad reality of today 's world is that mainstream culture is now filled with images of physical intimacy and intercourse , allowing kids to see and learn about these mature subjects at a much younger age .
We 've come a long way from the dated beliefs about intercourse and the reproductive system , some of which are pretty outrageous .
Here are the most bizarre moments in sex education videos from a time when adults had nothing better to do than carry around diagrams of the human body and invade the personal boundaries of children .

WASHINGTON 
In a federal budget filled with mind - boggling statistics , two numbers stand out as particularly stunning , for the way they may change American politics and American power .
The first is the projected deficit in the coming year , nearly 11 percent of the country ’s entire economic output .
That is not unprecedented : During the Civil War , World War I and World War II , the United States ran soaring deficits , but usually with the expectation that they would come back down once peace was restored and war spending abated .
But the second number , buried deeper in the budget ’s projections , is the one that really commands attention :
By President Obama ’s own optimistic projections , American deficits will not return to what are widely considered sustainable levels over the next 10 years .
In fact , in 2019 and 2020  years after Mr. Obama has left the political scene , even if he serves two terms  they start rising again sharply , to more than 5 percent of gross domestic product .
His budget draws a picture of a nation that like many American homeowners simply cannot get above water .
For Mr. Obama and his successors , the effect of those projections is clear : Unless miraculous growth , or miraculous political compromises , creates some unforeseen change over the next decade , there is virtually no room for new domestic initiatives for Mr. Obama or his successors .
Beyond that lies the possibility that the United States could begin to suffer the same disease that has afflicted Japan over the past decade .
As debt grew more rapidly than income , that country ’s influence around the world eroded .
Take a walk back in history with me as we visit 1987 .
Swaggart was involved with a prostitute at a Metaire , Louisiana , hotel called the Travel Inn on Airline Highway , when some associates flattened the tires on Swaggart ’s car , went to get cameras , and took photographs of Swaggart exiting the hotel with the prostitute .
The story broke on February 20 , 1988 , four months after Swaggart had promised to confess his sin .
On February 21 , 1988 , on his television show taped in Baton Rouge , Louisiana , Swaggart tearfully confessed that he was guilty of an unspecified sin and made comparisons to himself and King David .
Here is a BBC presentation on that whole affair .
The quality is not stellar , but finding any video on this subject has proven to be quite challenging .
The fact that people still follow this insane religious freak just shows how many people in this world are stupid and rather hopeless .

A magistrate has jailed a teenager for killing a cat , describing the attack as sickening .
In April 2008 , the elderly cat was stolen by a group of children and hanged from a bridge at Craigieburn , north of Melbourne .
Two boys , both aged 15 at the time , were charged with theft and aggravated cruelty to an animal .
Children 's Court Magistrate John Doherty said he was outraged , mortified and sickened by how the boys killed a defenceless family pet .
He sentenced one boy to four months in a youth justice centre .
The second boy was given a six - month probation order .
The court heard he was genuinely remorseful .

I do n't know if you 've noticed it , but secession is in the air .
First of all , a fellow named Bill Miller has started a new website , SecessionNews.com , and it is a Drudge - Report - like compilation of anything connected with secession across the land and around the world .
It is an extraordinary endeavor , and it reflects a great deal of talk about , interest in , separatism and independence these days .
Miller , a retired computer engineer , has undertaken this , he says , because he has a passionate interest in getting Americans to understand that secession is a legitimate and honorable political strategy .
Increasingly , it seems , they 're listening .
A regular contributor to the Miller site is Russell Longcore , who has also started up a new site of his own , the bluntly named DumpDC.com .
Longcore , who seems to have insurance and publishing businesses in Georgia , writes long and vigorously about secession in his fairly regular posts .
" Secession , " he says , " is on the lips of many Americans today .
When they look at a Federal Government that is spinning wildly out of control , state secession begins to have an allure as a remedy .
America has gone from a nation of sovereign states with a carefully defined Federal Government to a nation where states are but subservient territories of a rapacious , tyrannical ruling entity that entirely ignores any restrictions on its power . "
His site figures to do something about that .
Last December another new voice was added to the cause , from something called Attackthesystem.com that considers itself to represent the " radical Left . "
It argued that secession should be supported because it was the best way to bring down the American empire and all that it stands for , including its support for corporate capitalism , longtime goals of the traditional Left .
Vermont liberals of the Sanders persuasion should take a look at it ( " Why the Radical Left Should Consider Secession " ) .
In January one notable event , carried by the AP to the lengths of the land , was the launch of the campaign by Dennis Steele and Peter Garritano ( and others ) for an independent Vermont , but you know all that .
You might not have known that another secession campaign , or something very close to it , was launched just before that in Texas , where the Texas Nationalist Movement ( " Independence .
In our lifetime " ) announced its support for the Ron Paul Republican candidate for governor , Debra Medina .
She is “ in line with the core beliefs of our organization , ” it said , and she believes that the people of Texas should vote on the issue of independence , a core TNM demand .

( Just as an aside : Libertarians , particularly the smarter Paulists , are important allies for secessionists , since they get to the nullification / secession place with only a few prompts if they 're not already there .
Ron himself has said it 's a workable option . )
Also in January the invaluable website TenthAmendmentCenter.com began tracking the number of legislatures coming back into session this year and considering bills to reassert their sovereignty and Tenth Amendment rights .
By the end of January resolutions were introduced in 11 states ( Washington , Arizona , Utah , Wyoming , Nebraska , Missouri , Mississippi , Kentucky , Illinois , Maryland , and Rhode Island ) .
Last year ( also tracked on this site ) Tenth Amendment resolutions were introduced in 33 states , passed both houses in five , and were OK'd by the governors in two .
The movement looks to be gaining momentum again .
In February that movement held a Tenth Amendment Summit , in Atlanta , assembling state representatives and candidates from across the country for a one - day closed meeting on strategies , and next day hearing presentations from Judge Napolitano , the Fox commentator , and Ray McBerry , a secessionist candidate for Georgia Governor .
Secession , State , and ... Best Price : $ 25.31 Buy New $ 40.30 ( as of 10:15 EST - Details )
Also in February there took place a remarkable conference boldly announced as on " Nullification , Secession , and the Human Scale of Political Order " in Charleston , South Carolina , maybe the first ever large - scale scholarly conference on secession open to the public .
It featured many leading secessionist scholars , including Donald Livingston , Thomas DiLorenzo , SVR's Thomas Naylor , Marshall DeRosa , Kent Brown , and yours truly , and was attended by upwards of 100 people , an impressive turnout , especially considering the admission cost of $ 2–400 .
A national Tea Party Convention was also in February , not exactly a secessionist event but a measure of the underlying discontent that is leading people at least to protest the system ( and the debt ) they 've been given and start thinking ( some of them ) about alternatives .
So what 's going on ?

Basically , of course , it is the growing dissatisfaction , in blue states as well as red , and the purple and mauves , too , with a government grown too big , complicated , and corrupt to function .
It ca n't do health care , swine flue , stimulus payments , carbon limits , education , jobs , corporate bonus control , or airport security .
It can send 30,000 soldiers to the sinkhole of Afghanistan , because Congress long ago gave up any role in military policy and the peace movement long ago folded up , but that 's what Presidents always do when they want to seem to be strong .
Reagan invades Granada , Bush I Panama and Iraq , Clinton Kosovo , Bush II Iraq and Afghanistan .
All for no reason than showing that they can do something in Washington .
But there 's more to it than that .
There is a deep and fundamental perception that corporate America — briefly , Wall Street — really is in the saddle and runs the country , and for its own benefit , of course .
Very successfully , too , and with complete impunity .
It cares nothing for public opinion and has no shame .
Now this may always have been true , but there used to be the accepted illusion that the corporations had some interest in making the people happy , or prosperous — " What 's good for General Motors is good for the country . "
But now that the country owns General Motors they make no pretense that they are interested in spreading the wealth at all .
And it is because the public perceives it — unconsciously if not knowingly — that there is the general sense of unease , of anger .
Many of those feeling this unease and anger , of course , do n't know what to do about it other than going to tea parties and shouting at town halls .
But it is clear that a great many others are following the inexorable logical train that leads to secessionist thinking : this system is broken and can't be fixed , party ( including third party ) politics is part of the problem not the solution , armed rebellion does n't have a chance against an apparently ruthless state , and the only way to change things and have a chance of a better world is through peaceful secession — getting out , not getting back .
It has , too , the virtue of seeming to be doable — not like revolution or regime change or socialism or any other variant of extreme politics .
It 's not that I have any great faith in the mass of people of this nation using logic , but it just feels as if more people are following this line of thinking these days than … than any time since , say , 1865 .

The Best of Kirkpatrick Sale
" The evangelicals are in control and they take everything for themselves , " he claimed .
" They have the advantage that they control the airport where everything is stuck .
They take everything they get to their own people and that 's a shame .
Vegetables , you might think , are simple enough things to cook .
Now that we 've escaped the dread clutches of Mrs Beeton and her 45 - minute carrots , there 's not much left to learn .
After all , just how much culinary mystique can a marrow deliver ?
Well , you may be surprised .
Marrows , according to Elizabeth David , who delivered such a scolding last week on the subject of the garlic press , " should be prepared for cooking in the same way as aubergines ; cut , preferably unpeeled , into rounds or lengthwise , salted , and left to drain for an hour or so . "
What a lot of fuss for an overgrown courgette .
Now , I regret to admit I do n't have much to do with the marrow ( my boyfriend hates the things , however cunningly disguised as meat ) , but I have n't pre-salted an aubergine in years .
After all , that would necessitate beginning prep an hour and a half before I wanted to eat , which is usually about the time I 'm rushing around the shops grabbing the ingredients for dinner .
It just would n't work .
But is this mere culinary laziness , akin to using teabags or leaving the skin on carrots ( more nutritious , I tell myself ) – or is the tradition a genuine waste of time and salt ?
I 'm comforted to learn that Nigel Slater , who is a cook after my own heart ( he knows the odd jar of shop - bought pesto is n't the end of the world ) , never troubles himself with it : he claims not to have tasted a bitter aubergine in years .
Larousse Gastronomique concurs : " Traditionally , the slightly bitter taste of the vegetable was minimised by sprinkling the sliced or cut - up flesh with salt and leaving it for 30 minutes to draw out the bitter juices .
The aubergine was then rinsed and dried before cooking .
The process of degorging is no longer necessary as commercially cultivated aubergines are not as bitter as they used to be . "
That should , in theory , be that .
The bitterness has been bred out of aubergines since Elizabeth David first introduced this magnificent vegetable ( which , to pre-empt all you pedants , is strictly speaking a fruit ) to this country , so they no longer require salting .
Except that , just to confuse the issue , Hugh Fearnley - Whittingstall claims that , although degorgement ( as it seems to be somewhat saucily known ) wo n't make any difference to the flavour , it will stop the aubergine soaking up as much oil as you can throw at it during cooking .
Delia also salts – but for different reasons : " I do take the point that the modern aubergine has evolved to a state where it does not contain bitter juices , " she says reasonably , " but the juices are there , nonetheless , and I find salting and draining gets rid of excess moisture and concentrates the flavour – there 's nothing worse than a watery aubergine . "
Even Skye Gyngell , who , as head chef at the delectable Petersham Nurseries , should know a thing or two about vegetables , is in favour of salting .
So who 's right ?
Salted aubergines with drained juice .

Two plump aubergines , of roughly the same size and glossy firmness , should settle the matter .
I decide to follow Elizabeth David 's instructions for a Sauté of Aubergines , as that 's the simplest recipe I can find , leaving out the garlic and parsley , so as not to overpower their delicate flavour .
One aubergine is diced , sprinkled with salt , and left for an hour as instructed .
I 'm surprised to discover , on my return , that it 's produced a tablespoon and a half of rusty - coloured liquid , which tastes more like seawater than anything bitter .
I chop the other into equally sized pieces , and heat two heavy - based pans with " a good quantity of olive oil " ( a couple of tablespoons ) , then fry them both " rather gently , turning them over from time to time " for 15 minutes .
Although the non-salted batch soaks up the oil more rapidly , both pans are equally dry by the end .
And the results ?
I can detect no greater intensity of aubergine flavour in the salted batch – in fact , it just tastes saltier .
( David did n't tell me to rinse the salted aubergines before cooking , and , to be fair , Delia or Skye do n't either . )
The texture of both aubergines , as far as I can tell , is almost exactly the same : neither greasier , nor more watery .
So , if it makes so little difference to the oil consumption when frying , I 'm not inclined to take up salting again , particularly as I usually grill or bake the things .
Unsalted ( l ) and salted ( r ) aubergine pieces after shallow frying .

Perhaps it 's fair enough that we 're a bit clueless about aubergines – after all , we have n't been eating them very long .
But to be peddling myths about good old brussels sprouts is inexcusable .
Step forward , Nigella Lawson , Raymond Blanc and Skye Gyngell : all guilty of advising people to cut a cross in the base of their sprouts to help them cook more evenly .
Hugh , Gordon and the chairman of the Brassica Growers Association , Philip Effingham , are all against the cross on the grounds that it turns the unfortunate vegetables to mush – heck , even Delia 's changed her mind since publishing her Complete Cookery Course back in the 1980s , now reassuring the public that there 's " no need to make incisions in the stalks " .
The thinking behind the cross myth seems to have been to encourage the inside of the sprout to cook more quickly , before the outer leaves disintegrated : a particular problem in the past , when those on sale tended to be larger than they are now .
Unfortunately , as recent convert Nigel Slater has observed , whatever the size of the sprout , cutting into them in this way just leaves them waterlogged and soggy .
But many Word of Mouthers disagree – quite vocally , as we discovered before Christmas .
So I decided to try out the cross again , just in case .
The first thing I noticed was that anointing each sprout with a festive cross , which I had always viewed as a faff , even before deciding it was pointless , is actually not that much trouble .
Peeling off those tight outer leaves is much more time - consuming : the cross is the easy bit .
The second batch of sprouts , peeled and tailed , but with no cross , took about as long to prepare as the first .
I then boiled both lots for six minutes .
Sprouts uncrossed ( l ) and crossed with a knife before cooking ( r ) .

The carefully - crossed sprouts brought back memories of canteen Christmas dinners past – yellowing and faintly sulphurous on the outside and slightly pappy at the core , with a ring of bouncy , undercooked flesh in - between .
The non-crossed ones were simply overcooked on the outside , and chewy in the middle .
Neither were satisfactory examples of this mighty vegetable , which is why I generally cut mine in half , so they 're ready before the outer leaves can turn nasty , and remain appetisingly green to boot .
I do n't often say this , but I 'm with Gordon on this one .
What do you think – are salting and crossing a waste of time , or am I missing something ?
And if you agree , have you got any better advice for stopping your aubergines swimming in oil , or cooking the perfect sprouts ?
Much has been made of the strength of the 2010 defensive tackle class , and the fact that the first two picks in Scouts Inc . 's latest first - round projection are defensive tackles is no surprise .
However , the offensive tackles are coming on strong , and we now project four offensive tackles to come off the board in the first eight picks .
Add a pair of defensive ends to the players mentioned above , and you have eight linemen among the first 10 picks .
That leaves little room at the top for skill players and defensive backs , and some of the biggest names on our board have slipped significantly in our latest projection .
Here 's how we see things shaking out now that the college all - star games are over and prospects are preparing for the upcoming NFL combine .
Ubuntu Netbook Remix enlightens ARM support Feb. 19 , 2010
Canonical is developing a 2D ARM interface based on Enlightenment Foundation Libraries for the upcoming Ubuntu 10.04 ( " Lucid Lynx " ) version of Ubuntu Netbook Remix .
In other Ubuntu news , Ubuntu Live CDs in Lucid Lynx will boot 33 percent faster , and The Linux Box will market Ubuntu .
With a lack of open source 3D graphics support on ARM devices impeding Ubuntu 's use in ARM - based netbooks , Canonical turned to the Enlightment project 's libraries to add visual panache to 2D interfaces .
The Canonical project to use the open source Enlightenment Foundation Libraries ( EFL ) was announced in a blog post by in Canonical Ubuntu Mobile Developer Jamie Bennett , and then echoed by a post at the Enlightenment project .
Bennett 's blog post posted two examples of Ubuntu Netbook Remix ( UNR ) interfaces based on the EFL technology that should appear in the Lucid Lynx Ubuntu release in April .
EFL - based 2D launcher for UNR 10.04 , ARM version

As Bennett explains in his blog post , the ARM port of Ubuntu , which was announced in November 2008 , has been stymied due to licensing issues over 3D acceleration drivers and related software .
As a result , 3D Clutter - based interfaces such as those found in UNR , by way of its inclusion of Intel Atom - focused Moblin technology , are unable strut their stuff .
As Bennett ( pictured at right ) explains , ARM - based platforms have traditionally suffered from licensing problems with graphics drivers and free software .
This limits the use of 3D graphics acceleration in the growing wave of bargain basement ARM netbooks that are especially popular in the developing world , and expected to lead to Linux dominating netbook sales in a few years , according to ABI Research .
" Encumbered by licensing issues , many platforms only ship with 2D based drivers whilst the 3D driver - enabled offerings only frequent the poshest of circles such as Nokia 's N900 , " writes Bennett .
While Bennett claims that " Ubuntu runs very well on some ARM based platforms , " and notes that vendors are working on the 3D problem , Canonical is in the meantime working on a more compelling 2D interface for the ARM version of UNR .
" Our goal is to have Ubuntu running on any ARM based device , " he adds .
Ubuntu gains enlightenment
To support Ubuntu Netbook Remix on non-3D - accelerated hardware , Canonical turned to the Enlightenment EFL libraries .
Its new EFL - based 2D launcher can work on both ARM or x86 platforms , as well as both 2D or 3D - enabled devices , writes Bennett .
According to Bennett , the launcher is also more " theme - able " compared to UNR 9.10 's Clutter UI .
By modifying the " edje " declarative layout format , users can " completely change the way the UI looks . "
For example , the screenshot shown below is said to be based on the same code as the screen above , but uses a different theme file , writes Bennett .

As the blog on the Enlightenment project notes , EFL was first developed in 2000 , and the current version " was designed based on previous experience with Imlib and Imlib2 , libraries known to be quite fast . "
Performance is accelerated thanks in large part to the " Evas " canvas ( drawing ) library , which is said to be fast in both software - and hardware - accelerated environments .
Thanks to Evas , EFL is said to support a variety of rendering engines , including X Render , X11 , DirectFB , and OpenGL ES .
In addition , EFL's " Eet " library , used for binary , read - efficient configuration and resources file , has " boosted Canonical 's Ubuntu Netbook Remix startup time , " says the project .
Eet in turn forms the base for the aforementioned Edje theme system used by UNR .
In November , Enlightenment announced a partnership with Samsung to work on bringing EFL technology to its consumer electronics products .
The company is also " actively sponsoring development on Enlightenment and EFL , " says the project , which went on to state , " The Enlightenment team is proud its products are being used more and more on embedded systems , be they e-book readers , phones , or TV's ; x86 , ARM , or MIPS ; accelerated or non-accelerated hardware . "
You want MeeGo with that ?
Considering that the recent version of UNR is based on Moblin , we are interested to see what will happen with UNR and other Moblin - based netbook OSes such as SUSE Moblin Linux after this week 's MeeGo announcement from Intel and Nokia .
MeeGo is said to be a Qt- enabled merger of Moblin and Nokia 's Maemo open source Linux projects for netbooks and other mobile devices , including smartphones .
One would assume that the distros will follow Intel and the Linux Foundation to MeeGo , and that a transition process is already underway .
However , different distros cherrypick different parts of the Moblin stack , integrating them with their own distros , including native netbook versions such as the original UNR , so there may be a few bumps in the road .
Ubuntu Live CD speedup
In an earlier Feb. 12 post by Bennett on Linuxuk.org , he describes how Ubuntu 10.04 has fixed a major gripe with users of Ubuntu Live CDs : glacially slow boot - up times .
While Ubuntu 9.10 was widely praised for its much faster boot time when loading from a hard drive , and the upcoming Lucid Lynx ( 10.04 ) is said to flirt with even faster 15 - second boot - ups , Live CDs have until now been left behind .
The problem has been especially dire on ARM platforms , according to Bennett , who said that the Live CD ARM version for Ubuntu 9.04 takes a full three minutes to boot .
This is especially important considering that for many users , their first experience with Ubuntu ( and Linux ) is with a Live CD .
Bennett and his Canonical team looked into the problem , and found that the debconf database and the related Casper set - up scripts were the culprit .
By tweaking these elements in Lucid Lynx , Live CD startup time has accelerated by 33 percent , he claims , with the ARM version now booting in 1 minute and 53 seconds .
My Ubuntu in a Linux Box
Software development consultancy
The Linux Box announced that it will market Ubuntu in the United States , according to a Darryl Taft story in our sister publication , eWEEK .
The Linux Box , which customizes open - source projects for clients for various vertical sectors , has become a Canonical Silver Solution Provider Partner , and will sell , install , and support customized Ubuntu - based solutions , says the story .
The company will also provide businesses with large - scale migration deployment support and training services for cloud computing infrastructures and enterprise desktop alternatives , writes Taft .
Stated Elizabeth Ziph , CEO and co-founder of The Linux Box , " Ubuntu 's game - changing operating system model is catching on with original equipment manufacturers and business organizations of all sizes . "

Surfaces 1 : The ooze of the past
A novelist is , like all mortals , more fully at home on the surface of the present than in the ooze of the past .
Vladimir Nabokov , Strong Opinions
Curves and surfaces are a wonderful visual representation of mathematics .
They can move from the simple and profound to the complex and intriguing .
They have even been accused of being part of a sinister plot .
In addition the mathematics behind them is becoming increasingly useful in many areas , algebraic statistics for example .
I began this article with the idea that interest in the physical and visual sides of these objects was in a rather sharp decline .
The curves and surfaces courses that I studied had rather few images , and beyond the Science Museum I had not seen a decent collection of mathematical models ( and they have hidden a lot of theirs ) .
However on scratching the surface of the subject I found a huge wealth of material .
In fact so much that I have decided to split up my post ( this one ended up at 1600 words anyway ! ) .
This first post will introduce mathematical surfaces and give some snapshots from their history and links to art .
I plan two subsequent posts ( this will be edited when they come online ) .
Firstly an introduction to algebraic surfaces , secondly a discussion of splines and nurbs and how they provide a practical tool to designers ( without them having to worry too much about the maths ) .
So what is a surface from the point of view of mathematics ?
It is a two - dimensional topological manifold but this is just jargon .
Start instead by thinking of a sheet that might be folded and draped .
We normally want to consider surfaces that are smooth , which means that the sheet has no creases .
However surfaces can get wilder in several ways .
For example they can bend round and connect back to themselves .
In fact we consider surfaces like this all the time .
The surface ( english meaning not mathematical ) of any object you might pick up is like this .
When the surface connects back onto itself and has no edges , it is compact .
For example the surface of a ball is a surface , called , unsurprisingly , a sphere .
Surfaces can also have holes .
The simplest example being the torus which is the surface of a ring donut .
The number of holes through a surface is called the genus and , for compact surfaces that we can create in three dimensions , the genus gives a complete topological description .
Topology considers what happens when the surface is stretched and deformed but not glued or torn .
This is the reason you will sometimes hear that a topologist cannot tell the difference between a donut and a coffee cup , as both have one hole .
A second strange behaviour comes from the famous Möbius strip .
To make this we take a strip of paper and put one twist in it .
The two ends of the strip are then connected .
This creates a surface with only one side , as by walking along the surface , without going over the edge we can get from one side to the other .
The Möbius strip is not a compact surface , as it has an edge .
However it can be made into a compact surface by attaching its boundary to the boundary of a disc .
This gives a compact surface called the Klein bottle , that retains the property that it has only one side .
However the property of being able to get from one side to the other is a topological one .
We cannot create two sides simply by stretching and bending .
How does this correspond to my statement above that the topological information is given by genus alone ?
The answer is that I cheated .
I added the vague terms that we could make the surface in three dimensions .
This is impossible for Klein bottle unless we allow the surface to cut through itself .
Surfaces with this property are called non-orientable there is an analogous counting concept to genus for such surfaces , but it is a little more complicated .
However genus and the distinction between orientable and non-orientable completely describe the topology of any compact smooth two dimensional surface .
One concept that I will mention in passing is that of minimal surface .
These arose as surfaces that minimised area subject to some constraints .
For example containing a certain line in three dimensions .
They can be hard to find precisely by analytic methods , yet soap bubbles can find them very quickly .
More recently the definition has become surfaces which have zero average curvature .
More importantly however they can be made out of lego :
Topology is an interesting area that helps to understand some of the processes of modern mathematics .
There are obvious differences between objects with the same topology ( donuts and coffee cups ) , yet they do share certain features .
Such features cannot be changed by a well defined ( though large ) set of operations .
More importantly up to those operations we can understand all possible behaviour .
We are therefore able to give a complete classification of surfaces .
One of the origins of topology comes from the study of surfaces defined in a concrete way that yields a zoo of examples .
These surfaces are called algebraic surfaces .
Algebraic surfaces are the set of points in three dimensions that give the solution to polynomials with three variables .
For example , consider the polynomial .
Now choose values for x , y and z , as the vector ( x , y,z ) , for the vector ( 0,0,0 ) we have , so this is a solution of the polynomial .
Similarly ( - 1,0,1 ) gives .
On the other hand ( 1,1,1 ) gives , so this is not a solution .
The set of solutions with real numbers ( if any exist ) defines an algebraic surface .
For example for this polynomial we have the following :
Click the image above for a site with a wonderful zoo of examples .
You can really find nearly anything you want for example to express your love .
This zoo of examples is one of the reasons that mathematicians moved to topology to get an idea of the limits of what could happen .
Even with a computer it is not trivial how to construct a model for any polynomial .
However such programs do exist .
You can find your own examples and generate models to play with in your 3d programs .
However when mathematicians started considering such equations that did not have these luxuries .
Things began in the seventeenth century with Descartes and the use of algebra and co-ordinates to study geometry .
By the eighteenth century it had been established that many previously studied curves , such as the conic sections were in fact the solutions of polynomials .
For example the parabola is the set of solutions of the equation and the double cone itself is the solutions of the equation .
Many mathematicians , including Euler and Monge started studying surfaces in the same way , and also started to make models .
By the middle of the nineteenth century model making had become and industry and there were catalogues of published models .
In fact the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie received funding for many of his trips to France and Germany by the need to find models for the university , not for scientific collaboration .
This proved a golden age for models however and by the 1930s they were dying out .
The craftsmanship and accuracy of these models is mind - blowing .
The act of creating a complex object simply from ideas , without having seen it before is hard enough when one is sketching graphs in two dimensions .
Yet these craftsmen were able to achieve it in three dimensions .
Even though today such models are no longer an essential part of any mathematics library there are still many places they can be enjoyed .
Many universities still have ( dusty ) collections , as does the Science Museum in London ( including polished wood models ) .
Although it is not that satisfying to see a three dimensional model as an image there are also many places to see large collections online .
The collection of the University of Groningen has a large number of Schilling models as well as several other .
The University of Arizona and the University of Tokyo also have model collections online .
The development of 3d printing allows for a far simpler method of constructing models , this site also has interesting details of the original process including the recipe for the modelling clay .
Finally Angela Vierling - Claassen has a large amount of material and research on these models , including a photographic catalogue of the collection at MIT .
As you might have guessed from some of the images these surfaces have provided inspiration for artists , especially the modern movements of constructivism and surrealism .
It is debatable however how much these artists engaged with the mathematics or simply regarded used surfaces as objet trouvé ( a term which Duchamp himself found in the writings of Poincaré , which used it to describe mathematical theorems ) .
For Man Ray this is almost certainly the case .
He photographed the collection of the Poincaré Institute in Paris and went on to produce a series of painting entitled Shakespearean Equations .
Using someone else ’s words he described these :
At the beginning of my career I once classed myself amongst the photometrographers .
My works are purely photometric .
Take … the Shakespearean Equations , you will notice that no plastic idea entered these works , it is scientific thought which dominates .
Man Ray , Self - Portrait
The work of Naum Gabo and his brother Antoine Pevsner certainly involved some of the mathematics , particularly in the case of Gabo ’s Linear constructions .
However it seems that this was still an endeavour that was independent of the mathematics community beyond the initial motivation .
In fact :
Although he always denied it Pevsner based his Developable Surfaces on a concept found in certain mathematical models .
Anthony Hill Constructivism — the European Phenomenon
Finally how could I miss Maxwell Demon regular Max Bill .
Bill of course considered mathematical ideas to be central to his work , and perhaps fundamental to the future of art .
His work included consideration of surfaces , including the potentially independent discovery of the Möbius strip and Tripartite Unity , which also has a beautiful mathematical structure .
Groups say some refused classification ( RC ) material could have strong social or educational value
The Australian Library and Information Association ( ALIA ) , has joined with Google , Inspire Foundation and Yahoo to express opposition to the mandatory ISP filter .
In a joint statement released to the public , the groups said a mandatory filter would cover too many topics , potentially block content with a strong or educational value , and give people a false sense of security .
The groups went on to call for more funding to oversee policing against peer - to - peer child sexual abuses networks , as well as education for parents and children on how to stay safe online .
They also used the Enex testlab report and ISP filter trials to criticise a potential speed bottleneck .
According to ALIA executive director , Sue Hutley , the body has held a position against Internet filtering since the World Wide Web was born .
“ We ’ve been discussing this issue for decades now , ” she said .
“ It really does go back to the core values of libraries and library staff , which is against censorship and freedom of access to information .
“ It is not for library staff and it is certainly not for anyone in a democracy to determine what is appropriate – it is not up to us to judge . ”
But despite the long held view , Hutley acknowledged there were boundaries of morality even ALIA agreed should never be crossed .
“ We definitely want to see a more transparent system of classification of material other than child protection / child pornography , ” she said .
“ We are definitely against illegal materials relating to children . ”
Hutley called for more freedom in accessing a wide range of topics and said restricting them from general access would hurt both Australian users and researchers .
“ We ’re really looking at social and cultural topics such as euthanasia , drug use and other topics that are perhaps unusual for the general populace to be discussing , but at some stage , whether you ’re a parent or not , perhaps you are going to have to encounter , ” she said .
“ Certainly some of the sexual related topics are also aspects of concern to us .
“ If I ’m a researcher for particular sexual - related topics , even trying to do a basic Australian Internet literature review will be difficult to do with RC - classification filters . ”
Despite its opposition to the Government ’s position , Hutley said ALIA advised the Minister responsible , Senator Stephen Conroy , on its position and would work with the Government on the issue .
“ Libraries actually represent 12 million users … they are very well aware of the public ’s view against censorship , ” she said .
“ What we ’re hoping to do is work with them on a suitable adjustment to the proposed legislation that can mean that we are n’t going to be listed as a country that is undergoing a censorship regime . ”
ARN contacted the office of Minister Conroy but did not receive a response by time of publication .

The team of King 's Quest enthusiasts who had , since 2002 , been working on an unofficial continuation of the seminal adventure game , have complied with a demand by Activision to cease all development of their game .

The Silver Lining has a long and unusual history , even for fan - built games .
The final official installment of King 's Quest came in 1998 .
Two years later , enthusiasts started their first attempt at coding their own sequel , starting over with the current development volunteers , Phoenix Online Studios , in 2002 .
From the beginning , the team asserted a right to the project under U.S. fair use copyright law .
In 2005 , Phoenix Online survived its first cease - and - desist order from the rights holder at the time , Vivendi Universal .
Outcry and backlash over the project 's termination led to an extraordinary non-commercial " fan license " granted for The Silver Lining .
Advertisement
However , Sierra 's intellectual property has since changed hands from Vivendi to Activision .
And Activision is not interested in continuing this license or crafting another non-commercial agreement .
Says the developers :
After talks and negotiations in the last few months between ourselves and Activision , they have reached the decision that they are not interested in granting a non-commercial license to The Silver Lining , and have asked that we cease production and take down all related materials on our website .
As before , we must and will comply with this decision , as much as we may wish we could do otherwise .
We cannot say enough how much we appreciate the support we have had over these years from our fans .
Without you , we would never have gotten this far .
There would be no game to develop , and no one to develop it for .
You have been amazing and steadfast , and we will always remember that and appreciate it more than we can say .
Sadly , after eight years of dedicated work and even more dedicated fans , The Silver Lining project is closing down .

The company behind the magicJack , the cheap Internet phone gadget that ’s been heavily promoted on TV , has made a new version of the device that allows free calls from cell phones in the home , in a fashion that ’s sure to draw protest from cellular carriers .
The new magicJack uses , without permission , radio frequencies for which cellular carriers have paid billions of dollars for exclusive licenses .
YMax Corp. , which is based in Palm Beach , Fla. , said this week at the International Consumers Electronics
Show that it plans to start selling the device in about four months for $ 40 , the same price as the original magicJack .
As before , it will provide free calls to the U.S. and Canada for one year .
The device is , in essence , a very small cellular tower for the home .
The size of a deck of cards , it plugs into a PC , which needs a broadband Internet connection .
The device then detects when a compatible cell phone comes within 8 feet , and places a call to it .
The user enters a short code on the phone .
The phone is then linked to the magicJack , and as long as it ’s within range ( YMax said it will cover a 3,000 - square - foot home ) magicJack routes the call itself , over the Internet , rather than going through the carrier ’s cellular tower .
No minutes are subtracted from the user ’s account with the carrier .
Any extra fees for international calls are subtracted from the user ’s account with magicJack , not the carrier .
According to YMax CEO Dan Borislow , the device will connect to any phone that uses the GSM standard , which in the U.S. includes phones from AT&T Inc. and T - Mobile USA .
At a demonstration at CES , a visitor ’s phone with a T - Mobile account successfully placed and received calls through the magicJack .
Most phones from Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel Corp. wo n’t connect to the device .
Borislow said the device is legal because wireless spectrum licenses do n’t extend into the home .
AT&T , T - Mobile and the Federal Communications Commission had no immediate comment on whether they believe the device is legal , but said they were looking into the issue .
CTIA — The Wireless Association , a trade group , said it was declining comment for now .
None of them had heard of YMax ’s plans .
Borislow said YMax has sold 5 million magicJacks for landline phones in the last two years , and that roughly 3 million are in active use .
That would give YMax a bigger customer base than Internet phone pioneer Vonage Holdings Corp. , which has been selling service for $ 25 per month for the better part of a decade .
Privately held YMax had revenue of $ 110 million last year , it says .
U.S. carriers have been selling and experimenting with devices that act similarly to the wireless magicJack .
They ’re called “ femtocells . ”
Like the magicJack , they use the carrier ’s licensed spectrum to connect to a phone , then route the calls over a home broadband connection .
They improve coverage inside the home and offload capacity from the carrier ’s towers .
But femtocells are complex products , because they ’re designed to mesh with the carrier ’s external network .
They cost the carriers more than $ 200 , though some sell them cheaper , recouping the cost through added service fees .
YMax ’s magicJack is a much smaller , simpler design .
Editors ' Recommendations
Current fair use law is hazy by design ; instead of laying out specific use cases , the law relies on the famous " four factors " about the purpose of the use , the nature of the copyrighted work , the amount borrowed , and the effect on the value of the original work .
This can be maddening in many situations , because it is impossible to know in advance if a particular use qualifies .
On the other hand , it gives a fair use incredible flexibility to adapt to new circumstances like the advent of the VCR .
But in the paragraph that comes just before the four factors , Congress did see fit to lay down a nonexclusive list of fair uses : " criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching ( including multiple copies for classroom use ) , scholarship , or research . "
Is it time for more list items ?
The new Copyright Reform Act , proposed by Public Knowledge , would make a deceptively simple change to bring fair use into the 21st century — add seven words to this list .
Seven dirty words ?
The CRA is a new project from Public Knowledge , with much of the heavy lifting being done by the Cyberlaw Clinic at Stanford and the Technology & Public Policy Clinic at UC - Berkeley .
While Berkeley 's noted copyright scholar Pam Samuelson works up a new " model statute " for copyright law in the digital age , Public Knowledge hopes to make smaller interim fixes to copyright law that wo n't require the same dramatic reworking .
This week , it released the first of these reform ideas ( PDF ) focusing on the principle of fair use .
In addition to " criticism " and " news reporting " and the rest of the items in the fair use preamble , the CRA proposes the addition of three more : " incidental uses , non-consumptive uses , and personal , non-commercial uses . "
They might sound minor , but these suggestions are bound to provoke controversy .
Incidental uses " involve capturing copyrighted works , where the copyrighted work is not the primary focus of the use — for example , capturing music playing over radio when filming a family moment . "
Incidental use is hugely important to documentary filmmakers , for instance , who routinely capture copyrighted photographs hanging on walls or copyrighted shows playing on televisions in the backgrounds of their shots .
The second category , non-consumptive uses , " do not directly trade on the underlying creative and expressive purpose of the work being used . "
In other words , a non-consumptive use might take the complete text of the novel , make a copy of it , but use it only as the input for a lexicographical analysis of style , not to produce a free e-book .
" Because they do not trade on the expressive or aesthetic aspects of copyrighted works , " says the report , " they pose little threat to the core market interests of copyright holders that copyright endeavors to protect . "
Copyright owners do worry even about such innocuous - sounding issues , however , because of things like the Google Book Search settlement , where the issue of non-consumptive use has already arisen .
Researchers would love access to such a massive archive of textual material , but rightsholders worry about what might happen if Google 's data sets are released too widely .
Would the text of millions of copyrighted books , released to researchers in their entirety , open the way for widespread piracy of the last century 's copyrighted works in one giant download ?
But it is the third proposal that might prove most controversial .
" Personal and noncommercial uses " are said to " have little chance of harming copyright holders .
At the same time , they are ubiquitous : every day we timeshift television shows via TiVo , create mix CDs for the car and iPod playlists to the gym , backup up our computer hard drives , and read books to her children before bed . "
But at what point is a use truly " noncommercial " ?
This issue has been raised in both of the ongoing infringement cases against Jammie Thomas - Rasset and Joel Tenenbaum , the first two people to take RIAA - backed P2P infringement cases to trial .
In both cases , the labels have insisted ( repeatedly ) that no easy distinctions can be drawn between commercial and non-commercial activity ; though sharing copyrighted files with others may be " non-commercial " in the sense that no one is charging money for access , it also seems to be quite clearly " commercial " in the sense that a major purpose is to avoid paying for music that could easily be obtained from stores like iTunes .
Even the backers of the Copyright Perform Act , sympathetic as they are to fair use and an expansive reading of consumer rights under copyright law , do draw the line here .
While they want to ensure that deference is given to things like time - shifting , the report notes that simply placing " personal and non-commercial " in the preamble to fair use law is n't the end of the story .
The four factors still apply , and any non-commercial personal use that " sufficiently harms the copyright holder 's market would not be fair . "
Instead , personal and noncommercial copying would gain the presumption of legality — but if copyright holders could show " either actual market harm or a likelihood of market harm , " those uses would not be allowed .
As Pam Samuelson notes , " ordinary personal uses , such as backup copying and platform - shifting , would be fair , but P2P file sharing would not be . "
The Republican senator from Kentucky , Jim Bunning , known for two things – his baseball record and his bizarre behavior – is now known for two more : “ Tough s_ _ _ . ”
That ’s what the senator reportedly said about the 1.2 million jobless workers who will lose their unemployment insurance and COBRA health coverage come Monday , March 1 , when the current benefit extensions expire .
It only takes one senator to block a vote on a unanimous consent motion , and Bunning is that senator .
The motion would have extended unemployment insurance for 30 more days for those whose insurance is expiring at the beginning of March .
During the hours of debate Thursday night , Feb. 25 , in the Senate , Bunning refused to budge .
Politico reports that when Oregon ’s Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley urged Bunning to relent , his response was , “ Tough shit . ”
Apparently Bunning was upset that he missed a Kentucky - South Carolina basketball game .
So he dug in his heels .
Or as Politico describes the scene : Bunning leaned back in his chair , legs crossed and listened to the debate .
Until around midnight , when he took the microphone again and said , “ I have missed the Kentucky - South Carolina game that started at 9 o’clock , and it ’s the only redeeming chance we had to beat South Carolina , since they ’re the only team that has beat Kentucky this year . ”
After watching lone senators single - handedly hold up health care reform , and now this outrageous behavior by a senator not seeking reelection this year , millions are getting a political education on the arcane and undemocratic rules and procedures of the Congress ’ “ upper house . ”
In Bunning ’s Kentucky , the unemployment rate ranges from 10.7 to as high as 21.7 percent .
Nationwide , long - term unemployment continues to rise – it is currently at an all - time high of 40 percent of all unemployed , reports Mike Hall at the AFL - CIO Now blog .
Sen . Dick Durbin of Illinois , the No. 2 Senate Democrat , said he intended to try to break the impasse again today but Mr. Bunning indicated he would again be on hand .
Durbin expressed his outrage , saying , “ I just do n’t think one senator ought to be able to heap this kind of suffering and misfortune on people who are already struggling in this economy . ”
And using a baseball metaphor , he continued , “ This is a wild pitch you are throwing tonight because it is pitch that is hitting somebody in the stands . ”
Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill focused on how out - of - touch life inside the Washington Beltway can make people .
“ It is easy to get out of touch around this place , ” Sen. McCaskill said .
“ People open doors for you and bow and scrape .
It ’s really easy to forget what people are going through , what families are feeling right now .
And really , 30 days of unemployment insurance – have we gotten to the point that that ’s going to be a political football ? ”
Football ?
Baseball ?
Despite his Hall of Fame baseball career , the senator seemed only interested in basketball .
And not in the million - plus people who will be closer to homelessness come this Monday .

Despite the snarky title , I do n’t want to spend too much time raking over the obvious parallels between Cameron ’s shameless attempt to gain political capital out of the ongoing trial of two young boys for what is , by any standards , a staggeringly brutal assault on two other children of the same age , and the actions of a certain former shadow Home Secretary who pulled much the same stunt 17 years ago .
The main lesson is all this , such as it is , is that politicians will happily say almost anything if they think there ’s an extra vote or two in it .
That said , Cameron ’s efforts to jump on this particular bandwagon do serve to reinforce the general impression that both he and his campaign team are desperately inattentive , woefully out of touch and only casually acquainted with real world .
What I do want to reflect on here is the fact that yet again we have a case that seems likely to spawn another significant inquiry into the apparent failings of the UK ’s child protection system .
It ’s a sobering thought but , between 1973 and 1999 , there were more than seventy such inquiries undertaken in the UK .
Some attracted a higher profile than others .
Many , had little or no impact on public policy and their recommendations were quietly binned when public interest died down .
In 1999 , social policy researchers at John Moores University asked for copies of the findings of seventy public inquiries into cases of alleged child abuse , stretching back to the case of Maria Colwell .
Nine of these inquiry reports , most of which dated to the 70s and 80s , were found to be missing and further eight reports , over and above the seventy requested by researchers , were later found to exist at the time the research was undertaken .
What the researcher ’s found , in the reports they were able to analyse , will sound depressingly familiar – almost half recommended better training and supervision of care staff and better inter-agency co-operation .
It ’s perfectly possible to map out almost the entire history of the major public policy and legislative developments in child protection for at least the last 37 years – if not all the way back to World War 2 and the murder of Dennis O’Neill by his faster father in 1945 , which resulted in the 1948 Children Act and the creation of the first Children ’s Boards – by setting out a chronological list of dead children and the judges and other public officials who investigated the circumstances leading to their untimely deaths .
In fact , that ’s often what people are doing anyway , as its almost impossible to come across a feature article in the press about child protection issues that does n’t list at least two or three past cases from a long list that includes Colwell and Climbie , of course , plus Peter ‘ Baby P’ Connelly , Jasmine Beckford , Heida Koseda , Tyra Henry , Toni -Ann Byfield , Rikki Neave , Kira Ishaq and a depressingly long list of others .
There are some exceptions to this general rule , of course .
There was the Cleveland child abuse panic in which the name most associated with it was that of the Marietta Higgs , the doctor at the centre of the case .
There were also the ‘ satanic ritual abuse ’ panics that are known to the public by the location in which they occurred ( Rochdale , Orkney , Broxtowe and Lewis ) and although the case of Jon Venables and Robert Thompson is universally known by reference to name of their victim , James Bulger , this is by no means always the case .
When two young boys , Martin Brown and Brian Hown , were killed by an eleven year - old girl in 1968 , it was the name of the perpetrator , Mary Bell , that was attached to the case , not that of the victims , whose names have become little more than a footnote to the story so far as most of the public are concerned .
All this seems to be taken for granted .
Rarely , if ever , does anyone make the obvious connection and point out that these cases ( and inquiries ) seem to have been the primary driving force behind the development of child protection policy , and the systems and legislation that go with it , for the last half century .
We have a child protection system in this country that , on the face of it , has evolved by way of lurching from one fuck - up to the next , and then on to the next one after that , without anyone really taking to time to step back , look at the bigger picture , and wonder exactly what all this is actually for or whether there might be a better way of going about this than simply reacting to whatever the most recent screw - up .
A system that ’s been built on crisis management .
When you look at it that way – should we really be surprised that the current system is dysfunctional and that is sometimes gets things badly wrong ?
If the health of the army and the care of the elderly have , at various times , been thought important enough to warrant taking a step back from party politics to look , dispassionately , at the evidence then why not also the protection of children ?
Since World War 2 , Royal Commissions have been convened to examine questions about civil liability and compensation for personal injury , the role and influence of the press , the structure of local government , the provision of legal services , environmental pollution and trade unions and employer ’s associations .
Surely someone out there thinks that child protection is important enough to deserve the same consideration rather than treating it as just another cheap way of getting votes ?

Det Chief Supt Caroline Bates , head of Scotland Yard ’s first dedicated rape intelligence unit , has pledged that every woman reporting a rape will be interviewed by an officer trained in the psychological effects of the crime :
“ I train my staff to understand the psychological effects of rape , ” Bates said .
“ [ Victims ] might not come forward right away .
They have flashbacks .
Their first version of events may change .
Sometimes they are embarrassed .
They have to tell their most intimate details to strangers . ”
She said the nature of the crime made some victims reluctant to admit certain details straight away .
“ You can get disclosures later , for instance they may say ‘ I had a bit to drink ’ or ‘ I had sex with my partner earlier in the day . ’
Our job is to search for the truth . ”
Bates described as “ outrageous ” the mindset of officers who believed the word of John Worboys , the black - cab driver and serial sex attacker , above numerous victims who reported his attacks .
She said a victim - centred approach should encourage more women to come forward and get more cases to court .
“ Our officers will believe the victims , however unbelievable their story may be .
Their job is to keep an open mind and not to make judgements .
Unfortunately that was not done in the Worboys case . ”
An upcoming study out of the University of Leeds reports a significant link between the amount of time people spend online with the amount of time they feel down in the dumps .
The study will be published in this month 's issue of the journal Psychopathology .
The study examined responses from over 1,300 people to ( ironically ) , an online questionnaire probing their internet habits and also their depressive symptoms .
According to the study 's authors , people who spend a lot of time browsing the Internet are more likely to show depressive symptoms .
" Our research indicates that excessive internet use is associated with , but what we do n't know is which comes first , " said lead author Dr. Catriona Morrison , " are depressed people drawn to the internet or does the internet cause depression ? "
The researchers also classified a small subset of their sample as " internet addicts " .
The afflicted individuals find it difficult to control the amount of time spent online and their time spent surfing the web significantly interferes with their daily lives , ability to work or go to school , and social relationships .
These internet addicts are more likely to have a more severe degree of depression than their casual web - surfing counterparts .
What exactly do these net junkies spend their online time doing ?
A greater proportion of their browsing time is spent viewing sexual content , gaming online , and interacting in online social communities .
" This study reinforces the public speculation that over - engaging in websites that serve to replace normal social function might be linked to psychological disorders like depression and , " said Morrison .
" We now need to consider the wider societal implications of this relationship and establish clearly the effects of excessive internet use on mental health . "
Internet use might drain your brain and sap away your time , but I suspect that those who prone to bad feelings and deep depressions may actually be looking to the internet for solace and fulfillment .
The links to social media sites , gaming groups and can provide isolated and ostracized individuals with the kinds of connection , belonging , and sexual gratification that may be missing in their everyday offline lives .
The sense of satisfaction that comes along with these internet indulgences likely feeds a negative cycle where more time spent online means less physical activity and less social contact , increasing the vulnerability to depression .
We have a complicated relationship with digital media .
Our ability to connect to others , communicate with the masses ( hello blogosphere ! ) , and retrieve information at a click is astounding and unprecedented .
We used to have touch - tone phones instead of touch - screen PDAs .
Even those of us who grew up without the internet , email , Crackberries , Google or Wikipedia can hardly imagine what we could possibly do without them .
Most of us are plugged in pretty much 24/7 , and it may come with significant costs to our health and .
It 's probably not realistic or useful to go off the grid for good , but just make sure you find some time to unplug and unwind .
National political icon and conservative leader Sarah Palin has endorsed Dr. Rand Paul in his bid for United States Senate from Kentucky .
The Paul campaign has received a generous donation from Governor Palin ’s PAC .
Sarah Palin has clearly seen that Rand Paul supports smaller , constitutional government and is taking the fight to the career politicians and will shake up the tax and spend crowd in Washington D.C .
“ Governor Palin is providing tremendous leadership as the Tea Party movement and constitutional conservatives strive to take our country back , ” Rand said .
“ Sarah Palin is a giant in American politics .
I am proud to receive her support . ”
“ I ’m trying to go to Washington to fight to lower taxes and spending , and for term limits and balanced budgets .
I will go to protect the lives of our unborn children , ” Rand said .
“ I will strive to capitalize on the support of Governor Palin and so many others to go to Washington and fight for liberty and limited government and put an end to the current climate of insider politics , runaway deficits and out - of - control growth of government . ”
Sarah Palin ’s endorsement is another major success in a long list of achievements for the Paul campaign .
Dr. Paul was recently identified as one of the five most important candidates to support by Dick Armey , Freedom Works and the National Tea Party Movement .
Dr. Paul has also received endorsements from Concerned Women for America , Gun Owners of America , Steve Forbes and RedState.com ,
Recent independent polls show Rand holding a double digit lead in the Republican primary and large leads over either Democratic opponent .
Rand Paul has raised over $ 1.8 million dollars , including over $ 650,000 in the fourth quarter of 2009 .

Damon Root blogged below about a curious amici brief on behalf of Chicago ; elsewhere in McDonald v. Heller news , the NRA , reputed greatest organized champion of gun rights , are angling to get some minutes in oral arguments on the case , even though it is n't theirs , to make arguments different from that of the lawyers fighting for McDonald .
( The NRA had its own Chicago gun challenge it tried to get the Supreme Court to accept , which the Court has so far not done . )
In short , the NRA is unhappy that so much of McDonald lawyer Alan Gura 's arguments in his brief rely on an attempt to revive the " privileges or immunities " clause of the 14th Amendment , as opposed to relying on what has generally been used in the past century to extend the Bill of Rights to the states , the " due process " clause of the 14th .
Details from the fabulous ScotusBlog :
The National Rifle Association asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to allow its lawyer to take part in the oral argument March 2 in the case testing whether the Second Amendment restricts the power of state and local governments to pass gun control laws .
It sought 10 minutes of time allotted to the individuals and groups that are pursuing the Amendment 's extension , to put more stress on an alternative constitutional argument .
The request , the NRA noted in its motion , is opposed by the lead parties in McDonald , et al. , v. Chicago ( 08 - 1521 ) .
Those parties are expected to file a written opposition shortly .
The Court will consider the NRA request at its private Conference on Jan. 15 .
The Court in the McDonald case will consider two main arguments for applying the individual right to possess guns to state and local laws : first , that gun rights should be protected at those levels by the 14th Amendment 's " Privileges or Immunities " clause ; and , second , the protection should come under the Amendment 's Due Process clause .
Both of those arguments are at issue in the question presented by the petition .
The NRA said it wants to put stress on the due process argument .
In their merits brief in the case , the NRA noted , Otis McDonald and the others appealing " have concentrated their argument on a Privileges or Immunities Clause theory that would require overruling at least three of this Court 's precedents . "
And , the motion added , only 7 pages of the 73 - page McDonald brief discuss the Due Process Clause …..
The NRA maneuver brings further out into the open the strategic differences in pursuing the two alternative arguments .
A leading reason for pressing the Privileges and Immunities Clause approach is that it could give the Court a chance to overrule the 1873 ruling in the SlaughterHouse Cases — a ruling that made a nullify of that Clause .
It has long been a goal of some advocates to revive that Clause , as a firmer foundation for weighing government power against individual rights .
Conservative advocates , in particular , argue that the use of the Due Process Clause has given judges too much latitude to invent new rights that exist nowhere in the Constitution .
I was one of the first reporters to cover the divisions within the pro-Second Amendment community on McDonald lawyer Alan Gura 's " overturn Slaughterhouse " strategy in this December Reason Online piece .
While it is little known , except to readers of my book on the case , Gun Control on Trial , the NRA had a similar difference of strategy with Gura on his first grand Second Amendment case , Heller v. D.C. , pretty much fighting against it every step of the way in the belief it was premature and risky , until it reached the Supreme Court , when they came on board as staunch allies .
The reasons for the NRA 's discomfort with Heller are detailed in my book and in this Reason magazine excerpt from our December 2008 issue .

The subject of a recent federal lawsuit , routine blood samples legally taken from Texas newborns to screen for disorders and diseases were illegally being kept by the Texas Department of State Health Services without parental consent .
Found to have begun holding and retaining such blood samples since 2002 , the agency is being sued on behalf of the children 's parents by the Texas Civil Rights Project .
Legislation passed in May 2009 allows for blood samples to be retained indefinitely but allows parents to opt out if they wish to do so .
However the lawsuit maintains that all blood samples obtained prior to the legislation be destroyed in cooperation with the law at that time .
While the Health Department has agreed to destroy the samples , which have been preserved as blood spot cards , it is requesting permission to keep the blood samples of 400 children whose blood tested positive for certain atypical disorders .
The lawsuit is demanding no financial restitution for the state 's crimes , citing only privacy concerns and the principle of holding the government accountable when it violates the rights of its people .
According to Andrea Beleno , an Austin mother and plaintiff in the suit , people must stand up and oppose governmental lawlessness otherwise nobody will .
An agreement was reached on December 14 whereby the Center must destroy all samples within 120 days unless the state receives written permission to retain specific samples .
The Health Department must also inform the parents who were plaintiffs in the suit how their children 's blood samples were used and if any financial transactions took place during the research process .
All projects must also be published on the agency 's newborn screening website .
Spokesmen from Texas A& M's Health Science Center , the facility where the blood cards were being stored , expressed relief that a settlement has been agreed upon and the lawsuit dismissed , but it mourned the loss of what it described as a " superb database " that would have helped to prevent future birth defects in children .
The Health Department has agreed to comply fully with the new law concerning blood sample retention and is assuring parents that all information will be kept confidential and privacy maintained .
The agency hopes that new parents will be willing to voluntarily allow their children 's blood samples to be retained for research purposes that could lead to novel new treatments for serious medical problems .

* Channel is oil supply route for 4 refineries
* Cleanup likely “ days not weeks ” says Texas official ( Recasts first paragraph to add percentage of U.S. capacity ; adds ships waiting , quote from Texas official )
HOUSTON , Jan 24 ( Reuters ) - The Sabine - Neches Waterway , that supplies oil to four Texas refineries representing 6.5 percent of U.S. capacity , remained shut on Sunday as crews cleaned up oil spilled in a ship collision Saturday .
The U.S. Coast Guard said the shipping lane would remain shut until the spill was cleaned up .
On Sunday , 13 ships were waiting to exit the waterway and 13 were waiting to enter .
“ We do n’t have much of a timeline , ” said Coast Guard Petty Officer Adam Baylor .
“ We ’re working as quickly as possible to clean up the spill . ”
The four refineries , three in Port Arthur , Texas , and one in Beaumont , Texas , have not reported any shutdowns since a gash was torn in the side of the double - hulled Eagle Otome tanker on Saturday morning by a barge .
Texas officials said the spill of 460,000 gallons of crude , or about 11,000 barrels , was the state ’s biggest since 1991 .
Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said it was unclear exactly how long the cleanup would take .
“ But I think it ’s a matter of days not weeks , ” he said in a telephone interview .
AET Tanker Holdings , which owns the Eagle Otome tanker , is paying for the cleanup , Patterson said .
The spill triggered a voluntary evacuation recommendation to residents living near the port .
Police said about 12 people evacuated on Saturday .
They were all back in their homes by Sunday .
The four refineries have a combined refining capacity of 1.15 million barrels .
The 807 - foot ( 246 - meter ) Eagle Otome was bound with a cargo of crude to Exxon Mobil Corp 's XOM .
N 344,500 barrel per day ( bpd ) refinery in Beaumont , Exxon said .
The Beaumont refinery is the sixth - largest in the United States , according to the U.S. Energy Department .
“ We do not anticipate any impact to our operations at the Beaumont refinery , ” said Exxon spokesman Kevin Allexon .
A Valero Energy Corp VLO.N spokesman said the company 's 310,000 bpd Port Arthur refinery had offered emergency supplies to the clean - up crews .
The plant 's operations were unaffected by the crash .
A spokeswoman for Motiva Enterprises ' 285,000 bpd Port Arthur refinery declined to discuss refinery operations , but said the plant had supplies on hand and contingency plans in place to deal with the situation .
Motiva is joint - venture between Shell Oil RDSa.L and Saudi Refining .
Total SA TOTF .
PA did not reply to messages on Sunday .
The company has a 232,000 bpd refinery in Port Arthur .
The collision between the southbound barge and the northbound tanker occurred near the Valero refinery location , according to the Coast Guard .
The Valero refinery is the furthest south of the four supplied by the waterway .
The barge was one of two being moved by the Dixie Vengeance tug boat in the port of Port Arthur on Saturday morning when the collision occurred .
Investigators from the Coast Guard along with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board are probing the cause of the collision .
The Sabine - Neches Waterway is a man-made channel that for most of its 60 - mile ( 100 - km ) length runs parallel to the Sabine River , which marks the Texas - Louisiana border .

( CNN ) --
A male suicide bomber dressed in women 's clothing killed three members of Somalia 's U.N. - backed interim government and 16 others Thursday when he detonated at a medical school graduation ceremony in Mogadishu , government officials and witnesses said .
The Transitional Federal Government said Education Minister Abdullahi Wayel , Health Minister Qamar Aden and Higher Education Minister Ibrahim Hassan Adow were among the dead after the bomber attacked Banadir University 's medical school commencement .
The African Union , which leads a peacekeeping mission in Somalia , put the death toll at 19 .
The victims also included nine students and two doctors , according to a professor at Banadir University , while journalists said two of their colleagues died in the blast .
In addition , Sports Minister Suleman Olad Roble was hospitalized in critical condition , his relatives told local media .
Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed blamed the Islamist rebel group Al - Shabaab for the attack and displayed what he said was the body of the bomber for reporters , a local journalist who attended the news conference told CNN .
The body the president displayed had a beard .
The president also showed the remains of the suicide belt and shreds of a hijab -- a garment worn by some Muslim women to reflect modesty -- at the news conference , according to the journalist , whom CNN is not naming for security reasons .
At the United Nations , the Security Council condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism against " people dedicated to building a peaceful , stable and prosperous future for the people of Somalia . "
It urged a " thorough investigation " and expressed hope that those responsible would " be brought swiftly to justice . "
" The Security Council expresses its deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of those killed and to those injured in the attack , as well as to the Transitional Federal Government and the people of Somalia , " the council 's current president , Burkina Faso's U.N. Ambassador Michel Kafando , said Thursday .
Video of the graduation ceremony showed Dr. Osman Dufle , the country 's former health minister , speaking as the camera begins to shake -- apparently from the explosion .
Afterward , Dufle told journalists that he saw a person dressed in black moving through the audience just before the blast , according to the Radio Mogadishu journalist .
Al - Shabaab is made up of former allies of Ahmed , once a leader of the Islamist movement that briefly held power in Mogadishu in 2006 .
Adow , a Somali - American , served as the foreign secretary of the Islamic Courts Union when it held Mogadishu .
But while Ahmed and other former members of the ICU accepted a U.N. - brokered peace agreement with the government they once fought , Al - Shabaab -- which the United States says has links to al Qaeda -- has rejected the peace agreement and has waged a bloody campaign against the transitional government .
The African Union 's peacekeeping mission AMISOM condemned Thursday 's attack .
It vowed to " spare no efforts to ensure that the perpetrators of this act and such heinous crimes against humanity being carried out in Somalia " will be brought to justice .
The journalists killed were Mohamed Amiin Abdullah of Shabelle Media Network and freelance cameraman Hassan Ahmed Hagi , who worked closely with the network .
CNN regularly works with Shabelle Media .
The African Union condemned the attack , saying it would " spare no efforts to ensure that perpetrators of this act and such heinous crimes against humanity being carried out in Somalia " will be brought to justice .
The National Union of Somali Journalists also condemned the attack and said it brought the number of journalists killed in the country this year to eight .
CNN 's Ben Brumfield and journalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report .
But only now has sufficient investment been found for the company to begin production of the craft , which will also begin at an undisclosed site outside New Zealand .
Walam Olum Hokum
Eccentric nineteenth - century scholar Constantine Rafinesque composes a Native American epic
Constantine Rafinesque Constantine Rafinesque
According to the 19th - century scholar Constantine Rafinesque , an ancient Lenape ( Delaware ) Indian tradition preserved the memory of the tribe crossing the frozen Bering Strait from Asia into America thousands of years ago .
Rafinesque said his source , which he translated himself , was the Walam Olum or " Red Record , " a bundle of wooden plaques engraved and painted with supposed Lenape symbols .
It told how the Lenape entered the New World , overcame a Midwestern mound building people , and continued eastward , giving rise to the Algonquian - speaking tribes .
But there are gaps in Rafinesque 's story .
He claimed that he got the plaques in 1822 from a Dr. Ward , who had received them two years earlier from a Delaware patient .
( The physician is not traceable in any historical source . )
The symbols each stood for a verse in the Lenape epic , and Rafinesque said that he obtained the actual 183 verses two years later ( from whom is unknown ) .
Rafinesque published his translation in his 1836 book The American Nations , but the wooden plaques were lost ( Rafinesque does n't say how ) .
Many people believed Indians were descended from the Lost Tribes of Israel and that the mounds were built by a vanished non-Indian race .
Scholars saw the Walam Olum as evidence corroborating an Asian origin for Native Americans , as Rafinesque maintained .
There were some doubts about the Walum Olam 's authenticity , but it was republished in 1849 and a new translation came out in 1885 .
The 1950s were a turning point .
A study of the Walum Olam funded by pharmaceutical magnate and amateur archaeologist Eli Lilly ( a staunch believer ) gave it a passing grade and produced another translation .
But the study revealed how problematic the Walum Olam was , and some prominent archaeologists began rejecting it .
Carbon dating , newly developed , further called it into question .
Rafinesque 's timeframe for the Bering Strait crossing , based on the legend , put it about 3,600 years ago , while carbon dating placed it at least 12,000 years ago .
Still , many scholars took the Walam Olum as genuine , if historically inaccurate .
While Stephen Williams in Fantastic Archaeology ( 1991 ) condemned it as a hoax , concluding the painted sticks and pictographs never existed , no definitive debunking appeared .
It was up to David Oestricher to reveal how and why Rafinesque concocted the Walam Olum .
Oestricher went to the right sources , Rafinseque 's original papers and the Delaware themselves , and presented his results in his 1995 Rutgers University doctoral dissertation and in a popular article in Natural History in 1996 .
Oestricher asked elderly Lenape in Oklahoma about the Walam Olum .
They told him they had heard of it only recently , from anthropologists and archaeologists , and " found its text puzzling and often incomprehensible . "
Oestricher reviewed the translation with Lucy Parks Blalock ( born in 1906 , she was fluent in Lenape ) .
They found many problems with it , such as the inclusion of English idioms that did not exist in Lenape .
In the original manuscript , Oestricher found that Rafinesque had repeatedly crossed out Lenape words , replacing them with ones that better matched his English " translation . "
In fact , the English was written first , and then translated into Lenape .
If not an original Lenape epic , where did the tale come from ?
The story line resembles one in Rafinesque 's Ancient History , or Annals of Kentucky ( 1824 ) , which says the Lenape were a refugee group fleeing after the fall of " Oghuzian Empire . "
Driven into northeast Asia , they crossed the frozen Bering Strait into North America , overcame a powerful tribe and passed east over the Mississippi , and eventually arrived at the Delaware Bay area .
For the language , Rafinesque drew on the works of Moravian missionaries , specifically an 1827 grammar and an 1834 word list .
But mixed in with genuine Lenape words were others borrowed by Rafinesque from other Indian languages , Aztec , and even Chinese .
The symbols were likewise mixed : Ojibwa , Egyptian , ancient Chinese , and Maya .
Rafinesque had apparently added other symbols in order to linguistically link the Lenape to Asia , substantiating his own theory about the origins of Native Americans .
Oestricher notes mistakes Rafinesque made in using his sources .
He lists 25 chiefs by name , taking them from the 1834 word list .
But Oestricher says Lenape custom is that names are never used by two people , living or deceased .
Rafinesque even copied typographical errors in sources into his own manuscript .
Why the faking ?
Stephen Williams labels Rafinesque " complex " and " erratic and difficult " but " not insane . "
He notes Rafinesque 's breadth of knowledge , and publications in many fields , ranging from a 248 - page epic poem to a 300 - page monograph on Ohio River fishes .
Oestricher believes he might have been inspired by , and reacting to , the 1830 claim by Joseph Smith , founder of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , of finding golden plates inscribed in Egyptian and saying Indians and Mound Builders were the descendants of Israelites .
Passionate in his belief that Indians were of Asian origin , Rafinesque had denounced it as a hoax .
But he equally could have been reacting to Josiah Priest , who , in his highly popular American Antiquities ( 1833 ) , described archaeological and linguistic evidence across the continent for the Lost Tribes of Israel , Romans , Scandinavians , Egyptians , Welsh , and others .
Priest drew Rafinesque 's ire by taking his research and using it to support these wild claims .
Perhaps , says Oestricher , lack of money played a role .
Rafinesque had entered a competition , with a substantial cash prize , sponsored by the Royal Institute of France .
He submitted in October 1834 an essay about the Lenape language with no mention of the Walum Olam , despite his supposedly having studied it more than a decade .
But in December he sent in a supplement -- the Walum Olam .
It appears that he composed it only after acquiring a copy of the 1834 word list .
The Walam Olum demonstrates the damage that hoaxes and fakes can inflict .
Not only were scholars duped , but also many decades later younger Lenape , who cannot read or speak Lenape , had , according to Oestricher , " eagerly seized upon [ the Walam Olum ] as a glorious remnant of their culture . "
But Rafinesque had simply invented it -- whether to promote his view of Native American origins or to win a handsome cash prize .
Despite his significant scholarly achievements , he let his own beliefs or financial need override his scruples .
After pouring billions of dollars into the global fight against malaria and rebranding Microsoft in a more cuddly , human way , Bill Gates had just about shaken off accusations that he represented all that was unappealing about aggressive ­American capitalism .
But today his reinvention suffered something of a setback when he played down China 's attempts to stifle dissent on the internet as " very limited " .
Less than two weeks after Google said it planned to uncensor its Chinese search engine in protest at attempts to break into the email accounts of human rights activists , Gates criticised his rival 's decision and insisted that agreeing to Beijing 's demands was just part of doing business in the country .
" You 've got to decide : do you want to obey the laws of the countries you 're in or not ?
If not , you may not end up doing business there , " he told ABC's Good Morning America programme .
He also brushed aside accusations that Microsoft has been complicit in helping filter the web by saying that it was not an issue because any censorship could be circumvented with technical knowledge .
" Chinese efforts to censor the internet have been very limited , " he said .
" It 's easy to go around it , so I think keeping the internet thriving there is very important . "
Gates 's comments echo those last week by Microsoft chief executive , Steve Ballmer , who took a swipe at Google by suggesting that the company had over - reacted in China .
" People are always trying to break into other people 's data , " he said on Friday .
" There 's always somebody trying to break into Microsoft . "
Ballmer also likened Microsoft 's complicity in actively filtering internet content to the oil industry 's decision to import oil from Saudi Arabia , despite the censorship that takes place there .
" If the Chinese government gives us proper legal notice , we 'll take that piece of information out of the Bing search engine , " adding that even countries with " extreme " free speech laws , such as the US , exercised some censorship .
The comments of both men come despite the fact that efforts to censor the internet in China – a project known as the Golden Shield – are among the most extensive in the world .
The country 's estimated 300 million internet users are almost all affected by the various blocks and filters , which include direct censorship of anti-government protesters , members of the Falun Gong religious group , Tibetan independence campaigners and the Taiwanese media .
At various points , Beijing has also blocked access to international news websites including the BBC and the Guardian , and around 50 Chinese bloggers are in prison as a result of their postings .
Google 's stance has drawn widespread support from the human rights community and freedom of speech campaigners , but the Chinese authorities have repeatedly denied any link to the hacking .
Today the government made its most direct response to the issue yet – rejecting suggestions that it turned a blind eye to the activities of some hackers , and defending its right to punish those who challenge its rule .
" Any accusation that the Chinese government participated in cyber attacks , either in an explicit or indirect way , is groundless and aims to denigrate China .
We are firmly opposed to that , " a government spokesman told the state news agency , Xinhua , adding that China was itself the victim of numerous internet - based attacks .
No More Jesus Rifles After ABC
News report , Trijicon says it will remove Bible codes from scopes .
 -- Trijicon , the gunsight maker that has imprinted Bible verse numbers on its scopes , has announced that it will no longer imprint the verses on the sides of scopes intended for the U.S. military , and will also provide clients with the kits to remove the Bible verse numbers from existing scopes .
An ABC News report earlier this week revealed that the Michigan - based company , which has a contract to provide up to 800,000 scopes to the U.S. military , prints references to New Testament chapters and verses in code next to the model numbers of its scopes .
The scopes are used by the U.S. Marine Corps and Army in Iraq and Afghanistan , and by U.S. allies in those countries , and for the training of Afghan and Iraqi troops .
" Trijicon has proudly served the U.S. military for more than two decades , and our decision to offer to voluntarily remove these references is both prudent and appropriate , " said Stephen Bindon , Trijicon president and CEO in a statement .
" We want to thank the Department of Defense for the opportunity to work with them and will move as quickly as possible to provide the modification kits for deployment overseas . "
Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said the Department of Defense " applauds the voluntary actions announced today by Trijicon . "
Morrell said the coded Bible reference were clearly inappropriate .
Said Morrell , " It is not the policy of the Department of Defense to put religious references of any kind on its equipment . "
Earlier today , Gen. David Petraeus , who commands CentCom , which oversees U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan , told a D.C. thinktank that the company 's practice was " disturbing … and a serious concern for me " and field commanders .
He said there had been considerable discussions within the Department of Defense about how to deal with Trijicon 's practice .
The Trijicon statement said that the company would : " Remove the inscription reference on all U.S. military products that are in the company 's factory that have already been produced , but have yet to be shipped " and " Provide 100 modification kits to forces in the field to remove the reference on the already forward deployed optical sights . "
The company also said it would ensure future procurements from the Department of Defense are produced without scripture references , a nd offer foreign forces that have purchased the products " the same remedies . "
Haris Tarin , director of the Washington , D.C. , office of the Muslim Public Affairs Council , a civil - rights group , said his organization welcomed the announcement .
Said Tarin , " We must ensure that incidents like these are not repeated , so as not to give the impression that our country is involved in a religious crusade , which hurts America 's image abroad and puts our soldiers in harms way . "
Ibrahim Hooper , communications director for the Council on American - Islamic Relations , said that Trijicon had made a " responsible move ... that will help reduce or eliminate a potential danger to our nation 's military . "
New Zealand , Australia to Remove Bible Codes from Guns
The New Zealand military and the Australian military have already announced their plans to remove the inscriptions from their Trijicon scopes .
The British military had also expressed concern about the codes .
Trijicon has a $ 660 million multi-year contract to provide up to 800,000 sights to the Marine Corps , and additional contracts to provide sights to the U.S. Army .
U.S. military rules specifically prohibit the proselytizing of any religion in Iraq or Afghanistan and were drawn up in order to prevent criticism that the U.S. was embarked on a religious " Crusade " in its war against al Qaeda and Iraqi insurgents .
A photo on a Department of Defense Web site shows Iraqi soldiers being trained by U.S. troops with a rifle equipped with the bible - coded sights .
One of the citations on the gun sights , 2COR4:6 , is an apparent reference to Second Corinthians 4:6 of the New Testament , which reads : " For God , who commanded the light to shine out of darkness , hath shined in our hearts , to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ . "
Other references include citations from the books of Revelation , Matthew and John dealing with Jesus as " the light of the world . "
John 8:12 , referred to on the gun sights as JN8:12 , reads , " Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness , but will have the light of life . "
" It 's wrong , it violates the Constitution , it violates a number of federal laws , " said Michael " Mikey " Weinstein of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation , an advocacy group that seeks to preserve the separation of church and state in the military .
" It allows the Mujahedeen , the Taliban , al Qaeda and the insurrectionists and jihadists to claim they 're being shot by Jesus rifles , " he said .
Weinstein , an attorney and former Air Force officer , said many members of his group who currently serve in the military have complained about the markings on the sights .
He also claims they 've told him that commanders have referred to weapons with the sights as " spiritually transformed firearm [s ] of Jesus Christ . "
He said coded biblical inscriptions play into the hands of " those who are calling this a Crusade . "
It 's looking ugly at Palm , whose new smartphones at Verizon Wireless -- the Pre Plus and Pixi Plus -- are off to a slow start .
Shares are down 5 % today after getting downgraded by Bank of America / Merrill Lynch and MacQuarie Research .
As MarketWatch reports :
" Palm was cut to an underperform -- or sell -- rating by Bank of America / Merrill Lynch .
In a note to clients , analyst Vivek Arya said the company 's newest webOS phones have seen ' sluggish ' sales since the Verizon sales began . "
" In another report , Phil Cusick of MacQuarie Research cut his rating on the stock to neutral , or hold .
Cusick also cited ' weak sell - though ' at Verizon , and noted that interest from other carriers such as AT&T is weak . "
The main problem for Palm is that the smartphone market has become a platform game , which means there are only going to be 2 or 3 big winners .
So far , in the U.S. at least , RIM 's BlackBerry and Apple 's iPhone are the top 2 , and Google 's Android is making a strong push to be no .
3 , with increasing support from all four major U.S. wireless carriers .
While Palm has a technically impressive platform , there 's a lot more factors than technical quality in who will win :
It also includes carrier distribution , hardware design , marketing , app quantity and quality , commerce , entertainment and media services , etc .
And so far , Palm is not making it happen .
In today ’s Programming Praxis exercise we have to implement the soundex algorithm for encoding people ’s last names .
Let ’s get started , shall we ?
Some imports :
import Data .
Char import Data .
List
The algorithm itself is not all that complicated .
My only mistake was that I failed to account for names where the second letter was equal to the first , such as Lloyd , since initially I only grouped after removing the first letter .
soundex :: String ->
String soundex = f . map head .
group . map toUpper where f [ ] = [ ] f ( x : xs ) = x : take 3 [ toNum c | c <- xs ++ repeat ' 0 ' , notElem c " AEHIOUWY " ] toNum c = maybe ' 0 ' snd .
find ( elem c . fst ) $ zip ( words " BFPV CGJKQSXZ DT L MN R " ) [ ' 1 '..]
A test to see if everything is working correctly :
main :: IO ( ) main = do test [ " Euler " , " Gauss " , " Hilbert " , " Knuth " , " Lloyd " , " Lukasiewicz " ] test [ " Ellery " , " Ghosh " , " Heilbronn " , " Kant " , " Ladd " , " Lissajous " ] where test xs = print $ map soundex xs == result result = [ " E460 " , " G200 " , " H416 " , " K530 " , " L300 " , " L222 " ]
Yup , and at only about a third the size of the Scheme solution I ’d say that ’s not bad .

Sanctions target US firms By Wu Jiao ( China Daily )
Updated : 2010-02-01 07:50
For the first time Beijing vowed to censure private companies involved in the arms sales to Taiwan by the United States , a measure seen as concrete by experts and demanded by Chinese netizens for a long time .
China said it would impose unspecified sanctions on the companies involved and reduce international cooperation with the US unless it canceled the new arms package .
The foreign ministry did n't list the companies involved in its draft statement over the weekend .
But Sikorsky , Lockheed - Martin , Raytheon and Boeing , are four companies involved in the latest $ 6.4 billion sale .
All four have so far declined to comment to the press .
Boeing has big commercial interests in China , the world 's most populous market , including commercial aircraft sales .
United Technologies , which owns Sikorsky , also has significant business in the country , where it sells Carrier brand heating and air - conditioning , Otis elevators and escalators and other products .
Experts , while hailing the sanction as the most concrete countermeasure so far , said the government should weigh the sanctions in a cautious way as those companies have close trade cooperation with China .
Yuan Peng , head of US studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations , said that imposing sanctions for the first time signals China is more serious than ever in its reaction to the arms sale .
Ye Hailin , an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said the sanctions mean that those companies who try to profit from the deal need to pay the price .
" You can not just make money from both Taiwan and the mainland , " said Ye .
Many Chinese also applaud the sanctions .
" We should make the US feel more pain over the arms sale .
They deserve this concrete punishment , " said Gao Jie , a resident in Beijing .
According to Li Qinggong , deputy secretary - general of the China Council for National Security Policy Studies , arms makers , including Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co , have actually been long kept out of the Chinese market despite the fact that China has a huge demand for radars and related equipment because of its airport expansion .
On the website of Lockheed Martin , the global section listed the ROK , Japan , Taiwan , Singapore , Australia , New Zealand and India under its category of " Asia Pacific market " , but not the Chinese mainland .
The company 's last business with the mainland can be traced to 2002 , when it provided seven air traffic control automation systems .
Li said it was relatively easy for China to ban pure arms sellers , but it would be very complicated to sever the relations with Boeing and the United Technologies .
" It is still unclear whether the sanctions mean to be effective against the whole group or just the unit involved , " said Li . " Yet our government should weigh the sanctions in a cautious way to avoid hurting overall trade relations . "
Like previous US governments the Obama administration has been closely linked with arms manufacturers .
Robert J. Stevens , chairman , president and CEO of Lockheed Martin made a large donation to the Democrats since the Obama administration came to power .
William J. Lynn , the current Deputy Secretary of Defense , used to be chairman and chief executive officer of Raytheon Company .
Other US politicians are also closely linked with the arms sellers .
FedSpending.org , a website of the watchdog group OMB
Watch , reported in 2008 that 151 members of Congress invested close to a quarter billion dollars in companies that received defense contracts of at least $ 5 million in 2006 .
These companies got more than $ 275.6 billion from the government in 2006 , or $ 755 million per day , said the report .

The first monogamous amphibian has been discovered living in the rainforest of South America .
Genetic tests have revealed that male and females of one species of Peruvian poison frog remain utterly faithful .
More surprising is the discovery that just one thing - the size of the pools of water in which they lay their tadpoles - prevents the frogs straying .
That constitutes the best evidence yet documented that monogamy can have a single cause , say scientists .
Details of the frog 's sex life is to be published in the journal The American Naturalist .
These frogs are truly devoted to their offspring , and to each other
Dr Jason Brown
Duke University
" This is the first discovery of a truly monogamous amphibian , " says biologist Dr Jason Brown , then of East Carolina University in Greenville , North Carolina , who made the discovery with colleagues Dr Victor Morales and Professor Kyle Summers .
The monogamous frog species Ranitomeya imitator , known as the mimic poison frog , is already known to science .
In recent years , Dr Brown and his colleagues have extensively studied many of its habits , which were filmed by the BBC natural history documentary series Life in Cold Blood .
After mating , a female mimic poison frog lays her eggs on the surface of leaves .
The male frog then takes away the tadpoles that hatch , carrying them one by one on his back to pools of water which collect in bromeliad leaves high up in the branches of trees .
Each of half a dozen babies are put into their own tiny pool , which he then looks after .
When the tadpoles become hungry , the male calls to his female partner who arrives to lay a non-fertile egg in each pool , which the tadpole eats as food .
But while the male and female frogs appear to act in unison , new experiments have revealed the extent of their fidelity .
Many animals appear to be monogamous , with males and females forming pairs that can often last a lifetime .
But the recent explosion in genetic analyses has revealed many of these so - called monogamous relationships to be a sham .
While many animals might stay together and breed , they will often sneak off and cheat on their partners when they get a chance .
So Dr Brown and his colleagues decided to check out the mimic poison frog more closely .
They sampled the DNA of many pairs of adult frogs , and the subsequent generations of tadpoles they produced .
Of 12 frog families , 11 had males and females that remained continually faithful to one another , together producing all their offspring .
In the twelfth family , a male frog mated with two females .
" Others have found evidence of social monogamy in amphibians where parents remain paired , however they did n't look at the genetics of these couples and their offspring to confirm this , " Dr Brown told the BBC .
" Or they have looked at the genetics and observed that they are actually promiscuous . "
So that makes the mimic poison frog the first confirmed monogamous amphibian .
That contrasts with another closely related frog called the variable poison frog , which the mimic poison frog imitates , having a very similar colour pattern .
Genetic tests on the variable poison frog ( Ranitomeya variabilis ) by the researchers show it is promiscuous .
Keeping guard
Further research by the team has also revealed why the two frogs , similar in so many ways , are sexually very different .
The variable poison frog lays its eggs in much bigger pools of water , five times as large on average than those used by the mimic poison frog .
Also , the female plays no part in their raising , leaving their care to the male frog only .
When the researchers moved tadpoles from both species into different sized pools , they found that the tadpoles grew quickly in the larger pools , which contain more nutrients , but could not survive alone in smaller ones .
That strongly suggests that variable poison frogs do n't need to stick together , as their tadpoles can survive in larger pools without feeding from their mothers .
Mimic poison frogs have been forced to take a different path , however .
Their tadpoles cannot survive without the care of both their father and mother , as there is too little natural food in their smaller pools .
Fatherly protection
So the adult frogs stick together .
Overall , the researchers believe they have found convincing evidence of an evolutionary chain of causation : changing the breeding pool size forced the mimic poison frog to change its system of parental care , with males and females working together .
That then culminated in social and genetic monogamy .
If the pools were bigger , the frogs would n't have to remain faithful , as they would n't be tied by their need to work together to raise their brood .
" These frogs are truly devoted to their offspring , and to each other , " says Dr Brown , who is now studying at Duke University in Durham , North Carolina , US .
Gregory Cendana , president of the United States Student Association , says students and community members are mobilizing coast to coast to defend public education in “ March 4 Education ” rallies next month .
He described the campaign in the organization ’s annual State of the Student Union address on the group ’s web site last week .
USSA represents over 4.5 million students at over 400 campuses nationwide .
Cendana said state governments view higher education spending as little more than budget items with distant payoffs and students paying tuition as perpetual revenue streams for deficit reduction .
“ Essentially , they are balancing their budget on the backs of students , ” said Cendana .
And federal spending has not kept up with these cuts .
The Pell Grant , known as the cornerstone of need - based aid , once covered 72 percent of the cost of college , he said .
“ Today that number has plummeted to 32 percent . ”
Student borrowers are graduating with an average of over 23,000 dollars in debt and into one of the worst job markets on record for young people .
Plus more than 65,000 undocumented students are being denied access to college because of their citizenship , the USSA president said .
All of these factors are leading to ours being the first generation in decades to be worse off than our parents , said Cendana .
“ Students are not taking this lying down , ” he adds .
“ Despite racking up mountains of debt while facing enormous tuition hikes and state budget cuts , college students have continued organizing to make education a right . ”
USSA and supporters have been mobilizing hundreds of thousands of students across the country to demand college access and affordability through weeks of action , lobby visits , and campus rallies .
Door - knocking , phone banking and letter - writing campaigns on campuses nationwide are happening and students are on the move , said Cendana .
The March 4 actions are part of this effort .
The U.S. Senate is considering student aid reform legislation , which has already passed in the House .
The bill would , instead of subsidizing private lenders , allow the federal government to allocate over 80 billion dollars to need - based aid , toward access and retention programs and investments in community colleges and minority serving institutions .
The measure faces extreme opposition from big banks and the Republican Party that do not want to see their profits lost to college affordability , Cendana says .
“ We must lobby the Senate to stand with America ’s youth by passing student aid reform , ” said Cendana .
USSA does however welcome the news that education spending has increased by 7.5 percent in President Barack Obama ’s proposed budget .
This must be maintained and students need to urge lawmakers for further increases , said Cendana .
Cendana also noted that undocumented students continue to face limited college accessibility , and said it is wrong and unfair and must be challenged .
“ We grow up with these students .
They are our grade school classmates , our neighbors , and our friends , ” he said .
“ Yet without the ability to go to college , they are left behind . ”
Students and supporters must fight to pass the Dream Act , a bill that would open the doors to immigrant students who deserve a right to attend college , said Cendana .
We are on the brink of fundamental change , he said , and never before has the goal to make education a right been so within our grasp .
But the moment is brief and our action is required , he added .
“ Start a Dream Act coalition , take over your student government , lobby for student aid reform , write your newspaper , join a March 4th Education event in your area , and come to USSA ’s Legislative Conference , ” said Cendana .
“ Together , we must unite to define this decade of student power and make education a right . ”

Most Afghans are increasingly optimistic about the state of their country , a poll commissioned by the BBC , ABC News and Germany 's ARD shows .
Of more than 1,500 Afghans questioned , 70 % said they believed Afghanistan was going in the right direction - a big jump from 40 % a year ago .
Of those questioned , 68 % now back the presence of US troops in Afghanistan , compared with 63 % a year ago .
For Nato troops , including UK forces , support has risen from 59 % to 62 % .

Afghans react to the poll
The survey was conducted in all of the country 's 34 provinces in December 2009 .
In 2009 only 51 % of those surveyed had expected improvement and 13 % thought conditions would deteriorate .
But in the latest survey 71 % said they were optimistic about the situation in 12 months ' time , compared with 5 % who said it would be worse .
The other significant theme which emerges from the figures is growing antipathy towards the Taliban .
Ninety per cent said they wanted their country run by the current government , compared with 6 % who said they favoured a Taliban administration .
Sixty - nine per cent believed the Taliban posed the biggest danger to the country , and 66 % blamed the Taliban , al - Qaeda and foreign militants for violence in Afghanistan .
Most Afghans appeared positive about the presence of troops from Nato and other countries stationed in Afghanistan .
The survey also asked if people thought it was good or bad that US forces entered Afghanistan in 2001 to drive out the Taliban .
Of those questioned , 83 % said it was either very good or mostly good .
This compares with 69 % for 2009 .
However , more of those questioned believe troops with the International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) are now worse at avoiding civilian casualties ( 43 % worse and 24 % better ) .
There was some ambivalence about how long Isaf forces should remain in the country - 22 % said they should leave within the next 18 months , and 21 % said they should stay longer than 18 months from now .

Afghans appear more positive about their general living conditions and the availability of electricity , medical care and jobs compared with a year ago .
Insecurity and crime were slightly worse , they said , and freedom of movement slightly better .
Despite a presidential election last year mired in controversy over ballot rigging , 74 % said they were either very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with the outcome .
Also , 72 % of Afghans rated President Hamid Karzai as excellent or good - compared with 52 % 12 months ago - and 60 % rated the performance of the present government as good or excellent , as opposed to 10 % who thought it was poor .
One of the major issues facing Afghanistan is corruption among government officials or the police .
Of those surveyed , 95 % identified it as a problem ; 76 % said it was a big problem and 19 % said they considered it a moderate problem .
The survey was conducted by the Afghan Center for Socio - Economic and Opinion Research ( Acsor ) based in Kabul .
Interviews were conducted in person , in Dari or Pashto , among a random national sample of 1,534 Afghan adults from 11 - 23 December 2009 .

In Kyllo v. United States , 533 U.S. 27 ( 2001 ) , the Supreme Court held that it violated the Fourth Amendment to direct an infrared thermal imaging device at a home without a warrant to determine the home ’s temperature .
This post asks whether that result is still good law .
I realize that probably sounds a bit nutty at first , as Kyllo is only a few years old .
But Kyllo deliberately adopted a test designed to let the result change with social practice .
This post asks whether changing social practices already allow the police to use thermal imaging devices without a warrant .
I ’ll look at the problem in three steps .
First , I ’ll explain the relevant Fourth Amendment test from Kyllo .
Second , I ’ll explain how technology and social practice have changed in the eight - and - a - half years since the Kyllo decision .
And third , I ’ll put the pieces together and ask whether Kyllo ’s result remains good law .
My bottom line : I ’m not really sure , but there is a decent case to be made that the police can now use thermal imaging devices without a warrant consistently with Kyllo .

It 's that time again , folks — time for another viral vid of a kid who is so incredibly gifted that you 'll a ) .
Come to loathe your own child for his / her inadequate talent show skills , b ) .
Fall into a deep sea of depression when faced with the listless path your life has taken .
I give you : 5 - year - old Jonah Rocks .
This little video hit YouTube just a few days ago , and it 's already going viral , giving other pint - sized performers like Ukulele boy and Rush Girl a run for their proverbial money .
But this little dude is no flash - in - the - pan prodigy — he even has his own website ( which — be warned — has autoplay music ) replete with more videos and photos of Jonah and the band KISS His bio , from the " About Me Section " :
" Way back in 2008 , at the age of 3 , Jonah Rocks was lining up his Play - Doh cans to make a drum kit .
He would sneak all the baby spoons from the cupboard , and use them as drumsticks .
His daddy asked him if he wanted a real drum kit , and of course , Jonah said ' YES !'
Once he sat down behind that kit , and held that first pair of 7A 's in his hands , he has never put them down , playing as much as he can , whenever he can .
Jonah is completely self taught , never had a lesson , and if you 've watched him play , you know he absolutely loves it . "
Check out his cover of System of a Down 's " Toxicity " below :
Talent Show
And , if you 're not completely demoralized by Jonah 's superior talent , here 's some more bite - sized band members for you .
Before we get to my Super Bowl pick , a Boston reader named Zeke S. slapped some sense into me last week : " Simmons , you know that there are children who have n't seen a mailbag by you all decade !?!?!? "
Great point .
Bad job by me .
Gotta think of the kids .
As always , these are actual e-mails from actual readers .
Q : Did you just witness the New Peyton Manning Face ?
That one that says , " I SMASH fools , NO ONE is as hard as me .
NO ONE prepares like I do .
I am the Field General .
I am Peyton Effing Manning ! " I had my doubts , but there 's no way the Colts are losing this game .
-- Aaron , Corvallis , Ore .
SG : That arrived in my mailbox at 4:42 p.m. ET during the Jets - Colts game .
And Aaron could n't have been more right .
Old Peyton Manning
Face is either gone or hibernating .
New Peyton Manning
Face is carrying the day .
[+]
Enlarge Al Pereira / Getty Images Which Peyton face will show up on Sunday ?
Well , if you count commercials , probably all of them .
And if you 're trying to talk yourself into the Saints on Sunday , you keep coming back to one question : " Has Manning reached that hallowed MJ / Montana / Bird / Federer ' Do n't Bet Against Me , It 's Just a Bad Idea ' level ? "
That Jets game was his masterpiece .
New York had all the momentum .
They had gotten two big plays , gone up by two scores , taken the crowd out of the game and had Manning as ( seemingly ) rattled as he'd been in a while .
They just needed to make it to halftime .
What happened ?
Manning trotted back out and just throttled them .
Four plays , 80 yards , two world - class throws .
The game was never the same .
What shocked me most : I was sitting there expecting Manning to come through a player I always assumed would choke in big moments as recently as four years ago .
Is n't that the final stage for a great athlete , when we expect an impeccable performance from him during a truly dire situation ?
Look , I hate the Colts and bleed Brady .
Nothing makes me unhappier as a football fan than the increasing likelihood that ( a ) Manning is cementing his claim as the best quarterback of his generation ( and possibly the best ever ) , and ( b ) the Brady - Belichick salad days may have come and gone .
It 's a worst - case scenario for me .
I hate it .
But if you like football , if you care about it at all , how could you not appreciate what Manning inflicted on the Jets ?
Within the span of an hour , he singlehandedly broke the will of an overachieving team that had been firing on all cylinders .
By the end of the third quarter , everyone on New York 's defense had the body language of a boxer who was getting his butt whupped but still had four rounds to go .
They were done .
We saw Brady hit this level during the first 10 weeks of New England 's 16 - 0 regular season ;
Manning has been banging it out for five solid months .
And if you 're thinking about betting against him in the Pierre Bowl , ask yourself this :
How dumb will you feel in the fourth quarter , with the Colts leading by 10 and driving for another score , if Manning has the New Peyton Manning Face going ?
Would you be kicking yourself ?
Would you be saying , " Why did I go against Manning ?
What was I thinking ? "
More on this at the end of the column .
Q : Where does Mike Dunleavy stepping down rank in your greatest moments as a Clippers season - ticket holder ?
-- Dan , St. Paul , Minn .
SG : Are you kidding ?
It ranked No. 1 , right ahead of the 10 minutes after the Clips won the Blake Griffin lottery ( before I remembered that they were the Clippers and the odds were overwhelming that he'd wreck his knee or have an anvil fall on him ) .
You know what 's really sad ?
It 's the only time during my Clippers season - ticket era that I 've gotten e-mails from Clippers fans saying , " Woo hoo ! " or " We did it ! "
I guess that 's what happens when a team fires a coach who was 215 - 326 over the last six - plus years and pumped out more excuses than John Edwards .
You know what really killed Dunleavy ?
The 2009 - 10 Portland Trail Blazers .
He could n't rope Donald Sterling and L.A. 's front office into the whole " we'd be doing great if we did n't have all these injuries ! " excuse for the fourth time in seven years as the decimated Blazers keep chugging along toward 50 wins while losing a key guy every other week .
My only regret is that they did n't have one last " do n't worry , we 're firing Dunleavy right after " home game ( Saturday night against the Spurs would have been perfect ) so that he could have worn one last cheap suit , brought an ice - cold Steve Novak into the biggest play of the game one last time , and allowed the fans to chant " Fire Dunleavy ! " for two more hours .
They owed the fans that much .
Alas .
( The other big downer : that he stayed on as GM .
It 's like finding out that your sister finally dumped her loser boyfriend whom everyone 's been trying to convince her to dump for the last seven years , only he 's still going to be living over her garage .
I 'm going to spend Super Bowl weekend in Miami persuading my ESPN bosses to lure him away as a TV guy .
No , no , he 's gonna be GREAT .
The guy 's a star !
You have to believe me ! )
Q : Remember that you stated back on July 28th of 2009 that if Mike Dunleavy was still coach by Valentine 's Day , you would organize " Throw Bags of Your Own Urine " Night at the next Clippers game ?
Almost made it !
I had this article in mind all season and now I have nothing to look forward to on Valentine 's Day except taking my girlfriend out .
Way to ruin my day .
-- Pete , Philadelphia
SG : OK , so there were three big downers .
Not two .
Q : Since the Clippers removed Dunleavy from coaching , I would love it if you could compare your jubilation , relief , and / or excitement to a movie scene .
Are we talking " Shawshank " when Andy has made it out of the sewer pipe ?
" Goonies " when they rip up the contract ?
Lots of places to go here .
-- Greg , Haddam , Conn .
[+]
Enlarge Layne Murdoch / Getty Images Absence from Boston has only made the Sports Guy 's heart grow fonder in his man crush of Kevin Durant .
SG : I found out about Dunleavy in a fairly memorable way -- while driving from Washington to Miami with my buddy House for the Audi Efficiency Challenge .
( Note : Our 14 - hour journey raised $ 20,000 for the Red Cross in Haiti .
I drove the first 700 miles before coming out to a standing ovation .
If you want to read my tweets from the trip , click here . )
We were about 11 hours , two food stops and one gas stop into the trip and plodding along I -95 in Florida .
( It 's a surprisingly boring highway , by the way .
Should n't there be more to look at in Florida ? )
The previous highlight of the trip had been getting shut out of Chick - fil - A for most of South Carolina , then finally finding one and plowing through sandwiches like " Survivor " contestants plow through food after winning a rewards challenge .
Suddenly my BlackBerry started vibrating like crazy , and you can guess the rest .
So what movie scene ?
I 'd go with Henry Hill finding out that the Lufthansa heist worked in " Goodfellas . "
Remember when he's in the shower and just starts screaming in disbelief , then banging the wall ?
Yeah .
Here 's how depressing the Dunleavy era was : Someone asked me recently whether I had taken my 2 - year - old son to a Clippers game yet .
My answer ?
I can't take him until Dunleavy gets fired .
I want him to like basketball games and think they are fun .
I was dead serious .
Thanks for the memories , Mike .
Q : Troy Aikman 's dull monotone must be exactly the same as Hannibal Lecter talking to Miggs before he killed himself .
-- Mike W. , Louisville
SG : ( dull monotone )
You 're exactly right , Mike .
Q : IS THERE A MORE ODD COUPLE THAN HAYDEN PANETTIERE AND WLADIMIR KLITSCHKO ?
-- Ryan , Portland , Maine
SG : Agreed .
They 're such an odd couple that they broke Ryan 's caps lock .
I 'm just shocked that two people unseated Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes as " the celebrity couple that looks the strangest in all photographs . "
By the way , did you ever consider the parallels between the Klitschkos destroying heavyweight boxing and the Williams sisters destroying women 's tennis ?
Name me your favorite heavyweight fight of the last 10 years .
You can't .
Name me your favorite women 's tennis match of the past 10 years .
You can't .
The Klitschkos wo n't fight each other ; the Williams sisters refuse to go all out against each other .
It sucks .
The only thing that could redeem what happened here :
If the Klitschkos and Williams sisters started double - dating each other and shattered the " celebrity couple that looks the strangest in all photographs " record .
Q : If you were a billionaire and could start a sports franchise in any city , what sport would you choose and where would you locate it ?
-- Matt , Miami
SG : My buddy House and I spent 20 minutes debating this question during our 15 - hour drive , because these are the things you talk about during a 15 - hour drive .
Here 's what we decided :
• Has to be an NBA team .
Just so I could hire myself as the GM , and for the comedy .
• Has to be somewhere warm -- not just to lure free agents , but because it 's warm .
• Has to have nightlife good enough that it would be a competitive disadvantage for opposing teams .
• Has to be a place that would lend itself to a cool name , cool uniforms and a cool logo .
House votes for the " Hawaii Lava . "
He likes this idea because it nails every bullet point above , and because it would give him a chance to spend more time with Chad Ford .
I had originally voted for the " San Diego Zoo , " but House had me so excited about the Lava uniforms that I switched my vote .
I wo n't even tell you his game plan .
I 'm saving it for when I become a billionaire and get awarded a franchise .
Q : Do you realize that the rapid decline of KG and T - Mac was foreshadowed in this year 's adidas commercial ?
Watch it again now ( especially the beginning for the two guys on both ends ) .
KG and McGrady can barely run and showcase absolutely no athletic talent during the entire commercial .
McGrady looks 20 pounds overweight during a simulated jump shot ( except he does n't jump ) , and KG can barely manage his trademark menacing face .
-- Chase , Pontiac , Mich .
SG : Um , I do n't need to watch it again .
I 'm a Celtics fan .
I watch it every game .
Even though Garnett ended up winning a title , his recent decline is more than a little unfair ; after killing himself on all those crappy Timberwolves teams , when he finally reached NBA nirvana and found the right teammates and the right crowd , his body held up for exactly 16 months .
Now he 's playing on one leg like 2004 C - Webb , and there 's no going back .
Once your knees go as an NBA player , they 're gone .
So it 's the elephant in the room of every Celtics game -- physically , he looks the same , so you keep forgetting he has a bad wheel until he can't get up for an alley - oop or lets someone beat him baseline because he can't move laterally .
And then it 's like , " Ohhhhhhh . "
Can you complain if you 're a Celtics fan ?
Of course not .
They won a title and vindicated that mega - trade .
At the same time , it 's a little sobering that what should have been a four - or five - year run may have lasted only 16 months .
Of course
Q : If you could go back in time " Lost " - style and fix the 2007 lottery so the Celtics landed the second pick , would you keep what happened ( No. 5 pick , KG trade , 2008 title , everything else that happened up to now ) , or would you switch it so that they ended up with the No. 2 pick and Durant ?
-- Dr. Bill Simmons , Boston
[+]
Enlarge Garrett W. Ellwood / Getty Images " Good riddance , Mike !
I hope you ... oh , wait ... you 're only sort - of leaving ? "
SG : OK , I fibbed that one .
My dad asked me that on the phone this week .
And we both came to the same conclusion pretty quickly :
You 'd have to go with Durant .
Have you seen what he 's doing for the Zombies lately ?
Thirty a night , eight boards , 50 percent shooting , nails his free throws just eerie , Gervin - like consistency for a young team that does n't have another reliable scorer , and if that 's not enough , he 's the single best teammate in the league other than LeBron .
Barring injury , he 's going to win this year 's scoring title ( he'd be the youngest ever by two years ) and could be looking at a historic 35 ppg , 10 rpg , 50/40/90 percentage season soon .
I do n't see how you pass that up .
And if you remember , the 2007 Celts had a decent nucleus in place already ( Al Jefferson , Rajon Rondo , Kendrick Perkins , Paul Pierce , Theo Ratliff 's expiring contract , the rights to Minnesota 's No. 1 ) and easily could have turned a couple of those assets into Pau Gasol a couple of months later .
Here 's the best analogy :
You know in football when a team kicks a field goal , only there 's a penalty , and they have the option of wiping the points off the board but getting four new downs ?
It 's usually a horrible idea to wipe the points off unless you have someone on the Brady - Manning - Brees level as your quarterback .
Too risky otherwise .
For a redo of the 2007 lottery scenario , you would wipe three points off the board ( in this case , an NBA title ) , grab Durant and go for seven points ( the possibility of multiple titles and 15 - plus years of a potential pantheon guy ) .
You have to .
One more note :
This is something like my 10th or 11th year with NBA Season Pass .
I have never gotten attached to a non-Celtics team before , and I 've never played favorites if there were multiple non-Boston games happening at the same time .
This year ?
I find myself gravitating toward Zombies games night after night .
It 's a real team .
They like one another .
They 're better as a group than they are as individuals .
And Durant is the most special non-LeBron talent in basketball .
Not only is there nobody like him , but there 's also never been anyone like him .
He 's an original prototype .
In other news
Q : How is it possible that Greg Oden beat out Ron Artest to become the first NBA player to have naked pictures show up on the Internet ?
If Vegas had odds on this , what would they have been ?
I 'm thinking Artest at 6:5 , Oden more like 38,901,257:1 .
-- Frank , Long Island
SG : Agreed .
Total shocker .
Although it did allow me to make the " they were n't kidding when they said Oden 's legs were different sizes " joke .
And look , I hate to cry conspiracy here , but have you ever noticed that every time a photograph or sex tape gets leaked of a naked male celebrity -- I have to put this gently -- it turns out that the guy had nothing to be ashamed of ?
Why are n't any of these guys ever built like the guy who pops out of the trunk in " The Hangover " ?
It 's an amazing ongoing " coincidence . "
( By the way , I wish you could have shown me this sequence of e-mails three years ago as we were agonizing over the " Who 's better , Oden or Durant ? " question .
Would have saved everyone a ton of time . )
Q : Oh , Gilbert Arenas wo n't see him no more .
-- Clint , Madison , Wis .
SG : And you thought a 38 - year - old movie could n't sum up poor Gilbert 's situation in eight words .
Q : My buddies and I saw " Avatar " last night at the AMC Loews on 34th St. in Manhattan .
On our way in to the theater , we spotted Ronnie and Sammi Sweatheart .
We were so shocked that we just stared at them as they descended down the escalator while we rode past them in the opposite direction .
After 20 seconds of staring , my buddy finally snaps out of his stupor and shouts " Ron Ron Juice !
Gets the party started ! "
Sammi immediately dropped her head in shame while Ronnie gave us a fist pump and said " Yeaahhhh . "
Definitely the highlight of the night .
-- Tyson Brazell , New York
SG : That 's not a good sign for the Oscar hopes of " Avatar " -- that two reality stars ended up being the highlight of your night .
But I 'm glad you brought up " Jersey Shore . "
On my Season 1 recap podcast with the czar of reality TV , Dave Jacoby , we both argued that Season 2 could n't happen at the Jersey shore because the cast members have gotten too big .
We were hoping for a " fish out of water " location for them , something like Hollywood , South Beach , London or Kabul .
We thought that would be a situation .
A week later , news trickled out that MTV is leaning toward the Hamptons ( same mixing - it - up premise , more local ) for Season 2 , which would smartly keep things fresh and avoid those been - there - done - that pitfalls that sank other reality sensations like " The Osbournes " and " The Apprentice . "
So basically , we see sports decision - makers and political decision - makers repeat mistakes from previous generations again and again , and somehow , the one time someone is smart enough to say , " We need to learn from past mistakes -- how can we keep moving forward ? " it was a cable network maximizing the potential of a reality franchise that glamorizes sex , violence and general stupidity , as well as GTL ( gym , tanning , laundry ) .
I thought this was funny .
Q : Heather Graham turned 40 today ; not only does this make her eligible for your Diane Lane All - Stars , but I believe it may put her in the 3 - 4 - 5 hole of the lineup .
If you filled out the 2010 batting order , what would it look like ?
-- Greg , New York
SG : You know , it 's been a few years since we created the Diane Lane All - Stars .
Thanks to botox , lasers , and all the other products and cosmetic treatments , so many older women look fantastic now that it 's like trying to figure out which potential Hall of Fame receivers or sluggers from the '90s and '00s should be Hall of Famers .
Everyone 's stats are inflated .
Should we bump the age minimum to 45 ( or at least 43 ) ?
Probably .
But under old - school rules , my batting order looks like this :
1. Jennifer Aniston ( 40 ) -- I like having a single leadoff hitter with rumbling ovaries .
Aggressive and unquestionably desperate .
You 'd fear her on the basepaths .
2. Sandra Bullock ( 46 ) --
Cheery veteran , good for the clubhouse , willing to give up at - bats and move runners along to help the team .
[+]
Enlarge Getty Images Welcome to the All - Star Team , Rollergirl .
3. Heather Graham ( 40 ) -- Power , OPS , speed , the whole package .
It 's almost unfair to the others that she 's eligible .
It 's like when Jack Nicklaus joined the PGA Senior Tour .
4. Halle Berry ( 43 ) -- Perennial MVP candidate , someone you have to see in person to fully appreciate her greatness .
Our highest - paid player .
5. Salma Hayek ( 43 ) -- Fiery Latina , prodigious natural gifts , famous for people gawking at her tape measure home runs .
6. Catherine Zeta-Jones ( 40 ) --
She 's our David Ortiz , an aging foreign slugger who 's four or five years older than listed .
7. Kelly Preston ( 47 ) --
Do n't worry about the creepy Travolta stink on her .
She 's still putting up big stats , and the statistical community loves her .
8. Demi Moore ( 47 ) --
Knows all the chemical shortcuts and can help anyone else who needs advice on surgery or botox .
9. Cheryl Hines ( 44 ) --
Keeps the team loose , keeps everyone laughing , does n't go for her own stats , gives us a hot - selling jersey for our Jewish fans .
Can play four positions .
Starting pitcher : Diane Lane ( 45 ) -- Crafty veteran , namesake of the team , knows every trick in the book .
She 's like Jack Morris circa 1991 .
You want her out there in big games .
Set - up reliever : Maria Bello ( 42 ) --
Can throw one inning or three , has the highest " nude scene per movie " ratio of any decent actress .
Closer : Cindy Crawford ( 43 ) --
Still routinely hits 103 on the radar gun .
Coaching staff : Jacqueline Bisset , Julie Christie , Helen Mirren ( all in their 60s ) .
Why is it that women with accents retain a level of hotness that American women can't match ?
OK , maybe I 'm alone on this .
( Waiting . )
Nothing ?
Let 's move on .
Q : How have you not written one word about Anton Chigurh joining this season 's cast on " High School Reunion " ?
I 'm still in shock that you have n't touched on this yet ; not even a tweet .
You 're slipping , Sports Guy .
-- Brad , Frankfort , Ky .
SG : I 'm not slipping .
I 'm still in shock and awaiting the big coin - flip scene in the season finale , followed by him killing everyone with an air gun .
Unfortunately , we 're the only ones who get these jokes since we 're the only two watching the show .
Q : Why is Brett Favre 's career better than Kurt Warner 's again ?
Every single statistic that is a " rate " favors Warner as well as career QB rating .
Favre playoff record : 12 -10 .
Warner playoff record : 8 - 3 . Why do we stalk Favre 's land manor every winter and we 're going to let Warner go in peace ?
-- Dan , New York
SG : Because people care about Brett Favre .
Did you see the rating for that Vikes - Saints game ?
Fifty - seven million people !
Highest rated non-Super Bowl since the " Seinfeld " finale .
You can call him an attention hog , say he 's overrated , claim he 's a wishy - washy narcissist , even play the " if Desmond Howard does n't annihilate the 1996 Patriots , he 's ring - less right now " card .
But ultimately , everyone else in the room will care about your opinion .
He 's polarizing , he 's fascinating , he 's fun to complain about , he 's fun to watch , he 's predictable and unpredictable there 's just a lot going on .
You could n't say the same about Kurt Warner .
He was just a good guy who played football really well .
As for your Warner - Favre debate , that 's a fun one .
I never thought about that before .
In my book , I spent a lot of time figuring out specific ways to measure careers against each other , eventually coming to this conclusion : I 'd rather have four or five phenomenal years from Player A than 15 very good years from Player B. Well , I 'd take 1999 - 2001 Warner over any three - year incarnation of Favre in his prime , and I 'd take 2008 - 2009 Warner over any two - year incarnation of Favre after his prime .
No contest .
But let 's say you could start a team with either of them .
If I offered you nearly two full decades of Favre ( a top - 5 quarterback from 1993 to 2002 and a better - than - average quarterback from 2003 through 2009 ) or 11 up - and - down years from Warner ( better peaks in 1999 - 2001 and 2007 - 2009 , plus a higher playoff ceiling , but nothing else ) you 'd take Favre .
You would .
Warner wins the " higher ceiling " and " better teammate " arguments , and that 's it .
Q : Just watched the NFC title game .
I have n't seen the ball get dropped so many times in New Orleans since FEMA .
-- Andrew , Melbourne , Fla .
SG : " Thank you , thank you , you guys have been great !
Are you enjoying this mailbag ?
Tell your face ! "
Q : With almost every team " icing " the kicker by calling a timeout before a game - winning field goal attempt , it seems like everyone just expects it now .
In the Saints - Vikings game , Garrett Hartley was practically walking off the field before the Vikings " iced " him .
Why do n't more teams mix it up and defrost the kicker every once in awhile , forcing him to kick when he was n't really expecting it ?
-- Peter Davis , Indianapolis
SG : I love it !
Defrosting the kicker .
Although if it catches on , I 'm going to need a new euphemism for masturbation .
Q : Is there anything more ludicrous than shared e-mail accounts for married couples ?
What are these morons thinking ?
What possible good could come from this ?
The only thing more ludicrous is Brad Childress getting extended midseason .

There 's a whole new meaning now when your friend signs an e-mail , " I am Tiger Woods . "
SG : For the record , I got that e-mail two months ago ( well before the 12 Men In the Huddle Game ) .
See , I 'm all for the shared e-mail account for married couples .
It 's an uncomplicated way of announcing to your friends , " We tell each other everything , so if you confide in one of us , just know you 're confiding in both of us , " and if you want to dig deeper , there 's a little " I caught him cheating on me and / or found hundreds of hours of Internet porn on his computer , so the only way I 'm allowing him to even use e-mail anymore is if we share an account from now on . "
Or as it came to be known in 2010 , the Elin Nordegren Woods .
Q : Vikings - Saints : Just because a game is close does not mean it 's good .
Dramatic ?
Maybe .
Watchable ?
Kinda .
Entertaining ?
Gonna have to say no .
So can we all OK this rule ?
That game was not " good . "
Or " great . "
What word would you use to describe it ?
Can you create one ?
-- Dan , Rockville , Md .
SG : Sure .
I 'd go with a cross between " memorable , " " riveting " and " dramatic . "
Do you like " rivetemorablatic " or " dremorabeting " ?
Q : Was this the Joe Buck quote of the playoffs : " The Vikings have n't won a conference championship game since their last Super Bowl ? "
-- Marion , Yuma , Ariz .
SG : I 'd like to think so .
But I 'm glad you brought this up .
Announcing a basketball or hockey game or a soccer match has its own rhythm ; you 're either good at it or you 're not .
There 's only one way to do it .
We can have excitable versions and less excitable versions , but ultimately , you 're doing it one way .
Football and baseball play - by - play guys are more polarizing because there is n't an accepted way to announce those sports .
We see three styles : the Summerall / Buck style ( understated , professional , never excited ) ; the Harlan / Gus Johnson style ( over the top , overexcited , downright giddy ) ; and the Marv Albert / Jim Nantz / Sean McDonough style ( understated and professional , but more than willing to rise to the occasion if the moment deserves it ) .
It 's easier to pull off the Buck or Gus Johnson styles simply because you 're in the same mode all the time no matter what 's happening .
You might like one of those styles the most .
I would n't begrudge you .
Me ?
With all due respect to my man Gus , I respect the Nantz / McDonough style most because of the degree of difficulty .
You can't do a shtick ; you have to be genuinely invested in the events , and if that investment does n't feel genuine , we can tell immediately .
( The other crucial trait : being able to sell your partner regardless of whether he 's great or he sucks , which is the main reason why I 'd take Marv over Al Michaels in any Best Announcer Ever contest .
You could put Marv in a three - man booth with Moses Malone and Greg Stink , and he'd be able to coax a good broadcast out of them . )
My favorite non-Marv announcing performance ever belongs to Sean McDonough , who absolutely TJ Lavin'ed the ninth inning of Game 7 of the 1992 NLCS ( Pittsburgh at Atlanta ) .
It 's one of the most dramatic innings ever played -- Atlanta 's incredible comeback combined with the do - or - die stakes for a Pirates team that was being blown up , win or lose ( and would never bee the same again ) -- and McDonough matches everything that happens , with his voice even cracking as the creaky Sid Bream slides across home plate with the winning run ( " SA - AFE ! " ) .
Total goosebumps moment .
When you think about it , we 've been seeing reruns of the best possible games since the mid-'90s ( back when Classic Sports launched ) ; it 's always the same crew of games presented for us to experience in the same retroactive , nostalgic way .
I 've run out of ways to enjoy the old Jordan games , my favorite Boston games and everything else .
But a select few always manage to suck me in , usually the uber - dramatic ones with devastating results for one side -- Byner 's fumble , Sid Bream , the Snow Game , etc. -- and I 'd rank the ninth inning of that Sid Bream game against any of them .
And yes , the shot of Andy Van Slyke sitting in center field as if he just watched a bus blow up gets me every time .
It 's a masterpiece of a game .
And it would n't have been as good without an announcer who matched the moment .
I do n't think Joe Buck could have done it .
Q : Remember when Rex Ryan was screaming at the officials during the AFC Championship Game ( but we could n't hear what he was saying ) ?
This is what we yelled at the TV .
" I SAID TRIPLE CHEESEBURGER ! " " WHO ORDERED THAT SALAD ?!? "
" SLOPPY JOES ! " I would have to say that everybody watching across America probably said something to that effect .
What else would have been funny ?
-- Neal , Seattle
SG : I 'm going with " Get in my belly !!!! " or " Get in my belllllllllly ! "
Q : You know how Phil Jackson gives each of his players a book to read every year ?
Well , did you see what he gave Kobe Bryant this year ?
A book called " Montana 1948 , " about a family in conflict after it is discovered that one member has been sexually assaulting Native American women .
It explores how his brother deals with the struggle between his moral obligations and his family loyalty .
This is what Phil said about it : " ( Kobe ) never reads my books , so I got him a book about Montana .
I 'm not looking forward to having a review from him , but it was about the part of the country I grew up in so it 's something special for me to give it to him . "
Wow , any subtext there ?
-- Max , Oakland , Calif .
SG : ( Afraid to say anything . )
Q : I love your idea of the Blackberry Infidel for cheaters , but I have a tweak for it .
Instead of having all of them password - protected by default , this Blackberry would be like two devices in one .
It is a regular Blackberry that is not password - protected and has all the e-mails from your wife and pictures of your kids .
A secret series of keystrokes ( essentially a password ) would then unlock the Infidel .
This mode would use different e-mail addresses , and even a different phone number used only for cheating .
That way your phone bill will never show incriminating texts or phone calls .
There would be separate storage to keep all of the naked pictures of your mistresses .
Best of all , another set of keystrokes would instantly delete all of the memory and restore the Infidel back to its default settings .
I think we can build on this .
-- Russell H , Austin , Texas
SG : ( Nodding . )
Q : Is n't the most improbable / unrealistic part of the movie " Taken " that a 17 - year - old American girl would go to Europe to follow around U2 ?
-- Daryl , LeBanon , Pa .
SG : ( Still nodding . )
Q : Does n't your " Ten Minutes with Tiger " interview demonstrate that Michael Jordan did n't leave basketball for the stated reason , to play baseball ?
Why keep playing after three straight NBA championships ?
To quote Tiger Woods , to " Win. Keep winning . "
Think about it .
Jordan and Tiger have similar hypercompetitive personalities .
Destroy everyone , every time .
We already knew Tiger was one of the greats years ago , just as we knew Jordan was one of the greats in 1994 .
Yet , Jordan 's legacy was n't cemented in 1994 .
The greatest athletes do n't compete with their peers .
They compete for their places in history .
There 's no way he walked away from basketball voluntarily .
-- John S. , Sacramento
SG : ( Nodding vigorously . )
Q : If the Colts win the Super Bowl , what kind of reaction will the corpse of Jim Caldwell have after Gatorade is dumped on him ?

It was nice of Madame Tussaud to loan the NFL their Coach Jim for the week .
SG : I 'm rooting for him not to move at all .
I want it to seem as though they poured Gatorade on a cardboard cutout of Jim Caldwell .
Has anyone ever stonewalled the Gatorade bath before ?
I feel like he could do it .
Q : So I was at a buddy 's house last night with a bunch of friends .
At the end of the night , one guy takes out his cell phone , calls someone and asks , " Hey , you want to sneak in some Tiger Woods ? "
It turns out this guy was calling his brother to see if he wanted to get in a round on the Xbox before the end of the night .
But I ask you :
Is there a better euphemism for someone having an adulterous liaison ?
As in : " I 'm sure Ashton Kutcher is probably faithful to Demi Moore , but I could see him sneaking in a couple of rounds of Tiger Woods now and then . "
-- Mike , Arlington , Mass .
SG : I like it .
By the way , I remain disappointed that Tiger played the sex - rehab card -- even though it was the smartest move for him , as I wrote six weeks ago , because Americans are always more forgiving once the word " addiction " is introduced -- instead of playing the " what can I tell you , I got married too soon , it was a mistake and I feel terrible about it , but you live and you learn , so I 'm not gonna live a lie anymore and I 'll just be single " card .
You can't convince me that Tiger has an " addiction " when he was n't doing anything different from what HUNDREDS ( yes , all caps ) of celebrities and athletes were / are / will always be doing .
It 's insulting .
The sex - rehab card seems just as calculated as everything else he did this past decade .
If you want to dig deeper , there 's a chance that Tiger convinced himself that he did have a sex addiction , no different from O.J. 's convincing himself that he did n't kill his wife , or John Edwards ' convincing himself that he did n't have a love child , or Mark McGwire 's convincing himself that he did n't abuse steroids as badly as anyone from the previous decade despite the New York Daily News ' reporting otherwise .
My boss John Walsh wanted me to write a column about why famous people can convince themselves that an alternate version of the reality they already lived took place -- really , it 's the height of hubris , that someone could ignore facts because the same unwavering self - confidence that made them a transcendent athlete also leads them to cheat the system and lie to people that love them -- so by the time they 're selling their convoluted excuse of a story , they really do believe it .
And it 's a great idea .
But there 's nowhere to go with it beyond what I just wrote .
It 's cut - and - dried .
Anyway , Tiger was n't a serial cheater because he was addicted to sex .
He was a serial cheater because he became famous too soon ; because he learned from " role models " who were doing the same thing ; and because , like most super - famous people , he stopped thinking that the rules of human decency applied to him .
Q : Have you ever wondered what Dora and Diego actually do to make money ?
I have and the only plausible explanation is that Diego trades in exotic animals ( ever notice that everything he saves is highly prized as some sort of ancient remedy ) and Dora is simply a Colombian drug courier ( how else do you explain a magic backpack full of " stars " that makes everything better ) .
-- Steve , Petaluma , Calif .
SG : You 're dead on .
I also think Max and Ruby 's grandmother is an ex-con with multiple aliases and outstanding warrants .
Q : Imagine if LeBron started a complete new trend starting in 2010 where he just decided , " Eff it , I 'm winning a ring EVERY year " and signed one - year contracts EVERY YEAR for the biggest contender with cap space that could afford him .
In true LeBron style , he begins a completely new type of superstar -- the " Superstar Hitman . "
It 's as if we could have the 2010 LeBron sweepstakes EVERY YEAR !
Can you imagine ?
-- Chris S. , Brisbane , Australia
SG : Do n't laugh -- you might see a modified version of that .
One of two things will happen with the NBA 's next collective bargaining agreement :
Either they 'll have a harder cap with no luxury tax ( like what happened with hockey ) , or they 'll change it so that no contract can be guaranteed for more than three years .
I 'd wager on the latter idea because it protects the teams from themselves as well as one deal crippling them -- like Elton Brand with the Sixers right now -- and swings things a little more in their favor .
( For instance , you could sign Amare Stoudemire to a six - year - max deal this summer knowing that , if things go wrong for whatever reason , you have an out after three . )
But if it goes this way , and I think it will , LeBron would never have to sign more than a three - year deal anyway .
So he could play for the Bulls for three years , then the Lakers from 2013 to 2016 , then the Knicks from 2016 to 2019 , then back to the Cavs to finish things out .
The ultimate gun for hire .
Q : You wrote that Tiger is one of the " five dumbest adulterers of all time . "
Is this an actual list ?
If there is , who are the other four ?
-- Greg E. , Phoenix
[+]
Enlarge Arnaldo Magnani / Liaison Congrats , Monica !
Tiger could n't dethrone you and Slick Willie .
SG : Sorry , Bill Clinton has to be No. 1 . Doing it in the Oval Office , in the White House , where there 's a log of everyone who visits you , has to be the most reckless move in adultering history .
I 'd make John Edwards second , Tiger third , Jim Bakker and Gary Hart tied for fourth , and Hugh Grant fifth .
The smartest adulterer ever ?
Brad Pitt .
He upgraded from a workaholic actress who did n't want kids to the hottest / craziest / sexiest woman alive who doubles as a fetus machine and with no real career repercussions !
In fact , nothing Brad Pitt does ever seems to come back and haunt him .
Not even his latest beard , when he was a few rubber bands and a ponytail away from looking like Captain Lou Albano .
Everything bounces off that dude .
Q : So I was at a bar with a friend of mine the other night and naturally talk turned to Tiger .
He mentioned his " Genie in a Bottle Theory . "
If a genie asks a guy to make three wishes that she will make come true , what would the guy say ?
" I want $ 1 billion dollars , a swimsuit model wife and the chance to play golf every day . "
Tiger had all that and apparently it was n't enough to make him happy .
Now I 'm just depressed .
-- Lee , Washington , D.C.
SG : Your theory is flawed .
No man would list a wife as one of his three wishes from a genie in a bottle .
That 's not beating things like " front - row season tickets at Fenway , " " an end to world hunger " or " a 150 - foot yacht with a fully staffed crew of swimsuit models who wo n't push me for a commitment . "
Q : Who will be playing the Super Bowl halftime show for the next 10 years ?
My guess is John Mayer , U2 again , Dave Matthews Band , Beyonce , and maybe Jay - Z .
What do you think ?
I 'm worried about this .
-- Mike , Los Angeles
SG : You 're going to be really worried after you see my predictions for the next 10 years :
2011 : Beyonce and Jay - Z
2012 : Bruce Springsteen and John Cougar Mellencamp
2013 : Ayla Brown ( the daughter of our new president , former Cosmo model Scott Brown )
2014 : U2 and Pearl Jam
2015 : Britney Spears Woods
2016 : Snoop Dogg , Jay - Z and Kanye West ( just released from jail )
2017 : Justin Timberlake and Ayla Brown
2018 : John Mayer and Taylor Swift Woods
2019 : Coldplay
2020 : The Dave Matthews Band with special guest Carrie Underwood Woods
Q : Back in October I went to your book signing at Professor Thom 's in Manhattan .
I asked you to write your Super Bowl prediction when signing my book well , you predicted correctly the teams .
I tried attaching a pic of the signing to this e-mail , but it wo n't let me .
You wrote Saints 41 , Colts 40 .
Even though this high score is unlikely ( I remember JackO saying he would take the under ) I think you should still stick with your prediction .
This was in late October , right on the precipice of your catastrophic game - picking downfall .
I think you made this prediction right before you fell off the precipice , therefore you should stick with your prediction : Saints 41 , Colts 40 .
Maybe you can channel some of your earlier picking luck by sticking to your initial prediction .
You also may have been slightly drunk when signing my copy of TBOB , thus explaining the crazy high score .
Nonetheless , stick to your guns , right ?
-- Pat , New York
SG : Are you kidding ?
You just set me up for a classic " make a prediction the opposite way three months later , and either way , I can't lose ! " scenario .
I thought about sticking with that Saints pick and playing the " nobody believes in us ! " card for the Saints , but Dwight Freeney 's injury opened the door for enough pro-Saints sentiment that the game broke rather nicely for a Colts pick .
I love any time this happens : A pick looks super - obvious coming out of the gate ( I thought Indy should have been favored by seven all week ) , then everyone gets bored and starts looking for reasons why the less - obvious team can win ( Freeney 's hurt , too many people are going bonkers about Manning , the nobody - believes - in - us factor , New Orleans ' offense is good enough to come back from any deficit , etc. ) , and finally , things swing around so you feel fine about going with the team you should be picking all along .
For me , it comes down to this : I can't pick against Manning in a big game .
It 's just a bad idea .
Hence , I like a relatively close game with Indy prevailing 31 - 23 ( covering the 4½ - point spread but hitting the under of 57 ½ ) .
Then we can spend the subsequent week wondering whether Indy could have gone 19 - 0 .
That will be a barrel of laughs .

Without saying another word to her , I left .
My buddies have never stopped making fun of me since , but I still insist that it was the proudest moment of my life as a die - hard Flyers fan .
Can you please give me some consolidation , or should I have just swallowed my pride ?

LONG BEACH , Calif . —
Pride was out in force in Long Beach for a counter - protest against an antigay hate group on February 19 .
Seven representatives of the extreme fundamentalist Westboro Baptist Church set up a picket in front of Wilson High School to protest President Obama ’s appointment of Kevin Jennings to the U.S. Department of Education .
Jennings was appointed assistant deputy secretary of the Office of Safe and Drug - Free Schools back in May 2009 .
Jennings is also the founder of the Gay , Lesbian , Straight Education Network ( GLSEN ) .
According to a rambling , incoherent entry on the WBC ’s website , godhatesfags.com , Jennings and Obama have “ doomed America , ” and that Jennings was “ determined to sodomize ” all of the children he could “ get his …hands on . ”
The fanatical group ’s pitiful picket was quickly overwhelmed by 1,000 + counter protestors who showed up to let the WBCers know that their bigotry is not welcome in Long Beach .
The counter - protest was a youth - dominated , multi-racial , multi-class mix of individuals and organizations brought together by the local Gay Straight Alliance .
The students of Wilson High were dismissed from school during the protest .
Many joined the counter - protest .
At one point , the supporters of LGBT equal rights , carrying signs with slogans like “ God Made Gay , ” “ No Place for Hate , ” and “ Love is Not a Sin , ” surged across the street and quickly surrounded the hapless hate group .
Others engaged in absurdist street theater , mocking the demonstration by carrying placards with meaningless slogans like , “ Annex the Moon ” and “ Free Pizza . ”
Police made no effort to interfere with the nonviolent confrontation , instead focusing on keeping the street clear for traffic .
The chastened WBCers made their fast getaway under chants of “ Go Home ! ” and “ Long Beach ! ”
The Westboro Baptist Church , centered in Topeka , Kansas , periodically sends protest contingencies to Long Beach because it is a city with a large LGBT population .
The group also scheduled pickets the same weekend at other sites in Long Beach , including synagogues , a Jewish center , and the U.S. Naval Weapons Station .

Here 's my round up of highlights from the first day of the TED presentations .
One of my favorite presentations of the day was by Dr. William Li , a cancer researcher from the Angiogenesis Foundation .
Angiogenesis means the growth of blood vessels .
Your body usually knows how to regulate the growth of blood vessels , but sometimes there are defects in blood growing and pruning .
Too little angiogenesis can lead to things like wounds that wo n't heal , heart attack , and other diseases .
Too much angiogenesis leads to other bad things such as blindness , arthritis .
It 's is a common denominator of many diseases .
It 's also the " hallmark of every type of cancer . "
In autopsies of people who died in car accidents , doctors have found microscopic cancers in 40 % of woman ( breast ) and 40 % of men ( prostate ) .
Something like 70 % of older people have microcancers in their thyroid .
But the cancer is harmless — " cancer without disease . "
If you block angiogenesis the cancer can't grow .
" It 's a tipping point between harmless cancer and deadly one . "
Li showed a photo of a poor dog with gnarly tumor hanging off its side .
The vet gave the dog three months to live .
They started antiangiogenesis drugs .
In a few weeks , the tumor shrank away completely .
They also cured a dolphin of mouth cancer and saw a complete remission of a deadly lip cancer on a horse .
Today there 12 different antiangiogenesis drugs available for people and dogs .
They are quite effective for many cancers , but not much for liver , lung , and breast cancers .
The problem with these cancers is that by the time they are detected they have progressed too far for antiangiogenesis drugs to do their work .
The good news , Li says , is that " we eat to starve cancer . "
Lots of foods contain naturally occuring inhibitors of angiogenesis , and many are even better than drugs for blocking angiogenesis ( see image above ) .
Angiogenesis also plays a huge role in obesity .
" Adipose tissue is highly angiogenesis - dependent . "
You can cycle the weight of mice by inhibiting and promoting angiogenesis .
" We can't create supermodel mice — it takes them to normal weight . "
Daniel Kahneman at TED2010 , Session 1 , " Mindshift , " Wednesday , February 10 , 2010 , in Long Beach , California .

Daniel Kahneman , the founder of behavioral - economics talked about the differences between " experience happiness " and " memory happiness . "
His presentation brought to mind the 1966 Philip K. Dick novelette , " We Can Remember It for You Wholesale " ( which was the basis for the not - so - good movie , Total Recall ) .
Kahneman started off by listing a number of baked - in " cognitive traps " people have that make it hard to think straight about happiness .
Happiness is complex and confusing .
People tend to think that having happy experiences in your life and being happy about your life are one and the same , but they are actually different .
When your doctor asks you , " Does it hurt when I touch you here " she is asking your " experiencing self . "
When she asks , " How have you been feeling lately ? " your " remembering self " answers .
Your remembering self is a " story teller .
What we keep from our experiences is a story . "
To illustrate , Kahneman showed pain - over - time charts of two colonoscopy patients who reported the intensity of the pain they were experiencing each minute during a colonoscopy .
One patient experienced severe pain for 10 minutes .
The other experienced the same level of pain for 10 minutes , followed by gradually decreasing pain for an addition 10 minutes .
When each patient was later asked to recall the experience , the first patient said his experience was more painful , even though he experienced less pain than the second patient .
" The way that stories end matter . "
The first patient 's pain was at its peak at the very end , so it made for a worse story .
Another example : you have great experience listening to music at a live performance .
A loud screetch at the end ruins the memory of the experience .
A thought experiment : say you are about to take a vacation , but before you leave , you are told that all memory of the vacation will be wiped out as soon as you get home .
Would you take the same vacation or take a different one ?
If you think you 'd take a different one , your " experiencing self " and " remembering self " are not aligned .
Research concludes that " happiness is mainly being satisfied with being with people that we like . "

Ukulele Virtuoso Jake Shimabukuro got a standing ovation for his performance this morning , which included a masterful instrumental arrangement of Queen 's " Bohemian Rhapsody . "
Quotes : " The ukulele is underdog of all instruments . "
" If everyone played ukulele , the world would be a better place . "
" What the world needs now is more ukulele . "
" Ukulele is the instrument of peace . "
I interviewed Jake ( and will post the interview soon ) and he is extremely nice .
If the uke made him that way we have an answer to all the world 's problems .
Michael Shermer at TED2010 , Session 1 , " Mindshift , " Wednesday , February 10 , 2010 , in Long Beach , California .
Credit : TED / James Duncan Davidson
Michael Shermer showed a gadget a called the ADE651 .
It 's a black box with an antenna .
The manufacturer claims it can detect both bombs and drugs up to 1000 meters away .
It sells for $ ( removed ) ,000 .
The Iraqi government bought 800 of them .
Shermer 's friend James Randi says :
the ADE651 is a useless , quack , device which cannot perform any other function than separating naïve persons from their money .
It 's a fake , a scam , a swindle , and a blatant fraud .
The manufacturers , distributors , vendors , advertisers , and retailers of the ADE651 device are criminals , liars , and thieves who will ignore this challenge because they know the device , the theory , the described principles of operation , and the technical descriptions given , are nonsense , lies , and fraudulent .
( Does that mean he does n't like it ?. )
Shermer is the founding publisher of Skeptic magazine , Executive Director of the Skeptics Society , and columnist for Scientific American .
He talked about patternicity — the evolved tendency for people to find patterns , even in meaningless noise , and agenticity — the belief in souls , spirits , gods , ghosts , government conspirators , and aliens who more advanced than us , and are either coming to save us or enslave us .
Even idea that the government can rescue us is a form of agenticity .
9/11 is a conspiracy ( people planned the attack in secret ) , but truthers think it was an inside job by the Bush administration .
" But we know that can't be true because it worked . "
Perl 5.6.0 is almost a decade old ; perldoc perlhist gives a release date of 22 March 2000 .
My favorite feature of Perl 5.6.0 is lexical filehandles .
Instead of having to access the IO slot of package global typeglobs , I could use lexical variables to contain filehandles -- without having to muck about local izing symbol tables or worrying about action at a distance or lifetimes of global symbols .
Yet to this day , almost a decade later , I still see the old way with all of its disadvantages ( Tell the truth ; do you understand every word of " the IO slot of package global typeglobs " ?
Do you want to explain that to novice programmers ? ) in new code .
Perl 5.6.2 is long dead .
Perl 5.8.9 is the last of its release series too .
The argument for running new code on old installations of Perl 5 is awfully thin , in that light .
Likewise I can't make a simplicity argument for the old approach .
Making old - style filehandles work like people might expect is anything but simple .
Throw in a local here or there and the typeglob sigil and maybe a gensym ( ) call for good measure .
Fun !
Reasonable people differ on style and technique , but I wonder what makes a feature such as pseudohashes or 5.005 - style threads so hated that it eventually gets deleted , while difficult - to - use - correctly features superseded by better replacements stick around far longer than necessary .
My guess is that the Perl 5 world suffers here , as usual , from a questionable abundance of old code , old tutorials , old books , and copy and paste coding from ancient sources of dubious wisdom .
( This probably means I should submit patches to perldoc perluniintro and other offenders in the core documentation . )
Perhaps it 's time to consider a gradual , intentional , well - tested and well - reviewed campaign to update tutorials and example code with somewhat more modern examples of maintainable Perl .
( For fun , imagine a world where the canonical printed Perl 5 reference covered a version of Perl 5 released this millennium .
Then again , Perl.com thinks that 5.6.2 is " the previous version of Perl " 5 . )

Stardust in Perseus
Credit & Copyright : Máximo Ruiz
Explanation :
This cosmic expanse of dust , gas , and stars covers close to 3 degrees on the sky in the heroic constellation Perseus .
Right of center in the gorgeous skyscape is the dusty blue reflection nebula NGC 1333 , about 1,000 light - years away .
At that estimated distance , the field of view is about 50 light - years across .
Next to NGC 1333 is the reddish glow of shocked hydrogen gas created by energetic jets and winds from stars in the process of formation .
Other reflection nebulae are scattered around , along with remarkable dark dust nebulae .
Near the edge of a large molecular cloud , they tend to hide the newly formed stars and young stellar objects or protostars from prying optical telescopes .
Collapsing due to self - gravity , the protostars form around dense cores embedded in the molecular cloud .
“ Keep patrolling , ” pleaded Lakeisha Singleton , a lawyer who had pulled her car to the side of the road to greet Mr. Greer .

Though crime has been cut in half in New Haven over the last two decades and is down 10 percent over all this year from the year before , shootings are up about 50 percent this year , and Mr. Greer has called for the police chief , Francisco Ortiz , to resign .
Mr. Greer and his father , Rabbi Daniel Greer , dean of the yeshiva , have spent the last two decades restoring more than 40 dilapidated homes here and leasing them at no profit to low - and middle - income families .
As a result , the neighborhood “ has been on the upswing ” since its days as a haunt for prostitutes in the 1980s , said Elizabeth McCormack , the neighborhood ’s alderwoman .
But in recent years , the crime that once plagued the neighborhood began to return , and the Greers raised the idea of armed patrols after they said they got little help from the police .
Crime worsened this spring , coming to a head when Mr. Greer ’s brother , Dov , a rabbi like his father , was followed into his Edgewood home by several young men and assaulted .
A day later , the nightly patrols , from 6 to 10 p.m. , began .
At Mr. Greer ’s request , the Guardian Angels , the volunteer crime - watch group based in New York , came and set up separate unarmed patrols .
But it is the weapons carried by Mr. Greer and other patrol members , not the patrols themselves , that have caused a stir .
Nine of the patrol ’s 18 members carry guns , which is legal in New Haven as long as the citizen has a state permit .
Mr. Greer said the patrol includes Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews , and non-Jews .
Five members are black and one Hispanic , he said .
The group says that its racial makeup has eased fears that armed Jews would be chasing down black youths .

We checked in Oscar - nominated writer Terri Tatchell , the day after District 9 picked up four Academy nods .
She talked about District 9 director Blomkamp 's new project , her next scifi movie , and why this nomination is such a mystery to her .
Advertisement
District 9 is currently in the running for the Academy Award for Film Editing , Visual Effects , Writing [ Adapted Screenplay ] and the most buzzed about category Best Film .
We had to congratulate Tatchell on her Screenplay Adaptation nomination , and tell her to congratulate co-writer , director and spouse Neill Blomkamp as well .
How are you doing since the announcements yesterday ?
It feels a bit more real today , yesterday it felt more like a dream .
I 'm not drinking Baileys this morning so I 'm not quite as giddy as I was .
But I feel like I should still be celebrating .
We never ever , ever , ever , ever in a million years thought this was going to happen , ever .
We even joked that this would n't happen .
It 's certainly more pay - off than we ever expected .
We 're just happy people liked the film .
That was excitement enough ...
Advertisement
I feel like the luckiest person on the face of the Earth .
I feel incredibly fortunate , and grateful .
I 'm so excited to have been nominated for the screenplay , but I 'm also excited that it got nominated for Best Picture .
Probably more excited about that .
There are so many people that worked so hard on this film , and I do n't think it would have been as big of a success without them , like Sharlto Copley .
He was amazing in it , and I hate that he did n't get a nomination .
So I feel like the Best Picture represents everybody .
Why do you think District 9 did so well ?
I do n't want to say it does n't deserve it , but if we had n't gotten it , I do n't think I would never have thought , " Damn , they cheated me ! "
I do n't want to say it deserves it , but where I feel proud of it , is that I know how hard we worked on the story .
We worked non -stop for a year , and we agonized over it .
We agonized over the heart of it , the structure of it .
What rules we were breaking , and why we made those choices .
We worked really , really , really hard on it .
I 'm proud of how hard we worked , and I 'm proud when I sit in the theater and I hear people laugh at the right times or be horrified at the right times .
And you know that it works .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
So in that sense I 'm proud of it .
I feel proud that people have said they leave the theater thinking about things .
As opposed to just being entertained .
Because there was a fine line when we were writing it , as to how serious and heavy - handed we wanted to get with the thoughts that were in our head .
It was the first film , we had satire written on the wall .
We just kept saying , " Satire , satire — let 's not take ourselves so seriously . "
I 'm really happy with the balance that came out of the film .
I do n't know if that 's to credit the screenplay , or to credit the director .
I think maybe Neill gets the credit for that .
You 're an important figure in the science - fiction community now .
What do you think about all the other genre nods that popped up this year .
You mention Sharlto , but were there any other you were disappointed that did n't get nominated ?

I was disappointed about Moon .
I loved Moon .
I thought Sam Rockwell was amazing in Moon .
That one I 'm definitely disappointed in .
Avatar is definitely dominating everything , and it was an incredible film , very visually so .
Star Trek was great .
The Hurt Locker .
I absolutely loved .
That 's not scifi , but that deserves to be up there .
I liked the Hurt Locker so much that I got halfway home from the theater and I realized I left my purse in the theater .
That 's a compliment , that 's when you know you enjoyed a film .
But yes , for science fiction specifically , I have to say I was disappointed Moon was n't included .
Sometimes we feel that science fiction is the red - headed step child of award ceremonies , especially in Best Picture .
Do you agree ?

It definitely seems that this year it 's getting some respect .
I 'm not sure why that is .
I 'm still shocked District 9 is .
I have no explanation for that , none .
Avatar , it 's James Cameron , it 's huge .
It 's a film that appeals to everybody , younger kids and families .
So I understand why that 's in there .
But District 9 , it 's a mystery to me , I really just do n't understand it , I 'm just really happy that it happened .
I hope that it opens up avenues for future scifi films to come , because I think scifi is amazing .
Sometimes a lot of people shut their minds to it , because they do n't understand what it is .
I was reading an article yesterday that claimed that Dark Knight opened the door for District 9's Best Picture nomination , what do you think about that ?
Advertisement
Right , because [ as a result of Dark Knight 's shutout , there 's now room for ] 10 pictures , too .
There is no question District 9 would not be nominated for Best Picture , if there were only 5 .
I think I know the article you mean where it said Neill should be calling up Christopher Nolan and thanking him ?
[ Laughs ]
Yeah I definitely think that 's true that yes , we would not have been in the top 5 for sure .
So I personally , and I know there 's a lot of controversy over making it 10 , but even before we were nominated I was still in favor of it .
Because it is nice to see different dramas in there .
So people can get excited about different films .
I 've been a die hard Oscar fan since I was a little girl .
I was brought up where you ripped the announcement out of the TV Times and every family member would put in who they thought would win , and at the end of the night you totaled it up to see who would win .
It 's just more fun , if there are other films that people can root for .
District 9 has been called getting praise all year , but what has it been like since yesterday ?
Are all your projects now getting the green light overnight ?

[ Laughs ]
Neill already kind of had that going on so he 's covered .
The big thing for me with District 9 was getting an agent , because I live in Vancouver , so to get to be a writer represented in LA is really tough .
So that was huge , but I actually got that before , writing for Peter Jackson , kind of opened that door .
And when it did well people are now willing to read my spec scripts , so that 's a good thing .
But as for how an Oscar nomination is going to change things , I do n't know .
I 'm not going after paid writing jobs , I 'm more into writing at my own pace , and seeing what happens with it .
For now at least .
So James Cameron did n't call you and say " It's On ! "
[ Laughs ] No !
Gimme a week , we 'll see .
[ Laughs ] No. Writing with Neill was great , because I know him so well .
I know exactly , exactly what he 's after .
And I can write for him .
I 'm writing for another director now who is one of our best friends and know him so well , I know how to write for him .
So it kind of stresses me out to think about writing for a known director .

What 's next ?
We know that Neill is currently working on another scifi project , that he wants to keep semi-low budget , are you working on that project with him ?
No , aside from the fact I live with him , but apart from passing it back and forth , no he 's doing this one on his own .
We decided after doing District 9 ... we have a daughter , it just took over our entire lives .
You could n't have a dinner without talking whether Christopher Johnson should make it home or not .
It just took over every minute of our lives .
We 'd wake up in the middle of the night with " I have an idea ! "
We decided to try and to preserve the home life and to work separately .
He 's working on this one on his own , but I think he 's getting pretty close to the end .
I have to tell you , it 's amazing .
It 's really amazing .
It ' going to be really good , it 's definitely scifi and I think it 's going to be a little bit over the budget of District 9 , but not too much .
Advertisement
We 're excited for more scifi , will it be set in the near future like District 9 or in the now ?
District 9 was so gritty and dirty , will Neill try a more sterile approach ?
I think Neill will always be gritty and dirty with his work .
That 's very much his style , that 's what he likes .
So I think even if it were to be in the far future , which I 'm not saying it is , but even if it were — in my mind , I think [ in the ] future everything is slick and clean , [ but ]
I think his far future would still be gritty .

Does he have any idea who he wants to work with him on this film ?
For actors and actresses ?
No , no .
I do n't think he 's made that decision yet .
We constantly play that game : " What about them , what about them ? "
But he has n't made that decision .

What are you working on right now , are you staying with genre work ?
The heart and soul thing that I really want to do is write children 's novels , always ...
The film I 'm working on now is an adaptation of a short film called Terminus .
It 's a bit more science fiction , fantasy .
It 's about a stone creature that follows this stressed - out guy around , just stressing him more and more .
It was incredibly well received , and the director that created it , [ Trevor Cawood ] has n't done a feature yet , and he 's really talented .
I approached him about writing a feature script of that .
It 's been a little more challenging than I expected it to be .
I 'm probably on my second draft now .
I 'm not ready to send it off yet , but we 'll see .

Here 's the short film she 's referring to :
So you 're interested in writing children 's novels or young adult ?
Young Adult , the day that I feel like I 've really made it is when I can walk into a book store in the YA section and see a novel of mine on the shelves .
And something scifi , definitely .
The dream of all dreams would be to write a young adult science fiction novel and adapt it to the screen .
Advertisement
Are you ever going to write with Neill again ?
Maybe on a D9 sequel ?
I 'm sure we will .
If , if District 9 were to have a sequel , we 'd work on that together .
But who knows .
In the meantime we enjoy being each others ' helpers .

When is the District 9 video game coming out ?
Nobody jumped on that .
It was talked about initially and it never happened , I do n't think they are going to do it .
And the figurines , WETA is doing a Christopher Johnson , little CJ and the exo-suit collectibles .
It seems like there was so much stuff that could have been done , but I do n't think anybody thought it was going to be such a success , that it was .
I guess it did n't get going early enough .

It 's gotta be pretty sweet sitting here now after all the Halo fiasco , I 'm not sure how close you were to that project .
But it was pretty disheartening with Microsoft and everything .
You know Microsoft , they were great through it all .
There is no animosity at all towards Microsoft , they were wonderful ... it was more Fox .
You know what , for me it worked out better .
I was n't on Halo at all .
For Neill , at the end of the day , while he would have done an amazing Halo fim , in fact I 'm standing in my living room right now and I have all these amazing WETA sculptures of all the Halo characters that they were developing with Neill .
It would have been a fabulous movie .
But I think it was better for Neill that he created something wholly his own .
And District 9 is 100 % Neill Blomkamp and Halo was n't .
I think it all worked out for the best .
Obama has reinvented the state in more ways than you can imagine .
These days , liberals do n’t know whether to feel betrayed by or merely disappointed with Barack Obama .
They have gone from decrying his willingness to remove the public option from his health care plan to worrying that , in the wake of Democrat Martha Coakley ’s defeat in Massachusetts , he wo n’t get any plan through Congress .
On other subjects , too , from Afghanistan to Wall Street , Obama has thoroughly let down his party ’s left flank .
Yet there is one extremely consequential area where Obama has done just about everything a liberal could ask for -- but done it so quietly that almost no one , including most liberals , has noticed .
Obama ’s three Republican predecessors were all committed to weakening or even destroying the country ’s regulatory apparatus : the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) , the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , and the other agencies that are supposed to protect workers and consumers by regulating business practices .
Now Obama is seeking to rebuild these battered institutions .
In doing so , he is n’t simply improving the effectiveness of various government offices or making scattered progress on a few issues ; he is resuscitating an entire philosophy of government with roots in the Progressive era of the early twentieth century .
Taken as a whole , Obama ’s revival of these agencies is arguably the most significant accomplishment of his first year in office .
The regulatory agencies , most of which date from one of the three great reform periods ( 1901 –1914 , 1932 –1938 , and 1961 – 1972 ) of the last century , were intended to smooth out the rough edges ( the “ externalities , ” in economic jargon ) of modern capitalism -- from dirty air to dangerous workplaces to defective merchandise to financial corruption .
With wide latitude in writing and enforcing regulations , they have been described as a “ fourth branch of government . ”
That wide latitude could invite abuses of power , but the old - time progressives who fashioned the regulatory state rested their hopes on what could be called “ scientific administration . ”
Louis Brandeis and Herbert Croly -- to name two of the foremost turn - of - the - century progressives -- believed that the agencies , staffed by experts schooled in social and natural science and employing the scientific method in their decision - making , could rise above partisanship and interest - group pressure .
Brandeis ’s famous concept of states as “ laboratories of democracy ” comes out of his defense of state regulation of industry and was meant to conjure an image of states basing their regulatory activities on the scientific method .
For his part , Croly often made the progressive case for disinterested expertise .
The success of the regulatory agencies , he wrote , depended upon “ a sufficient popular confidence in the ability of enlightened and trained individuals … and the actual existence for their use of a body of sufficiently authentic social knowledge . ”
Many of the last century ’s presidents -- from Theodore Roosevelt to Jimmy Carter to Bill Clinton -- subscribed to this progressive ideal of regulation based on expertise .
But , beginning in the 1980s and culminating in the presidency of George W. Bush , the notion of scientific administration came under attack from Republicans and their allies .
They began to subvert the agencies by bringing in business executives , corporate lawyers , and lobbyists -- the very opposite of the impartial experts envisioned by Brandeis and Croly .
Cambridge , Mass .
– September 10 , 2009 – A team of environmental scientists from Harvard and Tsinghua University demonstrated the enormous potential for wind - generated electricity in China .
Using extensive metrological data and incorporating the Chinese government 's energy bidding and financial restrictions for delivering wind power , the researchers estimate that wind alone has the potential to meet the country 's electricity demands projected for 2030 .
The switch from coal and other fossil fuels to greener wind - based energy could also mitigate CO2 emissions , thereby reducing pollution .
The report appeared as a cover story in the September 11th issue of Science .
" The world is struggling with the question of how do you make the switch from carbon - rich fuels to something carbon - free , " said lead author Michael B. McElroy , Gilbert Butler Professor of Environmental Studies at Harvard 's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ( SEAS ) .
China has become second only to the U.S. in its national power generating capacity — 792.5 gigawatts per year with an expected future 10 percent annual increase — and is now the world 's largest CO2 emitter .
Thus , added McElroy , " the real question for the globe is : What alternatives does China have ? "
While wind - generated energy accounts for only 0.4 percent of China 's total current electricity supply , the country is rapidly becoming the world 's fastest growing market for wind power , trailing only the U.S. , Germany , and Spain in terms of installed capacities of existing wind farms .
Development of renewable energy in China , especially wind , received an important boost with passage of the Renewable Energy Law in 2005 ; the law provides favorable tax status for alternative energy investments .
The Chinese government also established a concession bidding process to guarantee a reasonable return for large wind projects .
" To determine the viability of wind - based energy for China we established a location - based economic model , incorporating the bidding process , and calculated the energy cost based on geography , " said co-author Xi Lu , a graduate student in McElroy 's group at SEAS .
" Using the same model we also evaluated the total potentials for wind energy that could be realized at a certain cost level . "
Specifically , the researchers used meteorological data from the Goddard Earth Observing Data Assimilation System ( GEOS ) at NASA .
Further , they assumed the wind energy would be produced from a set of land - based 1.5 - megawatt turbines operating over non-forested , ice - free , rural areas with a slope no more than 20 percent .
" By bringing the capabilities of atmospheric science to the study of energy we were able to view the wind resource in a total context , " explained co-author Chris P. Nielsen , Executive Director of the Harvard China Project , based at SEAS .
The analysis indicated that a network of wind turbines operating at as little as 20 percent of their rated capacity could provide potentially as much as 24.7 petawatt - hours of electricity annually , or more than seven times China 's current consumption .
The researchers also determined that wind energy alone , at around 7.6 U.S. Cents per kilowatt - hour , could accommodate the country 's entire demand for electricity projected for 2030 .
" Wind farms would only need to take up land areas of 0.5 million square kilometers , or regions about three quarters of the size of Texas .
The physical footprints of wind turbines would be even smaller , allowing the areas to remain agricultural , " said Lu .
By contrast , to meet the increased demand for electricity during the next 20 years using fossil fuel - based energy sources , China would have to construct coal - fired power plants that could produce the equivalent of 800 gigawatts of electricity , resulting in a potential increase of 3.5 gigatons of CO2 per year .
The use of cleaner wind energy could both meet future demands and , even if only used to supplement existing energy sources , significantly reduce carbon emissions .
Moving to a low - carbon energy future would require China to make an investment of around $ 900 billion dollars ( at current prices ) over the same twenty - year period .
The scientists consider this a large but not unreasonable investment given the present size of the Chinese economy .
Moreover , whatever the energy source , the country will need to build and support an expanded energy grid to accommodate the anticipated growth in power demand .
" We are trying to cut into the current defined demand for new electricity generation in China , which is roughly a gigawatt a week — or an enormous 50 gigawatts per year , " said McElroy .
" China is bringing on several coal fire power plants a week .
By publicizing the opportunity for a different way to go we will hope to have a positive influence . "
In the coming months , the researchers plan to conduct a more intensive wind study in China , taking advantage of 25 - year data with significantly higher spatial resolution for north Asian regions to investigate the geographical year - to - year variations of wind .
The model used for assessing China could also be applied for assessing wind potential anywhere in the world , onshore and offshore , and could be extended to solar generated electricity .

Life 's smallest motor -- a protein that shuttles cargo within cells and helps cells divide -- does so by rocking up and down like a seesaw , according to research conducted by scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Brandeis University .
The researchers created high - resolution snapshots of a protein motor , called kinesin , as it walked along a microtubule , which are tube - shaped structures that form a cell 's " skeleton . "
The result is the closest look yet at the structural changes kinesin proteins undergo as they ferry molecules within cells .
" We see for the first time how kinesin 's atomic - scale moving parts allow it to pull itself and its cargo along a microtubule , " says Ken Downing , a biophysicist with Berkeley Lab's Life Sciences Division .
He conducted the research with postdoctoral fellow Charles Sindelar , now at Brandeis University .
" We found that there is a pivot point , where the kinesin motor attaches to the microtubule , which acts like a fulcrum and causes kinesin to rock up and down like a seesaw as it moves along the microtubule , " adds Downing .
Their research is reported in the online early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The first - ever glimpse of kinesin 's seesaw motion offers key insights into one of life 's most fundamental processes .
Fueled by an energy - giving compound called ATP , kinesin proteins motor along microtubules like trains on a railroad track , towing cargo to various locations within cells and assisting in cell division .
Microtubules are a cylindrical weave of proteins found throughout cells that serve as cellular scaffolding .

Until now , scientists did not have a clear picture of what happens when ATP binds with kinesin , and especially how this process triggers structural changes in kinesin that propel the protein along microtubules .
Extremely high - resolution crystallography images of kinesin motors have enabled researchers to piece together the protein's three - dimensional structure .
But these images do n't reveal how it works .
" The problem is that it is not until the protein motor binds to a microtubule that structural rearrangements occur that enable ATP hydrolysis , the process that transfers energy from ATP to kinesin , " says Downing .
To image kinesin at this critical stage , Downing and Sindelar turned to cryoelectron microscopy , which is a type of electron microscopy in which the sample is studied at extremely low temperatures .
The technology is used by structural biologists to image proteins and other molecules as they appear in real - world conditions , in this case a kinesin protein attached to a microtubule .
The technique yielded 8 to 9 angstrom - resolution snapshots of the kinesin motor at four stages of the motor 's cycle as it moves along a microtubule .
One angstrom is one - ten billionth of a meter .
Using these images as a guide , the researchers then " dropped in " even higher resolution crystallographic images of kinesin 's components .
This step enabled them to derive atomic - level structural models of kinesin in action .
" Collectively , this work provides a detailed molecular explanation for kinesin's microtubule - attached power stroke , " says Downing .
" In other words , we can see it how it works in real life .
We looked at kinesin in different phases , and learned what causes it to move from one conformation to another , which is how it pulls cargo along the microtubule . "
In addition to further elucidating a key biological process , Downing and Sindelar 's research may inform the development of disease - fighting drugs .
One of kinesin's main jobs is moving chromosomes apart during cell division .
Anything that blocks this process will lead to cell death , which is the basis of several cancer therapies such as taxol .
" New insights into how kinesin works could allow scientists to develop drugs that target and block particular kinesin movements , " says Downing .
Queensland 's Transport Minister Rachel Nolan has again been called on to defend paperless public transport ticketing go cards after a security breach , with funds transferred without the owner 's consent .
A commuter says the entire balance of his Go Card was transferred to another account without his permission .
Nick Smith , 27 , who is a Nine Network cameraman , told Ms Nolan yesterday that that his Go Card had never left his wallet yet someone accessed his account .
After he discovered the problem on Friday , he called TransLink and was advised his funds had been transferred over the phone the night before , he told the minister .
" I had to give my name , address and my password when I was talking to TransLink over the phone , " Mr Smith told AAP .
Galaxy morphology , or the study of the shapes and formation of galaxies , is a critical and much - debated topic in astronomy .
An important tool for this is the Hubble sequence or Hubble tuning - fork diagram [ 1 ] , a classification scheme invented in 1926 by the same Edwin Hubble in whose honour the space telescope is named .
A team of European astronomers led by François Hammer of the Observatoire de Paris has , for the first time , completed a demographic census of galaxy types at two different points in the Universe 's history -- in effect , creating two Hubble sequences -- that help explain how galaxies form .
In this survey , researchers sampled 116 local galaxies and 148 distant galaxies .
Contrary to previous thought , the astronomers showed that the Hubble sequence six billion years ago was very different from the one that astronomers see today .
" Six billion years ago , there were many more peculiar galaxies than now -- a very surprising result , " says Rodney Delgado - Serrano , lead author of the related paper recently published in and highlighted on the cover of Astronomy & Astrophysics .
" This means that in the last six billion years , these peculiar galaxies must have become normal spirals , giving us a more dramatic picture of the recent Universe than we had before . "
The astronomers think that these peculiar galaxies did indeed become spirals through collisions and merging .
Tracing the history of galaxy formation leads us to the way our Universe presently looks .
Like any review of a life , there are chaotic , tumultuous times and more dormant periods and , like many teenagers , developing galaxies often collide with those in their way .
Crashes between galaxies give rise to enormous new galaxies and , although it was commonly believed that galaxy mergers decreased significantly eight billion years ago , the new result implies that mergers were still occurring frequently after that time -- up to as recently as four billion years ago .
" Our aim was to find a scenario that would connect the current picture of the Universe with the morphologies of distant , older galaxies -- to find the right fit for this puzzling view of galaxy evolution , " says Hammer .
Also contrary to the widely held opinion that galaxy mergers result in the formation of elliptical galaxies , Hammer and his team support a scenario in which these cosmic clashes result in spiral galaxies .
In a parallel paper published in Astronomy & Astrophysics , Hammer and his team delve further into their " spiral rebuilding " hypothesis , which proposes that peculiar galaxies affected by gas - rich mergers are slowly reborn as giant spirals with discs and central bulges .
Although our own Milky Way galaxy is a spiral galaxy , it seems to have been spared much of the teenage drama ; its formation history has been rather quiet and it has avoided violent collisions in astronomically recent times .
However , the large Andromeda galaxy from our neighbourhood has not been so lucky and fits well into the " spiral rebuilding " scenario .
Researchers continue to seek out explanations for this .
Hammer and his team used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey [ 2 ] undertaken by Apache Point Observatory , New Mexico , USA and from the GOODS field and Hubble Ultra Deep Field taken by the Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) aboard Hubble .
Notes :
[ 1 ] Hubble 's scheme divides regular galaxies into three broad classes -- ellipticals , lenticulars and spirals -- based on their visual appearance ( originally on photographic plates ) .
A fourth class contains galaxies with an irregular appearance .
[ 2 ]
Over eight years of operations , the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) obtained deep , multicolour images covering more than a quarter of the sky and created three - dimensional maps containing more than 930 000 galaxies and more than 120 000 quasars .
The SDSS used a dedicated 2.5 - metre telescope at Apache Point Observatory , New Mexico , equipped with two powerful special purpose instruments .
The 120 - megapixel camera imaged 1.5 square degrees of sky at a time , about eight times the area of the full Moon .
A pair of spectrographs fed by optical fibres measured spectra of ( and hence distances to ) more than 600 galaxies and quasars in a single observation .
*** UPDATE INFORMATION AFTER SECOND ATTEMPT ***
Thanks to the thousands , perhaps millions , worldwide who participated in the two attempts .
I have been touched by the way the idea has resonated with people of many countries , cultures , and faiths .
In this crazy and too - often ugly world to have something which brings people together to share an artistic dream is a rare gift , and I thank all of you for making it possible .
It has been a phenomenal artistic success , even though we did not accomplish the technical aspect of the project .
Indeed , as many people said , that was almost beside the point of the deeper goals of the project .
If you participated in either of the attempts , and have not yet sent me a report , please do so .
Or if you have further thoughts on the project that you would like to share , I 'd like to have them .
I plan on documenting the project with your comments .
Quite a number of people have written asking me to schedule other attempts , or make this an annual or even monthly event .
At this point I am not planning any such further attempts , and need to turn my attention to other projects .
But if someone else wants to take this on , please contact me in the next week or so .

******************************************************************
The Idea : Inexpensive , yet surprisingly powerful laser pointing devices have become ubiquitous in America .
Millions of people own such a device .
Laser light stays coherent over vast distances , the beams spreading very little .
In theory , even a single laser pointer could reach the Moon .
The original idea behind Paint the Moon was to organize millions of people in North America to shine their laser pointers on one area of the Moon at one time , in an artistic experiment to see if we can create a temporary visible field of color on our nearest celestial neighbor .
Will it work ?
Well , the first attempt did n't , though some people reported seeing a red haze or halo effect .
If we get more people , more lasers , can it work ?
I honestly do n't know .
I 'm a writer and an artist , not a scientist .
Most of the scientific opinion is that the small laser pointers themselves just do n't have sufficient power or suitable optical characteristics .
I have no reason to doubt those opinions .
Then why do it ?
We very well may not succeed , at least on the technical aspect of the project .
But let your imagination run for a moment , and consider how truly awesome a sight it would be if it did work , and the feeling you 'd have in knowing that you helped to make it possible .
This is not unlike going to see a play : you know you 're not actually watching ' real ' events take place , yet the shared experience is valid , perhaps inspirational , educational , or at least entertaining .
Even most of the scientists who write to tell me that the physics are not on our side say they plan on participating anyway , just because the idea is too cool not to .
And who knows .
I 've heard from a number of people who think that the project could work if more powerful lasers are used in conjunction with the smaller ones .
And not ' Star Wars ' types of lasers , but the ones commonly available to researchers , educators , even laser - light shows .
So maybe it is possible .
And I 'm not the first crazy to want to shoot lasers at the moon .
NASA has been doing it for over 30 years , as part of a range - finding effort .
There 's a link on my ' links ' page if you want to check it out .
Why do it ?
So - called ' environmental artists ' such as Christo have explored large scale , temporary works that involve altering or enhancing the landscape with fabric and other materials .
The technical dream of this project is along the same lines : to create a temporary dance of red laser light on the dark portion of the Moon which would be visible from Earth .
But just as important as this technical goal is the cooperative effort involved .
For it to have even the slightest chance of working , millions of people will have to take a few minutes out of an autumn night to join together and do one thing .
Millions more will be able to participate by watching the show .
Particularly with recent world events , this collective moment can have a special meaning : for five minutes , we can all be focused on sharing this conceptual work of art .
We can all touch the Moon , if only with our laser pointers and our hearts .
The Details : The date for the nextPaint the Moon attempt is November 24th , 2001 .
In North America , the time is 11:00 P.M. EST ( 10:00 P.M. CST , 9:00 P.M. MST , 8:00 P.M. PST ) .
If you 're outside this area , check this link for the global attempt times .
To be sure you 're on the same time as everyone else , check your clock here .
Everyone who has a laser pointer and a clear view of the first - quarter Moon should turn on their pointers and aim them at the Moon , just behind ( to the left , or East ) of the terminator ( the line where the sunlight stops ) .
The illustration at the top of this page shows approximately where you should aim .
Continue to shine your pointer at this spot for five minutes .
That 's it .
This date and time was selected for a couple of reasons : the Moon will be just beyond the first quarter , giving us a dark portion to attempt to illuminate ; it will be visible for a long enough period of time that everyone on the continent can participate , and to thereby maximize our chance of being able to see any success at painting a red spot of light on it ; it 's a weekend , so people ( particularly schoolchildren ) can stay up a little late on the East Coast to attempt this .
A note about safety : Please , people , let 's use some common sense with those pointers .
They 're pretty safe , but you can still ruin someone 's night by shining it at their eyes .
And certainly , if you have aircraft flying in your area , do nothing to endanger the lives of the crew and passangers .
Under no circumstance should you shine your pointer at planes .
Laser pointers can distract a pilot , and contribute to a disaster .
If you 're someplace where there are low - flying aircraft , try and be someplace else for the Paint the Moon event .
So . . .
Make sure the batteries for your laser pointer are fresh , tell your friends about this website , and hope for clear weather .
Let 's see if we can Paint the Moon !

On the East Coast , people drink water , coffee , or Diet Coke .
Out here on the West Coast , it ’s amazing to see how people customize their beverages .
Lattes aside , in the last week alone I ’ve seen at work :
Homemade iced coffee in a mason jar , brewed extra strong to combat the dilutive effect of the ice cubes .
Homemade sarsaparilla : a mixture of Pepsi and root beer
Green tea made with whole leaves , purchased from a specialty store online ( although I ’m told Starbucks now sells whole leaf green tea as well )
I think I will need to become more adventurous and customize my own beverage .
But honestly , I ’m not too picky .

How to Get Over a Breakup ( 2018 ) แค่โสดคงไม่ตาย ( ซับไทย )
AUSTRALIA 's population is set to explode , reaching at least 36 million by 2050 , and probably a lot more .
As it stands , our population is already growing at a faster percentage rate than any developed nation , and faster than countries like China , India and Indonesia .
Last year we added almost the equivalent of the state of Tasmania - 480,000 people - in a single year .
Think about all the roads , schools , parks , hospitals and homes in Tassie .
That 's about what we have to build just to maintain our standard of living and we need to do it every 12 months !
If we maintain anything like this rate of growth in the years to come , I believe it will be a disaster .
The way of life we love in Australia will be forever changed as we are crowded into packed and dirty cities .
State governments are already struggling to keep up with the current growth , let alone dealing with many millions more .
Just look at the 30 - year fiasco that is Sydney 's mythical second airport .
Brisbane can't decide what to do about dams , Melbourne can't implement a co-ordinated public transport system and we are building hugely expensive desalination plants just to have enough drinking water .
Does anyone really believe we are suddenly going to discover the secret of adding a city bigger than Canberra every year for the next 40 years ?
As Labor backbencher Kelvin Thomson has previously warned , we are sleep - walking towards disaster .
And speaking of Canberra , do n't look there for leadership on this issue .
Last October the Prime Minister declared he was " unapologetically in favour of a Big Australia " .
But by last month , sensing that many Australians were uneasy with uncontrolled population growth , he had changed his tune .
When asked about the forecast of a 60 per cent jump to 35 million , he said , " I do n't have a view on that , it 's simply the reality " .
It was as if the Government has no plan and no influence on the outcome .
Yet Rudd controls the main lever on population growth : immigration .
Our current immigration intake is at record levels , a trend begun under the Howard government .
Yet we have never been asked if we think it 's a wise idea .
Just what exactly are the benefits of a Big Australia ?
Treasurer Wayne Swan argues we must keep feeding more taxpayers into the system to prepare for when Baby Boomers start retiring .
Yet his own study , the Intergenerational Report , shows the number of seniors in the population will be less than previously predicted .
In fact Australia has one of the youngest population profiles of any advanced nation and Mr Swan 's strategy ignores the reality that immigrants become old too one day .
It 's like a giant Ponzi scheme , a short - term fix that will do nothing to provide for Australia 's long - term security .
But it would be unfair to just pick on the Government .
In recent weeks the Opposition has been just as confused , both welcoming Australia 's record level of immigration and threatening to slash it .
The result is that we do not have a population policy - no direction and no idea how many people our arid and fragile environment can sustain .
Are our politicians too frightened to offend the powerful business , religious and financial interests that support unrestrained growth ?
This is n't about being a selfish nation that closes its eyes to a world heading towards nine billion people .
Developing nations need the food we export , but soon Australia will likely become a net importer of food , literally taking food out of the mouths of the poor .
Already our immigration system encourages the plundering of the best doctors , nurses and engineers from the nations that can least afford to lose them .
Once we were part of the Colombo Plan , training the brightest from elsewhere then sending them home to build their own nations .
Now we are so desperate that we offer citizenship just to fill our own ever - expanding needs .
I 've been criticised for calling for a reduction in our immigration levels , an increase in our humanitarian efforts and an end to schemes like the baby bonus .
I have even been accused of being racist and anti-family for even raising the population question .
I will let others judge me over many years of public life , but it is certain that if we continue to treat population as a taboo subject , then it will surely open the door to extremists to fill the void .
Population is the elephant in the room that we have ignored for too long .
None of the issues we face - climate change , housing , energy , healthcare , our environment - gets easier if population grows out of control .
I have never felt more strongly about an issue and I want future generations to enjoy this way of life .

The nut :
On Jan. 15 , in the state capital of Montpelier , nine candidates for statewide office gathered in a tiny room at the Capitol Plaza Hotel , to announce they wanted a divorce from the United States of America .
“ For the first time in over 150 years , secession and political independence from the U.S. will be front and center in a statewide New England political campaign , ” said Thomas Naylor , 73 , one of the leaders of the campaign .
A former Duke University economics professor , Naylor heads up the Second Vermont Republic , which he describes as “ left - libertarian , anti-big government , anti-empire , antiwar , with small is beautiful as our guiding philosophy . ”
The group not only advocates the peaceful secession of Vermont but has minted its own silver “ token ” — valued at $ 25 — and , as part of a publishing venture with another secessionist group , runs a monthly newspaper called Vermont Commons , with a circulation of 10,000 .
According to a 2007 poll , they have support from at least 13 % of state voters .
Recent work in Newcastle , UK and at the University of Ulm , Germany has been toted as discovering the “ secrets to aging ” but is really just another small step in understanding why our bodies wear down .
The research was published in the journal Molecular Systems Biology , picked up by the Telegraph and then redistributed by the usual lot of copy and paste news feeds .
Using human cells , mouse cells and computer simulations , the British - German team explored the mechanism that produces cell senescence – the state in which a cell stops dividing and eventually dies .
They found a certain protein pathway was responsible for cells with damaged DNA becoming senescent .
That ’s a cool bit of science , but it ’s not the “ secret to aging ” and its lightyears from a cure for aging .
Unfortunately , journalists can’t sell “ scientists take another steady step in large complex problem that may not be solved for decades ” , so we ’re left with an over - hyped , misunderstood development .
Which is a shame , because the Newcastle - Ulm group actually made some interesting discoveries .
Just look at some of these hyped up headlines from the past 24 hours :
It ’s not that these outlets get the facts completely wrong .
They ’ll certainly tell you that British ( and German ) scientists have found a way to prevent cells senescence in certain cases .
What ’s that mean for you though ?
At this point … not much .
This is where the Telegraph and other news feeds venture into pure hype .
Knowing a single factor in how cells stop replicating wo n’t prevent aging .
Aging is more complex than that .
And this research , while interesting , was not aimed at extending the life of an organism .
No mice lived into advanced age , no humans got suddenly younger looking , there ’s nothing here that would qualify for a MPrize .
We ’ve seen steady progress in how we understand the mechanisms that cause cells to stop replicating themselves .
The most recent Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded for a suite of research cases that helped define the importance of the tips of chromosomes called telomeres .
These “ shoe - lace ” tips to our DNA help the strands of code replicate .
Some believe that the shortening of telomeres over time could be a cause for cell senescence and human aging .
The recent work in Newcastle , however , underplays the importance of telomeres in favor of free radicals .
Properly known as reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , these chemicals are released by mitochondria in cells after DNA is damaged .
The British - German team explored how DNA damage response ( DDR ) and ROS levels created a positive feedback loop .
By irradiating cells , they could induce DDR that lead to cell senescence .
Scientists found , however , that this path to cell death could be prevented by manipulating proteins important in the DDR - ROS loop .
That ’s a pretty important discovery .
Finding those protein pathways and manipulating them is sort of like finding the phone line you can call to prevent an execution .
Yet there are limits to using the DDR - ROS loop to prevent senescence .
After irradiating the cells , scientists could wait a few days before blocking protein pathways and still keep these cells from fully shutting down .
After 9 days , however , the path to senescence seems pretty inescapable .
So , once DNA is damaged , there ’s only so long you have to act before cells will permanently shut down .
We need to focus on what the research actually provides .
Exploring the DDR - ROS loop does give us some new insight into how cell senescence could be stopped in some cases .
Yet senescence is n’t a horrible thing .
It helps prevent cancer by keeping damaged cells from replicating with mutated DNA .
So really , the research explored a process that we may wish to one day selectively apply to some of our cells .
It ’s many years from becoming another close to a treatment , but it does highlight where in our cell chemistry a treatment may be be applied .
In short , it ’s a cool development in science , and something really interesting to read about .
As long as you do n’t expect it to turn you grandmother into a tween overnight .

A New York Hasidic woman passed away last month leaving behind 15 children , over 200 grandchildren and enough great - grandchildren to bring her total number of living family members to around 2,000 .
Yitta Schwartz — who lived to the old age of 93 outlasting her husband by 34 years — was productive even among her community of Satmar Hasidic Jews for whom having kids is a tribute to God .
So much so that she spent much of her time attending various events — brises , first haircuts , bar mitzvahs , etc. , reports the Times .
“ She would appear like the Prophet Elijah , ” said her eldest living daughter who is 64 .
“ Everybody was fighting over her ! ”
Schwartz lived in Kiryas Joel , near Monroe , N.Y. but would often hitch a ride to Williamsburg to see family .
She actually gave birth to 18 children in her life , but lost two in the Holocaust and one in a summer camp accident here in the States .
Among Holocaust survivors , Schwartz may have been among those to produce the most offspring .
Take that , Hitler !
" In the darkness of the sea , many species of fish and marine mammals have evolved to rely on sound for navigating , finding food , locating mates , avoiding predators , and communicating .
As we continue to develop and industrialize our coasts , we are substantially altering the acoustic environment vital to ocean life . "

The push to open Florida 's coasts to offshore oil drilling brings to light many more issues than just the damage to Florida 's white sand beaches and tourism industry .
One of the most disturbing of these issues is the destructive scale of ocean floor mapping that is necessary before drillers " break ground " on new projects .
The science behind ocean floor mapping is frightening .
To map the ocean floor , the oil and gas industry typically relies on airguns , which fire sonic blasts of up to 260 decibels ( db ) .
These airguns are towed behind boats in long arrays , firing shots of compressed air into the water approximately every ten seconds .
The intense pulses that they produce travel down through the water column , penetrate the seafloor , and rebound to the surface where they can be analyzed .
These blasts have been called the most intrusive form of man-made undersea noise short of naval warfare , and with good reason .
A 260 db sound is very intense .
As a comparison , damage to human hearing starts at 85 db .
A police siren from thirty meters is about 100 db .
Decibels are logarithmic , meaning every 10 db increase translates into roughly ten times more intensity , and sounds approximately twice as loud to the human ear , which also perceives sound logarithmically .
That means the 260 db airgun blast translates tothan a police siren at thirty meters , and would sound to humans about 16,384 times as loud .
A loud indoor rock concert weighs in at around 120 db : whales and other creatures in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico would be subjected to sounds 100 trillion times more intense than that .
Death from sound occurs because sound is a pressure wave .
This is why you can feel your body vibrate during loud , low sounds ( such as those felt during a concert ) .
Intense waves can rip ear , lung , and other vibrating tissues .
They also cause internal bleeding .
Two hundred and sixty decibels is 10,000 times more intense than the sound of a nuclear explosion at a range of five hundred meters .
Yet , this is what marine life off the coast of Florida will be subjected to in the name of offshore drilling .
It has been well established that the high - intensity pulses produced by airguns can cause a range of impacts on marine mammals , fish , and other marine life , including habitat displacement , disruption of vital behaviors essential to foraging and breeding , loss of biological diversity , beach strandings and mortalities .
That 's right : whales , dolphins and other marine animals that rely on the ocean for life would rather throw themselves on the beaches than be subjected to this literally deadly noise .
Airgun surveys also have dire consequences for the health of fisheries .
Airguns have been known to dramatically reduce catch rates of commercial species over thousands of square kilometers , leading fishermen in some parts of the world to seek industry compensation for their losses .
In fact , this is occurring in Norway at the present time .
The Minerals Management Service has made no attempt to account for the impacts of airgun surveys on foraging rates and other essential behaviors in any marine species ( including endangered ones ) .
And , unfortunately , the mitigation measures prescribed by the MMS are completely inadequate to redress the environmental harms that the science has identified .
Help us in our call to stop offshore drilling and oil exploration from becoming a reality off Florida 's coasts .

OTTAWA — New Democratic Party Leader Jack Layton says he will fight the cancer that his late father Robert battled 17 years ago
With his politician wife Olivia Chow at his side , the 59 - year - old Layton told reporters Friday he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer , the same kind of cancer the late Robert Layton successfully defeated .
“ Like my dad , I am a fighter and I am going to beat this , ” said Layton , who emphasized he will be staying on as leader , which he has held for seven years .
The senior Layton , who was Progressive Conservative cabinet minister in Brian Mulroney ’s government , eventually died in May 2002 at age 76 from complications from Parkinson ’s disease , not complications of prostate cancer as originally reported in his obituary at the time .
Layton told the news conference he had joined the 25,000 Canadian men who are diagnosed annually with “ treatable prostate cancer . ”
The news was far more serious than the back injury he has been nursing for a few weeks .
Chow , also a NDP MP , waged a successful battle against thyroid cancer and has been cancer - free since 2005 .
Layton explained that his treatment has already started and “ I am feeling good . ”
The NDP leader joked that the schedule of treatments may mean he will be watching more of the Vancouver Winter Games that he had expected to .
“ I can be inspired by our athletes as they exercise their determination , ” he said .
Layton was diagnosed with prostate cancer late in 2009 , said his press secretary Karl Belanger .
“ He will be treated here in Toronto , ” said Belanger , standing inside a packed Estonian Hall on Broadview Avenue in east end Toronto .
Belanger would not say how long and what type of treatment that will be .
“ That remains to be seen , ” he said .
The cancer was caught during a routine checkup .
“ He ( Layton ) will be in Ottawa on Monday for a news conference , ” he said .
Layton informed his party and spoke to other federal party leaders earlier Friday , Belanger added .
Layton has brought a higher profile and increased public funding to the party since he took over as leader in 2003 .
In a string of elections under his leadership the party has boosted its seat count in the House of Commons — to 37 , up from 14 — and its share of votes .
“ There is a lot more to do , ” Layton told reporters Friday .
“ There is still work ahead of us to build that caring and green Canada that we believe in and know is possible and I can’t wait to roll up my sleeves Monday morning and get started . ”

The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights has called off its Feb. 3 demand for a congressional probe of the U.S. Air Force Academy in response to a perceived insult to Christians .
League spokeswoman Susan Fani said the academy ’s Catholic chaplain , the Rev. Robert Bruno , has convinced league officials that positive steps have been taken to ensure the religious liberty of all cadets .
“ There is no need for a probe , ” Fani said in a news release Tuesday .
Previously , league president Bill Donohue had objected to the academy superintendent ’s negative characterization of a large wooden cross left in mid-January at the school ’s new outdoor worship site for pagans and practitioners of other earth - based religions .
Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael Gould had called the placement of a Christian symbol at an area dedicated for non-Christian worship as “ destructive behavior ” that would not be tolerated .
Donohue then issued a statement complaining that Gould ’s comparison of the cross incident to other acts of vandalism was “ overkill ” and “ grossly insulting to Catholics and Protestants . ”
Gould said he has been working to establish a campus climate of religious respect for diverse faith traditions after a 2004 survey found that many cadets believed evangelical Christians were harassing non-Christians at the academy .
An Air Force task force reported in 2005 that it found no overt discrimination against cadets , yet the academy had failed to accommodate some cadets ’ religious needs .
Bruno , the first Catholic chaplain to work at the academy since 1991 , persuaded the league that Gould had played a key role in fostering religious freedom for all , Fani said .

“ Nobody could comprehend why we ’d start a theater , ” said an investor , Nathan Faustyn , 25 .

Despite the recession  and in some cases because of it  small businesses are budding around Detroit in one of the more surprising twists of the downturn .
Some new businesses like the Burton are scratching by .
Others have already grown beyond the initial scope of their business plans , juggling hundreds of customers and expanding into new sites .
Across from the Burton , for instance , Jennifer Willemsen just celebrated the first anniversary of her shop , Curl Up and Dye , a retro - themed hair salon serving 1,500 clients .
Not far away , Torya Blanchard , a former French teacher , recently opened the second location of Good Girls Go to Paris , a creperie .
Next door , Greg Lenhoff , also a former teacher , opened a bookstore in August called Leopold’s .
And just down the street from Leopold ’s , on Woodward Avenue , Victor Both runs Breezecab , a company he started with a severance package after a layoff from Wayne State University .
He uses rickshaws to ferry workers and conventioneers around downtown .
“ This filled a transportation void , ” said Mr. Both , 34 , who picked up the pedicab idea while touring Las Vegas before his layoff .
“ I have n’t made much money , but the experience has been priceless .
I had no idea Detroit had so much love . ”
It is not an uncommon instinct to start an enterprise in bad times and seize on weakened competition , lower overhead costs and perhaps more free time .
Nor is it limited to Detroit .
But the trend is particularly striking here , in a city that was suffering long before the rest of the nation fell into recession and where hard times , business closings and abandonment became routine generations ago .
Ohioans for Humane Farms submitted a petition -- including signatures from Ohio voters in 48 counties , demonstrating broad and regionally diverse support -- to Ohio's Attorney General in support of placing an anti-cruelty measure on the statewide November ballot .
The proposed measure would allow voters to require the Ohio Livestock Care Standards Board to adopt certain minimum standards that will prevent the cruel and inhumane treatment of farm animals , enhance food safety , protect the environment and strengthen Ohio family farms .
Utilizing a large volunteer base , the group will seek to collect more than 600,000 signatures of registered Ohio voters upon approval of the petition forms by the Secretary of State .
The ballot measure is backed by The Humane Society of the United States , Farm Sanctuary , Ohio SPCA , Toledo Area Humane Society , Geauga Humane Society , Ohio League of Humane Voters , Center for Food Safety , United Farm Workers , Consumer Federation of America , Center for Science in the Public Interest , and a growing list of organizations .
This measure will allow Ohio voters to provide guidance to the newly enacted Livestock Board and set certain minimum humane standards that will prevent cruel factory farming practices in Ohio , including :
· Extreme confinement in tiny cages for months on end :
Tens of thousands of veal calves , 170,000 breeding pigs , and approximately 27 million egg - laying hens in Ohio are confined in cages and crates so restrictive the animals can barely move an inch for virtually their whole lives .
Many do n't even have enough room to stretch their limbs or turn around .
· Allowing " downer cows " to enter the human food chain : Allowing sick and injured animals into the food supply threatens public health and food safety .
Cows too sick or injured to stand or walk on their own to slaughter should be humanely euthanized , not inhumanely dragged or pushed while being shocked and beaten onto the kill floor to be used for human consumption .
· Inhumane methods of euthanasia for sick and injured animals :
In Ohio , a factory farmer was videotaped killing sick pigs by hanging them execution - style from a tractor , leaving them to writhe in the air for minutes on end .
He was acquitted of cruelty for the hangings , a verdict Ohio 's agribusiness community hailed as a " huge victory , " because Ohio has no law specifically requiring humane farm animal euthanasia methods .
The Board would have six years to implement these minimum standards , allowing producers ample time to transition to more humane systems .
If the measure is enacted , Ohioans for Humane Farms hopes that the Livestock Board would immediately adopt minimum standards that address euthanasia and downer animals .
" We would n't cram our pets into cages barely larger than their bodies for their entire lives , and we should n't subject farm animals to this inhumane and unacceptable confinement either , " stated Wayne Pacelle , president and CEO of The HSUS .
" All animals deserve humane treatment , including animals raised for food . "
" Mahatma Gandhi said you can judge a nation by the way it treats its animals .
As a veterinarian , I am duty - bound to protect the human - animal bond , and by supporting this measure , we as a state and nation will be improving the lives of animals , " states Cleveland veterinarian Brian Forsgren , DVM .
" Ohioans oppose cruelty and believe that all animals , including farm animals , deserve to be protected , " said Gene Baur , president of Farm Sanctuary .
" In November , Ohioans will have the opportunity to make their voices heard and phase out some of the worst factory farm abuses . "
Michigan recently became the latest state to adopt reforms , providing farm animals with more space to turn around and extend their limbs , passing a measure in its state legislature in 2009 very similar in form to the Ohio proposal .
Similar laws also have been enacted in Arizona , California , Colorado , Florida , Maine and Oregon .
The HSUS has more than 400,000 Ohio supporters .
Farm Sanctuary is the nation 's leading farm animal protection organization .
Facts
In March 2009 , HBO documentary Death on a Factory Farm revealed appalling mistreatment of pigs on an Ohio factory farm , including immobilization inside tiny crates and the killing of pigs by hanging them execution - style .
Across Ohio , crated calves are tethered by the neck and can barely move , pigs in severe confinement bite the metal bars of their crates , and hens can get trapped and even impaled in their wire cages .
There is overwhelming science demonstrating that such extreme confinement is detrimental to the animals ' welfare .
Caging animals in high densities leads to higher concentrations of animal waste and air and water pollution , as well as a greater risk of disease transmission such as Salmonella .

Seroquel brings in almost 10 % of AstraZeneca 's revenues
The marketing team sued over a drug 's alleged side effects tried to suppress key data , an ex-employee has claimed .
Seroquel 's former UK medical adviser told the BBC he was pressured to approve promotional material which said weight gain was not an issue .
Maker AstraZeneca , which faces fresh legal action next month , said it took concerns about its conduct seriously .
In the same programme , the British Medical Journal editor urged that the medicine licensing system be reviewed .
Dr Fiona Godlee said industry should no longer provide the evaluations of its own drugs which the licensing body considered .
' Job threat '
Thousands of patients are suing AstraZeneca in US courts , claiming the anti-psychotic drug Seroquel caused weight gain and diabetes .
The patients allege Seroquel , its second biggest selling drug worth $ 4.5 bn ( £ 2.7bn ) a year , was marketed without adequate warning about possible side effects such as massive weight gain and the development of diabetes .
However , this is denied by the company .
AstraZeneca , which is facing renewed legal action next month , said the company took concerns about its conduct seriously .

More from File on 4 Seroquel was launched in 1997 for treating schizophrenia and later for bipolar disorder .
Dr John Blenkinsopp , the company 's former UK medical manager , claimed he was pressurised by the company 's marketing arm to approve claims about the drug which he felt did not reflect the medical evidence .
" The clinical studies at the time of the launch of Seroquel showed patients developed significant weight gain , significant both statistically and clinically , " he told the BBC 's File on 4 .
" They [ the marketing team ] came at me with a number of potential claims all of which were trying to intimate that Seroquel was not associated with weight gain - the data pointed in the opposite direction , " added Dr Blenkinsopp who was speaking publicly for the first time since he left the company in 2000 .
He said : " I understood where they were coming from .
I had some robust discussions and exposed them to the data but that did n't seem to stop them because they were desperate for a differential advantage over one of the competitor products and they did n't have one .
" In the end I was put under quite a significant amount of pressure by the marketeers to sign off claims with regards to the lack of weight gain and I was unwilling to sign that off .
The marketeers made it clear it could be career limiting for me , " Dr Blenkinsopp added .
In the US the drug was marketed with claims that it would not cause weight gain .
That was not done in the UK except for one advertisement , published in the British Journal of Psychiatry in April 2004 .
Licensing reform Astra Zeneca said it would not comment specifically in reference to its former employees , but said it took seriously any concerns regarding the firm 's conduct and compliance procedures and it was currently reviewing issues raised by File on 4's investigation .
It said Seroquel was an important medicine and its safety and efficacy has been evaluated in clinical trials with thousands of patients Dr Godlee , Editor of the British Medical Journal , told File on 4 that the system of developing and licensing drugs needed a major overhaul to give an independent evaluation of the effects of medications .
She said the pharmaceutical industry had grown enormously and delivered many good and effective drugs .
But she warned that its power and influence needed to be controlled .
She has called for independent trials for all new drugs .
At present , the regulator - the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority - has to rely on research provided by the drug companies when it licences a medicine .
Dr Godlee said the regulator could sometimes be swamped by the amount of information it was given .
The MHRA says it has seen no evidence of this and maintains it carries out thorough and detailed reviews of any application .

The Indian government has moved to establish its own body to address and monitor science surrounding climate change , saying it cannot rely on the official United Nation panel .
The move is a severe blow to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) following the revelation parts of its 3000 page 2007 report on climate science was not subjected to peer review .
A primary claim of the report was the Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035 , but the claim was not repeated in any peer - reviewed studies and rebuffed by scientists .
India 's environment minister Jairam Ramesh announced that the Indian government will establish a separate National Institute of Himalayan Glaciology to monitor climate change in the region .
There is a fine line between climate science and climate evangelism , Ramesh said .
I am for climate science .
Stressing that the IPCC 's weakness was that it did n't do original research and derives assessments from published literature , he also announced an Indian IPCC would assess climate change through the region .
I respect the IPCC .
At the same time India is a large country ... we can't depend only on IPCC .
We will do our own assessment , Ramesh explained .
The first climate change assessment from this body would be brought out in November this year , he said .
The four by four assessment would look at four sectors -- agriculture , health , water and forests -- and four regions .
These would be Himalayan ecosystems , coastal areas , western ghats and the northeast .
The move also deals a blow India 's own Dr. RK Pachauri , the current chairman of the UN's IPCC .
Pachauri has come under pressure to resign for his handling of the glacier mistake .
Although he faces fierce criticism in the media , he continues to have the UN 's backing .
A man in China has convinced his new wife to undergo plastic surgery so she could resemble his dead first wife .
Zhao Gang , 32 , from Chongqing city , China , lost his first wife in a car accident three years ago and now wants his new wife to look exactly like the dead one .
Zhao said he only got married because his new bride looks a bit like her and he wanted to have a chance to make up for his mistakes .
Now , he wants his new bride to undergo plastic surgery so she would really resemble his dead wife .
Fortunately for him , his second wife agreed to his suggestion .
His unidentified wife told the newspaper , “ I feel conflicted .
I do n't want to become another 's shadow , but I also do n't want to lose the family .
Now I only hope the surgery will not make me look ugly . ”
Zhao said , “ Maybe it 's more or less unfair to her , but she has agreed and I will embrace her with all my love . ”
I do n’t deal with lawyers often , but feel right to say these lawyers are the most kind , courteous and knowledgeable about the law that I ever hoped for .
Their entire office is amazing and always kept me updated on the status of my case .
I recommend them anywhere – they seem to know what is going on in the court throughout all the boroughs - Manhattan , Brooklyn , Queens , Staten Island and the Bronx !

BioShock 2
What is it ?
The sequel to one of 2007 's most acclaimed games .
Where can I play it ?
PC , PS3 , 360 .
Why should I care ?
Despite a change in developers — 2K Marin and 2K Australia have taken over development duties from Irrational Games — BioShock 2 still has us intrigued .
Taking place 20 years after the original , the game will send players back to Rapture , only this time as a Big Daddy who attempts to overthrow the dystopic city 's new leader and her army of Big Sisters .
And as anyone who 's ever been chased by one can attest to , playing as a drill - armed Big Daddy has the potential to be very cool .
The game even has a multiplayer mode which takes place before the events of the original game , so you can experience the downfall of Rapture first hand .
World of Warcraft : Cataclysm
What is it ?
The third expansion for World of Warcraft .
Where can I play it ?
PC .
Why should I care ?
The world 's biggest MMO gets even bigger with its third expansion , Cataclysm , which will add a heap of new content into Azeroth .
This includes two new races ( Worgen and Goblins ) , an increased level cap ( 85 ) , new higher - level zones , additional race and class combinations , flying mounts , and more .
Some of the classic areas from the game will even get a makeover and a new secondary profession , archaeology , will be introduced .
It looks like it 'll be more than enough to keep the World of Warcraft train going for a long time .
Final Fantasy XIII
What is it ?
The thirteenth installment in the long - running JRPG series and the first to be released in four years .
Where can I play it ?
PS3 , 360 .
Why should I care ?
It 's been a long time coming , but Square - Enix 's latest blockbuster RPG is almost upon us .
After experimenting with real - time combat in FFXII , the thirteenth installment of the main Final Fantasy series will go back to the turn - based battles that the series is known for .
It also features other throwbacks to classic FF , including new takes on the Active Time Battle and Jobs systems .
And it looks absolutely gorgeous .
Early trailers and screenshots show off a stunningly realized world that seamlessly combines magic and technology .
We can't wait to explore it .
God of War III
What is it ?
The ( possibly ) final chapter of the God of War series and the first to appear on the current generation of consoles .
Where can I play it ?
PS3 .
Why should I care ?
The scale and scope of each new God of War game gets progressively larger , so it should come as no surprise that God of War III is the biggest yet .
The bosses are almost absurdly gigantic , and some of the battles will actually take place on the bodies of enormous Titans , while Kratos ' new attacks will raise the bar when it comes to violence inflicted on mythical creatures .
The game should also finish Kratos ' story once and for all , so we can finally see the angry Spartan get his revenge on the Gods of Olympus .
Heavy Rain
What is it ?
The latest game from Quantic Dream , developers of the excellent but flawed Indigo Prophecy .
Where can I play it ?
PS3 .
Why should I care ?
Games are often derided for their ability to tell a good story , so that 's reason enough to get excited for Heavy Rain .
The PlayStation 3 exclusive tells a gritty crime drama from the perspective of four different characters , each of whom can die at any point in the game .
And stay dead .
It may be light on action , forcing players to do the most mundane of tasks , but that does n't mean it wo n't get your heart racing .
One sequence has you searching frantically for your lost son in a crowded shopping mall , and it certainly had an effect on us .
Tree branches have inspired efficient transit networks , but a new study finds inspiration in leaves .
The curvy , connected leaf veins found in some plants are an efficient way to circumvent damaged areas and channel nutrients , report researchers led by Eleni Katifori of the Rockefeller University in New York City .
“ It ’s obvious that if you look at leaves , they have a lot of loops , ” Katifori says .
To find out how the looped networks may be beneficial for the plants , the researchers created a computer model to compare how efficiently different branching patterns could do the job of leaf veins , which move water and nutrients around .
“ The question we ’re asking is , what ’s the best network we can build ? ” Katifori says .
In the simulations , the looped network performed better than nonlooped ones in several important ways , the team reported Jan. 29 in Physical Review Letters .
Damage from hungry insects , cold weather or parasites can interrupt leaves ’ normal venation patterns .
Connected circular veins allowed the flow of water and minerals to circumvent areas where veins were destroyed , the team shows .
The looped network also allowed leaves to easily adjust the flow rate of water through veins , which can help leaves conserve water on a hot day , Katifori says .
Loop networks are n’t found just in tree leaves .
Blood vessels in the retina , structural veins in insect wings and the architecture of certain corals are all based on loops , the researchers write .
Understanding the benefits of such networks might lead to more efficient man-made network designs .

Recently by Gary North : A Regional Fed President Torpedoes Bernanke
Within the American conservative movement , opponents of the gold standard — any form of gold standard — have always dominated the leadership .
Newcomers may be unaware of this .
The average political conservative today is suspicious of the welfare state .
He opposes price inflation .
He wants “ sound money . ”
But his knowledge of money and banking is limited .
Until Ron Paul ’s 2007 — 8 run for President , the average conservative voter had heard little about the Federal Reserve System .
Discussions of the FED are usually limited to the financial media .
Debates are limited to whether the FED is wise in holding to , or changing , the federal funds rate .
Few readers of the “ Wall Street Journal ” or viewers of CNBC could tell you exactly what the federal funds rate is , why it is important , or how the Federal Reserve controls it .
Discussions of the Federal Reserve in the mainstream media are also limited to policy matters .
No one raises the fundamental issue of why and how it possesses the legal authority to set the federal funds rate , enforce banking rules , and control the money supply — sort of .
No one argues that the Federal Reserve is the most powerful private agency that is covered by a veneer of public accountability .
No one raises the issue of why the Web addresses of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks end in .org , but the Board of Governors ends in .gov .
The only exception in the mainstream media is Glenn Beck .
He does give some time to this topic .
His 2008 interview with Ron Paul did raise this issue .
Ron Paul for the first time in American history made the Federal Reserve an issue in a Presidential campaign .
He called for the re-establishment of the gold standard .
He warned that the FED would make bad policy decisions .
Then the economy unraveled in late 2008 , and the FED intervened to bail out the big New York City banks with fiat money and sweetheart deals .
Paul was the right man ( a 30 - year critic of the FED ) in the right place ( the Web ) at the right time ( a Presidential election year and a monetary crisis ) .
For Ben Bernanke , this was a perfect PR storm .
Tea Party recruits began their venture into politics with Ron Paul ’s message .
They do not understand that the American conservative movement has generally been anti-gold and pro-fiat money throughout its post - World War II history .
Here is why .
MISES VS .
FISHER
The early years of the Great Depression were a time of monetary deflation .
At least 9,000 banks went bankrupt ( bank + rupture ) in the United States , 1930 — 33 .
Whenever one did , the money supply shrank .
The fractional reserve process of credit leveraging , which had led to monetary inflation and economic boom in the 1920 ’s , reversed .
It produced monetary deflation and economic bust in the early 1930’s .
One economist who predicted this was Ludwig von Mises .
He warned in the late 1920 ’s about the coming contraction .
He was opposed by an American economist , Irving Fisher of Yale , who announced a plateau for the American stock market in September 1929 .
Fisher was rich at the time , the inventor of the Rolodex .
He lost his fortune and his sister - in - law ’s fortune over the next four years .
Fisher wrote The Purchasing Power of Money in 1911 .
Mises wrote The Theory of Money and Credit in 1912 .
He criticized Fisher ’s methodology and conclusions .
Mises argued that the gold standard had arisen as a market phenomenon because gold is the most marketable commodity .
The international gold standard of the 19th century arose because citizens perceived the advantages of gold as a means of restraining government spending .
It was a century of free trade , expanding civil rights , and relatively stable prices .
Civil governments were restricted .
In sharp contrast , Fisher in Chapter XII dismissed the gold standard as an historical accident .
He said the gold standard would be difficult to dislodge , but someday people would abandon it .
Why ?
Because gold “ is a substance of which the supply is excessive . ”
His role as a forecaster was as poor as his role as an economic analyst .
World War I ended the international gold standard by the end of 1914 .
The supply of fiat money then proved to be far more excessive than gold ’s supply had ever been , and therefore fiat money was favored by governments .
In 1933 , by then destitute , Fisher said that the United States should go off the gold standard — the last nation to adhere to it .
Roosevelt did so that year , but not because of Fisher .
By 1933 , Fisher had lost his credibility , along with his fortune .
Fisher ’s academic reputations reversed after World War II .
Academic economists became Keynesian in their views of fiscal policy : pre-deficit .
They also became Fisherites in their adoption of his anti-gold standard , pro-fiat money concept of money , which he had said was scientific .
They adopted his famous ( and analytically useless ) formula : MV=PT .
There is no case in American history of a comparable career in academic economics : rise , fall , and resurrection .
The most famous advocate of Fisher ’s monetary theory was Milton Friedman .
Through Friedman , the academic free market economics community became committed to fiat money after 1950 .
Friedman was the dominant free market spokesman after 1960 .
He held a position at the University of Chicago .
There was not a single gold standard proponent in the economics department in 1950 or later .
The only significant pro-gold standard opponents of the Fisherites were disciples of Mises , and there were no more than half a dozen of them — if that many — by 1950 who anyone in academia had heard of .
The public had heard of only two of them , at most : Henry Hazlitt , a New York Times economic journalist who had never gone to college , and F. A. Hayek , author of The Road to Serfdom ( 1944 ) , who by 1950 had ceased writing about money and banking .
He was on the faculty of the University of Chicago , but not in the economics department , which had refused to hire him .
He was funded by the William Volker Fund , the quiet dispenser of libertarian funds for two decades , 1945 — 65 .
The university did not pay his salary .
The same was true of Mises at New York University .
The conservative movement ’s leadership has been overwhelmingly pro-fiat money and silent on the Federal Reserve System .
Critics of the FED have long been segregated out of the movement by the leadership .
The Foundation for Economic Education ( founded by a non-academic publicist with Volker money in 1946 ) and the Mises Institute ( founded by a non-academic publicist in 1982 ) have at best been tolerated by Beltway conservatives .
Only in the last decade have pro-gold standard economists appeared on the scene through www.mises.org.
In the early years of National Review , Hazlitt was given a forum .
So were other pro-gold people .
Even I wrote an occasional piece , though not on the money question .
There were no attacks on the FED that I recall .
FRIEDMAN’S WAR ON GOLD AS MONEY
Friedman viewed gold as just another commodity .
He believed that individuals should have the right to make contracts in gold .
He promoted this back when it was illegal for Americans to own gold .
But he always opposed the substitution of a gold standard for a fiat money standard .
He accepted the Federal Reserve System as an institution with control over money .
He just thought it should run things more predictably , meaning with fewer policy decisions .
He became famous for his suggestion that the FED should stick to a fixed increase in the money supply .
At what rate ?
He was vague : 3 % to 5 % .
Which definition of money ?
Again , this was not clear , although he seemed to prefer M2 .
Few people know that Friedman abandoned this suggestion in the mid-1980’s .
He figured out at long last what Austrian School economists had been saying since 1912 : that the central bank wants to control events directly by manipulating money and credit .
In 1986 , his article appeared in the Western Economics Association ’s journal , Economic Inquiry .
It was titled “ Economists and Economic Policy . ”
He admitted that his advocacy of a fixed rule for the expansion of central bank - created money had been a waste of time .
Such a restraint was not in the self - interest of central - banking officials .
That public admission was barely perceived at the time and is long forgotten .
This was always the biggest problem with Friedman ’s policy recommendations .
Whenever they were conceptually wrong from the point of view of liberty , they got picked up by the mainstream , even occasionally implemented .
His most influential recommendation was income tax withholding in 1943 .
He was one of the Treasury Department ’s staff economists who wrote the defense of the idea , which had been recommended by the Chairman of the New York FED , a former Rockefeller foundation director , Beardsley Ruml .
( Ruml was a statistician , had a Ph.D. in psychology , and became chairman of R. H. Macy & Co. in 1945 , while serving as chairman of the New York FED . )
He favored tax - funded vouchers for education , which would automatically transfer tax money and thereby Supreme Court control over private education .
He and I debated this issue in the pages of the Foundation for Economic Education ’s monthly magazine , The Freeman , in 1993 .
Then there is his most famous example in academia : his retroactive policy recommendation for the Federal Reserve System .
It should have inflated more , 1929 — 33 , he argued in his most academically influential book , A Monetary History of the United States ( Princeton University Press , 1963 ) .
His co-author , Anna J. Schwartz , did the grunt work in gathering the statistics .
He provided the theory .
His policy recommendation was straight out of Fisher ’s playbook .
So was his monetary theory .
The theory was wrong because it did not take cognizance of the distortions produced by Federal Reserve policy in the 1925 — 29 period , in which the New York FED , under the control of Benjamin Strong , deliberately kept interest rates low in the United States in order to prevent an outflow of gold from Great Britain , which had returned to the gold standard in 1925 .
The Bank of England , under the influence of Winston Churchill , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , had returned to the gold standard at the pre-War price .
This was far too low , given the inflation of World War I .
Gold had immediately begun flowing out at this bargain price .
People could sell the gold and invest in Treasury debt in the USA at higher rates .
So , the head of the Bank of England , who was an intimate companion of Strong , prevailed on Strong to keep rates low .
This led to the stock market bubble of 1925 — 29 .
Friedman did not discuss this FED - Bank of England relationship .
Murray Rothbard did .
In the same year that Friedman ’s book appeared , published in the same town by a small , less influential publisher ( Van Nostrand ) , Rothbard ’s book , America ’s Great Depression , told the story in full detail .
The FED had created the bubble .
Then , in the year after Strong ’s death in 1928 , it stabilized monetary growth ; this collapsed the stock market .
Rothbard showed that Mises ’ theory of the business cycle explains this phenomenon .
So , in 1963 , the old debate between Fisher and Mises was revived .
Friedman ’s book became widely quoted .
Rothbard ’s sank without a trace .
Here is an important fact to remember .
Friedman ’s book covered 1867 — 1960 .
You almost never see it referred to , except for the section on Federal Reserve policy in 1930 — 33 .
For example , you do not see it quoted when it shows that the period extending from 1867 to about 1910 was a period of relatively stable money , falling prices , and increasing per capita wealth due to large increases in productivity .
Only when he was critical of the FED as insufficiently inflationary is the book ever mentioned .
The problem facing the FED was that thousands of banks were going under .
They took deposits with them .
This shrank the money supply .
There was no FDIC until 1934 .
There was no means of saving all of these banks apart from direct loans to them , collateralized by what today is called toxic assets .
The FED really was pushing on a string .
Bankers were terrified .
They called in loans .
They increased reserves at the FED .
In short , they did exactly what bankers are doing today .
Here is a chart of the money supply , the monetary base , and Federal Reserve credit , 1929 — 38 .
The money supply fell sharply : busted banks and currency hoarding .
The monetary base did not contract , 1929 — 32 .
Federal Reserve credit did until late 1931 .
It was limited in its collateral .
After 1931 , the FED actively inflated .
The money supply still fell , because thousands of banks went bankrupt in 1932 — 33 .
CAUSE AND EFFECT
It was Federal Reserve policy that caused the stock market bubble and the boom , 1925 — 29 .
It was Federal Reserve stabilization policy that popped the bubble in 1929 — 30 .
It was Federal Reserve expansionary monetary policy that failed to revive the economy in 1932 and 1933 .
The Federal Reserve has been the problem ever since 1914 .
It could not be trusted to bring either price stability or a corrective for recessions .
It did not adhere to a predictable monetary policy .
It was not governed by a single policy .
It was erratic .
It created the economy in its own image .
The textbooks do not reveal this .
The textbooks parrot the Party Line of the Federal Reserve : it has saved the American economy repeatedly by its intervention .
Without the FED , there would have been far greater instability .
This was Irving Fisher ’s line .
It was Milton Friedman ’s line with respect to the post - 1933 era of fiat money and FDIC protection of bank deposits .
The Austrian Party line , from Mises in 1912 until today , has never made its way into the textbooks .
It has rarely made its way into conferences of academic economists . . . and no historians ’ conferences .
It fell out of favor after Keynes ’ General Theory ( 1936 ) , and it has come back in favor among a hard core of younger , untenured economists only because of the Mises Institute and the World Wide Web .
The guild is still closed to such a view of economic causation .
Such a view teaches that central banking is the problem , not the solution .
This view is anathema in academia and the mainstream media .
CONCLUSION
The Fisher - Friedman view has been at war with the Mises - Rothbard view for almost a century .
It will not go away .
The two views are based on rival views of economic methodology .
The Austrians believe that government - enforced fiat money economies are inherently unstable , subject to booms and busts .
They favor a gold coin standard .
The monetarists believe that government - licensed central banks are preferable to any gold standard .
Gold is wasteful , they teach .
By implication , central banking and fiat money are less wasteful .
Until Ron Paul ’s candidacy and the rise of the Tea Party movement , most conservatives have accepted Friedman ’s view .
The leaders still do .
Hostility to central banking on principle has not been a hallmark of mainstream conservatism since 1945 .
Friedman has been the most prominent economist , and on money , he followed the pied piper of fiat money , Irving Fisher .
Just for the record , Fisher was a member of Yale ’s Skull & Bones .
He was also a devotee of scientific racism and a promoter of eugenics : government - forced sterilization .
He thought science could solve mankind ’s problems when used by government elites to run the affairs of men .
The fact that Friedman believed anything that this elitist purveyor of government - implemented scientific planning wrote never ceases to amaze me .
Fisher was consistent in his devotion to socialism , racism , and fiat money .
Friedman was not .

We ’ve reached the end .
It ’s with mixed emotions that Bryan and I have decided that this will be the final episode of this experiment in grassroots storytelling .
It ’s been an incredible adventure for us .
The athletes left us inspired .
The community reaction humbled us .
Thank you .
A few things I will never forget :
Spending New Years
Eve in a no name town on Vancouver island inside Jonaven ’s airstream .
Rain pelted the aluminum .
Watching the cable cam first take flight .
The resulting look of glee on Matt ’s face .
Sunset at the mouth of the Klamath .
Realizing that I still have the same enthusiasm for traveling the American West as I did when I was 21 .
Watching the light fade from the top of Cheop ’s .
I could go on and on .
It has been a memorable experience .
Thanks for watching .
INDIANAPOLIS --
An NFL spokesman said Saturday the league could change its overtime format for playoff games at a meeting next month .
Under the new format , both teams would get the ball at least once unless the first team to get the ball scores a touchdown , Greg Aiello said .
If the first team to get the ball makes a field goal and the other team ties the game , action would continue until a team scores again .
Under the current rules , the first team to score wins .
" There have been various concepts that have been discussed in recent years , but this one has never been proposed , " Aiello said .
The competition committee will discuss the new concept with teams and players at league meetings March 21 - 24 in Orlando , Fla. , when it could come to a vote .
At least two thirds of the teams would need to agree to the changes for new rules to be adopted .
The competition committee met with the players ' union and players on Thursday during the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis .
Discussion continued when the competition committee met with a general managers ' advisory committee on Friday .
The debate about the rules gained steam after the NFC championship game , when New Orleans beat Minnesota 31 - 28 in overtime and Brett Favre 's Vikings never got the ball in the extra period .
Under the proposed rule , Minnesota would have gotten another possession because the Vikings did n't allow a touchdown .
Overtime was adopted for regular season games in 1974 , a sudden - death format that allowed games to end in a tie if neither team scored in 15 minutes .
Overtime for playoff games always has been sudden death .
Using Python to Simulate Mechanical Things
Background
I like to build things out of Legos , but it is a real uphill battle to actually be able to control any of the things I build using actual control systems such as PID controllers .
I therefore decided I should start trying to build little programs to simulate as much as possible .
To assist me in this project , I enlisted Python because of its bindings to ODE and SDL , and also because it is interpreted and object oriented .
These attributes all combine to form a language that is very good for doing light - weight physical simulation .
I found the pyODE API reference necessary to keep open while programing .
The pygame API reference was useful for figuring out how to get fonts to render .
Update !
Files You 'll Need
I decided to start working with some of these files again much later after I originally wrote them ( in April of 2009 ) and found that I 'd since lost my development environment .
More distressing was the fact that Windows support for all these packages has been left behind the current versions .
Python is at version 3.something now , ODE is four or five versions newer , by pyODE has n't been touched in a year .
But there is nothing to worry about .
I have archived a working set of tools you can install ( and that I can install in the future ) to use these example programs :

Simple Pendulum Balancing
I did n't really know how to use Python , so I started with the second pyODE tutorial .
It simulates a two dimensional system which tries to spin two weights on the end of levers using a constant velocity .
The page for the tutorial has a nice screen shot of whats going on .
" Bang - Bang " Controller
My first change was to create a " bang - bang " controller to change the commanded velocity of the center lever to try and keep it pointed upright .
I also added some code to report the angle ( position ) of the lever and the error in the position of the lever .
Here is the sourcecode .
Proportional Controller
The second program replaces the " bang - bang " controller with a proportional conroller .
You may notice that it works much better than the previous controller .
It does n't seem to seek the desired position as quickly , but once it gets " locked on , " it can keep the position very steady .
I also added some code to report the output of the control system , the " command velocity , " and rounded all the displayed digits to three decimals to make them somehwat easier to read .
It is also interesting to report that the proportional controller only needed a maximum force of 20 units to achieve a steady state , while the bang - bang controller needed a maximum force of 22 units .
The bang - bang controller could probably use less than 22 units of force if it were allowed to command a larger velocity , but that would lengthen the settling time considerably .
Here is the sourcecode for the proportional controler demo .
PID Controller
Finally , I worte a full PID controller , with limits to lessen integral windup .
Rick Bickle 's motor control presentation was very helpful , from a coding standpoint .
I found that tuning the P , I , and D constants was rather challenging .
For previous controllers I 'd worked with , the D term was to be rather small , since it amplified noise .
The I term was usually fairly large , since it was used to prevent changes .
But in this controller , I had to set the I term to zero , and have a rather large D term !
I do n't pretend to be a PID guru , but I was somewhat surprised .
Part of the problem was how the system behaves .
Due to the second lever swinging around freely , it was hard to do the traditional tuning method .
The method I used in the past was to set all terms to zero .
Then increase the P term until the system oscillates .
Then increase the I term until the oscillation stops .
Finally , increase the D term to get the transient response you desire .
I think this system my be described as " chaotic " ( in the mathematical sense ) or " non-linear " .
I will have to research a little more about the terms to say for sure .
Here is the sourceode for the full PID controller , with values that bring the pendulum to a balance .
Feel free to twiddle around with the P , I , and D terms and the I term limits to see if you can get a better response !
Balancing Ball Robot
The next robot I wanted to simulate was a balancing robot , similar to David Anderson 's nBot , but using a ball instead of wheels so that it had to balance on two axes .
I started with the third tutorial for pyODE .
A lot of my code is from this example , but I typed it in by hand so as to force myself to understand each part of the code .
I would recommend this to anyone using tutorials to learn a new language .
I added some code to render balls as well as blocks , and set up an ODE universal joint between a sphere ( which would be the wheel ) and a box ( which would be the counterweight and object I wish to balance vertically ) .
Much of this part of the project was figuring out how ODE joints work and tweeking the physical parameters of the simulation .
No control systems have been added yet , but it should end up being similar to the PID code of the pendulum balancer .
Here is a copy of the source code .
Note that it uses pyOpenGL and GLUT , instead of pygame .
This is somewhat of a pain to setup , especially on Windows .
If I could find an easier way ( installation - wise ) for doing 3D work , I would probably switch .
Single Axis PID
It took me a few days to figure out a way to determine the tilt of the stick in such a way that I could derive control information for the ball .
The problem was that most methods of representing angles are ambiguous as to whether the tilt error was negative or positive .
The solution was to use a Euler axis / angle pair derived from the ODE rotation matrix of the stick .
With that out of the way , I put in a single PID controller on one axis of the sphere , which would balance the machine to a degree .
Once perterbed , or given enough time for errors to accumulate , it would gyrate wildly around trying to control a two - axis system with only one axis of control .
It almost seems like it could balance given tuning of the parameters .
The source code at this stage is full of four days of munging around with different rotational representations and is a real mess .
But its worth a download to watch the machine swing around like an idiot for a while .
This simulation is different than all the previous simulations in that the starting position of the second stick is slightly randomized .
This means that each run of the simulation is different .
Dual Axis PID
After another period of geometry wrangling , I deduced the correct combination of orthonormal basis and dihedral angles to control the second axis of the rolling ball .
This is all fine and good , except that now I have discovered that I need to control a third parameter : the " spinning " of the machine .
Right now , I can keep the machine oriented upwards , but in doing so , it will gradually accumulate a rotational inertia around it 's axis .
The problem is that I have no more control variables to exercise .
Imagine you had a ball that you and a friend were balancing on .
You are facing right angles and can only run forwards or backwards .
How would you turn the ball so that one of you were facing north or any other compass direction ?
The short answer is that you can't directly control it .
Neither you nor your friend can make the ball spin in place , since both of you are exerting forces which line up on the axis you want to spin around .
You could spin , if you got clever , by allowing yourselves to lean a certain direction , and then roll the ball so that you " swung " the direction you wanted to the ball to spin .
This would actually happen in the normal course of trying to keep the ball balanced , so you would gradually accumulate some spin anyways .
This is what is happening in my simulation now .
A gradual , uncontrolled spin develops and eventually makes the whole thing runs away .
In the third version of the simulation , you can see this happening .
I 've added some debug marks to show the different axis of the system .
I 've also added another block for it to run into .
I 've not done too much in the way of PID constant tuning ; in fact , I am using a simple P controller .
The problem I am now faced with is this : I have two controllable parameters , but three parameters to control .
I fiddled around some more with the code and added walls and a grid .
This does n't really change much .
The machine will bounce off the walls .
It makes screenshots a lot nicer . :)
I also made the camera always point at the center of the ball .
Here is a copy with these changes .
The last thing I tried on this system was adding a block which spun providing torque against the gradual accumulation of spin on the ball .
The block sat on top of the first block like the top of the letter T .
It had its own PID controller for how much it spun .
Suffice to say , throwing yet another body into this system , with its own PID controller , did n't do much for stability .

Ball Now in the Other Court
Richard Rothstein
Research Associate , Economic Policy Institute
Randi Weingarten has announced that she will press her union ’s locals to agree to contracts that include systems for fair and balanced evaluation of teacher performance ( including , but not limited to measures of student achievement ) ; and for the speedy removal of ineffective teachers , with simplified due process rules , when appropriate support fails to correct inadequacy .
Indeed , the AFT president may encourage local unions to proactively propose such procedures , even where school administrators fail to do so .
The speech has the potential to shift our debate about responsibility for raising student achievement , calling the bluff of those who claim that union protection of poor teachers is mostly what retards student learning .
Yet some are making too much of this speech .
Although it is conventional to blame unions for protecting ineffective teachers , the union does not unilaterally impose teacher discipline rules .
Every teacher contract negotiation requires agreement between school district administration and a union .
From the commentary on Ms. Weingarten ’s speech , you ’d think that school superintendents have been proposing fair and balanced teacher evaluation systems , with expedited due process disciplinary procedures , and teacher unions have been refusing to agree .
This is far from the truth .
There is no case where a school superintendent has proposed a teacher evaluation and discipline system of the kind Weingarten described in her speech , and where a union then refused to go along .
And if a union had , initially , balked ?
The reality of collective bargaining is this : administrations have the right to propose such systems , and to impose them if , after bargaining , a union continues to resist .
At that point , the union ’s only option is to strike ( where public employee strikes are legal ) or to beg for further discussion or mediation .
In the absence of eventual agreement , management has the right to impose its proposal without union consent .
It is impossible to imagine a realistic situation where a fair and balanced evaluation system , with due process protections , would be a strike issue for any local teachers union .
Unions strike if salaries lag far behind inflation , if pensions are cut , if health insurance coverage is slashed .
When adequate compensation is in place , unions do n’t strike ( and have n’t ) to resist fair and balanced evaluation with due process protection .
In contrast , strikes over grossly unfair teacher termination policies remain likely – recall the United Federation of Teachers strike in 1968 over arbitrary dismissals in Ocean Hill - Brownsville .
Recently , when the New Haven school administration proposed a system that takes small steps toward the kinds of procedures endorsed in the Weingarten speech , the AFT was a willing and enthusiastic partner .
Of course , some local union leaders today stupidly adopt a posture of resistance even to reasonable teacher evaluation proposals .
But it is only a posture .
They have no choice but to go along with such proposals if , in bargaining , management insists .
So why , then , do n’t we have fair and balanced evaluation of teachers with simplified due process rules for the removal of those who are persistently ineffective ?
Only because school district administrations do not propose such systems .
No speech by Randi Weingarten can change this reality .
Administrations do n’t propose such systems mostly because they are very , very expensive .
Evaluation of teachers , including the mentoring of novices and of veterans in need of improvement , requires the employment of many additional supervisors of teachers .
Call them master - or mentor - teachers , not supervisors , if you wish .
The cost implications are the same .
Schools today are under - administered .
Frequently , one principal supervises as many as 30 teachers .
No principal can evaluate and mentor this many .
In addition to teacher evaluation , principals are handling curriculum , scheduling , student discipline , parent and community relations , and supervision of buildings and grounds .
Lately , in our enthusiasm for administrative decentralization , we ’ve added budgeting and purchase of supplies to her load .
Even with the addition of an assistant principal , the challenge is impossible .
The reason we have such terrible “ drive - by ” teacher evaluation systems , with principals taking perfunctory peeks into classrooms , is that principals have no time ( or training ) to do it right .
No other profession operates with such inadequate supervision .
Can you imagine a nursing supervisor overseeing 30 nurses ?
A newspaper editor overseeing 30 reporters ?
A law firm partner overseeing 30 associates ?
Even an assembly line ca n’t rely on only one foreman for 30 workers .
Management theorists recommend that no leader should have more than 5 direct - reports .
The failure of public education to organize itself around this common - sense principle is the roadblock to fair and balanced evaluation .
Blaming teacher unions for this failure is demagoguery .
If , as Randi Weingarten supports , we were to simplify teacher discipline rules to make it easier to terminate an ineffective teacher , there are two core elements of due process that must be retained .
First , a principal must be able to demonstrate to a hearing officer that the teacher ’s weaknesses had been identified , that the teacher had been notified of those weaknesses , and that the teacher had been given the opportunity ( with appropriate mentoring , if necessary ) to correct them .
Second , a principal must be able to demonstrate that other , similarly - situated teachers , were treated similarly : the principal was n’t using the weakness as a pretext for arbitrary discipline while other teachers with similar weaknesses were ignored .
Meeting both of these conditions requires an intensity of oversight and observation of instruction that is impossible to achieve with existing supervisory ratios , except in the most extreme cases of gross incompetence .
Teacher unions will continue to resist proposals that fail to meet these requirements – such as those that evaluate teachers primarily by their students ’ standardized test scores – and nothing in Ms. Weingarten ’s speech suggests otherwise .
There are some districts today where teacher unions influence , even control , administration policies because of union members ’ participation in low - turnout school board elections .
In such cases , unions may , in effect , be bargaining with themselves , and administrations may never be able to insist upon reasonable and simplified due process rules .
But such circumstances are rare , and do not characterize big-city school systems , especially those where mayors appoint school boards or administrators .
In these districts , the question we should be asking is not , “ what would the union say if the chancellor proposed and insisted upon a fair and balanced evaluation system , ” but “ why has n’t he ? ”
And if he did , are we prepared to provide the funds for all those additional teacher supervisors and mentor teachers an effective system would require ?
( Note : Randi Weingarten serves on the Board of Directors of the Economic Policy Institute , where I am a Research Associate , and the American Federation of Teachers has made financial contributions to EPI .
Neither Ms. Weingarten nor anyone at the AFT has seen this post in advance , nor did she or anyone at the AFT approve its contents .
This post represents my views alone and is not necessarily consistent with the views of Ms. Weingarten or the American Federation of Teachers — Richard Rothstein )

Paramodel “ tommy sushi ” & “ tommy ca ” .
AZITO is an online gallery which brings the hottest contemporary Japanese artworks to the international scale .
By collaborating with Japan ’s leading galleries and artists , AZITO makes these works readily available for purchase online .
And with new arrivals every month , this is truly your personalized insight into the thriving world of Japanese contemporary art .
“ tommy sushi ” by Paramodel © Paramodel
AZITO is pleased to introduce two new series , “ tommy sushi ” and “ tommy ca ” by Paramodel .
Paramodel is an artist unit formed in 2001 by Yasuhiko Hayashi and Yusuke Nakano .
Their title is essentially a manifesto in sum – fusing the words “ Paradise ” , “ Paradox ” , and “ Model ” , the portmanteau also plays upon the Japanese word “ puramodel ” ( toy plastic dioramas ) .
Through elaborate combinations of plastic toys parts with other everyday objects , they attempt to create blueprints of Paradise whilst underscoring life ’s paradoxes .
“ tommy sushi ” by Paramodel © Paramodel
This engagement of “ play ” between pleasure and function , imagination and necessity , is what launches the viewer into a realm where the poetic mixes with the aesthetic .
The juxtapositions of such recognizable , yet unlikely objects , creates visual discrepancies that seem to reconnect one with the spiritual , like a Zen koan .
Paramodel ’s expansive oeuvre ranges from massive , room - scaling installations , to mini-sculptures , with videos , drawing , and photography , and other media in between .
“ tommi ca ” by Paramodel © Paramodel
The series of sculptures featured on AZITO show the perfect merger discovered between TOMY toy cars , plastic food models used by restaurants , and the dishes accompanying those cuisines .
Four carry enticing plastic sushi models , while another four carry Chinese food models .
Strapped down to the toy cars , the plastic foods are readily docked onto the very dishes which would be used in their consumption .
Yet , the cars cannot budge from the perimeter of the dish ; the food cannot be consumed ; and the viewer recognizes the paradox in having the exact collection of items needed for transporting food onto the table and into our mouths – and yet , not being able to perform either function .
Enticing us with our own desires of play , eating , and mimicry , and then turning such impulses into plastic model visions , these eight sculptures beautifully capture the spirit of “ Paramodel ” .
“ tommy ca ” by Paramodel © Paramodel

( CNN ) -- Threats by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula against targets in Yemen prompted the closure of the U.S. and British embassies there Sunday , officials said .
" There are indications that al Qaeda is planning to carry out an attack against a target inside of Sanaa , possibly our embassy , " John Brennan , the assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism , said on CNN's " State of the Union " on Sunday .
" And what we do is to take every measure possible to ensure the safety of our diplomats and citizens abroad , so the decision was made to close the embassy . "
The United States is working closely with the Yemeni government on the proper security precautions , he said .
Another senior administration official told CNN late Sunday that the closing of the U.S. Embassy was because of a specific , credible and ongoing threat .
No additional details were provided .
The British Foreign Office told CNN its embassy also closed because of security concerns .
A spokeswoman said a decision would be made later Sunday on whether it would reopen on Monday .
U.S. State Department spokesman Fred Lash would not elaborate on any specific security threats , and said he did not know how long the embassy would remain closed .
The embassy on December 31 alerted Americans in Yemen to remain on alert for the possibility of terrorist violence .
On Christmas Day , a Nigerian man allegedly attempted to detonate an explosive device on board a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam , Netherlands , to Detroit , Michigan .
On Saturday , President Obama linked the suspect , 23 - year - old Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab , to an al Qaeda affiliate based in Yemen .
Shortly after the incident , Yemen - based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the bombing attempt .
" I think what we 've seen over the past several years in Yemen is an increasing strengthening of al Qaeda forces in Yemen , " Brennan told CNN .
" There are several hundred al Qaeda members there . "
In a Sunday interview on the BBC's " The Andrew Marr Show , " British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said besides increased security measures , " We 've got to also get back to the source of this , which is Yemen , Somalia , Pakistan , and we 've got to recognize that we 've got a group of young people who have been radicalized as a result of teaching by extremist clerics , and we 've got to recognize that we 're fighting a battle for hearts and minds here as much as everything else . "
He said Britain will work with American authorities to support the Yemeni government in its counterterrorism efforts .
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula said the attempted attack on the airliner was in retaliation for airstrikes against it on December 17 and 24 .
One of those attacks targeted four al Qaeda operatives believed to have been planning an imminent attack in Yemen against the United States or Saudi Arabian embassies , or both , a senior U.S. military official told CNN on Sunday .
Three of the targets were killed in the attack and a fourth was wounded , the official said .
The wounded man was actually wearing his suicide vest when captured by the Yemenis , according to the official .
On Saturday , Gen. David Petraeus , head of the U.S. Central Command , met with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen , a senior U.S. government official told CNN .
During his meeting with Petraeus , Saleh expressed his appreciation for U.S. help in combating extremists , offered more support for U.S. counterterrorism strikes , and said he would continue providing assistance for the U.S. investigation into the attempted bombing , the official said .
The official said that Petraeus was carrying several messages and " various items " of information from Obama to Saleh .
No further details were available .
The two men discussed the latest intelligence on al Qaeda in Yemen , the official said , adding that the group in the U.S. - Yemeni meeting was kept very small on both sides .
In remarks Saturday , Obama pledged that everyone involved in the attack would be held accountable , and highlighted his administration 's attempts to crack down on extremist enclaves in Yemen .
The president also reiterated his long - standing promise to " disrupt , dismantle and defeat " al Qaeda .
Obama said that AbdulMutallab had recently traveled to Yemen and that " it appears that he joined an affiliate of al Qaeda . "
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula apparently trained AbdulMutallab , equipped him with explosives , and directed him to attack the plane , the president said in his weekly radio address .
Obama has been criticized by some political opponents for not responding more aggressively to the bombing attempt .
From the first day , the Obama administration has been focused on Yemen , Brennan said Sunday .
" We are very concerned about al Qaeda 's continued growth there , but they 're not just focused on Yemen , " he said of al Qaeda .
" They are , in fact , looking toward the West . "
That 's why , he said , " we have to get to this problem in Yemen now . "
" This is not the first time this group has targeted us , " Obama noted .
Recently , he said , " they have bombed Yemeni government facilities and Western hotels , restaurants and embassies -- including our embassy in 2008 . "
" Everything is possible " in terms of U.S. military assistance , Brennan told NBC's " Meet the Press " on Sunday .
The United States is providing Yemen with " security , intelligence and military support , " he said .
" We want to make sure the Yemenis have what they need . "
He told CNN that while the United States has made progress in diminishing al Qaeda 's capabilities , the organization is still a threat and still has the capacity to carry out attacks , and continues looking for ways to do so .

KDE has made the first release candidate of the KDE Software Compilation 4.4 available .
The new features of KDE SC 4.4.0 can be found in the official release announcement .
A more detailed list is available on TechBase .
Please report bugs you find in this release to KDE 's Bugzilla .
The first KDE SC ( KDE SC , what 's that ? ) release ( albeit not a stable one ) is the first release candidate for the upcoming KDE Software Compilation 4.4.0 which will be released on February 9th .
In between , there is a second release candidate planned already , RC2 , on 20th January .
In the 4.4 beta cycle , we have reduced the time it takes us to package and deliver the test releases , so our testers get the freshest tarballs ever , leading to shorter test - and - fix cycles .
KDE SC 4.4.0 is also the first release to be based on Qt 4.6 which became available in December .
We have therefore decided to insert another release candidate to make sure we deliver the best KDE Software Compilation to date with KDE SC 4.4.0 .
As usual , the source tarballs can be downloaded from various mirrors , spread across the world .
Packages for a number of distros will become available shortly , as the packages are still very fresh , and not everybody has had the chance to fully build them yet .
This release candidate is named after Cornelius Schumacher , in order to worship his continued awesomeness and his contributions to KDE as a whole .
Everyone is clamoring about tablets these days — ourselves included — so it 's not too surprising that Google and HTC are set to join the fray .
They are reportedly working together on a Chrome OS Google Tablet .

Smarthouse , an Australian publication , reports that HTC and Google have been collaborating " for the past 18 months " and have produced " several working models of a touch tablet , " including one outfitted with Google 's Chrome OS .
We wrote why a Google Tablet would be a good idea last month , and with the Apple Tablet discussion reaching a fever pitch , it 's harder and harder to get excited about a Chrome OS netbook from Google .

Having collaborated on the Nexus One , a smart phone that impressed us with its design as well as its hardware , HTC and Google partnering on a tablet seems like a promising prospect .
But will it " compete head on " with Apple 's tablet as Smarthouse claims ?
Probably not .

From what we know , it seems like Apple is putting as much effort into their tablet 's content as they are into the gadget itself .
We 've written extensively on how an Apple tablet could redefine newspapers , textbooks , and magazines .
In the last case , we 've already salivated , more than once , over concepts for how magazines might evolve in a multi - touch future .
Add that to Apple 's recent acquisition of Lala , a move that likely points to a cloud - based future for iTunes , and the reports that Apple is trying to secure TV show subscription packages for the iTunes store .
Admittedly , not a whole lot is certain about Apple 's tablet .
But you start looking at all of those pieces and how they might fit together around one device , you can easily envision a gadget that is focused on streaming the stuff you read , the stuff you listen to , and the stuff you watch .

It 's hard to foresee a future in which a Google Tablet tries to go head to head with Apple on the content level .
That 's not to say , however , that there are n't some compelling things that could be offered by a Google tablet .
As the launch of Google 's Chrome OS made clear , they 're looking toward a future with a multitude of devices that can access the Internet quickly , cleanly , and cheaply .
A Google Tablet could be just the thing to realize all of those goals .
When we tried out the JooJoo tablet , we saw how a well - designed tablet for consuming web content could provide an engaging experience .
A Chrome OS tablet by Google would likely work the same way , keeping typing to a minimum and offering a literal hands - on web surfing experience .

Air freight capacity out of mainland China and Hong Kong was almost fully booked in December , according to shippers , making it likely that China would post strong exports when it released a flood of monthly and annual economic data next week .
But in interviews this week , senior corporate executives voiced a range of opinions about whether this strength would continue into the new year , or whether the surge in December represented a flurry of restocking by retailers who went into the Christmas season with meager inventories .
Victor Fung , the nonexecutive chairman of Li & Fung , a Hong Kong - based trading and supply chain management company that is one of the world ’s largest , said that overseas demand had not been strong enough to sustain the strength in China 's shipments seen last month .
But he added that his own staff was somewhat more optimistic than he is , as are some investment bank economists .
Thursday 's slight increase in interest rates could prove even more significant if it marks the start of an effort by Chinese regulators to limit bank lending .
Chinese banks have not only lent heavily at home , but stepped up lending in other countries as well , taking market share from Western banks hobbled by the global financial crisis .
Top officials at the People 's Bank of China concluded an annual two - day policy review on Wednesday with a lengthy statement that had particularly strong cautions against bank lending to sectors of the economy with overcapacity or excessive energy use .
Chinese bank regulators also warned banks in late November to show more caution in lending and raise more capital to underpin the surge in lending they have already done ; the publicly traded Bank of China is widely expected to take the lead in raising money this year .
Thursday 's interest rate increase is not the first since the bottom of the economic downturn .
After cutting interest rates on the same 3 - month central bank bills by 2.4 percentage points in the last quarter of 2008 as the world 's financial system trembled , the People 's Bank nudged up interest rates by 0.363 from late June to early August last year in a series of increasingly large weekly increases .
But the central bank has been on hold ever since , watching for more evidence of the economy 's health .
Thursday 's increase appeared to confirm that the central bank was starting to become concerned again about rising prices , economists said .
Despite the clunky moniker , we read with interest as The Independent UK rattled off the seven — count ’em , seven — relevant starchitects in the world , contrasting them with commercial building firm Skidmore , Owings & Merrill .
SOM is a workhorse firm ( established in 1936 ) that has put up major projects from Dubai to Beijing including five of the ten tallest buildings in the world — in other words , America ’s first “ super practice . ”
What SOM has n’t hammered down is the je ne sais quoi of its flashier architectural contemporaries .
A primer on the heavy hitters after the jump .
Let ’s break down the following assertion :
And who are the real King Kongs of architecture in 2010 ?
The list is surprisingly short : Norman Foster heads it , standing imperiously aloof from Renzo Piano , Richard Rogers , Zaha Hadid , Frank Gehry , Herzog and de Meuron , and Rem Koolhaas .
Their buildings have “ signature ” design qualities .
Foster , peerless hi-tech ; Piano , elegantly refined frames ; Rogers , vividly articulated structure ; Hadid , sculptural abstraction ; Herzog and de Meuron , virtuosity of detail ; Koolhaas , edgy forms that are simultaneously utopian and dystopian .
To that , we ’ll add Gehry and his cartoonishly turbulent exterior shells .
Also , a fun fact : all seven of the noted architects have received the illustrious Pritzker Prize ( Gehry in 1989 , Piano in 1998 , Foster in 1999 , Koolhaas in 2000 , Herzog & de Meuron in 2001 , Hadid in 2004 , Rogers in 2007 ) .
Which begs the question : what do blue - chip architects like Jean Nouvel , Thom Mayne , and I.M. Pei have to do to earn the nickname of King Kong ?
Sir Norman Foster : “ His forms are always driven by an internal structural logic , and they treat their surroundings with a refreshing bluntness “ ;
“ The world ’s most famous and most productive architect .
A giant . ”
Work samples : New York Public Library renovation , the green headquarters for Hearst Publishing , the upcoming Bowery space for Sperone Westwater gallery , London ’s Canary Wharf underground station , a glass dome for the Reichstag in Berlin .
Richard Rogers : “ One of the most influential British architects of our time ” ; “ High tech iconoclast . ”
Work samples :
The Pompidou in Paris ( co- designed with fellow Kong Renzo Piano ) , Madrid ’s Barajas International Airport , Lloyd ’s of London , Stirling Prize - winning cancer center outside in London , Javits Convention Center .
Zaha Hadid : “ One of architecture ’s most original and powerful voices “ ; “ Policemen could cite her buildings for speeding “ ; “ Architecture ’s diva , the most precocious talent in her profession . ”
Work samples : MAXXI outside of Rome , Abu Dhabi Cultural Center , jelly ankle boot , Chanel space po , Leipzig BMW plant .
Renzo Piano :
“ The nature of his designs — sophisticated but not too threatening or unfamiliar — seem tailored to ease the insecurities of museum boards “ ; “ Rejecting monumentality , Piano expresses a preference for an airy , lightweight architecture . ”
Work samples : Parco della Musica in Rome , Potsdamer Platz masterplan for Berlin , Centre Pompidou competition design with Richard Rogers , Morgan Library addition , Modern Wing at the Art Institute of Chicago , New York Times building .
Frank Gehry : “ His work has become “ logotecture , ” a kind of high - priced , globalized architectural branding project “ ; “ One - trick pony “ ; “ [ In his mind ] architectural purity comes perilously close to oppression . ”
Work samples : Lou Ruvo Center for brain health , Disney Concert Hall in LA , Pritzker concert pavilion in Chicago ’s Millennium Park , IAC Headquarters in Manhattan , Guggenheim Bilbao , Laughing House in Spain .
Herzog & de Meuron : “ Stable qualities that have always been associated with the best Swiss architecture “ ; “ More than half a dozen art museums , each one a provocative reworking of the conventional formula . ”
Work samples : Tate Modern , Chinese National Stadium in Beijing , Walker Art Center , Allianz Arena in Munich , the upcoming Miami Art Museum .
Rem Koolhaas : “ The toughest kid on the block … [ He ] is n’t interested in signature architecture , in making things look pretty , or in hiding from the realities of contemporary life by treating architecture as a craft skill . ”
Work samples : Prada stores , the now - defunct Las Vegas branch of the Guggenheim , CCTV Headquarters in Beijing .

9/11 Panel Suspected Deception by Pentagon
Allegations Brought to Inspectors General
By Dan Eggen
Washington Post Staff Writer
Wednesday , August 2 , 2006
Some staff members and commissioners of the Sept. 11 panel concluded that the Pentagon 's initial story of how it reacted to the 2001 terrorist attacks may have been part of a deliberate effort to mislead the commission and the public rather than a reflection of the fog of events on that day , according to sources involved in the debate .
Suspicion of wrongdoing ran so deep that the 10 - member commission , in a secret meeting at the end of its tenure in summer 2004 , debated referring the matter to the Justice Department for criminal investigation , according to several commission sources .
Staff members and some commissioners thought that e-mails and other evidence provided enough probable cause to believe that military and aviation officials violated the law by making false statements to Congress and to the commission , hoping to hide the bungled response to the hijackings , these sources said .
In the end , the panel agreed to a compromise , turning over the allegations to the inspectors general for the Defense and Transportation departments , who can make criminal referrals if they believe they are warranted , officials said .
" We to this day do n't know why NORAD [ the North American Aerospace Command ] told us what they told us , " said Thomas H. Kean , the former New Jersey Republican governor who led the commission .
" It was just so far from the truth .
. . .
It 's one of those loose ends that never got tied . "
Although the commission 's landmark report made it clear that the Defense Department 's early versions of events on the day of the attacks were inaccurate , the revelation that it considered criminal referrals reveals how skeptically those reports were viewed by the panel and provides a glimpse of the tension between it and the Bush administration .
A Pentagon spokesman said yesterday that the inspector general 's office will soon release a report addressing whether testimony delivered to the commission was " knowingly false . "
A separate report , delivered secretly to Congress in May 2005 , blamed inaccuracies in part on problems with the way the Defense Department kept its records , according to a summary released yesterday .
A spokesman for the Transportation Department 's inspector general 's office said its investigation is complete and that a final report is being drafted .
Laura Brown , a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration , said she could not comment on the inspector general 's inquiry .
In an article scheduled to be on newsstands today , Vanity Fair magazine reports aspects of the commission debate -- though it does not mention the possible criminal referrals -- and publishes lengthy excerpts from military audiotapes recorded on Sept. 11 . ABC
News aired excerpts last night .
For more than two years after the attacks , officials with NORAD and the FAA provided inaccurate information about the response to the hijackings in testimony and media appearances .
Authorities suggested that U.S. air defenses had reacted quickly , that jets had been scrambled in response to the last two hijackings and that fighters were prepared to shoot down United Airlines Flight 93 if it threatened Washington .
In fact , the commission reported a year later , audiotapes from NORAD 's Northeast headquarters and other evidence showed clearly that the military never had any of the hijacked airliners in its sights and at one point chased a phantom aircraft -- American Airlines Flight 11 -- long after it had crashed into the World Trade Center .
Maj . Gen. Larry Arnold and Col. Alan Scott told the commission that NORAD had begun tracking United 93 at 9:16 a.m. , but the commission determined that the airliner was not hijacked until 12 minutes later .
The military was not aware of the flight until after it had crashed in Pennsylvania .
These and other discrepancies did not become clear until the commission , forced to use subpoenas , obtained audiotapes from the FAA and NORAD , officials said .
The agencies ' reluctance to release the tapes -- along with e-mails , erroneous public statements and other evidence -- led some of the panel 's staff members and commissioners to believe that authorities sought to mislead the commission and the public about what happened on Sept. 11 .
" I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described , " John Farmer , a former New Jersey attorney general who led the staff inquiry into events on Sept. 11 , said in a recent interview .
" The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years .
. . .
This is not spin .
This is not true . "
Arnold , who could not be reached for comment yesterday , told the commission in 2004 that he did not have all the information unearthed by the panel when he testified earlier .
Other military officials also denied any intent to mislead the panel .
John F. Lehman , a Republican commission member and former Navy secretary , said in a recent interview that he believed the panel may have been lied to but that he did not believe the evidence was sufficient to support a criminal referral .
" My view of that was that whether it was willful or just the fog of stupid bureaucracy , I do n't know , " Lehman said .
" But in the order of magnitude of things , going after bureaucrats because they misled the commission did n't seem to make sense to me . "

“ Mathematics is beautiful . ”
This may sound absurd to people who wince at numbers and equations .
But some of the most beautiful things in nature and our universe exhibit mathematical properties , from the smallest seashell to the biggest whirlpool galaxies .
In fact , one of the greatest ancient philosophers , Aristotle , said : “ The mathematical sciences particularly exhibit order , symmetry and limitation ; and these are the greatest forms of the beautiful . ”

In fact , one of the greatest ancient philosophers , Aristotle , said : “ The mathematical sciences particularly exhibit order , symmetry and limitation ; and these are the greatest forms of the beautiful . ”
Because of its beautiful nature , mathematics has been a part of art and architectural design for ages .
But it has not been exploited much for website design .
This is probably because many of us regard mathematics as being antithetical to creativity .
On the contrary , mathematics can be a tool to produce creative designs .
That said , you do n’t have to rely on math for every design .
The point is that you should regard it as your friend , not a foe .
For illustrative purposes , we created a couple of web designs that present mathematical principles discussed in this article .
We are also giving away a couple of PSDs that you can use right away in your next design .
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
Layouts featured in this post were created specifically for the purpose of this article .
During the design process we made sure that all of the designs shown in this article are essentially mathematical in nature ; that is , they exhibit order , symmetry and limitation .
We also have followed the Web design algorithm in this process — the designs have distinct themes , styles and elements .
To keep things simple and clear , we tried to stick to minimalist designs and also preferred single - page layouts .
Obviously , examples in this article are supposed to serve as a simple foundation for your designs and not as the finished designs .
Golden Ratio and Golden Rectangle
The golden ratio , also known as the divine proportion , is an irrational mathematical constant with a value of approximately 1.618033987 .
If the ratio of the sum of the quantities to the larger quantity is equal to the ratio of the larger quantity to the smaller one , then the quantities are said to have a golden ratio .
We already published a very detailed article “ Applying Divine Proportion To Web Design ” that explains how to use the golden ratio in Web design .
In today ’s article , we ’ll look at how to use golden rectangles in Web design .
A golden rectangle is one whose side lengths have the golden ratio 1 :( one - to - phi ) ; that is , 1:1.618 .
The construction of a golden rectangle is very easy and straightforward .
First , construct a simple square .
Then draw a line from the midpoint of one side of the square to an opposite corner and use that line as the radius to draw an arc that defines the height of the rectangle .
Finally , complete the golden rectangle and you are done .
A method to construct a golden rectangle .
The square is outlined in red .
The resulting dimensions are in the ratio 1 : Phi , the golden ratio .
As an example , consider the minimalist design below .
It has six golden rectangles in it , three rectangles per line .
The rectangles have the dimensions of 299 x 185 pixels .
Thus , the sides of these rectangles adhere approximately to the golden ratio ; that is , 299 ⁄ 185 = 1.616 .
Notice how the large amount of white space surrounding Golden rectangles creates a calm and simple atmosphere in which the navigation options can breathe and serve their purpose .
Although the layout uses only few colors and all blocks are positioned very similarly , the navigation options are obvious .
Large view
However , it may be quite difficult to add a new Golden block while keeping the consistency of the design .
Probably the only reasonable design solution here would be to add the block on the third line and use the rest of the horizontal space for other , more or less prominent features ( if necessary ) .
You can click on the image below to see the enlarged version .
Large view
Possible Applications
The golden rectangle design is well suited for photo galleries , portfolios and product - oriented websites .
The golden rectangles can also be arranged in other mathematically sound ways to generate beautiful designs .
In particular , you may want to use them for blocks that display images or ads in your sidebar .
Of course , the pure collection of golden rectangles does n’t make for a professional , nice - looking design .
You also need to work closely with grids , alignment , proximity and emphasis to achieve the main goals of your design .
For instance , an interesting design solution would be a CSS / jQuery - based fluid grid design based on golden rectangles , however we do not cover this technique in this article .

Fibonacci Design
As the name says , Fibonacci designs are designs based on the Fibonacci sequence of numbers .
By definition , the first two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1 , and each remaining number is the sum of the previous two .
Some sources omit the initial 0 , instead beginning the sequence with two 1s .
So the first two Fibonacci numbers are given , and each remaining number is the sum of the previous two .
The higher the Fibonacci sequence gets , the closer its numbers relate to each other according to the Golden Ratio .
A Fibonacci sequence goes like this :
0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 55 , 89 , 144 …
In music , Fibonacci numbers are sometimes used to determine tunings , and in visual art to determine the length or size of content and formal elements .
Jürgen Schmidhuber his methodology for Fibonacci - based designs on his blog .
However , if you examine the design he created , you are likely to find it rigid and a bit difficult to read and navigate .
Indeed , you need to get a bit creative with math rather than following the rules blindly — maths gives us a guide that we can apply , however it ’s rather about implementing sites with maths than implementing maths with our designs .
_Approximate and true golden spirals .
The green spiral is made from quarter - circles tangent to the interior of each square , while the red spiral is a Golden Spiral , a special type of logarithmic spiral .
Overlapping portions appear yellow .
The length of the side of one square divided by that of the next smaller square is the Golden ratio .
Source_
The main idea behind such designs is to use Fibonacci when deciding on the dimensions for content area or sidebar .
Both Golden ratio and Fibonacci let designers rely on sound , common ratios for page containers or blocks within page containers .
In general , layouts are quite easy to build using the Fibonacci sequence .
You pick a certain base width first — for instance , 90 px .
Then , when determining the size of your containers , you multiply the base width with the numbers from the Fibonacci series .
Depending on the calculations you get , you need to use them for your page blocks .
Let ’s take a look at an example .
Below is a minimalist typography blog based on Fibonacci Web design .
Large view
You can see that the page is divided into three columns .
Each column corresponds to a Fibonacci number .
For this design , we used a base width of 90 pixels .
This base width is then multiplied by a Fibonacci number to get the total width for a particular column .
For example , the first column has a width of 180 pixels ( 90 x 2 ) ; the second column has a width of 270 pixels ( 90 x 3 ) ; and the third column has a width of 720 pixels ( 90 x 8 ) .
The font size also corresponds to a Fibonacci number .
The blog heading has a size of 55 px ; the article ’s heading is 34 px ; and the content is 21 px .
The downside of layouts based on the Fibonacci sequence is that it ’s difficult to use it if you are given certain fixed width layout dimensions ( e.g. 1000 px ) .
In this situation it ’s easier to use the Golden ratio , as you would simply multiply 1000px with 0.618 and get 618 px which would be the ideal width for your content block .
However , if you try to achieve the same result with the Fibonacci sequence itself , you first need to figure out the sequence to the 1000 range .
According to the Fibonacci sequence calculator , the sequence would be …,610 , 987 , 1597 … .
Indeed , 987 is a good fit and you can start picking the widths for smaller blocks using the previous numbers in the sequence .
But if your fixed width layout is smaller or lager , you would need to use some approximate values which would again result in pure guessing .
The problem may also occur in liquid or elastic designs to some extent , but you have much more design freedom there .
Possible Applications
A Fibonacci design is best suited to blogs and magazine layouts .
You can arrange the layout in different ways according to Fibonacci numbers .
The article “ Nombre d’or , suite de Fibonacci et autres grilles de mise en page pour le design web ” ( in French ) explains in more depth the application of Fibonacci numbers to Web design .
Again , notice that you need to be creative when using Fibonacci sequence in your designs , otherwise your designs will turn out to be too rigid and hence difficult to use and navigate .

Five Elements , Or Kundli Design
Another interesting layout technique comes from the Indian horoscopes which are also called Kundli .
Basically , a Kundli is a very simple figure can be made in just three steps .
Draw a square , and then cross the two diagonals .
Join the mid-points on each side of the square to get the Kundli figure .
You ’ll notice four right - angle rhomboids in the figure .
These are the basis for our Web design .
The design below , then , is based on the Kundli geometric layout .
You ’ll notice that the chakras in the design also have mathematical properties .
Large view
This is a single - page layout .
Clicking on an element reveals more information about it , as shown in the figure below .
You could also include some simple jQuery animations or jQuery tooltips that would reveal more information on demand .
A further step would be a sliding web page where animation is used to display different content blocks ; you may also want to change the background images of the single content areas to make them a bit more distinctive .
In the following figure , you can see that our design is just a simple three - column layout : a header , three columns and a footer .
Not complex at all .
Possible Applications
This design is best for displaying product information and portfolios .
You can spice it up with JavaScript animation frameworks .
For example , you can apply color transformations to the chakras by using Raphael library , or you can add freestyle animations using jsAnim library .
You can have a tree sprout when the user clicks on the Earth element , or you can show sea creatures swimming in the water element .
The sky is the limit when it comes to animation using these JavaScript libraries .

Sine Wave Design
When it comes to mathmatics , you do not need to stick to well - known Golden Ratio or Fibonacci sequence .
You can also experiment with formulas from physics , chemistry and other sciences by using more general formulas and values in your designs .
For instance , let ’s consider the sine wave , or sinusoid , a mathematical function that describes a smooth repetitive oscillation .
We used a simple sine wave pattern as the basis for a simple and original Web design and create a single - page layout .
Of course , you can use the same approach for other designs such as graphics or infographics .
Large view
The layout is again very simple , consisting of a header , five columns and a footer .
You can use a jQuery tooltip to make the design more interactive .
Possible Applications
This wave pattern occurs often in nature , including ocean waves , sound waves , and light waves .
Also , a rough sinusoidal pattern can be seen in plotting average daily temperatures for each day of the year , although the graph may resemble an inverted cosine wave .
You can also use it to display a timeline of events .
It could even be developed to include horizontal navigation .
You can make it more interactive with the jQuery highlighter plug - in , which highlights each element ( i.e. DIV ) so that the user can focus on the content .

Other Techniques
Rule of Thirds
This rule states that an image should be imagined to be divided into nine equal parts by two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines , and that important compositional elements should be placed along these lines or their intersections .
It can also be expressed as a simplified mathematical approach that divides any layout into thirds , left to right and top to bottom .
Musical Logic
The rhythmic or thematic structure of musical compositions can be applied to distances between elements in a layout , like ABA , ABAC , etc. Learn more about music and mathematics in this Wikipedia article .

The couple said they wanted to keep Ayden 's ashes with them forever A father from Herefordshire is to have a portrait of his dead son tattooed on his chest using the child 's ashes .
Mark Richmond , 39 , and his wife Lisa , 31 , said they wanted to do something as a lasting tribute to their son Ayden .
He had a rare condition which meant he was unable to process fats and died in 2005 , aged two years and four months .
The couple , who own a tattoo parlour in Greater Manchester , plan to mix some of Ayden 's ashes in the ink for a 7in black and white portrait of him .
Mr Richmond , from Ross - on - Wye , said he was inspired by tattooing a portrait of murder victim Sophie Lancaster on her father John .
' Healing effect ' Sophie was a 20 - year - old gap student from Lancashire who was killed by a boy in a park in 2008 for being a Goth .
Mr Richmond said : " I invited John over for dinner to talk about the tattoo design and when you 've both lost a child , you just bond do n't you .
" He wanted a portrait of Sophie done as a way to help heal the scars of losing his daughter and I thought that 's something I 'd like to have done too . "
What better way to express myself than by designing a tattoo of my son using some of his ashes
Mark Richmond Mr Richmond said he still " feels at a loss and a little bit angry " about losing Ayden .
He has not been to visit his grave yet in Evesham , Worcestershire , and said he hoped the tattoo would help him cope .
He came up with the idea of using the ashes after his wife inquired about having a locket made by one of their customers so that she could always keep the ashes near her .
He said : " I just thought , why not .
I 'm an artist , what better way to express myself than by designing a tattoo of my son using some of his ashes . "
' Unheard of '
The ashes contain carbon , which is what tattoo ink is usually made from , Mr Richmond said .
His wife cannot have the tattoo yet as she is pregnant with their fourth child .
She said after the birth she would get her husband to tattoo the same portrait on her arm .
The couple have a tattoo parlour in Cheadle Hulme and their celebrity clients have included David Beckham .
They said they had heard about ashes being used in tattoos in the United States , but never in the UK before .
Mr Richmond plans to have the tattoo done on Wednesday .
He said : " Some people might think it 's a bit morbid , but until they have been through what we have , I do n't think they can really judge us . "

Iran says it only wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes Iran 's president has said it is ready to send its enriched uranium abroad for further enrichment under a deal to ease concerns about its nuclear programme .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told state TV that Iran would have " no problem " if most of its stock was held for several months before being returned as fuel rods .
Correspondents say that such a decision would be a major shift in Tehran 's position .
The US said that if this was a new offer , it was " prepared to listen " .
Last month , diplomats said Iran had informed the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) that it did not accept the terms of the deal and had instead demanded a simultaneous exchange on its territory .
The US and its allies fear Iran is attempting to develop nuclear weapons .
Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful .
' Definitive answer '
The deal agreed in October between Iran , the IAEA and the so - called P5+1 - the US , Russia , China , UK , France plus Germany - envisaged Iran sending about 70 % of its low - enriched uranium to Russia and France , where it would be processed into fuel for a research reactor .
If we send our enriched uranium abroad and then they do not give us the 20 % enriched fuel for our reactor , we are capable of producing it inside Iran
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
But for months , Iranian officials publicly criticised the terms and said they were unwilling to export the uranium without simultaneously receiving fuel in return .
The proposal proved unacceptable to the West .
But in a television interview on Tuesday , President Ahmadinejad dismissed the concerns of his " colleagues " that the West would not return the uranium , saying Iran would respond by producing more .
" We have no problem sending our enriched uranium abroad , " he said .
" We say : We will give you our 3.5 % enriched uranium and will get the fuel .
It may take four to five months until we get the fuel .
" If we send our enriched uranium abroad and then they do not give us the 20 % enriched fuel for our reactor , we are capable of producing it inside Iran . "
NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE
Mined uranium ore is purified and reconstituted into solid form known as yellowcake Yellowcake is chemically processed and converted into Uranium Hexafluoride gas Gas is fed through centrifuges , where its isotopes separate and process is repeated until uranium is enriched Low - level enriched uranium is used for nuclear fuel Highly enriched uranium can be used in nuclear weapons
In depth : Nuclear fuel cycle
In an initial reaction to Mr Ahmadinejad 's comments , US state department spokesman P J Crowley said the US was " not prepared to change the deal .
We are not interested in renegotiating it " .
In a later response , a White House official told the BBC : " If Mr Ahmadinejad 's comments reflect an updated Iranian position , we look forward to Iran informing the IAEA . "
The official added : " If Iran has something new to say , we are prepared to listen . "
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne , reporting from London , says that even now there will be scepticism over whether this Iranian change of heart really means anything .
The US is pressing hard for new sanctions against Iran because of the nuclear programme , so this could well just be a case of the Iranian government playing for time , trying to weaken forces lined up against it , he says .
Hikers
In his interview , Mr Ahmadinejad also said there were ongoing negotiations about a possible prisoner swap for several Iranians jailed in the US for the three American hikers currently being held in Iran .
" There are some talks under way to have an exchange , if it is possible , " he said .
" We are hopeful that all prisoners will be released . "
Who are the US hikers ?
Mr Ahmadinejad did not mention any specifics , but in December Tehran released a list of 11 Iranians it says are being held in US prisons , including a nuclear scientist who disappeared in Saudi Arabia and a former defence ministry official who vanished in Turkey .
The US has denied any knowledge of their whereabouts .
" I had said I would help in releasing them , but the attitude of some of the US officials damages the job , " he said .
" There are a large number of Iranians in prison in the US .
They have abducted some of our citizens in other countries . "
However , US National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer told Agence France - Presse news agency : " We have not entered into any discussion with Iran about an exchange . "
The three Americans - Shane Bauer , Sarah Shourd and Josh Fattal - were hiking in Iraq 's northern Kurdistan region in July when they accidentally crossed the border , their families have said .
Iranian prosecutors say they have been accused of spying .
Earlier , US Vice - President Joe Biden warned that Iran 's leaders were " sowing the seeds of their own destruction " by suppressing the opposition protests that followed the disputed re-election of Mr Ahmadinejad in June .
" The people of Iran are thinking about , the very people marching , they 're thinking about regime change , " he told MSNBC .

During his talk at the Consumer Electronics Show , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed the theme of privacy , as it relates to his company .
“ People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds , but more openly and with more people , ” Zuckerberg said .
“ We view it as our role in the system to constantly be innovating and be updating what our system is to reflect what the current social norms are . ”
I ’m getting dizzy , because that logic is totally circular !
Facebook is a successful business , built on getting people to put information on its website .
When more users update their profiles with phone numbers , relationship statuses and pictures of themselves vomiting , there ’s more information on Facebook , and therefore Facebook becomes more valuable .
I see the above quote as saying , “ Facebook has become successful at coaxing private information out of people , so now the social norms of ‘ privacy ’ have changed .
We will continue to innovate in the field of getting more people to give us their formerly private information . ”
It ’s kind of like a cigarette manufacturer saying the definition of “ healthy ” has changed , because more people have decided to smoke their cigarettes .

Paul Flynn has represented Newport West since 1987
People who administer bone - crushing handshakes to prove the strength of their personalities should be charged with assault , says a Labour MP .
Paul Flynn , 74 , the MP for Newport West , used his blog to claim that shaking hands was getting less popular .
" Good riddance .
They are unnecessary , unhygienic , germ - spreading intrusions , " he wrote .
He said some " oafs use them to prove the strength of their personalities with bone - crushers " .
" They should be summoned for assault . "
Mr Flynn wrote that eye - watering hand squeezes could be excruciatingly painful .
" Grimacing in pain does not deter them .
Even yelps of pain or sarcasm has no effect . "
He said he had tried sarcasm on these " insensitive dolts " but the point was ever understood .
Making fun
" Who will be the first person to be charged with assault by handshake ? "
Mr Flynn asked .
The veteran politician has previously used his blog to make outspoken comments .
He once attacked housing charity Shelter Cymru because he says it is ignoring the progress made in tackling housing problems .
He was also stripped of a parliamentary allowance for making fun of other MPs on his blog .
Mr Flynn was elected in 1987 and is known for his strong views on drug legislation and nuclear weapons .

You 've got to look at it from Senator Stephen Conroy 's perspective .
The fact Mike Kaiser had been involved in branch stacking is not a matter of shame .
He was working on behalf of the Right faction .
He was an ally .
He was successful .
He should not have attracted embarrassing publicity .
And for that he has to accept a penalty .
The penalty is he cannot run the Queensland ALP machine .
This means he can take a $ 450,000 job in the new NBN company to be established with taxpayers ' money .
And $ 450,000 is nothing when you are getting the taxpayers to stump up $ 43 billion .
Conroy is not what you would call a policy wonk .
He has risen in politics by running numbers : in the unions , in the Victorian ALP factions , in the federal caucus .
To keep all those people voting the right way you need to be able to deliver returns .
Faithful servants need to know they have good employment prospects .
This is where Kaiser becomes a role model .
Kaiser 's doing OK .
Conroy recommended Kaiser for a job .
And he can recommend others who show loyal service over a long period .

Co will be a fantastic opportunity for job seekers .
Most companies start small .
This one is going to start with $ 43 billion .
Since it has no pre-existing business it will recruit from the ground up , or as happened in the Kaiser case , from the minister down .
Here 's another reason to get Kaiser involved .

Caprica : Reins of a Waterfall
SPOILERS AHEAD : Reins of a Waterfall continues to expand the characters and the world of Caprica , and so the character themes in the score are also adapting .
While this episode does n’t introduce any new thematic material , it does use the current library of themes in new ways .
The first cue helps establish Lacey ’s isolation at school , as she walks through the hallways while her fellow students scorn her for being friends with a terrorist .
( Dude , her friend is frakkin’ DEAD , cut the girl some slack ! )
The orchestration of the main theme here is unique , because it rests atop a freely ascending accompanimental line in the violin and clarinets .
[ audio : http://www.bearmccreary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/cap103a.mp3|titles=Caprica – Lacey’s Popularity Problem ]
This kind of classically inspired figure would often be heard in the full orchestra in BSG or the Caprica pilot , but never in an intimate chamber orchestra setting like this .
I actually explored textures like this to wonderful effect throughout Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles , so I was confident the approach would work well here .
Later in the teaser , Sam roughs up Daniel before Joseph speaks with him .
As Joseph first approaches , Paul Cartwright ’s fiddle plays the Tauron theme with menace .
This is the first time that Joseph has taken on such an intimidating role , and the score shifts accordingly .
[ audio : http://www.bearmccreary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/cap103b.mp3|titles=Caprica – Ominous Tauron Theme ]
I was pleased that the melancholy undercurrents of the Tauron melody could so easily be tweaked into a new , frightening sound .
The Clarice Theme also shifts in Reins .
Clarice meets with a mysterious figure named Arvo , who is clearly connected to the STO .
For these scenes , the Clarice theme returns :
[ audio : http://www.bearmccreary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/CAP-Clarice-Theme.mp3|titles=Caprica – Clarice Theme ]
The theme underscores both Clarice ’s dedication and belief that she ’s doing the right thing , and the presence of the mysterious Arvo .
Here , the Clarice Theme officially expands to becoming the STO theme .
Like Rebirth , Reins includes important pieces of source music that help establish the world , in addition to the score .
The most exciting challenge in this episode was creating the music that would introduce us to Willie ’s gangster lifestyle , as he ditches school and hangs out at the local Tauron club .
For the pilot and first episode , I created a musical identity for the Taurons with the Tauron Theme :
[ audio : http://www.bearmccreary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/CAP-Tauron-Theme.mp3|titles=Caprica – Tauron Theme ]
This theme brings to mind a folky , ethnic ensemble , reminiscent of the main theme in the Godfather films .
However , I did n’t think that approach would work here .
This scene required source , not score .
In other words , the music here would literally be what the characters are listening to , and not an abstract emotional connection to their past in the underscore .
The editors temped this scene with old - timey blues music , appropriate for the fedoras and suits on screen .
And on a strictly dramatic level , the scene worked great with this music .
But , something about the temp blues music in the scene really bothered me .
While the Taurons have traditional tattoos , and are clearly proud of their heritage , they are also a younger generation .
These are not the aged gangsters we saw in the pilot .
They appear even younger than Sam .
I felt strongly that suggesting that young Tauron gangsters listened to acoustic blues or jazz music was a mistake .
We had already established that teenagers in the V - Club enjoy pulse - pounding electronica .
Why would street hooligans only a few years older than them listen to something that sounded like it was written 50 years earlier ?
I pitched an alternate strategy to the producers .
These Tauron gangsters would listen to some variation of gangster music , would n’t they ?
The producers , not feeling as strongly about the music either way , gave me a shot at pursuing this idea .
I knew the music would have to feel electronic and contemporary , but also be uniquely Tauron .
This would have to be music Tauron punks blast from their stereos in defiance .
Hip hop bursting from car windows makes a strong statement in an urban community , and I wanted the same effect here .
I started the piece with an old - timey piano solo ( recorded with upright piano samples that should ring a few bells in your BSG memories ! ) .
From there , I sketched out a basic hip hop groove and turned the track over to my brother Brendan McCreary .
You guys all know Brendan from his BSG vocal performance of “ All Along the Watchtower , ” shows with the BSG Orchestra or countless other times that his voice and songs have shown up in my projects .
But , this track is the most bizarre thing I ’ve ever asked him to do yet !
He took the basic song structure and groove I laid out and produced a fully - realized Tauron gangster rap track , taking his inspiration from Del the Funky Homosapien .
We even layered in some acoustic fiddle with Paul Cartwright , so that the Tauron source music would still be connected to the Tauron theme in the score .
For lyrics , we pulled a stanza from a ceremonial Tauron song written for another episode that has yet to air .
The lyrics are actually in Ancient Greek , the language that stands in for Tauron .
I gave Brendan the lyrics and asked him if he could convert them into a gangster rap song .
Not only did he pull it off , but he made a damn catchy hip - hop song , with a uniquely Tauron spin of course .
[ audio : http://www.bearmccreary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/cap103c.mp3|titles=Caprica – Voices of the Dead ]
The song is called “ Voices of the Dead , ” one I ’m very proud to be involved with .
But , Brendan deserves all the credit for shaping my shitty beats and general concept into a kick - ass hip hop tune .
Of course , like “ Caprica Abides ” in the last episode , weeks of work were put into a song that ultimately is only audible on screen for about 30 seconds .
But , its important to me that the full song exists , like the hidden part of an iceberg .
That authenticity makes the world of Caprica more real .
And I imagine there ’s a soundtrack album release that will eventually allow you guys to hear these songs in their entireties .
Rebirth and Reins are both complex episodes that lay the foundation for the first half of the season .
There are even better episodes coming up .
In fact , the show is just getting started .
So Say We All !
Caprica Abides !

Climate experts have been forced to admit another embarrassing error in their most recent report on the threat of climate change .
In a background note – released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) last night – the UN group said its 2007 report wrongly stated that 55 % of the Netherlands lies below sea level .
In fact , only 26 % of the country does .
The figure used by the IPCC included all areas in the country that are prone to flooding , including land along rivers above sea level .
This accounts for 29 % of the Dutch countryside .
" The sea - level statistic was used for background information only , and the updated information remains consistent with the overall conclusions , " the IPCC note states .
Nevertheless , the admission is likely to intensify claims by sceptics that the IPCC work is riddled with sloppiness .
The disclosure will intensify divisions between scientists and sceptics over the interpretation of statistics and the use of sources for writing climate change reports , disagreements that have led to apologies being made by both sides of the debate .
Last week a key climate - change sceptic apologised for alleging that one of the world 's leading meteorologists had deliberately exaggerated the dangers of global warming .
In an email debate in the Observer , Benny Peiser , head of the UK Global Warming Policy Foundation , quoted Sir John Houghton , the UK scientist who played a key role in establishing the IPCC , as saying that " unless we announce disasters , no one will listen " .
But in a letter to the Observer , Houghton said : " The quote from me is without foundation .
I have never said it or written it .
Although it has spread on the internet like wild fire , I do not know its origin .
In fact , I have frequently argued the opposite , namely that those who make such statements are not only wrong but counterproductive . "
Houghton said he was incensed because he believed the quote attributed to him , and to the IPCC , an attitude of hype and exaggeration and demanded an apology from Peiser .
For his part , Peiser told the Observer that he welcomed the clarification .
" For many years , the Houghton ' quote ' has been published in numerous books and articles .
I took Sir John 's failure to challenge it hitherto as a tacit admission that the ' quote ' was accurate and reflected his view on climate policy .
Now that he has publicly disowned the statement , I will certainly refrain from using it . "
Houghton 's " quote " has become one of the most emblematic remarks supposed to have been made by a mainstream scientist about global warming , and appears on almost two million web pages concerned with climate change .
The fact that it now turns out to be fabricated has delighted scientists .
" We do not over - egg the pudding when it comes to the evidence about global warming – and I hope people will now appreciate this point , " said Alan Thorpe , head of the Natural Environment Research Council .
The World from Berlin What Are Google 's Real Motives in China ?
Google this week has announced that it will no longer censor results returned by its Chinese search engine .
The company even said it is willing to turn its back on the country if it has to .
Many are applauding the move , but some German commentators wonder if there is an ulterior motive .
SA Attorney - General Michael Atkinson has changed the rules of democracy in the state , explains Hendrik Gout : you can't make an anonymous political comment on a blog , but you can make an anonymous donation to the ALP .
Here ’s how democracy works in South Australia .
Mid-last year , Attorney - General Michael Atkinson introduced a Bill to change the Electoral Act and the rules governing democracy in South Australia .
Under his proposal , political candidates would n’t be allowed to put up posters on power poles , the cheapest form of political advertising .
This wo n’t bother the Labor Party , cashed - up with anonymous political donations .
Famously asked why the Makris Corporation — developer and shopping centre magnate Con Makris is high on BRW ’s rich list — donated tens of thousands of dollars to political parties , his company ’s chief executive officer had something very interesting to say .
“ We want to make our projects happen , that ’s for sure , but that ’s a part of the way the system — poli­tics — works here , ” Makris CEO John Blunt said .
We ’re not suggesting for a moment that there ’s any connection between the two , but the record shows Makris Corporation projects are subject to political decisions .
The government has approved highly controversial Makris projects like one in North Adelaide even though they do n’t comply with normal planning rules .
Yesterday ’s electoral returns show Makris made substantial donations last financial year to both Liberal and Labor .

Another company , Pallidon Pty Ltd , gifted SA Labor $ 11,000 .
Pallidon is owned by ex-State and Federal Labor MP John Quirke .
Pallidon ’s business ?
Lobbying .
Client ?
Makris Corporation .
The returns also list a donation from Southern Quarries , also for exactly the same amount — $ 11,000 to Labor .
A cross-check of the SA lobbyists register shows a reference to Southern Quarries .
Its lobbyist is John Quirke .
But most political donations in SA are totally secret and anonymous .
“ There is a murky river of gold flowing into political parties that the SA people simply do not know about , ” Greens MLC Mark Parnell said , studying the returns .
“ SA has the worst political donations laws in the nation .
Because of our slack laws millions of dollars are flowing into the Labor and Liberal parties that do not need to be declared .
“ There is the huge gap between the total amount received by parties , and how much has been declared to the Electoral Commission .
In the case of Labor and Liberal , there is over $ 3 million that remains unaccounted for .
“ We simply do not know who has given the money and what they expect in return , ” Mr Parnell said .
Perhaps Makris Corporation can provide some insight .
“ We have got business interests as well , so we want good governance .
We want to see things happen in this state , ” Mr Blunt explained .
The minor parties and independents will be hard hit by the rule against posters on electricity poles ( called Stobie poles in SA , cast in concrete and steel from disused railway tracks ) which are traditionally festooned with election posters as elections approach .
The new law outlaws these posters and forces greater election spending .
The Greens saw red and eventually Atkinson ’s proposal was deferred to kick in after , but not before , the March 20 poll .
The Act also makes it compulsory , the instant electoral writs are issued , for people who send a letter or comment to a newspaper or news site like this one to provide their real name and postcode address .
Professor of politics at Flinders University Dr Dean Jaensch says public servants will be afraid to write to newspapers or websites criticising their Minister , for fear of retribution .
The Attorney - General , meanwhile , refuses to provide his residential address when he writes to newspapers .
His past two Independent Weekly letters to the editor were signed Michael Atkinson , and published below that was the line “ no address provided ” .
Here ’s a story we wrote on the subject two weeks ago :
Good for the goose Like other newspapers , The Independent Weekly requires a residential address ( not for publication ) for people who write Letters to the Editor so we can check the letters are genuine .
In five years , we ’ve made one exception to that rule .
Veterans Affairs Minister Michael Atkinson refused to provide his residential address , possibly because he ’s moved out of his own electorate .
So it was with some puzzlement that we came across an e-mail written by Mr Atkinson to a constituent .
“ If your email was not purely for the purpose of abusing me and you would like a considered response , please supply me with a home address ( a street address , not a P.O. box ) .
The reason I ask email correspondents for a street address is the large number of crank , hoax and abusive emails I get , ” the Minister wrote .
The issue came to prominence when the Attorney would not deny that he ’s moved out of his electorate .
According to Mick Atkinson , the changes to the Act are to provide transparency .
Meanwhile , anonymous donations continue to flow into Labor coffers perfectly legally .
Do n’t talk to us about transparency , Mick .
We can see through that one .
 There is nothing so easy as by sheer volubility to deceive a common crowd or an uneducated congregation .  – St. Jerome ( Epistle to Nepotian , Lii , 8 . )
Would the partisans of Christ have set out deliberately to lie ?
Were they such barefaced charlatans that they concocted falsehoods and deceits merely to advance themselves and their designs ?
By their own admission , YES they were .
They may well have been believers , in that they held to a certain faith .
On this was built the fanaticism either to die , or to kill others , for that faith .
But faith absolves the believer from any fidelity to objective truth .
God 's Truth – Lies
Religious fantasy advances in small steps by which those who already see a higher truth help the less gifted to achieve that sublime state by using various devices .
In Jewish tradition , one such a device was midrash , the teasing out of new , contemporary meanings from antique , sacred texts .
By such means , the scribes could resolve a current issue by interpreting what the scripture had really meant all along .
Was that a lie ?
False accreditation was another much used method , common practice during antiquity .
Most of the texts in both the Hebrew bible and the New Testament were forged in the names of their authors to give them authority .
This merely helped others recognise ' the higher truths ' presented to them .
Who could argue with Solomon , say , or Apostles of the Lord ?
A Labyrinth of Deceit
One of the most inveterate forms of imaginative creation was the invention of sayings and whole speeches which , just as fiction - writers do today , they put entire into the mouths of the personages of whom they were writing .
Thus , in the Gospel of John , chapters 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 and 17 are almost one continuous verbatim monologue  all three thousand six hundred words of it !
 supposedly uttered by the godman , a truly remarkable instance of total recall by the fabled octogenarian author !
The authors of Christianity were fond of allegory and parable .
Few people have a head for pure theology .
Popularising a convoluted point of theology for the unlearned by an illustrative story gets the point across .
What perhaps is missed is that Christian theology is several levels deep : it uses fictional characters to tell fictional stories to make doctrinal points .
Some dogmatists no doubt believed ( still believe ) that one day , long ago , a real whale swallowed a real Jonah .
After all , Jesus supposedly said :
" For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whales belly ; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth . "
– Matthew 12.40 .
The whole point of Jonah was not about Gods ability to conjure up man-swallowing fish ; it was that Yahweh loves even the depraved folk of Nineveh ( and their cattle ) .
The 6th century BC scribe who wrote Jonah used the name of a prophet mentioned in 2 Kings to make a point about the worthiness of evangelising to the heathen .
He has his reluctant hero sail from Joppa and encounter a storm .
Cast overboard somewhere out at sea , the big fish is a literary device to get Jonah back to Joppa , from where , more enthusiastically , he can set out again for the big , bad city of Nineveh .
The theological point could be made simply  our god loves all who repent , dont be reluctant , go and tell it to the heathen  but would that entertain the crowd ?
Simple folk of course would start to take the entertaining story as a literal truth .
Then , several generations later , when the story falls into the hands of the author of Matthew  who may well believe that the Jonah story is true  he has his own fictional Christ figure quote Jonah to give authority to a different theological point :  death can be conquered . 
Deception
Thus by small steps a complex weave of fantasy is woven .
As indeed the Church Fathers cheerfully admit :
" I will only mention the Apostle Paul . ...
He , then , if anyone , ought to be calumniated ; we should speak thus to him :
 The proofs which you have used against the Jews and against other heretics bear a different meaning in their own contexts to that which they bear in your Epistles .
We see passages taken captive by your pen and pressed into service to win you a victory , which in volumes from which they are taken have no controversial bearing at all ... the line so often adopted by strong men in controversy – of justifying the means by the result . "
– St. Jerome , Epistle to Pammachus ( xlviii , 13 ; N&PNF . vi , 72 - 73 )
Was Saint Paul an unabashed liar ?
From this verse in Romans it would appear so :
" For if the truth of God hath more abounded by my lie unto his glory , why yet am I also adjudged a sinner ? " – St. Paul , Romans 3.7 .
However in context Paul is actually censuring other Christians who say " Let us do evil , that good may come " ( that is , from God 's judgement ) .
But like Paul we can " take the passage captive " to make a point .
Luminaries of Deception
Jerome is not alone in his candour .
Bishop Eusebius , the official propagandist for Constantine , entitles the 32nd Chapter of his 12th Book of Evangelical Preparation :
" How it may be Lawful and Fitting to use Falsehood as a Medicine , and for the Benefit of those who Want to be Deceived . "
Eusebius is notoriously the author of a great many falsehoods  but then he does warn us in his infamous history :
" We shall introduce into this history in general only those events which may be useful first to ourselves and afterwards to posterity . "
– Eusebius , Ecclesiastical History , Vol. 8 , chapter 2 .
Clement of Alexandria was one of the earliest of the Church Fathers to draw a distinction between " mere human truth " and the higher truth of faith :
" Not all true things are the truth , nor should that truth which merely seems true according to human opinions be preferred to the true truth , that according to the faith . " – Clement ( quoted by M. Smith , Clement of Alexandria , p446 )
John Chrysostom , 5th century theologian and erstwhile bishop of Constantinople , is another :
" Do you see the advantage of deceit ? ...
For great is the value of deceit , provided it be not introduced with a mischievous intention .
In fact action of this kind ought not to be called deceit , but rather a kind of good management , cleverness and skill , capable of finding out ways where resources fail , and making up for the defects of the mind ...
And often it is necessary to deceive , and to do the greatest benefits by means of this device , whereas he who has gone by a straight course has done great mischief to the person whom he has not deceived . "
– Chrysostom , Treatise On The Priesthood , Book 1 .
' Golden Mouth ' John is notable for his extensive commentaries on the Bible which emphasized a literal understanding of the stories ; the style popular at Alexandria until then was to acknowledge an allegorical meaning of the text .
Thus eminent believers  added falsehood to the beliefs of later generations .
 For the best of reasons  they clarified  obscure points , conjured up characters to speak dialogue that could have been said , invented scenarios that could have happened , borrowed extensively from a wider culture .
And this all before they became the custodians of power and had real reasons for lies , inventions and counterfeits .
As we shall see , gods immutable laws became as flexible as putty .
The 5th and 6th centuries was the ' golden age ' of Christian forgery .
In a moment of shocking candour , the Manichean bishop ( and opponent of Augustine ) Faustus said :
" Many things have been inserted by our ancestors in the speeches of our Lord which , though put forth under his name , agree not with his faith ; especially since  as already it has been often proved  these things were written not by Christ , nor [ by ] his apostles , but a long while after their assumption , by I know not what sort of half Jews , not even agreeing with themselves , who made up their tale out of reports and opinions merely , and yet , fathering the whole upon the names of the apostles of the Lord or on those who were supposed to follow the apostles , they maliciously pretended that they had written their lies and conceits according to them . "
In the ferocious battle for adherents , the propagandists sought to outdo each other at every turn .
One example : by the 5th century , four very different endings existed to Mark 's gospel .
Codex Bobiensis ends Mark at verse 16:8 , without any post - crucifixion appearances ; it lacks both the ' short conclusion ' ( of Jesus sending followers to ' east and west ' ) or the ' long conclusion '  the fabulous post - death apparitions , where Jesus promises his disciples that they will be immune to snake bites and poison .
Once the Church had grabbed mastery of much of Europe and the middle - east , its forgery engine went into overdrive .
' The Church forgery mill did not limit itself to mere writings but for centuries cranked out thousands of phony " relics " of its " Lord , " " Apostles " and " Saints "
There were at least 26 ' authentic ' burial shrouds scattered throughout the abbeys of Europe , of which the Shroud of Turin is just one
At one point , a number of churches claimed the one foreskin of Jesus , and there were enough splinters of the " True Cross " that Calvin said the amount of wood would make " a full load for a good ship . " ' – Acharya S , The Christ Conspiracy .
Ignatius Loyola ( 1491 - 1556 ) , the tireless zealot for papal authority  he was the founder of the Society of Jesus ( the Jesuits )  even wrote :
" We should always be disposed to believe that which appears to us to be white is really black , if the hierarchy of the church so decides . "
The Reformation may have swept away some abuses perpetrated by the priesthood but lying was not one of them .
Martin Luther , in private correspondence , argued :
" What harm would it do , if a man told a good strong lie for the sake of the good and for the Christian church ... a lie out of necessity , a useful lie , a helpful lie , such lies would not be against God , he would accept them . "
– Martin Luther ( Cited by his secretary , in a letter in Max Lenz , ed. , Briefwechsel Landgraf Phillips des Grossmüthigen von Hessen mit Bucer , vol . I. )
The Forgery Mill
Notable Christian forgeries include :
The Donation of Constantine  ' Without doubt a forgery ...'
Catholic Encyclopedia
A two - part document purporting to be from the first Christian emperor to Pope Sylvester I ( 314-35 ) .
In the ' Confessio ' Constantine thanks Sylvester for his Christian instruction and baptism ( and consequent cure of leprosy ! )
In his ' Donatio ' Constantine confers on the pope and his successors primacy over all other bishops , including the eastern patriarchs , senatorial privileges for the clergy , imperial palaces and regalia , Rome itself and the western empire !!
In truth , this monstrous 8th century forgery ( peppered with anachronisms ) was almost certainly written by the future Pope Paul I ( 757-67 ) while his equally ambitious brother Stephen II ( 752 - 57 ) sat on the papal throne .
The False Decretals ( aka Pseudo - Isidorian Forgeries ) 
A riot of more than a hundred fake letters and decrees attributed to pontiffs from 1st century Clement ( 88 - 97 ) to 7th century Gregory I ( 590-604 ) .
Now attributed either to ' Isodore Mercator ' , a supposed 9th century master forger and papal aide , or to a group of Gallic forgers trading on the name and reputation of Isodore of Seville .
Like the Donation , the Decretals conferred rights and privileges on the papacy .
A similar collection , the ' Dionysiana ' , was named for a 6th century monk ' Dennis the Little ' ( Dionysius Exiguus ) , inventor of the BC - AD dating system .
Dionysius provided the papacy with Latin translation of the canons the Eastern Church .
This ripe collection included fifty canons from the very Apostles themselves .
' Thundering Legion ' Decree of Marcus Aurelius 
In this fabricated letter from the emperor to the Senate , Marcus is said to have forbidden persecution of Christians because , in a battle with the Quadi in 174 , prayers from Christian soldiers brought on a thunderstorm which rescued the Romans from thirst and dispersed the barbarian opponents .
The emperor is said to have accorded the Twelfth Legion the suffix fulminata or fulminea , that is , ' thundering . '
Tertullian ( c.160 - c.230 ) , north African theologian , made up this nonsense ; the twelfth legion had had the suffix legio fulminata from the time of Augustus .
The stoic Marcus Aurelius had nothing but contempt for the Christians .
' Letters ' of Emperor Antoninus Pius to the Greeks 
More fakery , this time from the pen of 4th century Bishop Eusebius ( Ecclesiastic History , IV , 13 ) .
He has the pious 2nd century pagan forbid ' tumults against the Christians . '
The Clementines 
These fancies , twenty books of ' curious religious romance ' ( Catholic Encyclopedia ) , masquerade as the work of 1st century pontiff Clement I. Written in the 4th century , their purpose was to bolster Rome 's claim to be the primary see : here we have the ' Epistle of Clement to James ' which originated the notion that St. Peter was the first Bishop of Rome .
Correspondence between Seneca and Paul - a 4th century invention of 1st century letters .
They alluded to fires in Rome and to the persecution of Jews and Christians .
Acts of Paul and Thecla – " Love for Paul " was the justification for this particular compendium of fable .
None other than Tertullian condemned his rival 's handiwork .
" If those who read the writing that falsely bears the name of Paul adduce the example of Thecla to maintain the right of women to teach and to baptize , let them know that the presbyter in Asia who produced this document , as if he could of himself add anything to the prestige of Paul , was removed from his office after he had been convicted and had confessed that he did it out of love for Paul . "
– Tertullian , De batismo , 17 .
' Testimonium Flavianum ' -
The infamous ' passing reference ' to Jesus Christ supposedly written by the 1st century Jewish historian Josephus ( he adopted the family name of the imperial house ) .
We know in graphic detail the course of the first Jewish War because  remarkably  the history recorded by Josephus somehow survived .
Whereas whole libraries of antiquity were torched by the Christians , curiously , this testimony of a Jew made it through the centuries .
A subsequent work by Josephus , The Antiquity of the Jews , which iterated and extended his story of the ' chosen people ' also survived .
The survival of these two overlapping works was no coincidence because they rather too well ' confirm ' from a ' non-Christian source ' the existence of the godman .
In short , sometime in the 4 th century , while most else of ancient scholarship was being thrown into bonfires , a Christian scribe  probably Eusebius , Bishop of Caesarea ' rescued ' the histories of Josephus and ' doctored ' them to provide convenient ' proof ' that Christ had been flesh - and - blood and was neither a fiction ( as pagan critics maintained ) nor solely a spiritual being , as gnostics reasoned .
( See full discussion : The authentic pen of lying Christian scribes ! )
Mother of All Fakes The Shroud of Turin Modern science signalled the decline in the wholesale manufacture of Christian forgeries .
The freethinker Leonardo da Vinci had the last laugh on the Church when he put his own face on a fake so clever that it remained ' authentic ' for five hundred years !
Shrouded in Deceit
The Chronicle of Sulpicius Severus - a 5th century disciple of Bishop Martin of Tours invented the lurid story of the Neronian persecution .
The Jewish historian Josephus says nothing about any " persecution " under Nero , though he is not slow to describe him as " acting like a madman " who " slew his brother , and wife , and mother , from whom his barbarity spread itself to others that were most nearly related to him ; and how , at last , he was so distracted that he became an actor in the scenes , and upon the theater . "
( Wars , 13.1 )
If a bonfire of Christians had actually happened Josephus would have mentioned it  but he does not , and nor does any early Christian writer .
" In reality , the Neronian persecution never occurred .
It is a fiction of the Church , invented for its greater glory . "
– Arthur Drews , The Legend of St Peter , p63 .
Chapter 16 of Life of Nero by Suetonius .
This is the origin of the ' Christians burnt as torches ' nonsense .
The Lentulus Letter For this pious fancy the forger created a fictitious predecessor to Pontius Pilate , governor of Judaea , calling him " Publius Lentulus " .
The forger has his creation write to the Roman Senate , reporting Christ 's " raising of the dead " .
He describes Jesus as " the most beautiful of the sons of men . "
The letter was first printed in the " Life of Christ " by Ludolph the Carthusian ( Cologne , 1474 ) .
It was probably composed in 13th / 14th century , based on an earlier Greek forgery .
Report of Pilate to Caesar  Pilate 's conversion to Christianity  and even the debauched Emperor Tiberius a closet - Christian !
Another gem from the pen of Tertullian !
 All these things Pilate did to Christ ; and now in fact a Christian in his own convictions , he sent word of Him to the reigning Caesar , who was at the time Tiberius .
Yes , and even the Caesars would have believed on Christ , if either the Caesars had not been necessary for the world , or if Christians could have been Caesars . 
– Tertullian Apol. xxi and Anti-Nicene Fathers , iii , 35 .
Letter of Jesus to the King of Edessa
Nothing less than the handwritten note of the godman himself !
This fabrication was supposedly delivered by the apostle Thaddeus , together with a self - portrait by the artist  Jesus Christ ( he wiped his face with the canvass ) !
Actually , the text is borrowed from the ' concordance ' of Tatian , compiled in the 2nd century , and known as the ' Diatessaron ' .
The forgery is almost certainly the work of Eusebius , Christian propagandist of the 4th century .
He was the first to mention the letter and claimed to have personally ' translated ' it from Syriac ( Ecclesiastical History I , xii ) .
The Virgin Birth Fraud
The most colossal blunder of the Septuagint translators , the mistranslation of the original Hebrew text of Isaiah , 7.14 , allowed deceitful early Christians to concoct their infamous prophecy that somehow the ancient Jewish text presaged the miraculous birth of their own godman .
The Hebrew original says :
' Hinneh ha - almah harah ve-yeldeth ben ve-karath shem - o immanuel . '
Honestly translated , the verse reads :
' Behold , the young woman has conceived  and bears a son and calls his name Immanuel . '
The Greek - speaking translators of Hebrew scripture ( in 3rd century B.C. Alexandria ) slipped up and translated ' almah ' ( young woman ) into the Greek ' parthenos ' ( virgin ) .
The Hebrew word for virgin would have been ' betulah . '
The slip did not matter at the time , for in context , Isaiahs prophe
c
y  set in the 8th century BC but probably written in the 5th  had been given as reassurance to King Ahaz of Judah that his royal line would survive , despite the ongoing siege of Jerusalem by the Syrians .
And it did .
In other words , the prophe
c
y had nothing to do with events in Judaea eight hundred years into the future !
Justin  Martyr , a pagan Greek from Palestine , fled to Ephesus at the time of Bar Kochbars revolt ( 132 - 135 AD ) .
He joined the growing Christian community and found himself competing with the priests of Artemis , an eternally virgin goddess .
Justin successfully overcame the sentiments of established Christians and had Mary , mother of Jesus , declared a virgin , citing his Greek copy of Isaiah as ' evidence ' of scriptural prescience .
The Greek priest who then forged the ' Gospel according to St. Matthew ' went one stage further , taking the word ' harah '  in Hebrew a past or perfect tense  and switched it into a future tense to arrive at :
' Behold , a virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son , and they shall call his name Emmanuel . '
– Matthew 1.23 .
All this to arrive at the monstrous fiction that ancient scripture foretold of the arrival of an infant actually called Jesus !
Still Lying in 21st century
The Pope has chosen to canonise Juan Diego , supposedly a sixteenth century Mexican Indian who had the good fortune to have the Blessed Virgin ( in the guise of ' Our Lady of Guadeloupe ' ) impress her own image onto his cloak .
Not surprisingly , Diego was a paragon of Catholic devotion , completely submissive to Spanish colonial authorities .
Mind you , the story only surfaced a century after its alleged occurrence , at the height of the campaign to eradicate indigenous religions .
Commented David Brading , Professor of Mexican History at Cambridge University :
' When the Pope canonises Juan Diego , he will have elevated to sainthood the hero of a religious work of fiction . ' – The Times , 31 June 2002 .
Continued The Times :
' An interview with the man given the task in 1947 of restoring Diego 's cloak , on which an image of the Virgin appeared , revealed this week that the image was not a miracle .
Instead , he said , it had been painted on . '
Whether we look at the Middle Ages and the Reformation , the first centuries of the Christian era or even today , Christianity has always been a fabrication , layer set upon layer of lies and nonsense , a fraud from its very inception .

New Xdebug browser extensions
London , UK
Years ago I wrote about a Firefox extension that allows you to start an Xdebug debugging session by clicking on an icon in Firefox ' status bar .
For some unexplained reason , this extension is no longer available through Firefox ' addon - site .
Although I have a copy at http://xdebug.org/files/xdebug_helper-0.3.1-fx.xpi for archival purposes , there are now a few other browser extensions that do the same thing .
easy Xdebug
easy Xdebug is an extension that serves as a replacement for the now unavailable Xdebug helper extension .
It 's written by Brecht Vanhaesebrouck of eLime .
The extension was originally tested with Netbeans but it also seems to work fine with Komodo .
Xdebug enabler
Xdebug enabler is an extension for Google 's Chrome browser .
It " allows you to enable and disable triggering Xdebug from with in Chrome .
Useful if you are a web developer using an IDE that supports Xdebug like Eclipse with PDT . "
It 's written by ' remailednet ' and available through the Google Chrome Extensions website .
JavaScript ' enabler '
I also ran across a blog post by ' Caleb G ' from HigherVisibility .
Instead of making an extension for a specific browser , he outlines two JavaScript bookmarklets that allow you to start and stop an Xdebug debugging session .
Update : The " Xdebug enabler " Chrome Extension seems to have some issues .
There is now also an alternative Chrome Extension called Xdebug helper that integrates quite a bit better .
You can find it at its Google Chrome Extension page .

by Anthony Watts
WUWT readers of course have heard about the Met Office and their giant new supercomputer called “ deep black ” that they use for climate simulation and short term forecasts .
Not to be outdone , the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) in Boulder , CO has commissioned a new supercomputer project of their own :
The NCAR - Wyoming Supercomputing Center ( NWSC ) shown in artist rendering below .
In the initial press release they state the location and purpose :
January 23 , 2007 BOULDER — The National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) and its managing organization , the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ( UCAR ) , announced today that they will form a partnership with the University of Wyoming , the State of Wyoming , and the University of Colorado at Boulder to build a new supercomputing data center for scientific research in Cheyenne .
The center will house some of the world ’s most powerful supercomputers in order to advance understanding of climate , weather , and other Earth and atmospheric processes . …
The center ’s supercomputers , which will be upgraded regularly , will initially achieve speeds of hundreds of teraflops ( trillion floating - point operations per second ) .
The Met Office wrote in their initial press release :
By 2011 , the total system is anticipated to have a total peak performance approaching 1 PetaFlop — equivalent to over 100,000 PCs and over 30 times more powerful than what is in place today .
We found out later that the Met Office supercomputer would have an electrical power consumption of 1.2 megawatts .
So with that it mind , we ’d expect the new NCAR - Wyoming Supercomputing Center ( NWSC ) to have some similar sort of power consumption .
Right ?
On the masthead of the NWSC page they say they are all about energy efficiency .
The NWSC project encompasses the design and construction of a world class center for high performance scientific computing in the atmospheric and related geosciences .
Consistent with its mission , the facility will be a leader in energy efficiency , incorporating the newest and most efficient designs and technologies available .
The center will provide new space to enable the advancement of scientific knowledge , education , and service through high - performance computing .
And on the right sidebar :
Focus on Sustainability Maximum energy efficiency , LEED certification , and achievement of the smallest possible carbon footprint are all goals of the NWSC project .
In the coming weeks and months , check this section of the site for updates on project sustainability efforts and outcomes .
That ’s great , I ’m all for sustainability and energy efficiency , even the “ smallest possible carbon footprint ” does n’t sound too bad .
Surely it will be more energy efficient and “ greener ” than the Met Office Supercomputer , right ?
There ’s an interesting unanswered question though .
Why put this new facility in Wyoming rather than “ green ” Colorado ?
Is n’t Boulder , where NCAR is headquartered , the greenest of Colorado cities , and in the US top five too ?
In the initial press release announcing the project , there ’s this bit of political feel good prose :
“ Having an NCAR supercomputing facility in Wyoming will be transformative for the University of Wyoming , will represent a significant step forward in the state ’s economic development , and will provide exceptional opportunities for NCAR to make positive contributions to the educational infrastructure of an entire state , ” says William Gern , the university ’s vice president for research and economic development .
Gosh , what an opportunity for Wyoming .
But why give the opportunity away ?
Colorado does n’t want this opportunity ?
None of the politicians in Colorado want to be able to say to their constituents that they brought “ economic development ” and “ positive contributions to the educational infrastructure of an entire state ” ?
That does n’t seem right .
The answer may very well lie in economics , but not the kind they mention in feel good press releases .
You see as we know from supercomputers , they need a lot of energy to operate .
And because they operate in enclosed spaces , a lot of energy to keep them cooled so they do n’t burn up from the waste heat they generate .
For all their sophistication , without power for operation and cooling , a supercomputer is just dead weight and space .
Electricity is king .
Interestingly , in the press releases and web pages , NCAR provides no answers ( at least none that were easy to find ) to how much electricity the new supercomputer might use for operation and cooling .
They also provide no explanation as to why Colorado let this opportunity go to another state .
I had to dig into NCAR ’s interoffice staff notes to find the answer .
The answer is : electricity .
Measuring 108,000 square feet in total with 15,000 - 20,000 square feet of raised floor , it will be built for 8 megawatts of power , with 4 - 5 megawatts for computing and 3 - 4 for cooling .
8 megawatts !
Yowza .
It ’s really about economics .
Electricity is getting expensive , and likely to be more expensive in the future .
Candidate Obama said that under his leadership , “ electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket “ .
Clearly NCAR is planning for a more expensive energy future .
In the interoffice staff notes , NCAR outlines its decision logic .
NCAR considered partnerships for the data center with a number of organizations along the Front Range , giving CU - Boulder and the University of Wyoming particularly close scrutiny .
NCAR also looked into leasing space and retrofitting an existing data center .
With support from NSF and the UCAR Board of Trustees , NCAR chose to locate the center in Wyoming after a rigorous evaluation , concluding that this partnership would facilitate getting the greatest computing capability for the regional and national scientific community at the earliest possible time .
“ The Wyoming offer provides more computing power , sooner , and at lower cost , ” Tim explained during an all - staff town hall meeting on January 31 .
“ We ’ve secured the future of NCAR ’s role in leadership computing . ”
The Wyoming offer consists of a 24 - acre “ shovel - ready ” site for construction in the North Range Business Park in Cheyenne near the intersection of I - 80 and I - 25 , along with physical infra- structure for fiber optics and guaranteed power transmission of 24 megawatts .
The University of Wyoming will provide $ 20 million in endowment funds for construction , as well as $ 1 million annually for operations .
NCAR will utilize the State of Wyoming ’s bond program to fund construction , with the state treasurer purchasing bonds that will be paid off by NCAR .
Although CU - Boulder ’s offer would have given the new center greater proximity to other NCAR facilities , it would have left NCAR with a mortgage of $ 50 million rather than $ 40 million and less long - term financial savings .
The Cheyenne site offers cheaper construction costs and lends itself to future expansion .
It also brings a transformative partnership to a state that has traditionally lacked opportunities in technology and research .
Indeed according to the latest figures from the Energy Information Adminsitration and Department of Energy ( EIA / DOE ) electricity is significantly cheaper in Wyoming .
So besides the fact that NCAR abandoned “ green ” Colorado for it ’s cheaper electricity rates and bond program , what ’s the “ dirty little secret ?
Coal , the “ dirtiest of fuels ” , some say .
According to Sourcewatch , Wyoming is quite something when it comes to coal .
Emphasis mine .
Wyoming is the nation ’s highest coal producer , with over 400 million tons of coal produced in the state each year .
In 2006 , Wyoming ’s coal production accounted for almost 40 % of the nation ’s coal .
[ 1 ]
Currently Wyoming coal comes from four of the State ’s ten major coal fields .
The Powder River Coal Field has the largest production in the world – in 2007 , it produced over 436 million short tons .
[ 2 ]
Wyoming coal is shipped to 35 other states .
The coal is highly desirable because of its low sulfur levels .
[ 3 ]
On average Wyoming coal contains 0.35 percent sulfur by weight , compared with 1.59 percent for Kentucky coal and 3 to 5 percent for other eastern coals .
Although Wyoming coal may have less sulfur , it also a lower “ heat rate ” or fewer Btu ’s of energy .
On average Wyoming coal has 8600 Btu’s of energy per pound , while Eastern coal has heat rates of over 12,000 Btu ’s per pound , meaning that plants have to burn 50 percent more Wyoming coal to equal the power output from Eastern coal . [ 4 ]
Coal - fired power plants produce almost 95 % of the electricity generated in Wyoming .
Wyoming ’s average retail price of electricity is 5.27 cents per kilowatt hour , the 2nd lowest rate in the nation [ 5 ]
It ’s so bad , that Wyoming ’s coal plants earned the coveted “ Coal Swarm ” badge on that page .
Gosh .
But not to worry , NCAR has a plan to “ clean up ” that dirty coal use to power their supercomputer climate modeling system .
Again from the interoffice staff notes
The new center will be the first NCAR facility to earn LEED ( Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ) certification for its design , construction , and operation .
Measuring 108,000 square feet in total with 15,000 - 20,000 square feet of raised floor , it will be built for 8 megawatts of power , with 4 - 5 megawatts for computing and 3 - 4 for cooling .
The power will be generated primarily from “ clean ” coal ( coal that has been chemically scrubbed to reduce emissions of harmful pollutants ) via Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power .
NCAR is also aggressively working to secure the provision of alternative energy ( wind and solar ) for the facility , hoping to attain an initial level of 10 % .
“ We ’re going to push for environmentally friendly solutions , ” Tim says .
Clean Coal ?
Hmmm . NASA GISS ’ Dr. Jim Hansen says Clean Coal is a decade away :
James Hansen , one of the world ’s best - known global warming researchers and a recent vocal advocate of proposed coal plants , says clean coal technology used on a full - scale coal - fired plant could be at least a decade away .
He expressed the sentiment in a media briefing organized by clean energy group RE - AMP , arguing against a proposed coal plant in Marshalltown , Iowa .
Hansen also said that :
“ The trains carrying coal to power plants are death trains .
Coal - fired power plants are factories of death .
When I testified against the proposed Kingsnorth power plant , I estimated that in its lifetime it would be responsible for the extermination of about 400 species – its proportionate contribution to the number that would be committed to extinction if carbon dioxide rose another 100 ppm . ”
Do n’t worry , the University of Wyoming in Cheyenne , where the new NCAR supercomputing center will be , is already on top of the situation .
This is from their press release May 26th , 2008 :
The University of Wyoming is ready to research clean coal and wants proposals from both academic and industry organizations .
With the help of the Wyoming state government , they ’ve arranged for up to $ 4.5 million in research funds — which can be matched by non-state funds .
And , Wyoming already has their hand out to Presdient Obama :
From CBS in Denver :
Colorado , Utah , Wyoming Seek Clean Coal Funding DENVER ( AP ) ―
The governors of Colorado , Utah and Wyoming are asking President Barack Obama to fund the development of clean - coal technologies in the West .
Yup , clean coal will power that new NCAR supercomputer any day now , and we ’ll be paying for it .
In the meantime :
I ’m sure NCAR will let us know how those wind turbines work out for that other 10 % of the power .

What will the next decade bring for the world ?
STRATFOR has the answers .
In a Decade Forecast released yesterday , the global intelligence company predicts Chinese economic collapse , game - changing global labor shortages , and continued American dominance because of a gradual retreat from international engagement .
Welcome to 2010 .
SEE ALL OF STRATFOR'S 2020 CALLS HERE >>>
We spoke with Peter Zeihan , Vice President of Strategic Intelligence , about STRATFOR 's predictions , of which he was an author .
Below are edited excerpts from our conversation .
TBI : What are the broad trends that Stratfor sees shaping the world in the next decade ?
Zeihan : Probably one of the biggest breaks that Stratfor has with conventional wisdom is that most of the world is convinced that the United States is a power in terminal decline .
In fact we see the United States withdrawing from its two wars , regardless of whether or not they 've ended , and returning to a more balanced attention span in dealing with the rest of the world .
Most of the rest of the world will view that as an American retreat from prominence and a sign that the U.S. is in decline once again .
But really when you 're a naval power and a merchant power , being out of the Middle East is increasing greatly your power to act and you willingness to act .
So we see it as a very American - centric decade moving forward .
Which predictions are most surprising ?
Aside from the United States not going anywhere , I would say we expect the economic collapse of China in this coming decade .
We 've been talking for awhile about how the economic system there is remarkably unstable and we think that they 're going to reach a break point as all of the internal inconsistencies come to light and shatter .
By the end of the decade , it 'll be pretty obvious to everybody that the China miracle is over .
As we enter the decade , people are finally , finally starting to talk about China bubbles .
If only their problem was that simple !
With the Europeans , the new European treaty actually matters .
The Lisbon Treaty is the first of dozens of treaties that the EU has done , but it 's the first one that actually does away with most of the single member vetoes ; and so you 've got Germany actually able to force its will upon a lot of states .
Germany is going to be ascendant in a manner that it has not been since the late 1930s !
Does n't mean it 's going to be rolling tanks into Poland or anything like that , but they are going to be using their institutional power to push everybody around .
That is going to cause a remarkable degree of discord and unpredictability in Europe , and that is something that the Russians are going to take advantage of every chance that they get .
The Russians realize that they 're in a race against the clock before their demographics kill them as a country , and so they want to make sure that they 've got as wide of a buffer as possible .
As long as Europe is at each others throats , even if its just with bureaucratic paper , the Russians are going to take advantage of that to strengthen their western perimeter and push the frontier into Europe as far as they can .
They know in 20 or 30 years they 're not going to be able to do much , so they want to buy as much time and space as possible .
What does the American business community need to pay closest attention to ?
The business community is probably going to get its shirt handed to it over China .
Now American investment into China is not nearly as robust as most people think .
It 's actually only five or six billion dollars every year , very , very small in the grand scheme of things , even by Chinese standards .
But the ability of China to continue to supply cheap exports to the United States might come into danger .
Not on the whole , because all of the Chinese regional cities will still have an interest in doing that , even once the Chinese system cracks .
But you 're going to have to pay very close attention to your supply chain there as the politics of China become unglued .
Japan -- also a major investor in a lot of places , also a major supplier of a lot technology and a lot of capital -- Japan 's demographics are the worst in the world .
In the next decade , they 're going to have to find some way to rectify the fact that they just do n't have sufficient number of workers to supply what they need .
They could turn to their traditional surplus labor source , which is Korea and China , in which case we could have some sort of East Asian conflict , perhaps even military in nature .
You have the world 's second or third largest economies starting to duke it out in some manner , and businessmen in America are going to take notice .
Or at least they 'd better .
In a broader demographic issue , all of the countries in the developed world and most of them in the developing world are aging .
We 're going to be seeing a lot of countries maybe not start to have their populations decline but certainly have them age and no longer grow .
The core economic platform that has driven the human condition for the last millennia is that populations will continue to get larger , markets will continue to get larger , there will be more capital available .
In this next decade that starts to invert .
The cost of capital is going to go up , the availability of markets are going to go up , and that 's ultimately a deflationary environment .
It 'll get worse in future decades , but this next decade is when the rules of the game start to change .
It 's not always about high - tech .
Sometimes it 's the simplest of things that make our lives better and less painful .
Like pot holders which keep our delicate fingers from getting burnt as we giggle over cheesy puns .

WHEN Yitta Schwartz died last month at 93 , she left behind 15 children , more than 200 grandchildren and so many great - and great - great - grandchildren that , by her family ’s count , she could claim perhaps 2,000 living descendants .
Mrs. Schwartz was a member of the Satmar Hasidic sect , whose couples have nine children on average and whose ranks of descendants can multiply exponentially .
But even among Satmars , the size of Mrs. Schwartz ’s family is astonishing .
A round - faced woman with a high - voltage smile , she may have generated one of the largest clans of any survivor of the Holocaust — a thumb in the eye of the Nazis .
Her descendants range in age from a 75 - year - old daughter named Shaindel to a great - great - granddaughter born Feb. 10 named Yitta in honor of Mrs. Schwartz and a great - great - grandson born Feb. 15 who was named Moshe at his circumcision on Monday .
Their numbers include rabbis , teachers , merchants , plumbers and truck drivers .
But these many apples have not fallen far from the tree :
With a few exceptions , like one grandson who lives in England , they mostly live in local Satmar communities , like Williamsburg in Brooklyn and Kiryas Joel , near Monroe , N.Y. , where Mrs. Schwartz lived for the last 30 years of her life .
Mrs. Schwartz had a zest for life and a devotion to Hasidic rituals , faithfully attending the circumcisions , first haircuts , bar mitzvahs , engagements and weddings of her descendants .
With 2,000 people in the family , such events occupied much of the year .
China 's education ministry has ordered colleges to cut ties with Oxfam and prevent it from recruiting on campuses , accusing its Hong Kong branch of a hidden political agenda .
While Beijing is often anxious about NGOs , the British - founded agency has been working on the mainland for more than two decades in co-operation with the government .
It is unclear what prompted the surprise decision .
A notice attributed to the education ministry said the Hong Kong branch of Oxfam , which oversees operations on the mainland , was a " non-governmental organisation seeking to infiltrate " the mainland .
It described the group 's head as a " stalwart of the opposition faction " , according to the South China Morning Post , which saw the notice on a website run by Minzu University in Beijing .
The notice , dated 4 February , also said : " All education departments and institutions of higher education must raise their guard and together recognise and take precautions against the unfriendly intentions of Oxfam Hong Kong 's recruitment of college volunteers . "
The notice has since been removed .
The newspaper said two other university websites carried what appeared to be summaries of the notice .
The Post added that the chairman of Oxfam Hong Kong , Lo Chi-kin , was a member of the territory 's Democratic party , which advocates reforms including direct elections for the legislature .
Matthew Granger , a spokesman for Oxfam International , said : " We have had no notification from the ministry of education or officials of any problem .
We have suspended the programme while we try to clarify whether there is a problem . "
The notice appears to refer to an internship programme started in 2006 that has placed 40 students working at NGOs into sectors such as supporting migrant workers .
Charlotte Kong , communications manager of Oxfam Hong Kong , said the project was part of its broader attempts to contribute to the development of civil society .
Kong said in a statement : " We believe it is in line with the central government 's policies encouraging more students to enter the field of social work .
In the past four years we never received any warning that this programme was sensitive .
" With the economy growing fast and society becoming more advanced , we are sure NGOs and civil societies are becoming an important contributor to China 's development . "
The organisation said the personal politics of Oxfam Hong Kong 's board members and employees had no influence on its work .
Oxfam has five offices on the mainland and its work has ranged from education projects and advocacy on climate change to helping communities in Sichuan province recover from the 2008 earthquake .
Although some officials have sought to encourage the development of NGOs and welcomed their potential to complement the work of the state , Beijing remains wary of the country 's emerging civil society and its potential to challenge the government .
Domestic groups often register themselves as companies because of the difficulties in establishing themselves legally .
Foreign organisations also operate under tight restrictions .
But Oxfam would not have been able to run the scheme for four years without some kind of agreement with officials .
New York
Times history lesson on civilian control of the military :
Why now ?
By Tom Eley
17 February 2010
On Monday the New York Times ran a column on the historical origins of civilian control of the military .
Contributing author John R. Miller — a fellow at the conservative Discovery Institute — attributed it to a speech George Washington , then commanding the American armies in the Revolutionary War , gave in 1783 to officers disgruntled over lack of pay .
Reading a letter from a congressman to 500 near - mutinous officers gathered in Newburgh , New York , Washington put on spectacles and said , “ Gentlemen , you must pardon me , for I have grown not only gray but blind in the service of my country . ”
The officers were moved , and a military revolt against the young government was averted , according to Miller .
Why did the Times run a column on the subject now ?
For whom was this history lesson intended ?
For most of US history , the principle of military subordination to elected government has been accepted without comment — except in the two instances where its assertion was the most controversial : Abraham Lincoln ’s sacking of General George McClellan in the Civil War , and Harry Truman ’s dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur during the Korean War .
Especially noteworthy are the column ’s opening and closing passages , which clearly refer to the present .
“ Civilian control of the military is a cherished principle in American government , ” Miller writes .
“ It was President Obama who decided to increase our involvement in Afghanistan , and it is Congress that will decide whether to appropriate the money to carry out his decision .
It is the president and Congress , not the military , that will decide whether our laws should be changed to allow gays and lesbians to serve in our armed forces .
The military advises , but the civilian leadership decides . ”
Having told the story of Washington at Newburgh , Miller begins his last paragraph with a stark warning : “ But powerful armies often make their own rules , and many nations have succumbed to military control despite strong constitutions . ”
The Times ’ decision to run this comment must be seen in light of the growing power of the military - intelligence apparatus and its increasingly open role in US political life .
This power has grown immeasurably since 1961 , when President Dwight Eisenhower warned of the threat to democracy posed by the “ military - industrial complex ” whose “ total influence , ” even then , was “ felt in every city , every Statehouse , every office of the Federal government . ”
Evidence of the growing power and impunity of the military and spy agencies abounds :
• January 27 Congressional testimony from State Department Under Secretary Patrick Kennedy implied that the Flight 253 bomber , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , boarded his Christmas Day flight from Amsterdam to Detroit with the complicity of one or more US intelligence agencies .
It has also been revealed that US spy agencies had Abdulmutallab ’s name , knowledge that an attack organized in Yemen was likely to take place on December 25 , and warnings from British intelligence and even the young man ’s own father .
No one in any US spy agency has been held accountable for what , according to the official version of events , is an inexplicable breakdown of the most expensive and expansive intelligence system in the world ; Kennedy ’s revelations have been subjected to a media blackout .
A more plausible explanation is that powerful elements inside the state thought an attack , failed or otherwise , might be used to destabilize the US government .
[ “ Why the media silence on the Flight 253 bombing hearings ? ” ]
• In the months leading up to his announced surge in Afghanistan , sources within the US military close to generals Stanley McChrystal , US commander in Afghanistan , and David Petraeus , head of the US Central Command , maintained a steady stream of leaks in a frankly acknowledged bid to shift US policy on Afghanistan .
McChrystal openly campaigned for an expansion of forces close to what Obama eventually ordered — a campaign supported by prominent members of the Republican Party .
• Last year , after the court - ordered release of Bush Justice Department memos that created a pseudolegal rationale for torture of “ terror suspects ” prompted widespread calls for investigations , former Vice President Dick Cheney mounted a public attack on the Obama administration .
Since then , intelligence agencies and the military have , through press leaks and statements from allied political figures like Cheney , mounted a full - throated defense of torture and other antidemocratic aspects of the “ war on terror . ”
• In July 2009 , it came to light that House and Senate intelligence committees were kept in the dark for eight years about a “ secret counter - terrorism program ” overseen by Cheney .
Obama ’s Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) director , Leon Panetta , only learned of the program months after taking control of the CIA .
The Los Angeles Times reported that the program “ went beyond the widely publicized warrantless wiretapping program ... encompassing additional secretive activities that created ‘ unprecedented ’ spying powers . ”
• On April 27 , 2009 , one of two Air Force One planes — the Boeing 747s used by the US president — flew at low altitude over New York City escorted by fighter jets .
Officials absurdly claimed the operation was necessary to get a picture of Air Force One against the backdrop of the Statue of Liberty .
The flight , which provoked panic in Manhattan , took place without the knowledge of Obama or New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg .
[ “ What happened in the skies over New York City ? ” ]
• After his inauguration , Obama left largely untouched the US military command and high - ranking personnel in the main spy agencies , while promoting generals to top civilian positions and maintaining Bush ’s defense Secretary , Robert Gates , in the same position .
Done in the name of “ continuity , ” these personnel decisions illustrated Obama ’s contempt for the popular hostility to the Bush administration ’s war policies that underlay his election .
• In September 2007 it was revealed that a nuclear - armed B - 52 bomber had flown over the US without authorization .
• After the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington D.C. , Cheney initiated and headed a program called “ Continuity of Government ” that created a secret government in an “ undisclosed , secure location , ” where he subsequently spent much of his time .
The shadow government was drawn entirely from the executive branch , the military , and spy agencies .
Elected members of Congress were not included and were unaware of its creation .
Whether or not the shadow government has been disbanded is unclear .
• There remains no credible explanation for the 9/11 attacks .
As in the Flight 253 bomb plot , not a single member of the US intelligence agencies ostensibly responsible for protecting the American people has been held accountable for what is , if the official version of events is accepted , the greatest domestic security failure in US history — an event seized upon to launch the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq , and unprecedented attacks on basic democratic rights .
• In the disputed 2000 presidential election , which the Supreme Court handed to George W. Bush by ordering a halt to ballot counting in Florida , Al Gore conceded defeat amid fears of opposition from the military , which the Republican Party openly courted during the struggle over election results .
A source close to Gore said he “ got very stuck on the notion that if he became president it was not in the national interest that he have a relationship characterized by his mistrust of the military . ”
Commenting on these and similar comments attributed to Gore , the World Socialist Web Site noted “ they amount to the acceptance of a military veto over the outcome of a national election and the occupant of the White House .
The subordination of the military to civilian rule is a cardinal principle of the US Constitution .
The fact that this cornerstone of democracy has become so eroded is a stark indication of the decay of bourgeois democratic institutions in the US . ”
[ “ New York Times documents military role in theft of 2000 election ” ]
This list , which could be much longer , is the context in which the Times ’ history lesson on civilian control of the military appears .
In fact , Monday ’s column is the newspaper ’s second reference in recent weeks to fears of the dangers posed to civilian rule by the military and intelligence agencies .
The first was more oblique .
A January 23 article , “ Gates Sees Fallout From Troubled Ties With Pakistan , ” covered a recent trip to Pakistan by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and concluded with the following line : “ His final message delivered , he relaxed on the 14 - hour trip home by watching ‘ Seven Days in May , ’ the Cold War-era film about an attempted military coup in the United States . ”
Given the growing assertiveness and impunity of the security apparatus , it seems unlikely that the decision to disclose this piece of information was gratuitous .

My wife and I have never been big couponers .
Is that even a word ?
No matter .
I certainly do n’t have the patience to try and match what we are buying to coupons and then figure out what we could make based on those choices .
I know there are volumes of sites devoted to that exact art , Coupon Mom comes to mind .
But a reader sent in his new venture which is a site called FlyerSide that takes most of the work out of getting the best deals .
Enter your zip code and you ’ll see a list of stores in your area .
I was very surprised to see the 3 biggest in my area show up .
They are also accepting nominations for new stores and seem to be quick about getting them online .
There is presented a list of some of the best deals and some even cooler options for recipe integration .
How Does it Work ?
You can search and find different foods and the sale price at your local store .
But the bar none the coolest feature is a section called A recipe for Savings where recipe ’s supplied by AllRecipes are listed with ingredients and the amount you ’ll save .
For my case a recipe showed up for Baked Cheesy Veggie Chicken Pasta which would save me $ 8.17 ( 41 % ) off the normal price .
Recipe components that are on sale are hyperlinked .
Merely click on the item ( say 3 1/ 2 ounces blue cheese , crumbled ) and you ’ll get the deal below the recipe that you can then add to your Grocery List .
It ’s helping me in two areas .
One we frequently can’t figure out what to have for dinner and two saving me some money at the same time .
Best of all it ’s totally free .
This is a great tool to add to your arsenal and I ’m sure Joe would love to hear your feedback at his contact page .

When a new major version of Perl 5 comes out , history suggests a new minor release will follow .
Some of this reasoning is pragmatic .
For all of the requests of the Perl 5 Porters for people to test development snapshots ( 5.11.0 through 5.11.5 ) and the inevitable release candidates ( in this case , 5.12.0 RC1 through ... hopefully not RC2 and RC3 ) , nothing gets more testing or bug reports than new major releases .
Bugs get reported .
Changes get requested .
Changes occur .
The traditional view of new major releases is that they 're somewhat unstable .
" Wait for the patch release , " people say .
This was true of 5.6.0 .
( The ancient Camel third edition describes an unreleased version of Perl 5 somewhere between 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 ) .
This was true of 5.8.0 .
This was even more true of 5.10.0 , where the CPAN itself suggested that 5.10.0 was a " testing " release for bleeding edge users .
Given the size of the Perl 5 test suite and the daily and weekly test reports produced from the bleeding edge of Perl 5 itself as well as the monthly releases , most of the obvious bugs appear and get corrected quickly .
Even so , bugs happen .
It 's software .
Changes occur and people notice only in odd or complex situations .
Sometimes a new compiler warning appears , or underlying libraries change .
Sometimes a few updates help get Perl 5 building on a platform which itself has changed .
A patch release is inevitable .
However , the Perl 5 Porters make no promises about when a point release will occur .
Nor do they promise how many point releases will occur in a family .
The Perl 5.8.0 family had nine point releases between July 2002 and December 2008 .
If Perl 5.10 had n't taken five and a half years , Perl 5.8.0 might have had fewer point releases .
22 months passed between the release of Perl 5.10.0 and Perl 5.10.1 .
There may never be a 5.10.2 .
A point release needs two things : a steady stream of bug fixed in the core without breaking source compatibility and someone to identify appropriate those patches and to make the release .
In other words , one or more people need to be able to cherry - pick patches from the development track of the next release of Perl 5 to the branch which will become the new point release .
The weight of history and expectations is sufficient to assume that p5 p will be able to find or herd enough volunteer effort to make a Perl 5.12.1 and a Perl 5.14.1 and so on , but if monthly Perl 5 releases continue and produce a new major release every 12 - 18 months , the likelihood of a Perl 5.12.2 and a Perl 5.14.2 decreases .
The single unpredictable factor is the presence of a major bug discovered in that release family ; a major security bug or a data loss bug is one possibility .
In that case , a single - patch minor release is likely .
Beyond that , minor releases have diminishing returns .
A lot of people incurred the wrath of Hunter S. Thompson over his long career , and we can now add the " fools , " " bastards , " and " idiots " who worked at his local electronics shop to that list .
Warning , the video is NSFW if you work with old people or humorless prudes .
Take your average septuagenarian 's frustration with technology and add Thompson 's well - documented volatility .
That will only offer a hint of how amusing this call — an expletive - ridden threat to the people who set up his new JVC DVD player — really is .

It 's also reassuring to know that Thompson , who wrote a weekly column for ESPN.com at the end of his career , employs the same " do - what - I - want - or - else - I'll - write - about - it ! " tactic we here at Gizmodo routinely use to keep tech support jockeys in line .

A beta of Coverage . py 3.1 is available .
Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs , usually during testing .
The big feature of 3.1 is that Python 3.1 is now supported .
Kits are available as source or as Windows installers from the coverage .
py page on PyPI , and code is also available from the repository on bitbucket .
Significant changes in coverage .py since v3.0.1 :
Python 3.1 is supported .
The same source kit works on both 2.x and 3.x .
The “ coverage ” command now uses a sub - command syntax similar to source control systems .
This will make new feature additions easier .
Coverage results can be reported as a Cobertura - compatible XML file .
Use the new “ coverage xml ” command .
I ’m looking for users who use Hudson or Sonar to ensure that this is working properly in all cases .
Some users reported incorrect results due to using DecoratorTools , which fiddles destructively with the settrace function .
TurboGears is a major example of code that was n’t measured properly .
The new -- timid switch makes coverage .
py operate simply enough that DecoratorTools does n’t interfere with its operation .
HTML coverage reports now have syntax - colored Python source .
Please try 3.1b1 and let me know what you think .
Feedback is welcome in any way you like , but particularly good are tickets on bitbucket , or email on the testing - in - python mailing list .
In January , John Caldow was inducted into the Illinois Track and Cross Country Coaches Association Hall of Fame , a testament to his 40 - plus years of coaching excellence at DePaul University and other high schools across the city .
Among the public high schools he coached at were King , Jones , and Calumet .
And in 2006 , after he'd retired from teaching phys ed in some of those same schools , he went to work at Whitney Young as an assistant track coach to Young 's head coach , Bob Geiger — a four - hours - a - day , six - days - a - week , five - months - a - year commitment for which Caldow was paid the whopping sum of $ 2,500 .
The Board of Education — the governing body for the Chicago Public Schools — ought to give him a medal .
Instead they 're cutting his pay to nothing .
" I figured it out and it came out to about $ 2.87 an hour , " he says .
" How are you supposed to get people to coach if you do n't pay them anything ? "
Good question .
And I can't tell you what the official answer is since Monique Bond , spokeswoman for the Chicago Public Schools , has not returned my calls .
Here 's what I do know .
Facing a budget deficit of at least $ 800 million , CPS sports director Calvin Davis sent an e-mail to school athletic directors in early February announcing that the central office had decided to save money by cutting out pay for assistant high school track coaches , including the people who coach freshmen and sophomore squads .
The announcement did n't say how much money would be saved .
But let 's take a generous guess .
There are about 150 high schools in the city , including all the small schools within schools .
So if every single school has a track team ( which they do n't ) and every team has three assistant coaches ( which they do n't ) then we 're talking about maybe $ 1.1 million .
This is out of an annual CPS budget of about $ 6.8 billion — in other words , a drop of water in an ocean .
Of course , given the district 's massive budget hole , it 's probably hard for some people to get worked up over the track and field program while schools CEO Ron Huberman is talking about laying off teachers , increasing class sizes , and scaling back special ed .
I guess I have a bias toward track .
My daughters ran it .
I coached it .
I love watching it .
And I know firsthand how meaningful it can be for kids — and not just the superstars — who are looking for a way to have fun , keep out of trouble , and stay in shape .
Ironically the cuts come as educators across the country are talking about the need to expand recreational activities for teenagers .
The New York Times recently ran an article about two new studies showing that " team sports can result in lifelong improvements to educational , work and health prospects " for girls .
And Michelle Obama has launched a nationwide campaign to fight obesity by getting more kids to exercise regularly .
On the local level , it was only a few months ago that corporate , civic , and political leaders — starting with Mayor Daley himself — swore up and down that their efforts to bring the 2016 Olympic games to Chicago were all about ushering in a new age of sports and fitness in public schools and parks .
In fact , they told us , the citizenry would benefit from the Olympic bid even if we did n't get the games , because civic and corporate Chicago were now committed to developing more recreational opportunities for ordinary youth .
But that was then .
The new cuts will make it harder for public high schools to sustain viable track programs .
Some lucky schools may be able to get parents to kick in for coaches ' pay , or at least to cover their gas money .
Schools with the poorest students — the ones with the most to gain from extracurricular activities like track — will of course be hit the hardest .
Keep in mind that the state of track and field in the public schools was already abysmal .
As I 've reported before , the district does n't have a single indoor track — runners train in school hallways during the winter — or any plans to build one .
It 's no wonder so few public school kids master the techniques of the shot put or clearing a hurdle , much less the more specialized activities like high jumping or pole vaulting .
Huberman , who used to be CTA president and Mayor Daley 's chief of staff , has said he has no choice but to cut sports programs since he 's pretty much trimmed all the fat from the CPS budget .
I found that a little hard to believe .
So I went through the budget myself to see if I could help .
Let 's start at the top .
The office of the CEO has a staff of eight and a budget of $ 1.1 million .
In addition , the office of the CEO 's chief of staff has another seven employees and a budget of $ 1.5 million .
If the district is desperate to make cuts , how about taking a knife to the bureaucracy before going after programs for kids ?
When Huberman took over the schools last year he brought with him five former CTA and City Hall employees , each making at least $ 120,000 .
Among them was Barbara Lumpkin .
Once described by the Sun -Times as the " City Hall equivalent of a utility infielder , " Lumpkin had previously served Mayor Daley as city comptroller , budget director , city treasurer , and chief procurement officer .
She 's now making $ 154,000 as Huberman 's deputy CEO for External Affairs , which has a staff of 49 and a budget of $ 5.6 million .
Her job is to raise money from the business community .
The schools could obviously use more money .
But it 's funny that while they expect coaches to work for free , they can't find any retired business leaders willing to volunteer their time to raise money for the cause of education .
When the mayor decided he wanted the Olympics , he managed to recruit — or strong - arm — every civic bigwig in town for the effort .
Where else can we cut ?
Well , there 's the CPS law department .
Though it has 80 employees and an annual budget of about $ 9.5 million , somehow or other Huberman needed to fork over another $ 100,000 to former federal prosecutor William Jones Jr. to investigate whether school board members and officials had improperly charged artwork , limousine rides , high - priced meals , liquor , and other expenses to their school district credit cards .
Mayor Daley defended the investigation and the money for Jones , telling reporters , " You want to protect taxpayer money . "
I guess you gotta spend money to protect it .
But he did n't explain why they had to hire Jones when CPS already had an in - house inspector general with a staff of 17 full - time employees and an annual budget of $ 1.9 million .
You figure with all those lawyers and inspectors they'd have enough people to investigate the credit - card expenditures .
Then again , there 's no shortage of things to investigate within CPS .
In 2008 Lamont Bryant sued the district , alleging he was improperly fired from his job as Marshall High basketball coach after alleging financial improprieties among school administrators .
Last year Bryant and the school board settled , with the board agreeing to pay Bryant $ 500,000 .
Well , at least one coach is getting paid .
The school district could also save the schools some money by cutting back on its spending to lease cars .
According to a recent Chicago Tribune story , the district " spends more than $ 800,000 a year for leased vehicles , including gas and maintenance . "
Huberman himself gets the use of two cars : a 2009 Ford Escape ( at least it 's a hybrid ) that costs $ 800 a month and a Crown Victoria that leases for about $ 1,000 a month .
Huberman and his aides also might want to look at cutting back on contracts to outside vendors ( about $ 696.6 million has been set aside for that ) and trimming a few of the extraneous central office divisions , like the Office of Autonomy .
I 'm not sure who it 's autonomous from — certainly not Huberman or Mayor Daley — but it has seven employees and an annual budget of $ 1.4 million .
That 's the division that 's in charge of overseeing schools that are doing so well they 're independent from school board oversight .
Which raises the question : if they do n't need oversight , why is there an office to oversee them ?
If Bond ever calls me back , I 'll ask her that too .
And by the way , her Office of Communications has a budget of $ 2.2 million and 13 employees , none of whom apparently do any communicating — at least not with me .
And then of course there are the tax increment financing districts .
( Regular readers had to know they were n't going to get through this column without hearing about them . )
When people see the CPS line item on their property tax bill , they might reasonably think all the money in that line item is going to the schools .
But in fact a good chunk of it goes to the TIF slush funds controlled by the mayor , which are n't itemized on property tax bills .
Last year alone , the TIFs siphoned about $ 250 million in property tax dollars out of CPS 's supposed share .
Just once I 'd love to see some school official tell the mayor to keep his cotton - picking hands off their property tax money .
But it 's not going to happen anytime soon .
Huberman and board president Mary Richardson - Lowry both serve at the pleasure of the mayor .
Richardson - Lowry knows all about the TIF program .
Before Daley named her to the board , she was chairman of the Community Development Commission , the group of mayoral appointees that oversees TIF deals .
In recent years , the CDC has approved $ 35 million in TIF money to help United Airlines move into new offices downtown , $ 6 million to help MillerCoors do the same , $ 8 million to lure the French Market to the Ogilvie Transportation Center , and — oh , you get the point .
You could hire a whole lot of assistant track coaches with that money .
But the mayor and his aides have other priorities .
To paraphrase Marie Antoinette , let the track coaches eat brioche .
They can buy it at the French Market .

Smartphones have changed the way businesses operate .
The biggest challenge now is choosing the right platform , writes Julia Talevski .
If someone told you in 1999 that before the next decade was over , you'd be doing most of your written communications with your mobile phone , you probably would have looked at your handset and wondered how .
Smartphones are becoming important business tools .
Now , with 3G wireless broadband , full " qwerty " keypads , multimedia capabilities , high - resolution touch screens plus a host of security and backup features , smartphones have become a mainstay for many businesses .
Not all smartphone platforms are created equal , however .
For example , BlackBerry has been well - known for its specific email and security abilities and the iPhone for its applications .
Android is well - regarded for its " openness " .
Scaling : Why Giants Don't Exist
Michael Fowler , UVa
Galileo begins
Two New Sciences with the striking observation that if two ships , one large and one small , have identical proportions and are constructed of the same materials , so that one is purely a scaled up version of the other in every respect , nevertheless the larger one will require proportionately more scaffolding and support on launching to prevent its breaking apart under its own weight .
He goes on to point out that similar considerations apply to animals , the larger ones being more vulnerable to stress from their own weight ( page 4 ) :
Who does not know that a horse falling from a height of three or four cubits will break his bones , while a dog falling from the same height or a cat from a height of eight or ten cubits will suffer no injury ?... and just as smaller animals are proportionately stronger and more robust than the larger , so also smaller plants are able to stand up better than the larger .
I am certain you both know that an oak two hundred cubits high would not be able to sustain its own branches if they were distributed as in a tree of ordinary size ; and that nature cannot produce a horse as large as twenty ordinary horses or a giant ten times taller than an ordinary man unless by miracle or by greatly altering the proportions of his limbs and especially his bones , which would have to be considerably enlarged over the ordinary .
For more of the text , click here .
To see what Galileo is driving at here , consider a chandelier lighting fixture , with bulbs and shades on a wooden frame suspended from the middle of the ceiling by a thin rope , just sufficient to take its weight ( taking the electrical supply wires to have negligible strength for this purpose )
Suppose you like the design of this particular fixture , and would like to make an exactly similar one for a room twice as large in every dimension .
The obvious approach is simply to double the dimensions of all components .
Assuming essentially all the weight is in the wooden frame , its height , length and breadth will all be doubled , so its volume -- and hence its weight -- will increase eightfold .
Now think about the rope between the chandelier and the ceiling .
The new rope will be eight times bigger than the old rope just as the wooden frame was .
But the weight - bearing capacity of a uniform rope does not depend on its length ( unless it is so long that its own weight becomes important , which we take not to be the case here ) .
How much weight a rope of given material will bear depends on the cross-sectional area of the rope , which is just a count of the number of rope fibers available to carry the weight .
The crucial point is that if the rope has all its dimensions doubled , this cross-sectional area , and hence its weight - carrying capacity , is only increased fourfold .
Therefore , the doubled rope will not be able to hold up the doubled chandelier , the weight of which increased eightfold .
For the chandelier to stay up , it will be necessary to use a new rope which is considerably fatter than that given by just doubling the dimensions of the original rope .
This same problem arises when a weight is supported by a pillar of some kind .
If enough weight is piled on to a stone pillar , it begins to crack and crumble .
For a uniform material , the weight it can carry is proportional to the cross-sectional area .
Thinking about doubling all the dimensions of a stone building supported on stone pillars , we see that the weights are all increased eightfold , but the supporting capacities only go up fourfold .
Obviously , there is a definite limit to how many times the dimensions can be doubled and we still have a stable building .
As Galileo points out , this all applies to animals and humans too ( page 130 ) : ( large ) increase in height can be accomplished only by employing a material which is harder and stronger than usual , or by enlarging the size of the bones , thus changing their shape until the form and appearance of the animals suggests a monstrosity .
He even draws a picture :
Galileo understood that you cannot have a creature looking a lot like an ordinary gorilla except that it 's sixty feet high .
What about Harry Potter 's friend Hagrid ?
Apparently he 's twice normal height ( according to the book ) and three times normal width ( although he does n't look it on this link ) .
But even that 's not enough extra width ( if the bone width is in proportion ) .
There is a famous essay on this point by the biologist J. B. S. Haldane , in which he talks of the more venerable giants in Pilgrim 's Progress , who were ten times bigger than humans in every dimension , so their weight would have been a thousand times larger , say eighty tons or so .
As Haldane says , their thighbones would only have a hundred times the cross section of a human thighbone , which is known to break if stressed by ten times the weight it normally carries .
So these giants would break their thighbones on their first step .
Of course , big creatures could get around this if they could evolve a stronger skeletal material , but so far this has n't happened .
Another example of the importance of size used by Galileo comes from considering a round stone falling through water at its terminal speed .
What happens if we consider a stone of the same material and shape , but one - tenth the radius ?
It falls much more slowly .
Its weight is down by a factor of one - thousand , but the surface area , which gives rise to the frictional retardation , is only down by a factor of one hundred .
Thus a fine powder in water --- mud , in other words --- may take days to settle , even though a stone of the same material will fall the same distance in a second or two .
The point here is that as we look on smaller scales , gravity becomes less and less important compared with viscosity , or air resistance : this is why an insect is not harmed by falling from a tree .
This ratio of surface area to volume has also played a crucial role in evolution , as pointed out by Haldane .
Almost all life is made up of cells which have quite similar oxygen requirements .
A microscopic creature , such as the tiny worm rotifer , absorbs oxygen over its entire surface , and the oxygen rapidly diffuses to all the cells .
As larger creatures evolved , if the shape stayed the same more or less , the surface area went down relative to the volume , so it became more difficult to absorb enough oxygen .
Insects , for example , have many tiny blind tubes over the surface of their bodies which air enters and diffuses into finer tubes to reach all parts of the body .
The limitations on how well air will diffuse are determined by the properties of air , and diffusion beyond a quarter - inch or so takes a long time , so this limits the size of insects .
Giant ants like those in the old movie " Them " would n't be able to breathe !
The evolutionary breakthrough to larger size animals came with the development of blood circulation as a means of distributing oxygen ( and other nutrients ) .
Even so , for animals of our size , there has to be a tremendous surface area available for oxygen absorption .
This was achieved by the development of lungs : the lungs of an adult human have a surface area of a hundred square meters approximately .
Going back to the microscopic worm rotifer , it has a simple straight tube gut to absorb nutrients from food .
Again , if larger creatures have about the same requirements per cell , and the gut surface absorbs nutrients at the same rate , problems arise because the surface area of the gut increases more slowly than the number of cells needing to be fed as the size of the creature is increased .
this problem is handled by replacing the straight tube gut by one with many convolutions , in which also the smooth surface is replaced by one with many tiny folds to increase surface area .
Thus many of the complications of internal human anatomy can be understood as strategies that have evolved for increasing available surface area per cell for oxygen and nutrient absorption towards what it is for simpler but much smaller creatures .
On the other hand , there is some good news about being big : it makes it feasible to maintain a constant body temperature .
This has several advantages .
For example , it is easier to evolve efficient muscles if they are only required to function in a narrow range of temperatures than if they must perform well over a wide range of temperatures .
However , this temperature control comes at a price .
Warm blooded creatures ( unlike insects ) must devote a substantial part of their food energy simply to keeping warm .
For an adult human , this is a pound or two of food per day .
For a mouse , which has about one - twentieth the dimensions of a human , and hence twenty times the surface area per unit volume , the required food for maintaining the same body temperature is twenty times as much as a fraction of body weight , and a mouse must consume a quarter of its own body weight daily just to stay warm .
This is why , in the arctic land of Spitzbergen , the smallest mammal is the fox .
How high can a giant flea jump ?
Suppose we know that a regular flea can jump to a height of three feet , and a giant flea is one hundred times larger in all dimensions , so its weight is up by a factor of a million .
Its amount of muscle is also up by a factor of a million , and when it jumps it rapidly transforms chemical energy stored in the muscle into kinetic energy , which then goes to gravitational potential energy on the upward flight .
But the amount of energy stored in the muscle and the weight to be lifted are up by the same factor , so we conclude that the giant flea can also jump three feet !
We can also use this argument in reverse : a shrunken human ( as in I shrunk the kids ) could jump the same height as a normal human , again about three feet , say .
So the tiny housewife trapped in her kitchen sink in the movie could have just jumped out , which she 'd better do fast , because she 's probably very hungry !
Question : from The Economist , Sept 16 , 1995 page 74 : " the average 16 - year - old Japanese girl has grown 4 % heavier since 1975 , although she is only 1 % taller . "
Just how much plumper does she look ?
What percent increase would keep her shape exactly the same ?
_______________________________________________________________________________
Teaching note : I began the lecture with five questions in a PowerPoint presentation , to be answered using clickers .
The idea was to get the class thinking about how areas and volumes increase when an object increases in size , keeping the same proportions .
To understand how doubling the diameter of a circle increases its area fourfold , imagine the circle just fitting inside a square .
It 's obvious what happens for squares ; and also that the circle takes up the same percentage of the square 's area no matter what size they are , provided it just fits .
Then a cube , and a ball in a cubical box .
Think first about a 2x2x2 cube made of a child 's cubical building blocks .
Visualize both volume and area increase from 1x1x1 .
The last two questions were asked later , at the appropriate point in the class .

" Why , they must spit two or three gallons a day !
They ain't died fast enough , these old men ! " – Mrs. T.E. Bagley , Whitney , Texas , 1949
John Ptak comments on a story from a 1949 issue of LIFE .
The photos are fantastic .
It is n't , I guess , so much a story about their sitting as it is a story about their not sitting , about how it came to be that their lumber was removed and the men forced to find another place to take in the sights and construct their great edifices of commentary and asides .
The story appears in LIFE Magazine of 15 August 1949 , and lays the whole drama out in two splash pages , with bare editorializing and some great photos .
The story goes like this : " In 1922 D. ( Doctor Dee ) Scarborough , the druggist in Whitney , Texas , put up a bench outside his store , and immediately it became a loafing headquarters for the gaffers of the Brazos River Valley .
' Year after year they sat there looking like a jury of irritable terrapins , whittling , spitting and passing judgment on everything that passed .
But finally reform caught up with them . "
It caught up to them , even if everyone was wearing a collared shirt .

I checked out the Halo 5 Guardians Beta and found out that I 'm still not good at Halo MP , but still had fun ...

IF you 've watched Star Trek Voyager or the others , then you 'll be familiar with many things in the game .
The ground combat leaves much to be desired and is just " okay " .
The space combat is good , however .
The story behind the game is very good and most times the actors who portrayed the characters did the voice for their character .
Most of the characters seem to come from Voyager and the story takes place 20 years after Voyager has returned from the Delta Quadrant .
If you 're a fan of the shows , being able to walk around DS9 was pretty cool , and I 've seen a number of people who role play .
You can pick 1 of a few races or make your own alien .
You can choose to be part of the federation , the Klingons , or the Romulans .
You can also visit parts of the very ship that you fly around in space in .
As a Star Trek fan it brought back memories of the shows and intrigue on what the story line holds next .
Their events are also interesting .
" Ice skating " races and snowball fights for the winter event with none other than " Q " himself .
In the summer you get to go to Risa and have " hover board " type races and fly around with a jet pack to collect items .
With each event , you collect tokens of sorts that you use to buy pets or new outfits or consumables .
Oh and there are Tribbles .
Many different kinds .
And yes , if you 're not careful , they will breed in your inventory .

MSL Survivor Group 7
2-0 Winner : Bisu
“ I definitely want to win this season ”
Q : It ’s your 10th consecutive MSL qualification
A : I started thinking how long - lasting I am staying at MSL .
I honestly did n’t have confidence this season .
My record has n’t been good lately , so I was questioning whether I could advance , but I ’m glad that succeeded .
Q : How was your game against Modesty ?
A : I made fast Robotics in preparation for his Lurkers and thought I would win easily as soon as my Observer was produced .
In addition , my HTs could use two storms each , so I easily blocked the Hydra push .
Q : [ Question fail , nothing was written here so I ’m guessing : How did you prepare your builds for today ? ]
A : I could n’t practice a lot , but I thought a lot about it .
I could n’t play a lot for Winner ’s League , so I used the builds that I could n’t use .
I think it worked out rather well .
Q : How did you feel when you saw your opponent ’s build ??
A : I realized for the first time that people actually use Bachanic [ bionic + mechanc ] on that map yesterday .
However during practice yesterday , I lost to the same build .
I had a feeling that he would use bachanic today , so I even stopped Probe production to focus on my army , and things happened according to my prediction , so it was easy from there .
Honestly , I did n’t practice that with my teammates , but I played it in a private server , and my opponent could have been BaBy ( laughs ) .
I laughed during the game , and thought of it as déjà vu .
Q : Your Proleague performance is not very good
A : When I kept losing , I lost my confidence .
Against WeMade FOX , I only got 1 kill , against KT , I could n’t even get any kills , and against Hwaseung , I lost as well .
Consequently , I got used to losing and could n’t find ways to win .
I ’m very different from how I was last year .
I think I ’ll have to look for ways to win again in Proleague .
Q : Your goal for MSL
A : It ’s been way over a year since I ’ve won .
Even outside of MSL , I want to go to the finals for any individual leagues and win it .
Last season , I disqualified so early so I was like a member of audience , but when I saw the players advance high , it seemed so fun .
I definitely want to advance higher , and I want to show that I can win to people around me .
I definitely want to show good results .
Q : Anything else ?
A : I lost so many times so my confidence has diminished , but my manager and coaches gave me a lot of advices and my fans continued to cheer me , so I think I ’ll have to do better .
People gave me a lot of strength for today , and I want to thank them for it .

- 10연속 MSL 진출에 성공했다
▲ MSL에는 진짜 오래 머무르는구나 하는 생각을 가지게 됐다 .
사실 이번에는 자신이 좀 없었다 .
요즘 성적이 안 좋아서 오늘 올라갈 수 있을까 의문을 품기도 했는데 이렇게 올라가게 돼서 기분 좋다 .
- 김현우와의 경기는 어땠 나
▲ 러커를 대비해서 로보틱스를 빨리 올렸고 옵저버만 있으면 쉽게 이길 수 있다고 생각했다 .
그리고 템플러의 사이오닉 스톰을 두 번 쓸 수 있는 마나가 있어서 히드라 러시를 잘 막을 수 있겠다고 생각했다 .
-
▲ 연습을 그렇게 많이 하지는 못했고 생각을 많이 했다 .
위너스리그에 많이 나오지 못해서 쓰지 못했던 빌드들을 쓰게 됐다 .
대체적으로 잘 풀린 것 같다 .
- 상대 바카닉을 파악하고 나서 어땠는 지
▲ 그 맵에서 바카닉을 하기도 한다는 것을 어제 처음 알았다 .
그런데 어제는 내가 그 빌드에 졌었다 .
왠지 오늘도 바카닉인가 하는 느낌이 들어서 프로브도 안 뽑아 가면서 병력 생산에 주력했는데 생각했던 대로 흘러가서 잘 풀린 것 같다.
사실 팀원들이랑 한 것이 아니라 사설 서버에서 한 판 했던 경기였는데 아마 그게 전태양 선수일수도 있다 . ( 웃음 ) 게임하면서도 웃음이 나왔고 데자뷰 현상인가 하는 생각도 들었다 .
- 프로리그에서 활약이 미미하 다
▲ 지다 보니까 자신감을 잃게 되더라 .
지난 번에서 위메이드전에서 1 킬 밖에 못하고 KT전에서는 아무것도 못하고 지고 , 화승전에서도 이상하게 졌다 .
그러다 보니 지는 게 익숙해 지는 것 같고 이기는 방법을 못 찾겠더라 .
작년의 나와는 너무 달랐다 .
프로리그에서 어떻게든 다시 이기는 방법을 찾아야 할 것 같다 .
- MSL에서 목표가 듣고 싶다
▲ 우승한 지 1년이 훨씬 넘은 것 같다.
MSL 뿐만이 아니더라도 개인리그에서 꼭 결승에 가서 우승하고 싶다 .
지난 번에 너무 일찍 탈락해서 시청자의 입장이었는데 선수들이 높은 무대에서 하는 것을 보니까 굉장히 재미있어 보였다 .
꼭 다시 한 번 가보고 싶고 주위에 아는 사람들을 불러 놓고 이기는 모습을 보여 주고 싶기도 하다 .
꼭 좋은 성적을 내고 싶다 .
- 하고 싶은 말이 있다 면
▲ 그 동안 너무 많이 져서 자신감을 잃었었는데 감독님이나 코치님이 좋은 말씀 해주셨고 팬 여러분도 계속 응원해 주시는 만큼 앞으로 잘 해야 할 것 같다 .
오늘 이기라고 주변 사람들이 많이 힘을 줬는데 고맙다고 말하고 싶다 .
MSL Survivor Group 7
2 - 1 Winner : BaBy
“ My heart was about to explode thinking I might lose in the final match again ”
Q : You ’ve finally made it to the MSL
A : I ’ve advanced to Survivor 3 times , but I kept losing in the final match .
I was shocked after all those times , and I ’m relieved that I finally qualified this time .
Q : How was your match against ?
Your Dropship usage was good
A : I made the natural Refinery too late , so my Vessels were late .
I thought the only way was to use Dropships .
That strategy luckily worked really well , so I was able to win .
When I was focusing too much on the battle in the center , my gas timing was off .
Q : Did you prepare for the Bachanic against Bisu ?
A : When I get gas rushed , I scout the opponent and if they 1 Gate expand , their tech becomes late and this strategy works well .
I won a lot with this strategy , and yesterday night , I did n’t have anyone to practice with , so I practiced on a private server and I won that game .
Therefore , when I saw Bisu do a 1 Gate expand , I thought I could win , but I oddly lost .
He ’s definitely really good .
Q : Oh my .
Bisu said that he lost to someone ’s Bachanic last night and therefore he was able to prepare for the strategy , so was n’t your opponent Bisu last night ?
A : Match Point gives a lot of points in private server , so I played one match .
If it really was Bisu , I really am not lucky ( laughs ) .
Q : How was your last game against Modesty ?
A : Last game , my Command Center was lifted , and Lurkers came into my main , so I thought I would lose a final match like that again , and became really nervous .
My heart has never pumped that hard in my life before .
When Modesty ’s army died by my mines , and my 1 Vulture killed a lot of his Drones , then I finally thought that I won the game .
Q : You seem to be on a good pace .
Goals for MSL ?
A : My goal is Ro16 for now .
As I practice , I realize that I ’m still lacking a lot so I ’ll have to try harder .
Q : Anything else ?
A : I will do my best in the future .

- 드디어 MSL 진출인 데
▲ 여태까지 3 번 정도 올라왔었는데 계속 최종전에서 떨어졌었다 .
그러면서 충격을 많이 받았었는데 늦게나마 이렇게 올라갈 수 있어서 다행인 것 같다 .
- 박찬수와의 경기는 어땠나 .
드랍십 활용이 좋았는 데
▲ 중반에 앞마당 가스를 늦게 지어서 베슬도 잘 안 찍히고 그래서 드랍십 밖에 방법이 없다고 생각했다 .
운이 좋게 그게 잘 먹혀서 이길 수 있었다 .
센터 싸움에 집중하다가 가스 타이밍이 약간 어긋났었다 .
- 김택용전에서 바카닉은 원래 준비한 것인 가
▲ 원래 가스러시를 당하면 정찰을 해보고 상대가 게이트 더블을 하면 테크가 느리기 때문에 이전략이 잘 통한다 .
원래 잘 이겼고 어제도 새벽에 연습할 사람이 없어서 사설서버에서 게임을 했는데 그 때도 내가 이겼었다 .
그래서 오늘 김택용 선수가 게이트 더블하는 것을 보고 이길 수 있겠다고 생각했는데 이상하게 지더라 .
역시 잘하는구나 생각했다 .
- 맙소사. 김택용 선수가 어제 사설서버에서 누군가의 바카닉에 지고 덕분에 이번 경기에서 잘 대비했다고 하던데 상대가 김택용 선수 아니었 나
▲ 사설서버에서 점수를 많이 주는 맵이 매치포인트라서 딱 한 판을 했었는데 그게 정말 김택용 선수였다면 내가 정말 운이 없는 것 같다 . ( 웃음 )
- 김현우와의 최종전은 어땠 나
▲ 마지막 경기는 앞마당 커맨드센터도 뜨고 본진에 러커도 들어오고 하면서 또 최종전에서 이렇게 지는구나 싶어서 굉장히 떨렸다 .
살면서 이렇게 심장이 두근두근했던 적은 처음이다 .
김현우 선수가 내 앞마당에서 마인 대박으로 죽고 내 벌쳐 1기 가 상대 드론을 많이 잡은 것을 확인하고 나서야 비로소 이겼다는 생각이 들었다 .
- 최근 분위기가 좋은데 MSL 에서의 목표는
▲ 일단 16강을 목표로 하고 있다.
연습하면서도 느끼지만 아직 부족한 점이 많아서 더 열심히 해야 할 것 같다 .
- 하고 싶은 말이 있다 면
▲ 앞으로 좋은 모습 보여 드리겠다 .

One of the clearest lessons of the last few decades is that capitalism is indestructible .
Marx compared it to a vampire , and one of the salient points of comparison now appears to be that vampires always rise up again after being stabbed to death .
Even Mao ’s attempt , in the Cultural Revolution , to wipe out the traces of capitalism , ended up in its triumphant return .
Today ’s
Left reacts in a wide variety of ways to the hegemony of global capitalism and its political supplement , liberal democracy .
It might , for example , accept the hegemony , but continue to fight for reform within its rules ( this is Third Way social democracy ) .
Or , it accepts that the hegemony is here to stay , but should nonetheless be resisted from its ‘ interstices ’ .
Or , it accepts the futility of all struggle , since the hegemony is so all - encompassing that nothing can really be done except wait for an outburst of ‘ divine violence ’ – a revolutionary version of Heidegger ’s ‘ only God can save us . ’
Or , it recognises the temporary futility of the struggle .
In today ’s triumph of global capitalism , the argument goes , true resistance is not possible , so all we can do till the revolutionary spirit of the global working class is renewed is defend what remains of the welfare state , confronting those in power with demands we know they cannot fulfil , and otherwise withdraw into cultural studies , where one can quietly pursue the work of criticism .
Or , it emphasises the fact that the problem is a more fundamental one , that global capitalism is ultimately an effect of the underlying principles of technology or ‘ instrumental reason ’ .
Or , it posits that one can undermine global capitalism and state power , not by directly attacking them , but by refocusing the field of struggle on everyday practices , where one can ‘ build a new world ’ ; in this way , the foundations of the power of capital and the state will be gradually undermined , and , at some point , the state will collapse ( the exemplar of this approach is the Zapatista movement ) .
Or , it takes the ‘ postmodern ’ route , shifting the accent from anti-capitalist struggle to the multiple forms of politico - ideological struggle for hegemony , emphasising the importance of discursive re-articulation .
Or , it wagers that one can repeat at the postmodern level the classical Marxist gesture of enacting the ‘ determinate negation ’ of capitalism : with today ’s rise of ‘ cognitive work ’ , the contradiction between social production and capitalist relations has become starker than ever , rendering possible for the first time ‘ absolute democracy ’ ( this would be Hardt and Negri ’s position ) .
These positions are not presented as a way of avoiding some ‘ true ’ radical Left politics – what they are trying to get around is , indeed , the lack of such a position .
This defeat of the Left is not the whole story of the last thirty years , however .
There is another , no less surprising , lesson to be learned from the Chinese Communists ’ presiding over arguably the most explosive development of capitalism in history , and from the growth of West European Third Way social democracy .
It is , in short : we can do it better .
In the UK , the Thatcher revolution was , at the time , chaotic and impulsive , marked by unpredictable contingencies .
It was Tony Blair who was able to institutionalise it , or , in Hegel ’s terms , to raise ( what first appeared as ) a contingency , a historical accident , into a necessity .
Thatcher was n’t a Thatcherite , she was merely herself ; it was Blair ( more than Major ) who truly gave form to Thatcherism .
The response of some critics on the postmodern Left to this predicament is to call for a new politics of resistance .
Those who still insist on fighting state power , let alone seizing it , are accused of remaining stuck within the ‘ old paradigm ’ : the task today , their critics say , is to resist state power by withdrawing from its terrain and creating new spaces outside its control .
This is , of course , the obverse of accepting the triumph of capitalism .
The politics of resistance is nothing but the moralising supplement to a Third Way Left .
Simon Critchley ’s recent book , Infinitely Demanding , is an almost perfect embodiment of this position .
For Critchley , the liberal - democratic state is here to stay .
Attempts to abolish the state failed miserably ; consequently , the new politics has to be located at a distance from it : anti-war movements , ecological organisations , groups protesting against racist or sexist abuses , and other forms of local self - organisation .
It must be a politics of resistance to the state , of bombarding the state with impossible demands , of denouncing the limitations of state mechanisms .
The main argument for conducting the politics of resistance at a distance from the state hinges on the ethical dimension of the ‘ infinitely demanding ’ call for justice : no state can heed this call , since its ultimate goal is the ‘ real - political ’ one of ensuring its own reproduction ( its economic growth , public safety , etc ) .
‘ Of course , ’ Critchley writes ,
history is habitually written by the people with the guns and sticks and one cannot expect to defeat them with mocking satire and feather dusters .
Yet , as the history of ultra - leftist active nihilism eloquently shows , one is lost the moment one picks up the guns and sticks .
Anarchic political resistance should not seek to mimic and mirror the archic violent sovereignty it opposes .
So what should , say , the US Democrats do ?
Stop competing for state power and withdraw to the interstices of the state , leaving state power to the Republicans and start a campaign of anarchic resistance to it ?
And what would Critchley do if he were facing an adversary like Hitler ?
Surely in such a case one should ‘ mimic and mirror the archic violent sovereignty ’ one opposes ?
Should n’t the Left draw a distinction between the circumstances in which one would resort to violence in confronting the state , and those in which all one can and should do is use ‘ mocking satire and feather dusters ’ ?
The ambiguity of Critchley ’s position resides in a strange non sequitur : if the state is here to stay , if it is impossible to abolish it ( or capitalism ) , why retreat from it ?
Why not act with ( in ) the state ?
Why not accept the basic premise of the Third Way ?
Why limit oneself to a politics which , as Critchley puts it , ‘ calls the state into question and calls the established order to account , not in order to do away with the state , desirable though that might well be in some utopian sense , but in order to better it or attenuate its malicious effect ’ ?
These words simply demonstrate that today ’s liberal - democratic state and the dream of an ‘ infinitely demanding ’ anarchic politics exist in a relationship of mutual parasitism : anarchic agents do the ethical thinking , and the state does the work of running and regulating society .
Critchley ’s anarchic ethico - political agent acts like a superego , comfortably bombarding the state with demands ; and the more the state tries to satisfy these demands , the more guilty it is seen to be .
In compliance with this logic , the anarchic agents focus their protest not on open dictatorships , but on the hypocrisy of liberal democracies , who are accused of betraying their own professed principles .
The big demonstrations in London and Washington against the US attack on Iraq a few years ago offer an exemplary case of this strange symbiotic relationship between power and resistance .
Their paradoxical outcome was that both sides were satisfied .
The protesters saved their beautiful souls : they made it clear that they do n’t agree with the government ’s policy on Iraq .
Those in power calmly accepted it , even profited from it : not only did the protests in no way prevent the already - made decision to attack Iraq ; they also served to legitimise it .
Thus George Bush ’s reaction to mass demonstrations protesting his visit to London , in effect : ‘ You see , this is what we are fighting for , so that what people are doing here – protesting against their government policy – will be possible also in Iraq !’
It is striking that the course on which Hugo Chávez has embarked since 2006 is the exact opposite of the one chosen by the postmodern Left : far from resisting state power , he grabbed it ( first by an attempted coup , then democratically ) , ruthlessly using the Venezuelan state apparatuses to promote his goals .
Furthermore , he is militarising the barrios , and organising the training of armed units there .
And , the ultimate scare : now that he is feeling the economic effects of capital ’s ‘ resistance ’ to his rule ( temporary shortages of some goods in the state - subsidised supermarkets ) , he has announced plans to consolidate the 24 parties that support him into a single party .
Even some of his allies are sceptical about this move : will it come at the expense of the popular movements that have given the Venezuelan revolution its élan ?
However , this choice , though risky , should be fully endorsed : the task is to make the new party function not as a typical state socialist ( or Peronist ) party , but as a vehicle for the mobilisation of new forms of politics ( like the grass roots slum committees ) .
What should we say to someone like Chávez ?
‘ No , do not grab state power , just withdraw , leave the state and the current situation in place ’ ?
Chávez is often dismissed as a clown – but would n’t such a withdrawal just reduce him to a version of Subcomandante Marcos , whom many Mexican leftists now refer to as ‘ Subcomediante Marcos ’ ?
Today , it is the great capitalists – Bill Gates , corporate polluters , fox hunters – who ‘ resist ’ the state .
The lesson here is that the truly subversive thing is not to insist on ‘ infinite ’ demands we know those in power cannot fulfil .
Since they know that we know it , such an ‘ infinitely demanding ’ attitude presents no problem for those in power :
‘ So wonderful that , with your critical demands , you remind us what kind of world we would all like to live in .
Unfortunately , we live in the real world , where we have to make do with what is possible . ’
The thing to do is , on the contrary , to bombard those in power with strategically well - selected , precise , finite demands , which ca n’t be met with the same excuse .
After being in stealth mode for eight years , Bloom Energy unveiled its Bloom Box , a device which it believes will revolutionize the world , at a highly publicized media event on Wednesday .

The company unveiled its technology at a launch event at eBay 's campus in Silicon Valley , attended by big names including former Secretary of State Colin Powell and the governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Bloom is 60 percent cleaner than coal , said Schwarzenegger .
Former NASA scientist and Bloom Energy Chief Executive K.R. Sridhar described the technology in a statement as potentially having “ the same kind of impact on energy that the mobile phone had on communications . ”
Bloom showed off its main product , the Bloom Energy Server , a generator based around a smart new fuel cell technology .
Fuel cells rely upon chemical reactions to generate energy rather than fossil fuels , and as such are considered cleaner , more affordable , and more reliable than the traditional energy sources .
The fuel cells promise to produce more power — with less environmental damage — than others on the market .
Fuel cell technology has been researched for decades , and was typically associated with hydrogen as the main fuel source .
But Bloom ’s flat ceramic squares , the size of a Polaroid photo and made with baked beach sand , are supposed to be more versatile , the company said .

According to Bloom Energy , each server represents a 40 percent to 100 percent carbon footprint reduction , depending on the type of fuel used through the thousands of fuel cells .
Even with fossil fuels , the electricity produced will be 67 percent cleaner than the power produced from a coal - fired plant , according to Bloom .
Several major companies , including eBay , FedEx , Google , Staples and Wal - Mart , have already begun testing the technology .
The trial runs have so far produced more than 11 million kilowatt - hours of energy while cutting 14 million pounds of carbon dioxide emissions , Bloom said .
The company said it has already raised $ 400 million from investors , including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Morgan Stanley .

Advertisement Viktor Yanukovych , the opposition leader who won Ukraine 's recent election , has been inaugurated as the country 's new president .
His electoral opponent , Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko , says Mr Yanukovych won through fraud and refuses to recognise his victory .
Both Mrs Tymoshenko and the outgoing President , Viktor Yushchenko , did not attend the ceremony in Kiev .
International observers have said the February poll was conducted fairly .
Mr Yanukovych beat Mrs Tymoshenko in the run-off by 3.5 % .
He won the support of only about a third of Ukraine 's 37 million eligible voters .
He is the first Ukrainian president to have been backed by fewer than 50 % of those who voted .
Despite this , his victory marked a comeback from humiliation five years ago when mass street protests - known as the Orange Revolution - overturned a presidential election that had been rigged in his favour .
The protests swept to power Mr Yushchenko and Mrs Tymoshenko .
' Non-aligned state '
On Thursday , Mr Yanukovych swore the oath of office in parliament in front of deputies and visiting foreign heads of state and representatives .
Mrs Tymoshenko says the poll was " falsified " " I vow to defend through my actions the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine and the rights and freedoms of its citizens , " he said .
There was a block of empty seats in the chamber where deputies belonging to Mrs Tymoshenko's bloc would have sat .
After taking the oath , Mr Yanukovych acknowledged the divisions in parliament and Ukraine 's economic difficulties , including " colossal debts , poverty and economic collapse " .
But he that he knew how to lead the country out of the crisis , urging the government and parliament to co-operate with him .
Ukrainian politics has been dominated by the rivalries between Mr Yanukovych , Mrs Tymoshenko and Mr Yushchenko since the Orange Revolution .
Mr Yanukovych has said he now wants to form a new coalition and oust Mrs Tymoshenko as prime minister .
She has refused to step down and has called on her parliamentary coalition to oppose him .
Last weekend , she withdrew a legal challenge against her rival 's victory in the election .
She said the court was not interested in giving her justice in her case against Mr Yanukovych .
There have been concerns that he would steer Ukraine 's foreign policy away from the West - leaning course that Mr Yushchenko had charted , in favour of closer ties with Moscow .
His power base is in the Russian - speaking east and south of the country .
In the Ukrainian - speaking west and centre , he lost every region to Mrs Tymoshenko .
But in his speech , Mr Yanukovych said Ukraine was " a bridge between the East and the West , integral part of both Europe and the former USSR " .
Describing Ukraine as a " European , non-aligned state " , he pledged to develop a foreign policy that would allow Kiev to " reap maximum rewards by developing mutually beneficial ties with Russia , the EU , US and other states " .
In a signal that he may not move away from closer ties with the EU , some of his advisers have said his first foreign visit as president will be to the EU headquarters in Brussels , not Moscow .

The scrapping of the CBD Metro has not only cost NSW taxpayers $ 330 million , it has also cost more than 350 jobs .
The government said it had not figured out what to do with 43 permanent staff and 20 temporary staff employed by the now defunct Sydney Metro Authority .
Almost 300 people who have provided engineering , design and planning services may also require compensation .
The Premier , Kristina Keneally , would not put a figure on the expected cost of redundancies and terminations .
'' It would not be possible to give any figure on redundancies until we 've had an opportunity to work with those employees on an individual basis . ''
Labor 's policy of no forced redundancies means public servants whose positions are axed are redeployed .
They remain on full pay for up to a year , after which they can be forced to take redundancy if a suitable role has not been found .

But how did they gain such a stranglehold on the chocolate industry and why were they so successful in business ?
For a religious group more interested in championing social reform than industry , the Quakers have established an impressive roll call of household business names .
Barclays and Lloyds banks , Clarks shoes , Bryant & May matches and the biscuit firms Huntley & Palmers and Carrs are just a few of the companies founded by members of the pacifist group .
But when it comes to confectionery , there has been a virtual monopoly for more than a century , led by Cadbury of Birmingham , Fry's of Bristol and Rowntree 's and Terrys of York .
HISTORY OF THE QUAKERS Society of Friends founded in England in 1650s by George Fox Pacifist religious group values all people equally and believes there 's something of God in us all Name derives either from founder telling magistrate to tremble - quake - at God 's name , or from shaking associated with religious experience About 17,000 Quakers in Britain today , and 210,000 worldwide
This achievement is all the more remarkable given the tiny numbers of Quakers .
In 1851 they only accounted for about one in 1,400 of the population of 21 million in England , Scotland and Wales - less than 0.1 % .
The move into chocolate began with cocoa drinks in the 19th Century as a reaction against the perceived misery and deprivation caused by alcohol , says Quaker historian Helen Rowlands .
" Quakers and other non-conformists at the time were concerned about levels of alcohol misuse in the population at large , they were part of the temperance movement .
" Cocoa was a way of providing cheap and available drink .
It was healthy because you had to boil the water to make it when they did n't have good water supplies . "
There was a friendly rivalry between the manufacturers , many of whom started out as general grocers , but also a fraternity .
Quaker gatherings for worship take place in meeting houses , not churches " There were certainly strong networks between them .
They knew one another from their church - based life , and because of the way they had been excluded and persecuted on the edge of society , there was a strong sense they should help each other out , " says Ms Rowlands .
" So they developed strong business networks as well as personal ones . "
As they moved into producing chocolate bars , several of the Victorian Quaker firms bought new cutting - edge machinery and established a competitive edge over other producers .
The other advantage was their reputation for honesty and reliability running parallel with their quest for justice , equality and social reform .
" They were amongst the first to set a firm price for goods .
There was a lot of bartering before , but the Quakers said ' no , we 'll state the price for goods and a fair price ' , " says Ms Rowlands .
" People appreciated that , they knew where they stood with Quaker businessmen - they were in it to make a livelihood but not at the expense of customers or employees . "
The workers ' pool in Bournville
This ethical approach gave Quaker retailers a competitive advantage over their resentful rivals because their customers knew they were not being ripped off and did not have to haggle to get a fair price .
Cadbury , which built the village of Bournville for its workers complete with schools , leisure facilities and parks , was amongst the first firms to make pension provisions and provide a canteen .
It also knew a healthy workforce was a productive workforce , and employed doctors and dentists at a time when there was still child labour in Britain .
Ms Rowlands says evidence shows the new ethical stance led to a successful business , but it was unclear how other firms viewed it at the time .
" [ The Quakers ] were not the only people doing that kind of thing but they were in the vanguard of it .
The connection between faith - based motivation and business was very clear and perhaps less overt amongst others . "
The Quakers were formed as a protest against the established Church and , crucially , members were excluded from universities and debarred from many public and civic offices along with other non-conformists .
So professions such as medicine or the law were not open to them , which explains why so many gravitated towards business and commerce .
" During the 18th and early 19th Centuries , non-conformists were barred from universities .
You had to be a practising Anglican to take a degree , " Ms Rowlands says .

History of Cadbury adverts " Lots of the middle classes who might have taken the intellectual route went into trade and industry , and their talents were well used there . "
There was an inventive streak and an interest in science among Quakers , typified by the Darbys of Coalbrookdale , who founded the British iron industry , and the Hanburys who brought tinplate to Wales .
Their pacifist stance also created new markets .
Unlike their competitors , the Darbys refused to make cannon during the Napoleonic wars and instead concentrated on domestic ironware , which proved a more lucrative industry than weapons .
In the 1820s , the Peases ran the first train from Stockton to Darlington on what became known as the Quaker Line , and the Quakers influenced pharmacy ( Allen and Hanbury ) , chemicals ( Albright & Wilson and Sturge ) and engineering ( Ransomes of Ipswich ) .
Natural capitalists
But they were also people of their own era , forcing women to leave work once they married and employing slaves on West Indian sugar plantations despite later starting Britain 's campaign against the slave trade .
Jobs for the girls ... but only until marriage Academic Sarah Moss , who wrote Chocolate : A Global History ( Edible ) , says conditions on Quakers ' slave plantations may have been better than others , " but it was still slavery without any doubt " .
Quaker confectioners were seen as trustworthy , she says , with good and safe factory conditions - bucking the trend at the time .
" Contamination of sweets was a big issue in the 19th Century .
Red lead was a common colouring for sweets , which was poisonous , and brick dust was added to chocolate to make it go further , " she explains .
She also thinks aspects of the Quakers ' religious ethos and self - reliance make them natural capitalists .
A caricature of wealthy Quaker banker Samuel Gurney published in 1823 " Non-conformists put the burden of responsibility for salvation on the individual .
Quakerism does n't have any kind of priesthood .
That approach to life is the prototype of successful capitalism - you just get on , it 's just you and the system and no welfare state . "
By the 1870s , Oxford and Cambridge universities began accepting Quakers , opening up new professions and opportunities .
Paul Whitehouse , treasurer of Quakers and Business , says this helps explain why there are fewer Quaker firms today .
" People went into a large selection of different walks of life .
There was no longer this concentration of people in business .
[ Once ] the best and brightest went into business , now they were spread across so they did n't stand out . "
After World War II , Quaker - owned family businesses began to disappear - Cadbury merged with Schweppes in 1969 and Rowntree 's was bought by Swiss multinational Nestle in 1988 .
Quaker
Oats in name alone , and now owned by PepsiCo Ms Rowlands says there was a sense among Quaker bosses that holding on to their companies as wholly family enterprises would made them competitively vulnerable .
Quakers and Business tries to apply the same ethical values of yesteryear to today 's society , and the Quaker brand remains a powerful , trusted and at times exploited one .
The US company Quaker Oats , founded in the late 19th Century , still uses the image of a traditionally dressed Quaker on its cereal boxes - despite never having any connection to the group .
Below is a selection of your comments .
One very impressive thing among the Quakers was perhaps their process of decision making in controversial subjects .
They did n't decide things by vote .
Instead they went on discussing the matter until a unanimous conclusion was arrived at .
It appears to be the ultimate in democracy .
I wonder whether they keep up this tradition even now .
V P Ninan , Kottayam - Kerala - India Old Quaker business ethics were indeed admirable .
It would be admirable also if today 's chocolate candy producers would start using Fairtrade , Equal Exchange and Traidcraft chocolate in their products , and free chocolate confectionery from the curse of slavery forever .
Sarah Q Malone , State College , PA For an example of a thriving present - day Quaker business , see chemical company Scott Bader Commonwealth .
Ernest Bader , a Quaker , gave his very successful business to his employees in the early 1950s .
This was such a novel idea at the time that a specific legal procedure had to be devised to make this possible .
The present company has a constitution which makes it totally impervious to takeovers .
Charles , Colchester , UK
Not to detract from any of the fine work of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation or the Cadbury family but William Cobbett , MP draws other conclusions as to Quaker business success in his writings of the 1820s .
In particular he notes how Quakers could be seen to operate co-operatively to " work " the fledgling stock exchanges , and how Quaker groups would club together in order to corner a market in any given commodity .
Mark Bell , Guildford I 've been interested in Quaker business practices for a while , and would be very interested to see if their business ethos ' could be practiced in the modern business world .
However , as most successful companies are now owned and run for and by shareholders for the most amount of profit , there is rarely any room for the ethical trading that the Quakers would have promoted .
It 's sad that today this desire for a good product and a clear conscience is drowned out by marketing data and a drive towards ridiculous profits .
Heather , Willenhall
Whilst travelling around India I became aware of the influence of the Jains who like the Quakers have strict modes of behaviour which govern every aspect of life but are also very successful in the arenas of business and academia .
They have the highest literacy in India and have the oldest libraries .
Des Chamberlain , Amsterdam
It is all most intriguing .
How did the Quaker businesses maintain their philanthropic principles when they had to sack people ?
Did they do it very kindly ?
David Butland
Sad to see a formerly family owned company go the way of a leveraged buy - out .
To be fair the Cadbury family had already sold out in the 60s , but in my opinion this is one step too far .
The board justified their decision with the sole intention to rake in as much cash for the shareholders as possible .
Hardly the ethical approach a Quaker would take .
Lee , Manchester , UK Lee ,
The board of directors are required by their responsibilities in law to obtain the best value in any bid for their shareholders .
Had they insisted on an " ethical " buyout , they could , and likely would , have been subject to legal action .
This is true of any publicly owned company .
Cadbury lost its ability to take decisions purely on ethical grounds , rather than on economic grounds , once the shares in the company were sold by the original family , who consequently lost their controlling interest .
The company is now owned by the shareholders , alone to whom the directors owe their duties .
Any publicly quoted company directors are subject only to the law and to the requirement to maximise benefit to their shareholders .
The message ?
If you want to ensure a company is run in line with your own personal philosophy , do n't sell it .
Mark Jones , London , UK
It was with some regret that I stopped buying a particular brand of confectionary when it was bought by a company which failed to maintain the funds to the model village supported by the original company ; as a multi-national I felt it just did n't need my money as much as a donation to that charity did .

When Allegra Fullerton got married last November , her niece was the flower girl .
Like most her niece was a bit awkward going down the aisle , but Allegra 's sister stood in the wings and encouraged her on .
What a sweet robot .
Advertisement
Allegra 's sister Laurel is " into robots " , we 're told , and decided to built the flower - blowing bot for her sister 's wedding to Andy Fischer .
From the pictures it looks like the bot was a hit .

The Flower Girl even took a turn on the dancefloor .
I spoke to Allegra just moments ago .
She explained why she had a robot in her wedding :
I have always , always loved robots and have a collection of books , toys , and now an actual robot !
How can you compete with a robot crusing down the aisle spitting out flowers on the ground ?
I wanted my wedding to have a playful feel and pay tribute to my upbringing ( Dad and sister are both engineers ) and really give a San Francisco feel to the event .
My sister built the robot and has been building robots since she was in high school .
The ah ha moment for having a robot flower girl was one sunny afternoon at brunch with my fiance .
I had a vision , thankfully he shared it and after a chat with my sister ( who was a Mechanical Engineer Grad Student at Stanford at the time ) she said she would make it happen and we went from there .

Update !
Engineering Sister Laurel writes in with details of the build :
WeddingBot ( or so I call it ) was built for my sister , Allegra , since she did n't know any young children to act as flower child or ring bearer .
I had recently finished building a water - squirting remote - controlled duck boat for a class ( details at : http://www.stanford.edu/~laurelf/duck/ ) so she asked me to make her a remote - control robot that would spew flowers .
WeddingBot was mostly designed and built during my internship at Pocobor ( http://www.pocobor.com/ ) a small mechatronics consulting company in San Francisco .
When I was n't working on projects for them they were happy to let me to use their software and tools to design the circuit boards and program the bot .
The chassis of WeddingBot was pretty simple , two boxes from Daiso , some wooden columns , and a motor kit with wheels .
A large computer fan with plastic ducting was used to blow flowers out of the top .
The bot was powered by RC car batteries ( purchased at a hobby shop ) and had a circuit board I designed for translating wireless commands from the controller ( sent via an xBee Pro ) into motor / fan responses .
The controller was based on an old Microsoft Sidewinder joystick I 've had since middle school .
I took it apart and connected the button and stick position outputs to another circuit board to translate the joystick inputs into wireless commands the robot could understand .
Both the joystick and robot circuit boards had microcontrollers that I programmed in C. Driving WeddingBot was pretty straightforward .
The amount the stick was tilted forward or back determined the overall speed and the left / right position determined how much it would veer left or right at that speed .
Holding the trigger button would turn on the fan so that flowers would launch out .
The back button would switch left / right turn commands to make driving the robot towards you more intuitive ( since your left and the robot 's left are opposite in that situation ) .
I added an extra red button that could be used to re-center the joystick if the default position somehow became skewed .
Before we begin discussing how , let us talk about what .

Based on a True Story TV Movie Portrays Dark Side of Scientology
A new German TV movie tells the story of a man whose family life was destroyed after joining the Church of Scientology .
The drama , which is based on a true story , was filmed in secret to prevent the organization taking legal action against the project .
Even if we can all agree that we hate hold times and the awful choice in music , customer service is one of those incredibly subjective experiences .
When it comes to Apple I seem to hear from people who swear by it just as much as people who swear at it .
From a more objective standpoint , though , it seems that Apple has done a pretty good job of serving its customers as needed , having nabbed the number three spot in BusinessWeek 's annual customer service survey .
In its bronze medal position , Apple earned A+ ratings in both the qualify of staff and efficiency of service ; its overall score increased by almost ten percent over its 2009 rating .
In particular , the company earned plaudits for its Genius Bar and new roving check - out system .
Of those surveyed , 66 percent said they would definitely recommend the brand and 58 percent said they would definitely repurchase the brand .
The two companies that beat out Apple were retailer L.L. Bean and insurance and banking company USAA .
The information in BusinessWeek 's survey was compiled in part from numbers collected by well - respected market research firm J.D. Power and Associates , along with an additional survey material collected from a panel of BusinessWeek readers .
Amusingly enough , Apple may have had a hand in besting itself .
There 's a lengthy article at BusinessWeek about the second place USAA ( in the interest of full disclosure , USAA is my bank , credit card company , and insurance company ) , which talks about how the company has improved its service through the use of technology -- in particular its innovative iPhone app , which allows the depositing of checks online and initiating insurance claims .
Still , as Apple was 20 places above its nearest competitor , Dell , I 'd say there 's not a whole lot for the company to worry about .
This story , " Apple Ranks Third in Customer Service Survey " was originally published by Macworld .

BEACHWOOD , Ohio – Braving brutal winter winds , workers from the Hugo Boss clothing firm picketed an upscale suburban mall , asking help to stop the company from closing one of the last remaining domestic clothing plants and moving to Turkey .
Hugo Boss , a German maker of top - of - the - line men ’s suits and pants , notified its nearly 400 employees over the Christmas holiday that it planned to shut its plant in Brooklyn , a suburb of Cleveland , when the current contract with Workers United expires at the end of April .
The union , part of the Service Employees International Union , has vowed to fight , and set up an informational picket Thursday on the edge of Beachwood Mall in front of Nordstrom ’s , one of the largest U.S. retailers of Hugo Boss suits .
As passing motorists honked in support , the workers held signs and chanted , “ Keep Cleveland working . ”
A delegation went into the store to ask support for the effort .
The Rev. Bob Strommen , a leader of Cleveland Jobs with Justice , told the picketers that the delegation got a friendly reception but was referred to Nordstrom ’s regional office .
He said Hugo Boss suits were on sale at the store for $ 795 .
Union representative Sue Brown said the company ’s plant closing announcement came as a shock since talks involving the offices of Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland , U.S. Sen .
Sherrod Brown and other public officials on providing the company with economic incentives had been hopeful .
“ The company is not in trouble , ” she said .
“ They have never denied the plant is profitable .
They just want cheap labor .
It ’s about greed . ”
The company had previously offered a one - year trial experiment to save the plant based on slashing wages from $ 12.80 to $ 8.30 , she said .
“ I could n’t support my family on that , ” said Anthony Senart , 23 , a sewing machine operator at the plant for the past six years .
“ We have two little girls . ”
Senart said his wife , Erika , is also employed at Hugo Boss so closing the plant would be devastating .
His mother has also worked at the plant for 31 years , he said .
“ Hugo Boss is making lots of money off us , ” Senart said .
“ Why should they have to cut our wages . ”
The company “ spends millions on fancy ads and sports sponsorships like competitive sailing , tennis , golf , auto racing and soccer , ” stated a flyer handed out by the picketers .
The amount the company might save by closing its Cleveland - area plant “ is only a few million dollars … a drop in the Hugo Boss bucket , ” the flyer said .
“ This is a fight , for all unions , for all workers , ” Clayola Brown , one of the union ’s international vice presidents , told a recent meeting held by the North Shore AFL - CIO .
“ Ohio has been targeted for too long .
There are no more entry level manufacturing jobs , ” she said .
“ We need help from churches , public officials and the whole labor movement .
We must make the corporations and the right wing back up or they will roll over everyone . ”
Cleveland - area clergy have scheduled a breakfast Feb. 2 to discuss how to help .
The union is appealing to supporters to e-mail Hugo Boss CEO Dr. Andreas Stockert urging that the plant be saved .
The e-mail address is : Andreas_Stockert@hugoboss.com .
Below , workers tell their story in a two - minute video on the fight .

Environment minister admits mortality figure from sooty particles from transport and industry for first time to committee of MPs
Air pollution may be leading to the premature deaths of 35,000 people in Britain a year , nearly 50 % more than has been previously admitted by government , a committee of MPs has heard .
The figure was used for the first time by environment minister Jim Fitzpatrick when giving evidence to the Commons environment audit committee .
The MPs were also told that air pollution - minute sooty particles emitted by motor transport , ships and fuel burning in houses and industry - may now be costing £ 7bn to £ 20 bn a year .
Government estimates of premature deaths from long - term exposure to air pollution have previously ranged up to 24,000 people a year , a figure calculated from 1998 data .
But evidence given to the MPs by Professor Frank Kelly of University College London and repeated by Fitzpatrick today suggest the real figure is 35,000 .
It represented " one of the biggest public health failings by a government in modern history , " said Simon Birkett , director of the Campaign for Clean Air in London .
" Why has it taken direct questioning by the environmental audit committee to get a minister to refer , for the very first time , to the possibility of 35,000 premature deaths in the UK in a year due to air pollution ? "
But Fitzpatrick said that it was more accurate to say that the impact of air pollution was a reduction of seven to eight months on everyone 's life .
" If we were able to eliminate poor air quality tomorrow , we would not have a reduction of 12,000 to 35,000 deaths a year . . "
" We are intent on improving air quality .
There is no safe level for air pollution ,
We have to reduce the exposure of the whole population , " he said .
Britain , along with other EU countries , faces unlimited fines by Europe if it continues to breach legal limits in central London , which has some of the worst traffic pollution in Europe .
PORT -AU - PRINCE , Haiti —
Survivors strained desperately on Wednesday against the chunks of concrete that buried this city along with thousands of its residents , rich and poor , from shantytowns to the presidential palace , in the devastating earthquake that struck late Tuesday afternoon .
Calling the death toll “ unimaginable ” as he surveyed the wreckage , Haiti ’s president , René Préval , said he had no idea where he would sleep .
Schools , hospitals and a prison collapsed .
Sixteen United Nations peacekeepers were killed and at least 140 United Nations workers were missing , including the chief of its mission , Hédi Annabi .
The city ’s archbishop , Msgr. Joseph Serge Miot , was feared dead .
And the poor who define this nation squatted in the streets , some hurt and bloody , many more without food and water , close to piles of covered corpses and rubble .
Limbs protruded from disintegrated concrete , muffled cries emanated from deep inside the wrecks of buildings — many of them poorly constructed in the first place — as Haiti struggled to grasp the unknown toll from its worst earthquake in more than 200 years .
In the midst of the chaos , no one was able to offer an estimate of the number of people who had been killed or injured , though there was widespread concern that there were likely to be thousands of casualties .
“ Please save my baby ! ” Jeudy Francia , a woman in her 20s , shrieked outside the St. - Esprit Hospital in the city .
Her child , a girl about 4 years old , writhed in pain in the hospital ’s chaotic courtyard , near where a handful of corpses lay under white blankets .
“ There is no one , nothing , no medicines , no explanations for why my daughter is going to die . ”

Governments and aid agencies from Beijing to Grand Rapids began marshaling supplies and staffs to send here , though the obstacles proved frustrating just one day after the powerful 7.0 - magnitude earthquake hit .
Power and phone service were out .
Flights were severely limited at Port - au - Prince ’s main airport , telecommunications were barely functioning , operations at the port were shut down and most of the medical facilities had been severely damaged , if not leveled .
A Red Cross field team of officials from several nations had to spend Wednesday night in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic to gather its staff before taking the six - hour drive in the morning across the border to the earthquake zone .
“ We were on the plane here with a couple of different agencies , and they all are having similar challenges of access , ” Colin Chaperon , a field director for the American Red Cross , said in a telephone interview .
“ There is a wealth of resources out there , and everybody has the good will to go in and support the Haitian Red Cross . ”
The quake struck just before 5 p.m. on Tuesday about 10 miles southwest of Port - au - Prince , Haiti ’s capital , ravaging the infrastructure of Haiti ’s fragile government and destroying some of its most important cultural symbols .
“ Parliament has collapsed , ” Mr. Préval told The Miami Herald .
“ The tax office has collapsed .
Schools have collapsed .
Hospitals have collapsed .
There are a lot of schools that have a lot of dead people in them . ”
He added : “ All of the hospitals are packed with people .
It is a catastrophe . ”
President Obama promised that Haiti would have the “ unwavering support ” of the United States .

Although it might seem like a headline from The Onion , the story 's actually true .
NASA 's being forced to cut four million dollars from the Mars rover project .
In order to meet that requirement , they 'll have to put one rover , Spirit , to sleep — a " hibernation " period .
The team at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Lab ( JPL ) will also have to put the other rover , Opportunity , on a diminished work cycle .
But in actuality , they wo n't be cutting what Opportunity 's doing — they 'll just be spreading it out over a longer period of time .
" Instead of sending up commands to Opportunity every day to drive or explore a rock , its activities may be limited to every other day , said John Callas , the Mars Exploration Rover project manager at JPL . "

Keep in mind that we support the Mars rover mission , but at the same time , is n't this so like bureaucracy ?
Congress and the Administration cut NASA 's budget , but since NASA can't really cut what they 're tasked to do , it 's really just a shell game of " we 'll take our budget cut by spending the same amount of money , just spreading the work out over double the amount of time . "

This Coffee Party already has 30 chapters around the country and is picking up steam ( sorry , ca n’t resist the pun ) on places such as Facebook and Twitter .
Also , Park has plans for making the Coffee Party larger :
We will organize public gatherings .
One of the events that we are planning is a national coffee house day on March 13th , in which we will encourage our existing and soon - to - form chapters to facilitate informative and civil dialogue about issues that affect all of us , collectively .
We will ask them to report back to us on what consensus they reach , and take action from there .
You can find out more about The Coffee Party here :

An interesting aspect of this Coffee Party is an ambition to get progressives and liberals re-engaged in the grass - roots again .
I am hoping the President ’s performance since the State of the Union , particularly his Q&A with GOP representatives at their Baltimore retreat last month , and yesterday ’s HCR summit will re-energize the left ’s flagging morale .
A few days ago , I wrote a length diary about steps we can all take ( and many of us already took in 2006 and 2008 ) about how to seize back control of the narrative and help President Obama and congressional democrats forward their agenda .
Because the main gist of that diary dovetails nicely with the Coffee Party ’s aims , and I uploaded the diary at 2:00 am EST so I am not sure how many people read it , I am going to repost it below ( I ’ve chopped it a bit ) .
Steps to Re-engaging and Winning Back the Narrative
Like many of you reading this , I proudly voted for President Obama in 2008 .
Like many of you I spent a lot of time and energy helping to get him elected ( many of us pitched in with canvassing , making phone calls , talking to or sending emails to family , friends , classmates , co-workers , etc , participating in blogs , or basically engaging many people that you came across in your daily lives in making them aware of the issues from the last election and Obama 's positions on them ) .
Like many of you I have watched his first year in office with a mixture of hope and frustration .
And , like many of you , the combination of this frustration and the inevitable letdown after campaigning for so long in 2008 ( and 2007 and 2006 ) left me somewhat disengaged over the past 12 months .
I get the sense that too many of us have done this , and accordingly we have ceded too much of the narrative and too much of the messaging to Republicans and tea-partiers .
However , I 've come to realize that Obama was almost certainly right about one thing .
We ARE the ones we 've been waiting for and if his agenda is going to be rescued and moved forward , its going to take people like us to change the narrative .
He needs our help and I hope after reading this , you agree .
Unlike the conventional wisdom , I think Obama has actually had a good month or so ( since the State of the Union ) and I believe he has learned many lessons from his first year in office and is beginning to seize back the momentum .
But , he needs us to really push for him .
I realize many of you do n't agree with some ( or even much ) of what Obama has done so far .
However , there has been a jarring dearth of practical ideas coming from the other side .
We have real problems that require real solutions , and until and unless the other side comes up with better alternatives , I hope you agree that fighting the misinformation campaign of obstructionism by Republicans is a worthy goal .
I am writing this as a " call to arms , " or a " rallying cry " for those who support Obama 's agenda or are at least open to supporting parts of his agenda .
We are the only side proposing any realistic solutions to our problems , but we are losing the messaging war .
It is up to us , not the Obama administration alone , to change this .
I propose the following :
Be Informed on the Issues Focus on Family / Friends / Colleagues Who are " Reachable " on the Issues Be Engaged at the Water Cooler ( both actual and digital ) and change the Narrative " In the Trenches " Do n't Let Up - Let 's Close The Intensity Gap Between Now and November Be Positive ( and Optimistic ) - This can be Done
Be Informed on the Issues
Some points to consider at the outset .
While we are confident that we are right on most of the positions , let 's face it , these issues largely involve politics , sociology , economics , and public policy .
As such , few , if any , immutable laws exist in this arena .
It 's not like certain aspects of physics or chemistry where opinions are irrelevant .
With the political arena , support can be found for pretty much any position if you look hard enough .
However , I am actually being quite charitable to the other side on most issues .
The reality is on most issues , we have the consensus and data on our side .
Each of us should be prepared to use it , or at least be able to know how to quickly access it .
We should match their rhetoric with reality , their emotional rants with calm logic , and their misinformation with facts .
Many of you reading this are already extremely well informed and have no need of my pep talk .
However , many reading this may not be aware of helpful resources outside of the typical mainstream media .
Websites like Daily Kos ( www.dailykos.com), 538 ( www.fivethirtyeight.com), HuffingtonPost www.huffpost.com), Media Matters ( www.mediamatters.org), Talking Points Memo ( www.tpmcafe.com) and Slate.com can be extremely valuable repositories of information .
Yes , you have to be a bit savvy and selective when viewing these sites - some are full of a lot of unsubstantiated opinions and rhetoric .
But , they are also stuffed with thoughtful posts informed by reliable data - often on issues either not covered by the mainstream media or not covered in sufficient depth .
We have had some pretty powerful talking points develop very recently that should allow you to engage everyone but the most intransigent tea-partier .
Some suggestions :

Despite the mainstream media 's dour coverage , recent studies and data show the stimulus package is actually working as designed and has saved as many as 2 million jobs .
http://www.nytimes.com/...
And the non-partisan CBO just issued this glowing report :
http://www.washingtonpost.com/...
And , some pretty dramatic graphs which tell the same story :

-- Obama has actually CUT taxes for most Americans , Not Raised Them
Yet another false talking point espoused by the right , and another opportunity for us to set the record straight .
Despite the stimulus package cutting taxes for 95 % of Americans , in a recent poll only 12 % of Americans thought Obama cut their tax , and twice as many - 24 % thought he raised them .
http://www.cbsnews.com/...
This misperception feeds the narrative that Obama is a " socialist " and provides fuel to the Tea - partiers .
Let 's get out front of this issue and make sure people in our network know the facts .
-- Obama Actually Knows
What he is Doing with National Security and Foreign Policy
The Obama Administration is making real inroads against the Taliban , catching several top leaders and capturing Taliban headquarters , all within the last week or so .

-- Developing Clean Energy Technology is Crucial to our Economic Prosperity and National Security
Without having to debate whether climate change is real , a tactic to use with skeptics is to acknowledge that either their view is wrong or ours is .
But , what are the consequences of each side being wrong ?
If we 're wrong , and there is no human - caused climate change , then our quest for renewable clean energy will simply result in the US being clean technology leaders thus laying a strong foundation for our continued economic prosperity , it will wean us off Middle East oil and thus increase our security , and make our planet cleaner .
If they 're wrong , in addition to possibly compromising the habitability of the planet for millions of humans , we would have ceded the clean energy industry to other countries threatening our long - term economic prospects , and we would could continue to tether ourselves to oil and the middle east .
To tether our economic outlook and national security to a rapidly depleting resource is nuts .
Ask them to explain why opposing massively investing in renewable energy , regardless of the climate change debate , makes any sense .

-- The Rabid Anti-Government and Anti-Tax Rhetoric of the Fringe Right Has Spawned Violence , As Predicted .
While we all have had frustrating experiences with the government , and no one enjoys paying taxes , a lot of rhetoric these days scapegoats the federal government for all of our problems .
I 'm not going to defend the government on every issue , but it is irresponsible to suggest that the government is evil and corrupt and cannot be part of the solution to any of our problems , as some commentators on the right have built their careers out of doing .
The recent plane crash at the IRS building in Texas was the type of rightwing anti-government violence a Department of Homeland Security report ( commissioned by the Bush Admin , but completed early in Obama 's term ) warned us about .

Focus on Family / Friends / Colleagues
Who are " Reachable " on the Issues
I do n't expect people who are unreachable on these issues to be reading this .
I have spent many hours talking / emailing conservative or tea - bagging friends and colleagues , but to little avail .
At some point , we have to realize that a certain percentage of the population is just not going to agree with anything the President supports .
This is a call to make on your own , but from my perspective my time ( as is everyone 's ) is limited and I will no longer waste time engaging these individuals ( at least with respect to these issues ) while I could be spending that time conversing with people who actually want to be part of the solution rather than merely root for Obama to fail .
Be Engaged at the Water Cooler ( both actual and digital ) and change the Narrative " In the Trenches "
These days , we have 2 " water coolers . "
One is what I refer to as the " actual water cooler " - a real water cooler or gathering place at work where you can engage with your colleagues about this , or for that matter , any time you have face to face or phone communication with other people about these issues .
The " digital water cooler " is engaging others through email , texting , twitter , social networks like facebook , or going to blogs .
Not to mention the hybrid of these 2 - talk radio , cable news and newspaper editorial pages .
We need to make sure we call into these programs and blanket the editorial staffs with letters to the editors .
We need to match the intensity of the other side in both water coolers .
When a colleague starts spouting off Rushisms or Beckisms , or the latest falsehoold about health care reform , like death panels , we should be ready and willing to knock such nonsense down .
Not merely to rebut the person talking , but for anyone who may be listening to the conversation .
Through this , we send a clear signal that we will not be cowed with attempts to intimidate us with misinformation and we can re-energize those who are looking for this type of engagement to kick - start their support .
I offer the talking points noted above as suggestions or starting points , but feel free to use your own and share with others those that you have found useful .
This is what I mean about changing the narrative in the trenches .
Too often in the last 12 months , we have been caught with our britches down ( so to speak ) when these opportunities have arisen and we have largely allowed others to set the narrative for us .
We can do this - we did in 2008 and we can do it again .
-- Put the burden on them to make their case
Another technique that I find very effective is when you hear someone start spouting off ridiculous and unsupported assertions , ask that they be explained .
The fact is most of these assertions by the right are only " sound - bite deep . "
For example , next time someone at work states that Health Care Reform is a " big government takeover " do n't instantly jump into your defense of HCR .
Rather , ask the person to explain to you exactly how the proposed HCR is government takeover .
They usually can't explain it very well , and their " support " is usually very easy to pick apart .
Put the burden on them to make the case rather than launching into your case reflexively .
Do n't Let Up - Let 's Close The Intensity Gap Between Now and November
The numbers are still on our side , however , Republicans and Republican leaning independents are much more involved at this point in the election cycle than Democrats , and thus are more likely to vote in November .
To close this enthusiasm gap and get more Dems and center / center - left voters the polls in November , we have to be as dedicated as those on the right .
Confront misinformation and distortion head on and encourage and re-energize those that are supporting politicians actually trying to solve our problems .
Be Positive ( and Optimistic ) - This can be Done
This may be the most important item .
Just remember , Obama actually has done quite a lot of good things since being in office .
http://mediamatters.org/...
http://www.slate.com/...
And , he is beginning to seize the initiative again .
While there have been some rough moments , just remember - it was his first year on the job .
Just like any of us , he is improving with more time on the job .
Things are beginning to turn around .
We have a choice , we can either stand by and watch him struggle , or we can do our part , and pick up a mop and help him clean up the mess he inherited .
So , I say let 's pick up the mop ( or " cowboy up , " or " man up , " or " raise the level , " or " bring it , " or whatever motivational phrase you use to get you going ) and let 's get it done !
They are so small that most people have never even seen them , yet " voodoo wasps " are about to be recruited big time in the war on agricultural pests as part of the wider effort to boost food production in the 21st century .
The wasps are only 1 or 2 millimetres long fully - grown but they have an ability to paralyse and destroy other insects , including many of the most destructive crop pests , by delivering a zombie - inducing venom in their sting .
Now scientists believe they have made the breakthrough that will enable them to recruit vast armies of voodoo wasps to search and destroy farm pests on a scale that could boost crop yields without polluting the wider environment with insecticides .
The researchers have decoded the full genomes of three species of parasitic wasp , which could lead to the development of powerful new ways of deploying these tiny insects against the vast range of pests that destroy billions of tonnes of valuable crops each year .
There are more than 600,000 species of parasitic voodoo wasps and they already play a critical role as a natural regulator of insect populations .
However , scientists believe that the decoding of their genomes will open the door to new and better better ways of targeting them against specific pests .
" These genome sequences will be a major tool for agricultural pest control .
Many people may not realise how dependent humans are on these tiny wasps which protect our food crops and save billions of dollars each year by reducing crop loss , " said Chris Smith of San Francisco State University , a member of the research team .
The three wasps all belong to the Nasonia genus and are strictly speaking " parasitoid " species , meaning that they lay their eggs inside the paralysed bodies of other insects , keeping them alive long enough for the wasp larvae to grow and mature into adults as they feed off the living flesh of their " zombie " host .
" Parasitic wasps attack and kill pest insects , but many people do n't even notice them or know of their important role in keeping pest numbers down .
We owe them a lot .
If it were n't for parasitoids and other natural enemies , we would be knee - deep in pest insects , " said Professor John Werren of the University of Rochester , who led the study published in the journal Science .
" If we can harness their full potential , they would be vastly preferable to chemical pesticides which broadly kill or poison many organisms in the environment .
We basically broadcast toxins into the environment – pesticides to control in a very non-specific way a large number of pests .
As a result the environment is exposed to these toxins , and we are as well . "
The scientists hope that deciphering the genomes of the Nasonia wasps will enable them to find the insect genes involved in directing a wasp to attack a specific insect , with the aim of understanding how to manipulate such attacks .
The researchers also hope to identify the chemical nature of the venoms used by the wasps to paralyse their hosts , a development that could also lead to new drugs for human medicine .
Parasitoid wasps are already used as natural pesticides .
Last year , for instance , scientists in the US released thousands of parasitic wasps to attack the olive fruit fly , which is decimating the olive groves of California .
The wasp is harmless to people , pets and plants .
Scientists also believe that knowing the genomes of the Nasonia wasps will help in the fight against human diseases that are carried by insects .
It may be easier to control the disease - carrying insect using the parasitic wasps , rather than targeting the disease itself .
Insects : Back from extinction
They do sea eagles .
They do red kites .
They do corncrakes .
And now , they 're doing bumblebees .
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds , not content with successfully reintroducing some of Britain 's most charismatic and endangered bird species , is turning its attention to insects .
With the help of conservation partners , it is bringing back endangered species of bees , crickets , hoverflies and moths on its vast national network of nature reserves .
It is the RSPB 's contribution to 2010 as a special wildlife year - this is the International Year of Biodiversity - and opens up the possibility of much wider restoration of lost wildlife species in Britain than has hitherto been considered practicable .
The list of insects to be brought back is headed by the short - tailed bumblebee , now extinct - it was once widespread in the south of England but disappeared as a result of changes in farming methods , with the last recorded UK population being in 1988 .
However , populations taken to New Zealand by British settlers a century ago have survived and some will be brought back for release this summer on the RSPB 's Dungeness reserve in Kent , with the help of the Bumblebee Conservation Trust , Natural England , and Hymettus , a bees and wasps conservation group .
Another project , also in cooperation with Natural England , will be the reintroduction of field crickets to the RSPB reserves at Farnham Heath , Surrey and Pulborough Brooks , West Sussex in April .
Field cricket populations have declined severely due to loss of habitats such as lowland heathland and grassland , and were at their lowest point in the late 1980s after they were reduced to a single surviving colony of just 100 individuals in Sussex .
In Scotland , the RSPB and Scottish Natural Heritage will be laying the groundwork for a planned reintroduction of the threatened pine hoverfly to the RSPB's Abernethy reserve in 2011 .
One of Britain 's most endangered insects , the pine hoverfly only breeds in the hollows of tree stumps created by fungi , and changes in forestry practices have led to a crash in its population .
Also in Scotland , the RSPB and Butterfly Conservation this year will establish a captive breeding programme in an attempt to create a sustainable population of the rare dark bordered beauty moth , which lives in aspen woodland and heathland , currently only in two colonies in Scotland and one in northern England .
If this is successful the moths will be released at a Scottish RSPB reserve next year .
" The B in our name stands for birds - and we stand up for birds wherever we can - but our work covers all kinds of wildlife , " said Dr Mark Avery , the RSPB 's Director of Conservation .
" No conservation organisation worth its salt concentrates on just one species and ignores all others .
2010 is the International Year of Biodiversity and that chimes perfectly with our efforts to protect whole ecosystems on our reserves from the smallest bug to the tallest tree .
" We have recorded more than 13,000 different species on our 200 reserves , and only three per cent of those are birds .
I 'm very excited that they will soon become home to some of the country 's most endangered insects . "
There was also a longer - term reason for the reintroductions , Dr Avery said – climate change , which would see many creatures seeking to move northwards .
Some species , especially birds , would be able to do this easily , but others would not .
" Over the next few decades we may have to move species to where they need to be , rather than where they are , " he said .
PRINCETON , NJ --
The increased conservatism that Gallup first identified among Americans last June persisted throughout the year , so that the final year - end political ideology figures confirm Gallup 's initial reporting : conservatives ( 40 % ) outnumbered both moderates ( 36 % ) and liberals ( 21 % ) across the nation in 2009 .
More broadly , the percentage of Americans calling themselves either conservative or liberal has increased over the last decade , while the percentage of moderates has declined .
Since 1992 , there have been only two other years -- 2003 and 2004 -- in which the average percentage of conservatives nationwide outnumbered moderates , and in both cases , it was by two percentage points ( in contrast to the current four points ) .
" The proportion of independents calling themselves " moderate " held relatively steady in the mid-40s over the last decade , while the proportion of Republican and Democratic moderates dwindled . "
The rather abrupt three - point increase between 2008 and 2009 in the percentage of Americans calling themselves conservative is largely owing to an increase -- from 30 % to 35 % -- in the percentage of political independents adopting the label .
Over the same period , there was only a slight increase in professed conservatism among Republicans ( from 70 % to 71 % ) and no change among Democrats ( at 21 % ) .
The 2009 findings come from an aggregate of 21 separate Gallup and USA Today / Gallup surveys , including nearly 22,000 interviews .
The 1992 to 2008 trends also represent thousands of interviews compiled for each year .
Thus , the margins of sampling error around the individual estimates are less than one percentage point .
Trends of the Past Decade
Just looking at the decade that ended in 2009 , Gallup 's annual political ideology trends document a slight dip in the percentage of Americans calling themselves moderate ( from 40 % in 2000 to 36 % in 2009 ) , while , at the same time , the ranks of both liberals and conservatives expanded slightly .
Gallup measures political ideology by asking Americans to indicate whether their political views are very conservative , conservative , moderate , liberal , or very liberal .
The detailed responses show a slight increase between 2000 and 2009 in the percentage of Americans calling themselves " very conservative " ( from 6 % to 9 % ) and less change in the percentage calling themselves " very liberal " ( from 4 % to 5 % ) .
Most conservatives continue to call themselves " conservative " rather than " very conservative , " and the same pattern is seen for liberals .
Republicans Become More Solidly " Conservative "
In addition to the very recent increase in conservatism among independents , a growing percentage of Republicans identified themselves as such starting in 2003 .
Across the same period , the percentage of Democrats calling themselves conservative dipped slightly , somewhat offsetting the increase among Republicans .
Partisans Shy Away From " Moderate " Label
The proportion of independents calling themselves " moderate " held relatively steady in the mid-40s over the last decade , while the proportion of Republican and Democratic moderates dwindled .
Between 2000 and 2009 , the percentage of moderates fell five percentage points among Democrats ( from 44 % to 39 % ) and seven points among Republicans ( from 31 % to 24 % ) .
Democrats Grow Increasingly " Liberal "
Similar to the increased conservatism among Republicans , there was a gradual increase in the last decade in " liberal " identification among Democrats , from 29 % in 2002 to 38 % in 2007 , and it has since remained at about that level .
The effect of this shift among Democrats is most apparent when one reviews the trend in their ideological profile over the past decade .
Whereas moderates constituted the largest bloc of Democrats in 2000 , today they are about tied with liberals as twin leaders , and the proportion of conservatives has declined .
By contrast , the expanded number of conservatives making up the Republican Party has merely strengthened the conservatives ' already strong hold on that party .
And despite the recent uptick in conservatism among independents , the largest segment continues to be moderate ( although by a smaller margin than previously ) .
Bottom Line
Political independents showed increased attachment to the " conservative " label in 2009 , boosting the overall ranks of that group so that it now clearly outnumbers moderates in Gallup 's annual averages for the first time since 2004 .
Longer term , the proportions of Americans calling themselves conservative as well as liberal expanded slightly this past decade , largely because of increased partisan attachment to each label .
At the same time , the percentage of " moderates " has dwindled , underscoring the heightened polarization of American politics as the nation heads into a new decade .
Survey Methods
Results are based on aggregated data from Gallup polls conducted in 2009 , each based on telephone interviews with 1,000 or more national adults , aged 18 and older .
For results based on the total sample of 21,905 national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1 percentage point .
Other results are based on aggregated Gallup surveys of approximately 1,000 national adults 18 and older each .
Sample sizes for the annual compilations range from approximately 10,000 to approximately 40,000 .
For these results , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1 percentage point .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Middle East - watchers have long wondered whether Iran would grow too strong for the rest of the region 's comfort .
( Iran 's continued nuclear development , covered by the Wire here , here and here , have strengthened this question . )
Ethnic distinctions , some experts argue , could become the fault line along which majority - Persian Iran splits from the rest of the predominately Arab Middle East .
This would grant an opening to Israel and the U.S. to ally with Arab states against Iran , ending to the Israel - Arab split that has defined the region for half a century .
But would Muslim Arabs really ally with Jews and Christians against fellow Muslims in Iran ?
Or is this theory merely a pipe dream of pro-Israel American analysts ?
For Arabs , Iran the New Israel Foreign Policy 's Thomas Ricks writes , " Iran is getting more powerful , and that scares the Arab states .
So they seem to be turning away from worrying about Israel and focusing more on Iran as it moves toward becoming a nuclear power .
The Bush administration actually helped strengthen Iran a lot by knocking down Iraq as the great bulwark against the expansion of Persian power westward , " he writes .
" Will [ nuclear scientist ] AQ Khan and the Bush administration together inadvertently have brought Arab - Israeli peace to the Middle East ? "
A Sunni-Jewish Alliance ?
The Atlantic 's Jeffrey Goldberg predicts that Sunni Muslims will ally with Israel against the Shia Muslims of Iran .
Sunnis make up the majorities of all Arab states , except Iraq where they they are the minority , and Yemen where they make up half the population .
Goldberg writes that Iraq , which became the first Shia-run Arab state when the U.S. toppled Sunni leader Saddam Hussein , makes a Sunni - Shia split possible .
" Consider the possibility of a grand , if necessarily implicit , Jewish - Sunni alliance as a gift to Obama from his predecessor . "
Why ?
" [ M]ost Arab states have a deeper interest in containing Iran than they do in containing Israel . "
Sunni Arabs Already Splitting From Iran Commentary 's Michael Totten thinks Arab Sunni public already mistrust and fear Iran .
" The leadership in most of these countries has thought so for years .
That average citizens now do so should be encouraging news [...]
Thanks to the Iranian government 's stubborn insistence on developing nuclear weapons , the age - old strife between Persians and Arabs , and Shias and Sunnis , may finally be eclipsing the Arab - Israeli conflict , " he writes .
For example , " The civil war between Sunni and Shia militias in Baghdad a few years ago was much nastier than any of the Israeli - Palestinian wars . "
Are You Guys Nuts ?
Middle East blogger Gregg Carlstrom does n't buy it .
He concedes that Arab governments want U.S. pressure to slow Iran 's growth , but cites polling data that most Arab people still see Israel as a bigger threat .
" [ T ] he poll asks respondents to pick the two countries ' that you think pose the biggest threat to you . '
Israel is first , at 88 percent ; the United States is second , at 77 percent .
Iran ( 13 percent ) comes in slightly ahead of China ( 9 percent ) . "
Polling in the Arab world is difficult .
But the data we have suggests that Arab publics do not view Iran 's nuclear program as an existential threat .
They 're worried about it -- but when asked to place it on a list of threats , it tends to rank fairly low .
There 's little evidence to suggest Arab polities are preparing to set aside their dislike for America and Israel and join the U.S. in some kind of grand alliance against Iran .
Been Predicted Many Times Foreign Policy 's Marc Lynch dismisses , " Been hearing this argument for a decade . "
If it has n't come to fruition yet , why would it ?

Scandinavia-gate
Yet again , we have a situation where the data does n’t match the full - gloss coloured graphs produced by the PR agency for global warming called the IPCC .
Frank Lansner and Nicolai Skjoldby have started a new blog Hide The Decline , and posted that Scandinavian data shows clearly that temperatures got markedly cooler from 1950 - 1970 , before they began rising again , and even after the warming , they only appear to be back where they were .
But , all the IPCC graphs minimize the cooling .
It would be reasonable to conclude from the data that the temperature today in Scandinavia is roughly similar to that of the 1930′s .
But , you ’d never know this from looking at the IPCC graphs .
The IPCC needs to come forward and explain why its graphs are so different .
There is no “ hockey stick warming ” here .
There is no unprecedented heat , and there is no good correlation with the rise of carbon dioxide either .
Sure , this is just one region , not the globe , but this is yet another example of how the IPCC has not presented an honest assessment of the information .
Corroborating this information , sea surface temperatures around Scandinavia do n’t show any rise .
Indeed , the water appears to be cooler than it was 60 - 80 years ago .
Where could that heat be hiding ?
There ’s more info at the source .
Plus there ’s an encyclopedia of climate information
Frank has done a great job assembling and making an encyclopedia of graphs and information .
There ’s an A – Z panel .
It ’s a fine source I recommend .
And do n’t forget , if you need to insert a graph into the comments , you can do so using the “ img ” button .
Graphs do help to lift the quality of comments , but they will slow the page loading , so please use them wisely .

I have to say that a month or two ago , I would never have have considered leaving Google .
Even despite Eric Schmidt 's now infamous " maybe you should n't be doing it " statement .
Their services are that great .
But somehow , the whole Buzz fiasco really forced me to shift my thinking a little bit .
Google controls my mail , my phone ( via Google Voice ) , my search , my calendar , my docs , my news ... and the list goes on .
That 's an awful lot for one big corporate entity to know about little old me .
I 'm still on Buzz , but when the chaos ensued after it 's launch , it was a bit of an awakening for me .
The fact is , Google 's privacy is at least as good and usually better than most other providers out there .
Unless you 're going to use the [ scroogle.org ] , [ cuil.com ] or [ Yauba.com ] search engines , Bing or Yahoo are still data mining just as much as Google , even if it 's only via your IP address .
The reality is , I 'm not about to give up my Gmail , Google Voice , of Google Reader anytime soon .
But I have been taking a closer look at www.zoho.com to manage my docs and all the search engines mentioned above just to throw a little of the balance elsewhere .
Also , Firefox is my primary browser , but Google Chrome is a very impressive backup .
Over the weekend I deleted it completely ( thanks Revo Uninstaller ! ) and installed a Chromium browser without the Googlization : SRWare 's Iron — all the benefits of Chrome without Google .
So , we 'll see .
Google have not really betrayed my trust yet , but I do have my eye on them and would n't hesitate to pull out completely if I ever really felt like they did their users terribly wrong .

Just Another Perl ' Blug By Just Another Perl Hacker
Revenge by billboard : Scorned lover pays £ 150,000 for street posters to reveal affair with Obama aide
The spurned mistress of one of Barack Obama 's top economic advisers has exacted revenge by plastering details of their affair on giant billboard posters across the U.S .
YaVaughnie Wilkins is said to have paid £ 150,000 to reveal her relationship with Charles Phillips to the world after he went back to his wife .
The posters , which are three storeys high , show Miss Williams and the senior member of the president 's hand - picked Economic Recovery Advisory Board below his initials and a quote saying : ' You are my soulmate forever . '
Shamed : YaVaughnie Wilkins poses with former lover Charles E. Phillips in a poster she placed in New York
There is also a link to a website that is a shrine to his eight - year affair with Miss Wilkins , 41 .
It includes pictures chronicling their travels around the world as well as intimate notes and ticket stubs from concerts , films , sports games and Mr Obama ' s inauguration a year ago .
One of the giant signs is posted on Broadway near Times Square in New York - one of the world 's most prominent advertising hoardings .
A further two have appeared elsewhere in New York as well as one in Atlanta and one in San Francisco , where Miss Wilkins lives and her married ex-lover owns a family home .
Each are said to have cost £ 30,000 to display .
The billboards baffled Americans when they first appeared – with speculation mounting over whether it was a marketing ploy or an apology .
Her extraordinary actions had the desired effect .
The chief executive has been forced into an embarrassing public statement in which he admitted their affair .
Adventures :
Wilkins set up a website of photos of the couple 's world travels , including Sydney , right
Powerful : Phillips , circled , was an adviser to U.S. President Barack Obama
Yesterday Mr Phillips , 50 , who is also president of internet giant Oracle , issued a brief three - sentence statement saying : ' I had an eight - and - a - half year serious relationship with YaVaughnie Wilkins .
' My divorce proceedings began in 2008 .
The relationship with Ms Wilkins has since ended and we both wish each other well .'
There has been speculation that YaVaughnie deliberately timed her campaign to coincide with a major Oracle event next week .
Website Gawker noted that the company was due to host an all - day live event on January 27 .
Mr Phillips was paid £ 12 million last year and has made around £ 30 million since 2007 .
He has recently reconciled with his wife , Karen , according to reports in the U.S .
The couple were seen at an awards ceremony in New York and pictured together at a gala held by the American Museum of Natural History in the city in November .
They have a ten - year - old son , Chas .
Miss Wilkins , a California - based actress and writer , was not available for comment yesterday .
Reconciliation : Phillips is back living with his wife Karen ( centre ) and their 10 - year - old son in New York
Pressure : Phillips said he wished Wilkins well after intimate photos posted online forced him to admit the affair
' Soulmates ' :
The website , paid for by Wilkins , shows photos of the pair enjoying holidays abroad
Pressure : Phillips was forced to admit the affair after the billboard posters and website went live
High - profile campaign : Wilkins paid $ 50,000 for each poster - including this one in New York
Promises : Wilkins put the love notes sent from Phillips during their affair online
Her website shows Mr Phillips and her standing arm - in-arm on the Great Wall of China and posing in Sydney wearing matching ' Australia ' jackets .
One of the photo albums from 2001 is set to a karaoke performance of the Smokey Robinson song Cruisin ' , where a man and a woman can be heard singing : ' This is not a one - night stand . '
There is also a huge collection of notes from Mr Phillips .
One gushes : ' You 're all that matters to me . '
Another reads : ' I have never met a woman as fascinating as you .
You are exactly what I 've been looking and waiting for . '
Miss Wilkins wrote : ' Charles ,
You have my heart for ever - I love you so much . '
California - based web designer Bela Kovacs claimed he was asked to build the site , charlesphillipsandyavaughniewilkins.com , as ' a present for Charles ' .
Last night visitors to the website were met with a ' service unavailable ' message .
The White House refused to comment last night on whether the billboards would affect Mr Phillips 's position .
But an administration aide said it was being treated as a ' private matter . '
An expert software analyst , Phillips is viewed as one of the most powerful people in the industry .
He joined the company in 2003 and previously worked for Morgan Stanley .
He is a former captain in the United States Marine Corps .
New York bloggers have gone into overdrive today with some claiming Phillips led a double life - presenting himself as a divorcee while still married .
Revenge : YaVaughnie
Wilkins paid for three posters , which baffled Americans when they first appeared
Tsarinamisha , who claims to be a ' close friend ' of the couple , ' wrote on Gawker 's website : ' I can assure you he portrayed himself as having been legally divorced in 2003 .
' Their closeness and the fact that their relationship was very public led no one to believe otherwise .
' They attended family and professional events as a couple , lived together for eight years and bought a home about two years ago .
' I was a guest at numerous of their parties and he introduced her to numerous people , including his son , as his girlfriend . '
Intimate : Love notes were posted on the website , which Wilkins paid £ 860 to have built
Spurned : Wilkins posted the details on the affair online after Phillips went back to his wife , Karen
Dbishty , who like Tsarinamisha , left a post on Gawker 's website said : ' There was never any indication there was a third party in their relationship .
' Charles and YaVaughnie spent quite a bit of money on their estate so it does n't make sense that things have turned out this way .
' The realtor at Coldwell Bankers and contractors at Genesis , Inc. and Bethe Cohen Design associated with the couple have nothing but glowing things to say about YaVaughnie and Charles .
' If he is married , YaVaughnie did not know .
She believed him , as we all did , when he said he was divorced . '
However , another blogger on the Gawker site said Phillips was still attending events with his wife – including the American Natural History Museum ’s gala event last November .

Researchers have made a breakthrough in HIV research that had eluded scientists for over 20 years , potentially leading to better treatments for HIV , in a study published today in the journal Nature .
The researchers , from Imperial College London and Harvard University , have grown a crystal that reveals the structure of an enzyme called integrase , which is found in retroviruses like HIV .
When HIV infects someone , it uses integrase to paste a copy of its genetic information into their DNA .
Prior to the new study , which was funded by the Medical Research Council and the US National Institutes of Health , many researchers had tried and failed to work out the three - dimensional structure of integrase bound to viral DNA .
New antiretroviral drugs for HIV work by blocking integrase , but scientists did not understand exactly how these drugs were working or how to improve them .

Researchers can only determine the structure of this kind of molecular machinery by obtaining high quality crystals .
For the new study , researchers grew a crystal using a version of integrase borrowed from a little - known retrovirus called Prototype Foamy Virus ( PFV ) .
Based on their knowledge of PFV integrase and its function , they were confident that it was very similar to its HIV counterpart .
Over the course of four years , the researchers carried out over 40,000 trials , out of which they were able to grow just seven kinds of crystals .
Only one of these was of sufficient quality to allow determination of the three - dimensional structure .
Dr Peter Cherepanov , the lead author of the study from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London , said : " It is a truly amazing story .
When we started out , we knew that the project was very difficult , and that many tricks had already been tried and given up by others long ago .
Therefore , we went back to square one and started by looking for a better model of HIV integrase , which could be more amenable for crystallization .
Despite initially painstakingly slow progress and very many failed attempts , we did not give up and our effort was finally rewarded . "
After growing the crystals in the lab , the researchers used the giant synchrotron machine at the Diamond Light Source in South Oxfordshire to collect X - ray diffraction data from these crystals , which enabled them to determine the long - sought structure .
The researchers then soaked the crystals in solutions of the integrase inhibiting drugs Raltegravir ( also known as Isentress ) and Elvitegravir and observed for the first time how these antiretroviral drugs bind to and inactivate integrase .
The new study shows that retroviral integrase has quite a different structure to that which had been predicted based on earlier research .
Availability of the integrase structure means that researchers can begin to fully understand how existing drugs that inhibit integrase are working , how they might be improved , and how to stop HIV developing resistance to them .

Rocksteady Studios flew down from the shadows to shock the community last year with their smart and fantastic take on the Dark Knight and his rogue ’s gallery with Batman Arkham Asylum .
With a sequel announced at the Video Game Awards this past December , analysts and consumers alike have high expectations for the London - based studio .
Warner Brothers has noticed the excitement with the developer , and how it has translated to some serious sleeper success , and has continued their investment into the market by buying out a majority hold ( 68.4 % , according to Group president Kevin Tsujihara ) in Rocksteady stock .
“ The biggest gap this fills is that it locks in development talent on one of our most valuable pieces of intellectual property for games : Batman . ” Tsujihara explained to the Financial Times .
As a stockholder , Warner Brothers own majority hold over Traveller ’s Tales ( for their Lego - izing of Batman ) , Snowblind Entertainment ( The Lord of the Rings ) , and Midway ( Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe ) .
This is the sixth post in an article series about MIT 's Linear Algebra course .
In this post I will review lecture six on column spaces and null spaces of matrices .
The lecture first reviews vector spaces and subspaces and then looks at the result of intersect and union of vector subspaces , and finds out when Ax=b and Ax=0 can be solved .
Here is a list of the previous posts in this article series :
Lecture 6 : Column Space and Null Space
Lecture six starts with a reminder of what the vector space requirements are .
If vectors v and w are in the space , then the result of adding them and multiplying them by a number stays in the space .
In other words , all linear combinations of v and w stay in the space .
For example , the 3 - dimensional space R3 is a vector space .
You can take any two vectors in it , add them , and multiply them by a number and they will still be in the same R3 space .
Next , the lecture reminds subspaces .
A subspace of some space is a set of vectors ( including the 0 vector ) that satisfies the same two requirements .
If vectors v and w are in the subspace , then all linear combinations of v and w are in the subspace .
For example , some subspaces of R3 are :
Any plane P through the origin ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) .
Any line L through the origin ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) .
See the previous , lecture 5 , on more examples of spaces on subspaces .
Now suppose we have two subspaces of R3 - plane P and line L. Is the union P?L a subspace ?
No .
Because if we take some vector in P and some vector in L and add them together , we go outside of P and L and that does not satisfy the requirements of a subspace .
What about intersection P?L ?
Is P?L a subspace ?
Yes .
Because it 's either the zero vector or L .
In general , given two subspaces S and T , union S?T is a not a subspace and intersection S?T is a subspace .
The lecture now turns to column spaces of matrices .
The notation for a column space of a matrix A is C( A ) .
For example , given this matrix ,
The column space C( A ) is all the linear combination of the first ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) , the second ( 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 ) and the third column ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) .
That is , C( A ) = { a· ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) + b· ( 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 ) + c·( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) } .
In general , the column space C( A ) contains all the linear combinations of columns of A .
A thing to note here is that C( A ) is a subspace of R4 because the vectors contain 4 components .
Now the key question , does C( A ) fill the whole R4 ?
No .
Because there are only three columns ( to fill the whole R4 we would need exactly 4 columns ) and also because the third column ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) is a sum of first column ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) and second column ( 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 ) .
From this question follows another question , the most important question in the lecture - Does Ax=b have a solution for every right - hand side vector b?
No .
Because the columns are not linearly independent ( the third can be expressed as first + second ) !
Therefore the column space C( A ) is actually a two - dimensional subspace of R4 .
Another important question arises - For which right - hand sides b can this system be solved ?
The answer is : Ax=b can be solved if and only if b is in the column space C( A ) !
It 's because Ax is a combination of columns of A .
If b is not in this combination , then there is simply no way we can express it as a combination .
That 's why we are interested in column spaces of matrices .
They show when can systems of equation Ax=b be solved .
Now the lecture turns to null spaces of matrices .
The notation for a null space of a matrix A is N ( A ) .
Let 's keep the same matrix A :
The null space N( A ) contains something completely different than C( N ) .
N( A ) contains all solutions x's that solve Ax=0 .
In this example , N( A ) is a subspace of R3 .
Let 's find the null space of A .
We need to find all x's that solve Ax=0 .
The first one , obviously , is x = ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) .
Another one is x = ( 1 , 1 , - 1 ) .
In general all x's ( c , c , - c ) solve Ax=0 .
The vector ( c , c , - c ) can be rewritten as c·( 1 , 1 , - 1 ) .
Note that the null space c·( 1 , 1 , - 1 ) is a line in R3 .
The lecture ends with a proof that solutions x to Ax=0 always give a subspace .
The first thing to show in the proof is that if x is a solution and x ' is a solution , then their sum x + x ' is a solution :
We need to show that if Ax=0 and Ax ' = 0 then A(x + x ' ) =
0 . This is very simple .
Matrix multiplication allows to separate A(x + x ' ) into Ax + Ax ' = 0 . But Ax=0 and Ax'=0 .
Therefore 0 + 0 = 0 .
The second thing to show is that if x is a solution , then c·x is a solution :
We need to show that if Ax=0 then A ( c·x ) =0 .
This is again very simple .
Matrix multiplication allows to bring c from A ( c·x ) outside c·A( x ) = c·0 = 0 .
That 's it .
We have proven that solutions x to Ax=0 always form a subspace .

The fair and balanced network has a little problem , I believe , and one that the media never seem to address .
If they are just another news organization and are defended by Howard Kurtz and Jack Tapper as such , then why do they employ almost the entire field of Republican presidential candidates for 2012 ?
At this point in time the leading candidates are :
So far Romney is n't on the Fox News dole yet , but how long will it be before he gets his own time slot in some form before 2012 rolls along ?
Huckabee has his own one hour show on weekends , Sarah Palin juts got hired and is making the rounds on the FNC shows so she can be trained for the future , and Newt is a fixture on the network as the conservative basher - in - chief and thought to be the next Reagan by some of their hosts .
Let 's not forget that they immediately hired Karl Rove as their master strategist when he left George W. Bush 's side .
This is just plain wrong in so many ways .
And the media remains silent except for quick mentions about it .
Howard Fineman rightly calls Ailes a " kingmaker " and you can see that that 's his goal .
Politics , like nature , abhors a vacuum — which is why God created Roger Ailes .
The president of Fox News is , by default , the closest thing there is to a kingmaker in Anti-Obama America .
And that , in turn , makes him the de facto leader of the GOP .
In a relentless ( and spectacularly successful ) hunt for cable ratings , Ailes has given invaluable publicity to the tea partiers , furnished tryout platforms to GOP candidates , and trained a fire hose of populist anger at the president and his allies in Congress .
While Beltway Republicans wring their hands or write their tracts , Ailes has worked the countryside , using his feel for Main Street resentment to attract and give voice to this year 's angriest — and most powerful — voter - viewers : those who hate the Feds , the Fed , and the Ivy League .
It was Ailes who put the " party " in the tea parties by giving them a round - the - clock national stage .
Next month Fox will have priority access to the National Tea Party Convention in Nashville .
Ailes already has been leading the charge to tear down President Obama and has been very successful at that so far .
In a year they have changed the political narrative when conservatism and the GOP were in shambles and the country was in meltdown .
They were aided by a horrendous economy created by Bush and his conservative cronies of course that Obama inherited .
The president has also left his base in the dark too , but FOX News is a real threat to the democratic process in America .
PERIOD .
I 'm not just talking about having a conservative point of view .
They created an entire political movement called the tea party movement and not a word from the media about this .
Even on TV today , pundits and pols call them a wild card in politics , but that 's silly , They make Newt Gingrich look like a moderate republican .
When has a media outlet ever turned into an activist organization for one political party and recruited members by sending their hosts on location to do so ?
I have n't heard the media complain either that FOX is the only network that has access to the teabagger convention .
Once again the Aile 's machine chugs along and our country suffers for it as the MSM remains mute .
Today , Langer ’s studies are required reading in introductory psychology courses , and her work has inspired a generation of leading behavioral researchers who are rethinking human thought itself .
But Langer herself has taken a different tack .
As her intellectual successors publish research studies , she has transformed herself into almost an advertisement for her own work , setting out to spread the word about the power of mindfulness .
Nearly a decade ago , she took up painting , pursuing it , as she pursues everything , as mindfully as possible ; today her canvases , many of them whimsical portraits of her pet dogs , show in well - reputed galleries and sell for thousands of dollars .
She has long been at work on a book on mindfulness and tennis , a sport she plays avidly .
And her recent books are concerned less with how mindfulness works than how we all might better use it to improve our lives .
experiments that expose the strange power of the mind to fool itself and to transform the body .
In one of her best - known studies , she found that giving nursing home residents more control over their lives made them live longer .
In more recent work , she made hotel maids lose weight simply by telling them that their work burned as many calories as a typical workout .
And in the study at the center of the Aniston movie , a team led by Langer found that instructing a group of elderly men to talk and act as if they were 20 years younger could reverse the aging process .
While other researchers might blanch at the Hollywoodization of their work , for Langer it ’s almost an organic development - part of a long journey to bring the message of her research to the masses .
Langer ’s reputation in the field of social psychology rests on a set of ingenious
Langer is a famous psychologist poised to get much more famous , but not in the ways most researchers do .
She is best known for two things : her concept of mindlessness - the idea that much of what we believe to be rational thought is in fact just our brains on autopilot - and her concept of mindfulness , the idea that simply paying attention to our everyday lives can make us happier and healthier .
She was Harvard ’s first tenured woman professor of psychology , and her discoveries helped trigger , among other things , the burgeoning positive - psychology movement .
Her 1989 book , “ Mindfulness , ” was an international bestseller , and she remains in high demand as a speaker everywhere from New York ’s 92d Street Y to the leadership guru Tony Robbins ’s Fiji resort .
And now a movie about her life is in development with Jennifer Aniston signed on to star as Langer .
STOCKBRIDGE - The Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health is housed in a former Jesuit seminary built in the 1950s , on a rise with broad views of the Berkshires .
The long hallways have the institutional feel of a high school , except that everyone is speaking in respectful tones , and rolled yoga mats are everywhere , like baguettes in Doisneau ’s Paris .
On the walls are limited - edition photographs of lean people doing yoga in front of moss - dappled Indian shrines .
At the gift shop on an early February weekend , visitors could have their tarot read , or a photographic portrait taken of their aura .
And one of the featured speakers , offering a weekend - long seminar , was a senior professor at Harvard University , Ellen Langer .
At the time , the dominant view in the field of psychology assumed that human decision - making was a thoroughly logical process , driven by a constant calculation of probabilities and costs and benefits .
The reaction to that botched deal made Langer suspect something very different .
As Langer sees it , it ’s the pervasiveness of mindless behavior that makes mindfulness so powerful , and her earliest research focused on the former .
Her doctoral dissertation , at Yale , grew out of a poker game with some colleagues .
One round , the dealer accidentally skipped someone .
“ Everyone went crazy , ” Langer recalls .
It was out of the question , she learned , to simply give the skipped person the next card and proceed with the deal .
She began to wonder why people were so attached to “ their ” cards even when they had no idea whether they were good or bad .
As advice , it was not revolutionary .
But as the morning went on , and Langer described the research on which she had built her particular worldview , a sense emerged of just how powerful she thought the mind could be .
In responding to each , Langer returned to a similar point : Each of these complaints was born of mindlessness .
They were instinctual responses rather than thoughtful engagement .
Why not see the time alone at breakfast as a gift ?
Would the young mother rather have a child who blindly followed orders ?
And surely there was something interesting and redeemable to be found in the in - laws .
The night before , Langer had asked participants to think of someone or something that bothered them .
She started the morning by asking what they had come up with .
One woman said her husband was always late for breakfast , another described her child ’s “ defying ” behavior , another made what sounded like a veiled complaint about her in - laws .
“ I do n’t think I ’ve ever envied anybody .
If someone has something , I can , too , ” Langer announced to her Kripalu seminar during the Saturday morning session .
Dressed in slim black slacks and a black , tunic - like cardigan , she stood before 65 people , mostly women , in a lofty , barn - shaped room that had once been the seminary ’s main chapel .
“ I do research , but my research is not designed to be a description .
It rarely says what is , but what can be , ” she told me at Kripalu .
For some psychologists , mantras like these make Langer less a social scientist than a guru .
She treats research and writing - the day - to - day work of most psychologists - with a pronounced cavalierness , neglecting to publish results even when they strike her as interesting .
At times she sounds suspicious of the very idea of scientific evidence .
What she is practicing , she says , is a different brand of psychology , “ the psychology of possibility . ”
“ Things are not good or bad , ” she repeated to her audience at Kripalu , “ What ’s good or bad are the views we take of things . ”
To test this , she ran a study in which she set up a lottery and varied the terms by which people got their tickets .
She found that subjects valued their tickets much more when they were allowed to choose them , even though that did nothing to increase their chances of winning .
She called this “ the illusion of control . ”
Langer followed this up by looking at the often meaningless factors that determine how people evaluate information .
In one study , conducted with Benzion Chanowitz and Arthur Blank , she had experimenters approach people who were using a Xerox machine and ask to cut in to make copies .
They found that people were more likely to let someone cut if offered a reason - but , intriguingly , it did not matter if the reason made sense .
People were as receptive to a meaningless reason ( “ to make copies ” ) as a valid one ( “ I ’m in a rush ” ) .
“ It is not that people do n’t hear the request , ” Langer wrote in “ Mindfulness , ” “ they simply do n’t think about it actively . ”
These findings broke open the field of social psychology .
“ It was a huge corrective , ” says John Bargh , a psychologist at Yale known for his work on “ automaticity ” and thought .
He remembers reading the Xerox machine study as a graduate student : “ That just lit me up .
It opened my eyes and everything was off to the races after that . ”
For Bargh and others , Langer ’s research cleared the way for a whole new model of how people really think and decide , one that replaced the cold inner logician with a rich tangle that incorporated emotion , evolution , and the particularities of the human body .
Researchers like Daniel Gilbert , Antonio Damasio , and Dan Ariely saw mindless behavior as a trove of clues , and in many cases , psychologists discovered that there could be a value to “ mindlessness ” - our seemingly irrational instincts were not only quicker , but often more accurate than our more considered ruminations .
Langer , on the other hand , thought mindlessness was harmful .
Not paying attention to their lives , as she saw it , made people bored and careless , prejudiced and complacent ; it stunted innovation and led to catastrophic errors among pilots and soldiers and surgeons .
She did n’t see mindlessness as a window into the brain .
She saw it as a condition to be cured .
So Langer began to study its opposite .
She called it “ mindfulness , ” a term that was being independently adopted around the same time by doctors and therapists embracing the Buddhist practice of mindful meditation .
Langer ’s definition was something more everyday - that we simply need to go through life paying better attention to it .
She began to focus her work on the question of what difference that might make .
Here 's the copy cat manufacturer business model :
1. Blatantly copy designs that required substantial research expenses for your competitors to produce .
2 . Set up a cash cow business whereby you undercut your competitors with copy cat products that sell for less due to lower labor and design costs .
3 . Then use the cash flow from your cash cow to develop even better products than your competitors .
It 's the viciously competitive ( and borderline intellectual - property - infringing ) avenue by which many Asian manufacturers have moved up the value chain .
( Toyota included , who is now a victim of the practice )
Caing has an excellent article outlining how BYD , the Chinese auto and battery company that Warren Buffett has famously invested in , executed just such a strategy .
Caing :
Last May , the city of Xian started switching its taxi fleet to the BYD F3 car , which at first glance could be confused with a Toyota Corolla .
Indeed , the F3 is an inside - outside copy of the Japanese manufacturer 's small car but costs only half as much .
BYD is n't shy about its business practices .
In the F3's introductory period , the company marketing department touted Corolla similarities as a sales point .
At some service centers in the city of Zhengzhou , F3 owners could spend a few hundred yuan to have the exterior badge swapped with a Toyota logo .
And last year , after just five years in production , annual F3 sales reached 300,000 units , making it one of China 's best - selling cars .
To develop good cars in the shortest time possible , BYD spends tens of millions of yuan every year buying and then dismantling the newest models built by manufacturers around the world .
That 's also how Wang set up the company 's first battery production line .
In those early years , a fully automated Ni-Cd battery production line from Sanyo cost tens of millions of yuan , so Wang decided to make one himself .
He reverse - engineered the setup for an identical production line that cost only about 1 million yuan .
Of course , for a manufacturer to become a leader , rather than just an imitator , they have to perform item # 3 above , which is the most difficult .
Yet BYD seems to be now developing new innovative battery technology well ahead of auto leaders ... all funded by its copy cat cash cow products .
Copying was in Wang 's blood .
After a 2003 visit to BYD's Songjiang laboratory in Shanghai , for example , a former Chery Auto expert noted that he saw only two pieces of lab equipment that had been imported ; the rest were Chinese - made imitations of foreign equipment .
How can simple imitation win a market ?
The Chery veteran said BYD strategy 's is based on focus , brazenness and precision .
Rather than waste effort creating new models for the sake of variety , a limited number of resources are spent on developing key products .
That 's the company 's focus .
As a brazen market player , BYD picks best - selling products and blatantly copies them , head to toe .

Murder , She Wrote
Handwriting analysis may reveal dishonesty
A new study adds “ writing with large strokes and applying high pressure on paper ” to the list of telltale signs that someone might be lying .
Researchers at Haifa University in Israel could tell whether or not students were writing the truth by analyzing these physical properties of their handwriting .
Lying requires more cognitive resources than being truthful , says lead author Gil Luria .
“ You need to invent a story , make sure not to contradict yourself , et cetera . ”
Any task done simultaneously , therefore , becomes less automatic .
Tabletop pressure sensors showed this effect in the students ’ handwriting , which became more belabored when they fibbed .
Handwriting analysis could eventually complement other lie detection methods and would add a new dimension because , unlike almost all other techniques , it does n’t rely on verbal communication , Luria says .
Electric Surprise
Stimulating brain cells may be trickier than we thought
Scientists and doctors have long used electricity to both study and treat the brain .
But a report in the August 27 , 2009 , issue of Neuron indicates that the brain ’s response to electricity is exceptionally complex .
Using a new type of optical imaging , Harvard Medical School researchers observed neurons as they were stimulated by an electrode .
Instead of activating a small sphere of surrounding neurons as expected , the electrodes caused sparse strings of neurons to fire across the brain .
The finding suggests that brain surgeons and the designers of neural prosthetics have a much smaller margin of error than previously thought — shifting an electrode even slightly could activate an entirely different set of neurons .

A heart attack deprives the heart of oxygen causing permanent damage Temporarily stopping blood flow in the arm prevents damage in people having a heart attack , a Danish study has shown .
It is thought the procedure " kick - starts " natural mechanisms in the heart to counter the lack of oxygen .
In a study of around 150 patients , those who were treated this way in the ambulance on the way to hospital sustained less damage to heart tissue .
The British Heart Foundation said The Lancet study was " interesting " but more research was needed .
The Danish researchers said they had carried out the experiment in patients who were having a large heart attack because their coronary artery was blocked , preventing blood reaching the heart .
More research is now needed to find out if this treatment results in better recovery and ongoing clinical benefit
Fotini Rozakeas , British Heart Foundation
These patients are transferred directly to large specialist hospitals where a balloon can be quickly inserted into the artery to clear the blockage and restore blood flow .
In the study , paramedics used a standard blood pressure cuff to cut off the blood supply in a patient 's arm for five minutes .
They repeated this procedure four times with a five - minute break in between each time .
Once at hospital , the patient was injected with a radioactive material which allows doctors to see which parts of the heart had sustained damage from lack of oxygen .
The researchers took a final look at damage to heart tissue 30 days after the operation to restore heart function .
Protection
They found that those whose blood supply had been articificially restricted as part of this study ended up with less tissue damage to the heart .
Study leader Professor Hans Botker , from Aarhus University Hospital , said it had already been shown that you could " warm up " the heart by depriving it of oxygen for short periods to enable it to resist damage .
But what this study suggests is the effect can be reproduced by depriving a " distant organ " , such as the arm , of oxygen .
" This seems to kick - start the organs ' own protective mechanisms , " he said .
" Stopping blood flow to the arm suggests to the heart that there is something wrong and that seems to cause some extra protection . "
He added that more research is needed before the technique can be used widely in patients .
" We need to clarify whether there is a clinical benefit to the patient in reducing deaths and the incidence of heart failure . "
Fotini Rozakeas , cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation , said the phenomenon had been shown to protect the heart muscle from damage when applied shortly before planned heart surgery .
" This interesting , yet small , study suggests that is also effective in reducing damage to heart muscle in patients who have had a suspected heart attack and are about to be treated with angioplasty .
" More research is now needed to find out if this treatment results in better recovery and ongoing clinical benefit .
" If so , it will pave the way for this simple , cheap and effective technique to be adopted more widely , in ambulances or in hospital . "

But the smarts do n't stop there .
Different bullets register different amounts of electricity with the piezoelectric sensors .
Using data from those electric charges , TARDEC researchers are developing complex algorithms that can determine what size round is striking the armor , giving soldiers the added benefit of knowing what kind of weaponry the enemy is packing .
Meanwhile , though the amount of electricity generated from each bullet strike is very low , researchers are looking at ways to harness it , perhaps using it to power other kinds of sensors .

Requisiti di sistema :
It all began when Burbank software engineer Jim Bumgardner decided he wanted to be mayor of the North Pole .
Bumgardner , who was checking into the Hill Street Cafe in Burbank , was a new recruit to fast - growing Foursquare , one of the major players in a new social networking space that lets users “ check in ” and alert friends to their current location .
Foursquare is the successor to Dodgeball , which Dennis Crowley started in 2004 and sold a year later to Google .
Google killed the service .
So Crowley kicked it off again with business partner Naveen Selvadurai last March during South by Southwest , the annual technology and musical festival .
You earn “ badges ” for checking into venues .
One of the chief goals of Foursquare is to become “ mayor ” of a particular location .
The better the location , the greater the bragging rights .
So it was only be a matter of time before players started bending the rules .
Bumgardner , 47 , who is also a part - time teacher , author and musician , may have been the first to blog about it .
Bumgardner , who has been interested in social media since the mid-1990s , has been using Foursquare since January .
He says it took a few weeks for him to warm up to the service , which he initially thought was “ annoying . ”
“ It definitely gets more appealing when you start earning badges and mayorships , ” he said .
He started cheating on Feb . 7 .
" Basically I thought it would be funny if I could add the ‘ North Pole ’ to my list of mayorships , and I started to wonder how to pull it off , ” he said in an e-mail interview .
“ Once I got started on that project , I realized how ridiculous the Foursquare security was .
I tried to imagine a variety of different ways that someone more malicious than I could exploit the foursquare service , and I tried a few of them out , one - by - one .
My goal was to eventually reveal my findings , so Foursquare would be motivated to tighten their security .
But obviously I was having a bit of fun during my land grab .
“ I realized I could not only grab the North Pole , but possess most of the major world landmarks -- the Statue of Liberty , Mount Rushmore , The Taj Mahal , ala Dr. Evil -- by writing a script to check into them every day .
“ I imagined a scam in which someone could ‘ frame ’ a celebrity by creating fake accounts and having them check into seedy venues , so I tried my hand at that .
I realized that any visitor to the Martha Stewart show , or her office building , who was also a foursquare user , would encounter the fake account I had created for her , and discover that ‘ Martha ’ had been visiting pawn shops , and 99 - cent stores .
Similarly , any visitor to the Kodak theater would discover my fake ‘ Simon ’ account .
I thought it was important to demonstrate this scam , so that Foursquare would eventually take steps to prevent it .
“ I realized the security was so poor , that I could probably take over every single Starbucks as ubiquitous as they are .
So I created a set of ‘ Java Monkey ’ bots that grabbed about 120 in a single week .
If I had made a few more of them , and left them turned on , I would have eventually grabbed every single Starbucks .
This exploit could be used by rival businesses to ‘ poison ’ the venues of their competitors , or used as a platform for malicious advertising .
" By the end of the week , I had about 10 scripts , each operating different accounts , running in the background on my laptop , each one checking into a different venue every 20 minutes or so .
After a week of this kind of stuff , I discovered the simple ‘ boat ’ hack , and started giving people boats ( you add the tag " boat " to an airport , and every Foursquare user who checks into the airport gets the ‘ I 'm on a boat ! ’ badge ) .
On Monday while eating breakfast with his wife at the same diner where he conceived the “ North Pole ” idea , he realized his job was done .
So he headed home to share with the world what he had learned .
The blog post went viral .
Crowley responded in a comment .
As Foursquare closes in on 500,000 users , cheating has increased , he said .
“ There ’s a weird balance between a social utility ( ‘ find your friends ’ ) and a social game ( ‘ most checkins gets your on the leaderboard !’ ) that we ’re still working on figuring out .
On one hand , we want everyone to be able to check - in from anywhere on any device .
We ’ve never liked the idea of creating a service that only your coolest friends with the coolest phones could use so we made sure any user on any phone would be able to check - in ( SMS. mobile_web )
On the other hand , the social game really works best when you can rely on GPS accuracy to police the checkins – if you ’re not really there , you should n’t get credit for being there , right ?
" But what ’s more valuable – a system in which everyone can play and participate ?
Or a system that places emphasis on the validity of each checkin / post at the expense of all inclusiveness ?
I think the thing that makes fourssquare so interesting – and yet so difficult – is that it wants to be both things at the same time .
And if you survey users , just as many use it for finding their friends as they do for trying to get points / badges / mayorships .
“ At Foursquare , I think we still have some thinking to do on this .
We do see a lot of fake checkins ( yes , we log and flag them … i think 2 - 3 % of total checkins were “ fake ” last time we checked ) and there are a few bad apples that like to steal mayorships from their couch .
We ’ve been punting on addressing this because it requires removing some of the magic from foursquare ( mayors , points , badges ) for users with non-GPS phones .
“ We often wonder why people ‘ cheat ’ when there ’s really nothing to win – it ’s not like we ’re giving away trips to Hawaii or Ford Fiestas over here .
But I guess the combo of mayorships , local recognition and , hey , maybe a free slice of pizza is a little too much for some people to live without . :) ”

In 1989 , VH1 gave away 36 vintage Corvettes in a contest .
The winner sold those cars to artist Peter Max , who let them rot in a Brooklyn parking garage for twenty years .
The cars recently disappeared .
This is their story .
Advertisement
Thanks to the smart work of Daniel McDermon over at the New York Times , we 're finally piecing together a story that we had heard snippets of for years but never nailed down .
In 1988 , VH1 was struggling for ratings .
As part of a publicity stunt , the music video network spent a truckload of money on 36 vintage Corvettes .
The cars were given away in a telephone sweepstakes the next year , and one winner walked off with the complete set .
Advertisement
The contest was the brainchild of freelance TV producer Jim Cahill .
VH1 charged him with the task of raising the network 's national profile and attracting the then - vibrant baby - boomer demographic .
He came up with the idea — give away one car from every year of the Corvette 's three - and - a - half - decade history — while sitting on the freeway in Los Angeles .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
What followed was a buying spree of epic proportions .
Over the course of several months in 1988 , Cahill spent $ 610,000 — roughly $ 1.1 million when adjusted for inflation — of VH1's money on what must have seemed like the automotive purchasing orgy of a lifetime .
According to a period article in Vette magazine , the 36 cars that he bought were " drivers , " not " Bloomington cars . "
Fourteen were convertibles , and 25 of the 36 contained automatic transmissions ( eww ) .
Cahill shepherded the cars from commercial shoot to commercial shoot , kept them fastidiously clean , and generally went to town with the whole mess .
He also did what any of us would do — he drove one home each night for 36 nights .
( He has since noted that , although some of the cars were healthy and drove well , many of them were nightmarishly bad . )
To facilitate the contest and help recoup some of the investment , VH1 set up a 900 number that charged two dollars per call .
Prospective entrants called the number to register , and AT&T gave the network $ 1.49 from every call .
190,000 people called in the first day , 1.3 million registered in total , and VH1 made its money back in less than two weeks .
Amazingly , the contest was won by Dennis Amadeo , a carpenter from Long Island who entered only once .
He flew to California and was given the five - pound bag of keys by ex-Beach Boy Mike Love in a ceremony in Culver City .

This is where it gets weird .
Enter Peter Max .
Max , a Manhattan - dwelling American graphic artist responsible for a large part of the 1960s pyschedelic design movement , was , and is not , a car guy .
He gained fame for his " Cosmic ' 60s " style and use of vibrant color , and while he has painted everything from a Boeing 777 to Dale Earnhardt 's NASCAR Monte Carlo , he is n't the type of celebrity to have a Lenoesque garage full of automotive weirdness .
Advertisement

Nevertheless , he bought the cars from Amadeo .
As he tells it , he found out about the collection through a friend , fell asleep shortly after , and had a dream that included cheerleaders , the 36 ' vettes , and a stadium full of people yelling " They 're Peter Max 's cars ! "
Naturally , when he woke up , he got out his wallet .
( We make our spontaneous , million - dollar decisions based on REM sleep , too .
Does n't everybody ? )
Max contacted Amadeo , made a deal — $ 250,000 cash plus $ 250,000 in artwork and a portion of the proceeds should the cars be sold again — and , despite a few reservations , had the Corvettes shipped to New York .
Cahill facilitated the preparation and handover of all 36 cars , ensuring that they were both clean and driveable when they were put on the truck .
Advertisement
This is where it starts to get depressing : Because Max was then involved in a number of different projects ( not the least of which was an IRS investigation ) , the Corvettes sat , were moved , and then sat again .
They eventually ended up in the basement of a Brooklyn apartment building that had once been a New York Daily News printing plant .
They sat there , gathering dust , for years .
Advertisement
It would not be an exaggeration to say that Max 's cars were left to rot , nor that he essentially abandoned them .
They remained largely hidden until May of 2005 , when a New York magazine writer discovered them and wrote a column .
A member of the enthusiast forum Digital Corvettes read the column , got interested , and went to take a look .
When he posted pictures , the Internet went nuts .
The people who lived in the ' vettes ' apartment building soon complained , bitching and moaning because their valuable Big Apple parking spaces were being taken up by a celebrity 's fiberglass junkyard .
A handful of Digital Corvettes members , including site owner Patrick Gramm , went to New York to find the cars , take a quasi- legal look , and get some questions answered .
( Big - block cars ?
Rare options ?
A '53 ? )
Countless people wrote emails and forum posts , offering to maintain the cars for free just so they would n't rot away .
No one listened , Max remained mum , and nothing happened until a few weeks ago , when the cars disappeared .
Advertisement
That , too , prompted an uprising .
The collection was so provocative that the New York Times ran a story and several blog posts on it , even going so far as to get David Burroughs , the CEO of Bloomington Gold , to issue a sight - unseen appraisal on the lot .
( $ 840,000 , for the record . )
A tenant in the apartment building in question tweeted about the cars ' disapparance , expressing joy .
A Times writer ( the aforementioned McDermon ) also lived in the building , and his curiosity prompted him to do extensive research , dig up Cahill , and talk to Max .
The result was fairly predictable :
The Corvettes were in a new , undisclosed location ;
Max still planned to do something with them but was waiting on financial backing ; and Cahill was a bit sad .
And that , it seemed , was that .
Or not .
HERE'S THE COOLEST PART : The Digital Corvettes community got its shit together and found the cars .
Their new hiding place was discovered by a forum member .
The following images appeared on DC two days ago :
... as did , predictably , a new round of outrage .
Max 's plans ?
He wants to buy 14 more cars , bringing the collection to an even 50 examples and the 2003 model year .
He also told the New York Times that he wants to paint the cars in a more respectful manner and auction them off .
Cahill came out of the woodwork , signing up for a Digital Corvettes membership and spilling the beans on the collection 's early days .
( Random depression : Max 's shippers did n't even want the car covers . )
And we are , like everyone else , a little sad .
Advertisement
There is a lesson here , but we 'll be damned if we know what it is .
Regardless , one thing is for sure :
No matter who you are , you should n't buy a passel of Corvettes if you 're going to let them fester in a basement .
And Max , if you 're out there , listen up :
When people offer to fix your cars for free , you listen .
Do us a favor and stop hiding your fiberglass light under a bushel , huh ?

UPDATE : We received the following from Jim Cahill after publishing this post .
It contains a small correction ( we had originally noted that he was not a Corvette enthusiast ) and a description of how the 36 - car giveaway came to be .
( CNN ) -- Producing electricity using the power of the oceans could start a new wave in renewable energy .
But some fear that " wave farms " could damage the livelihoods of fishermen by rendering coastal waters off limits .
Hydropower accounts for 19 percent of the world 's electricity , according to the U.S. Geological Survey , and mainly uses the power of falling water at man-made dams .
But wave power is still an untapped resource , which some believe could one day generate a tenth of the world 's renewable energy .
Off the coast of Hawaii , Ocean Power Technologies ( OPT ) is looking to produce electricity using the island 's famously wild surf .
The U.S. Navy is backing OPT 's research on the PowerBuoy 40 -- a wave energy converter that is 16 meters high and 14 meters in diameter , most of which is submerged in the ocean .
A float on the PowerBuoy bobs up and down with the waves , working an internal plunger that is connected to a hydraulic pump .
The pump drives a generator to produce electricity , which can be sent to the shore via an underwater cable .
Once it 's connected to the energy grid this spring the buoy will produce 40 kilowatts ( kW ) of electricity -- enough to power 20 to 25 homes .
Charles Dunleavy , CEO of OPT , told CNN , " One of the big advantages of wave energy is it 's close to shore , and as you look around the world the majority of the world 's population is very close to shore . "
He added that wave power has advantages over other types of renewable energy .
" Sun comes and goes and during the nighttime you can't get any solar power for your photovoltaics .
Wind energy is also intermittent , but wave energy is constant and continuous . "
OPT is already working on the next generation of PowerBuoys .
The PB150 is larger than the model being used in Hawaii and will generate 150kW .
Once worked is finished on the PB150 OPT says it will install several at a site off the coast of Oregon , in the northwestern United States .
It says the Oregon coast has the potential to house wave farms that could produce 100 megawatts of power .
Columbia Power Technologies is another commercial wave energy company with its sights set on Oregon .
It hopes its own wave energy buoy will be in the waters off Oregon in 2012 .
But fishing is big business in Oregon .
The Dungeness crab industry alone is worth around $ 80 million per year and some fear that plans for wave farms could make no - go zones of vast stretches of prime fishing waters .
Nick Furman is director of Oregon 's Dungeness crab commission .
He told CNN , " We 've kind of accepted the fact that even though it 's prime habitat for Dungeness crab , we 're going to have to put those 10 buoys out in the water .
" Our biggest fear is that if it were to be successful , and if the development money was available , instead of fishing boats all we saw was buoys bobbing up and down . "
When it comes to harvesting the power of the oceans , buoys are n't the only technology making waves .
In 2008 , Scottish company Pelamis Wave Power opened the world 's first commercial wave farm off the coast of Agucadoura in north Portugal .
Pelamis Wave Energy Converters are made up of four tubular sections .
As they move in the waves their motion is resisted by hydraulic rams , which pump high - pressure fluid through hydraulic motors , driving generators to produce up to 750 kW of electricity .
Although the Agucadoura project ran into technical problems , Pelamis is now working on a new wave machine , P2 , which it plans to install off Orkney , in northern Scotland .
While wave power remains relatively expensive to produce , the field is still in its infancy and prices are expected to fall as the technology develops .
Robert Paasch , director of the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center , in the United States , told CNN , " Wave energy right now we 're estimating is around 50 cents a kilowatt hour , but what we expect to see is a curve much like we saw with wind .
" Thirty years ago wind energy cost about 50 cents a kilowatt hour and it's now down in the seven to five cents range , where it 's competitive with a lot of carbon - based sources . "
What do you think ?
Will wave power ever be cheap enough to compete with fossil fuels ?
Do you see wave farms as a valuable renewable resource or a blot on our oceans ?

In 2009 , we established the Symbian Foundation to make the Symbian platform available open source and royalty - free .
In November 2010 we announced that the foundation would ramp down its operational activities as a result of changes in global economic and market conditions .
We have now completed the transition from a non-profit organisation responsible for governing the open development and curation of the Symbian platform , to a licensing entity with no permanent staff .
Moving forward , the foundation is responsible only for specific licensing and legal frameworks put in place during the open sourcing of the platform .
The Symbian platform will continue to evolve under Nokia , who have started to make the future development of the platform available via an alternative direct and open model .
You can find more information on Nokia ’s plans for Symbian at http://symbian.nokia.com.
Forum Nokia is the best place to access developer support for Symbian , including tools , documentation , technical support , and discussion boards .
We would like to extend our deepest thanks to everyone who contributed to the major milestones achieved at the Symbian Foundation .
We can all be proud of these accomplishments – some not seen before in the history of computing , such as the completion of the largest transition to open source of any commercial codebase in software history .
We would also like to extend warm thanks to the entire member community for their continued commitment to the Symbian platform .
We are confident that these are absolutely the right changes in the context of today ’s market and economy , and we look forward to watching a new era of success for the Symbian platform unfold .
As you may remember , last week I referred to the Dewey Decimal Classification system , used by libraries worldwide to organize books .
While it is n’t for me on my home shelves , I must admit to being slightly obsessed with it as a child : after all , what could be more geeky than dividing everything into 10 categories , then dividing those into 10 more categories , and then dividing those into 10 more categories .
( My only qualm , using a young boy ’s logic , was that it seemed ridiculous that the vast majority of sports could be covered simply by the number 796 : in my system , sport would have had 100 numbers to itself at least . )
It seems I ’m not alone : the Dewey system is at the heart of what I ’m declaring the geekiest hotel in the world : New York ’s Library Hotel .
Not only is the entire hotel themed around books and art , but its 10 guest floors are individually themed to the 10 main classes of Dewey categories .
Even better , each of the six rooms on a particular floor are assigned a sub-category and then filled with books and artworks on the subject .
Of course , it would n’t be a proper geeky hotel without a mistake which visitors could pick up upon .
In this case it ’s that the numbering system only corresponds with Dewey as far as the floor .
So , for example , room 506 ( or rather 500.006 ) is themed on astronomy when , technically speaking , it should be based around organizations and management .
That ’s because the room numbers actually signify the size of room rather than the content .
There are also a few liberties taken with the floors .
With the lowest two floors of the hotel not available to guests , the 000 , 100 and 200 categories are housed on floors 10 through 12 .
And “ Computer science , information & general works ” is rebranded simply as general knowledge .
Space being tight in New York , these concessions are understandable .
But I would love to see an eccentric billionaire take the concept to Vegas and open a hotel with a thousand rooms to cover the entire Dewey system .
After all , who would n’t want to stay in rooms 369 ( Miscellaneous kinds of associations ) , 628 ( Sanitary & municipal engineering ) or 636 ( Animal husbandry ) ?
If you do get tired of books , the rooms also contain a DVD player and movies taken from the American Film Institute ’s choice of the 100 greatest moves of the 20th century .
And if for some strange reason you should feel the need to leave the hotel , the New York Public Library is only a couple of blocks away .
Oh , and if you were wondering , the most requested room at the hotel is 800.001 which , in this case , houses erotic fiction .
People all have their own ideas of what a time machine would look like .
If you are a fan of the 1960 movie version of H. G. Wells ’s classic novel , it would be a steampunk sled with a red velvet chair , flashing lights , and a giant spinning wheel on the back .
For those whose notions of time travel were formed in the 1980s , it would be a souped - up stainless steel sports car .
Details of operation vary from model to model , but they all have one thing in common :
When someone actually travels through time , the machine ostentatiously dematerializes , only to reappear many years in the past or future .
And most people could tell you that such a time machine would never work , even if it looked like a DeLorean .
They would be half right :
That is not how time travel might work , but time travel in some other form is not necessarily off the table .
Since time is kind of like space ( the four dimensions go hand in hand ) , a working time machine would zoom off like a rocket rather than disappearing in a puff of smoke .
Einstein described our universe in four dimensions : the three dimensions of space and one of time .
So traveling back in time is nothing more or less than the fourth - dimensional version of walking in a circle .
All you would have to do is use an extremely strong gravitational field , like that of a black hole , to bend space - time .
From this point of view , time travel seems quite difficult but not obviously impossible .
These days , most people feel comfortable with the notion of curved space - time .
What they trip up on is actually a more difficult conceptual problem , the time travel paradox .
This is the worry that someone could go back in time and change the course of history .
What would happen if you traveled into the past , to a time before you were born , and murdered your parents ?
Put more broadly , how do we avoid changing the past as we think we have already experienced it ?
At the moment , scientists do n’t know enough about the laws of physics to say whether these laws would permit the time equivalent of walking in a circle — or , in the parlance of time travelers , a “ closed timelike curve . ”
If they do n’t permit it , there is obviously no need to worry about paradoxes .
If physics is not an obstacle , however , the problem could still be constrained by logic .
Do closed timelike curves necessarily lead to paradoxes ?
If they do , then they cannot exist , simple as that .
Logical contradictions cannot occur .
More specifically , there is only one correct answer to the question “ What happened at the vicinity of this particular event in space - time ? ”
Something happens :
You walk through a door , you are all by yourself , you meet someone else , you somehow never showed up , whatever it may be .
And that something is whatever it is , and was whatever it was , and will be whatever it will be , once and forever .
If , at a certain event , your grandfather and grandmother were getting it on , that ’s what happened at that event .
There is nothing you can do to change it , because it happened .
You can no more change events in your past in a space - time with closed timelike curves than you can change events that already happened in ordinary space - time , with no closed timelike curves .
As we will see , the time travel paradox — the possibility of changing our past — seems intractable only because it conflicts with our notion of ourselves as beings with free will .
Consistent stories are possible , even in space - times with closed timelike curves .
To illustrate this point , imagine that you stumble upon a time machine in the form of a gate .
When you pass through it in one direction , it takes you exactly one day into the past ; if you pass through in the other direction , it takes you exactly one day into the future .
You walk up to the gate , where you see an older version of yourself waiting for you .
The two of you exchange pleasantries .
Then you leave your other self behind as you walk through the gate into yesterday .
But instead of obstinately wandering off , you wait around a day to meet up with the younger version of yourself ( you have now aged into the older version you saw the day before ) with whom you exchange pleasantries before going on your way .
Everyone ’s version of every event would be completely consistent .
We can have much more dramatic stories that are nevertheless consistent .
Imagine that we have been appointed Guardian of the Gate , and our job is to keep vigilant watch over who passes through .
One day , as we are standing off to the side , we see a person walk out of the rear side of the gate , emerging from one day in the future .
That ’s no surprise ; it just means that you will see that person enter the front side of the gate tomorrow .
But as you keep watch , you notice that he simply loiters around for one day , and when precisely 24 hours have passed , the traveler walks calmly through the front of the gate .
Nobody ever approached from elsewhere .
That 24 - hour period constitutes the entire life span of this time traveler .
He experiences the same thing over and over again , although he does n’t realize it himself , since he does not accumulate new memories along the way .
Every trip through the gate is precisely the same to him .
That may strike you as weird or unlikely , but there is nothing paradoxical or logically inconsistent about it .
The real question is this :
What happens if we try to cause trouble ?
That is , what if we choose not to go along with the plan ?
Let ’s say you meet a day - older version of yourself just before you cross through the front of the gate and jump backward in time , as if you will hang around for a day to greet yourself in the past .
But once you actually do jump backward in time , you still seem to have a choice about what to do next .
You can obediently fulfill your apparent destiny , or you can cause trouble by wandering off .
What is to stop you from deciding to wander ?
That seems like it would create a paradox .
Your younger self bumped into your older self , but your older self decides not to cooperate , apparently violating the consistency of the story .
We know what the answer is :
That can not happen .
If you met up with an older version of yourself , we know with absolute certainty that once you age into that older self , you will be there to meet your younger self .
That is because , from your personal point of view , that meet - up happened , and there is no way to make it un -happen , any more than we can change the past without any time travel complications .
There may be more than one consistent set of things that could happen at the various events in space - time , but one and only one set of things actually does occur .
Consistent stories happen ; inconsistent ones do not .
The vexing part is understanding what forces us to play along .
The issue that troubles us , when you get down to it , is free will .
We have a strong feeling that we cannot be predestined to do something we choose not to do .
That becomes a difficult feeling to sustain if we have already seen ourselves doing it .
Of course , there are some kinds of predestination we are willing to accept .
If we get thrown out of a window on the top floor of a skyscraper , we expect to hurtle to the ground , no matter how much we would rather fly away and land safely elsewhere .
The much more detailed kind of predestination implied by closed timelike curves , where it seems that we simply cannot make certain choices ( like walking away after meeting a future version of ourselves ) , is bothersome .
The nub of the problem is that you cannot have a consistent “ arrow of time ” in the presence of closed timelike curves .
The arrow of time is simply the distinction between the past and the future .
We can turn an egg into an omelet , but not an omelet into an egg ; we remember yesterday , but not tomorrow ; we are born , grow older , and die , never the reverse .
Scientists explain all of these manifestations of the arrow of time in terms of entropy — loosely , the “ disorderliness ” of a system .
A neatly stacked collection of papers has a low entropy , while the same collection scattered across a desktop has a high entropy .
The entropy of any system left to its own devices will either increase with time or stay constant ; that is the celebrated second law of thermodynamics .
The arrow of time comes down to the fact that entropy increases toward the future and was lower in the past .
A statement like “ We remember the past and not the future ” makes perfect sense to us under ordinary circumstances .
But in the presence of closed timelike curves , some events are in our past and also in our future .
So do we remember such events or not ?
In general , events along a closed timelike curve cannot be compatible with an uninterrupted increase of entropy along the curve .
That ’s a puzzle :
On a closed curve , the entropy has to finish exactly where it started , but the arrow of time says that entropy tends to increase and never decrease .
Something has to give .
To emphasize this point , think about the hypothetical traveler who emerges from the gate , only to enter it from the other side one day later , so that his entire life story is a one - day loop repeated ad infinitum .
Take a moment to contemplate the exquisite level of precision required to pull this off , if we think about the loop as “ starting ” at one point .
The traveler would have to ensure that , one day later , every single atom in his body was in precisely the right place to join up smoothly with his past self .
He would have to make sure , for example , that his clothes did not accumulate a single extra speck of dust that was not there one day earlier .
This seems incompatible with our experience of how entropy increases .
If we merely shook hands with our former selves , rather than joining up with them , the required precision does n’t seem quite so dramatic .
In either case , though , the insistence that we be in the right place at the right time puts a very stringent constraint on our possible future actions .
Our concept of free will is intimately related to the idea that the past may be set in stone , but the future is up for grabs .
Even if we believe that the laws of physics in principle determine the evolution of some particular state of the universe with perfect fidelity , we do n’t know what that state is , and in the real world the increase of entropy is consistent with any number of possible futures .
A closed timelike curve seems to imply predestination :
We know what is going to happen to us in the future because we witnessed it in our past .
Closed timelike curves , in other words , make the future resemble the past .
It is set in stone , not up for grabs at all .
The reason we think the past is fixed once and for all is that there is a boundary condition at the beginning of time .
The entropy of the universe started very small ( at the time of the Big Bang ) and has been growing ever since .
Ordinarily we do not imagine that there is any analogous boundary condition in the future — entropy continues to grow , but we cannot use that information to draw any conclusions .
If we use a closed timelike curve to observe something about our future actions , those actions become predestined .
That ’s extra information about the history of the universe , over and above what we normally glean from the laws of physics , and it makes us uncomfortable .
If closed timelike curves exist , ensuring that all events are consistent is just as strange and unnatural to us as a movie played backward , or any other example of evolution that decreases entropy .
It ’s not impossible ; it ’s just highly unlikely .
So either closed timelike curves cannot exist , or big , macroscopic things cannot travel on truly closed paths through space - time — unless everything we think we know about entropy and the arrow of time is wrong .
Life on a closed timelike curve seems pretty drab .
Once you start moving along such a curve , you are required to come back to precisely the point at which you started .
An observer standing outside , however , has what is seemingly the opposite problem :
What happens along such a curve cannot be uniquely predicted from the prior state of the universe .
We have the strong constraint that evolution along a closed timelike curve must be consistent , but there will always be a large number of consistent evolutions that are possible , and the laws of physics seem powerless to predict which one will actually come to pass .
In the usual way of thinking , the laws of physics function like a computer .
You give as input the present state , and the laws return as output what the state will be one instant later ( or earlier , if we wish ) .
By repeating this process many times , we can build up the entire history of the universe , from start to finish .
In that sense , complete knowledge of the present implies complete knowledge of all of history .
Closed timelike curves would make such a program impossible , as a simple thought experiment reveals .
Hark back to the stranger who appeared out of the gate into yesterday , then jumped back in the other side a day later to form a closed loop .
There would be no way to predict the existence of such a stranger from the state of the universe at an earlier time .
Let ’s say we start in a universe that , at some particular moment , has no closed timelike curves .
The laws of physics purportedly allow us to predict what happens in the future of that moment .
This ability vanishes as soon as someone builds a time machine and creates a closed timelike curve .
Mysterious strangers and other random objects can then appear out of thin air and disappear just as quickly .
We can insist all we like that what happens in the presence of closed timelike curves be consistent .
But that requirement is not enough to make the events predictable , with the future determined by the laws of physics and the state of the universe at one moment in time .
Indeed , closed timelike curves can make it impossible to de-fine “ the universe at one moment in time . ”
Ordinarily we can imagine “ slicing ” our four - dimensional universe into three - dimensional “ moments of time . ”
In the presence of closed timelike curves , though , we generally will not be able to slice space - time that way .
Locally — in the near vicinity of any particular point in space - time — we can always divide events into the “ past ” and the “ future . ”
But we might not be able to do this throughout the universe .
The warping associated with the closed timelike curve could cause our slice to twist back on itself , making it impossible to divide all of space - time into distinct moments .
We would therefore have to abandon the concept of determinism , the idea that the state of the universe at any one time determines the state at all other times .
We would also have to abandon free will — because witnessing part of our future history implies some amount of predestination .
Do we value determinism so highly that we should reject the possibility of closed timelike curves entirely ?
Not necessarily .
We could imagine a different way in which the laws of physics could be formulated — not as a computer that calculates the next moment from the present moment but as a set of conditions that are imposed on the history of the universe as a whole .
It is not clear what such conditions might be , but we have no way of excluding the idea on the basis of pure thought .
All this may sound like vacillation , but it provides an important lesson .
Some of our understanding of time is based on logic and the known laws of physics , but some of it is based purely on convenience and reasonable - sounding assumptions .
We think that the ability to uniquely determine the future from knowledge of our present state is important , but the real world might end up having other ideas .
If physicists discover that closed timelike curves really can exist , we will have to dramatically rethink the way we understand time .
In that case , the universe could not be nicely divided into a series of separate “ moments ” of time .
The ultimate answer to the puzzles raised by closed timelike curves is probably that they simply cannot exist .
If that is true , though , it is because the laws of physics do not let you warp space - time enough to create them — not because they let you kill your grandfather before you are born .
This piece is adapted from Cosmic Variance blogger Sean Carroll ’s latest book , From Eternity to Here : The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time , which was published last month by Dutton .
In the days of old , the king would kill someone who told him something he did not want to hear .
But few people today would even contemplate that .
And bad news is all around us .
We have wars that have dragged on for years , we have an economy that is sputtering at best and we are constantly reminded that many of our leaders have moral shortcomings .
No one shoots the messenger over anything like this .
But when the subject concerns facts about government involvement in criminal activities , the reaction of much of the public and the media is perhaps even worse : the messenger gets ridiculed .
Recently , Stephen Colbert of the Colbert Nation brought 9/11 Commission member John Farmer on his show to discuss his new book .
Right away , Colbert asked in a facetious tone whether there are any conspiracy theories in the book , like " Dick Cheney as a flight attendant . "
Predictably , Farmer assured Colbert that there were no such theories .
Oliver Stone 's 1991 movie JFK , which supports conspiracy theory in the John Kennedy assassination , was attacked by media critics before it even came out .
This response contrasts sharply with the admiration the media gave the Warren Report and its support of the official lone gunman theory .
Many of the critics did not actually read the report .

Code Pink Claims Blackwater Ex-Employee Threatened One Of Its Activists
Created : February 25 , 2010 11:19 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
I did n’t see this at yesterday ’s big Blackwater hearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee , but another reporter friend watched this happen .
Code Pink , the womens ’ anti-war activist group that ’s a fixture in congressional hearings , put out this press release about an incident yesterday between one of its members and Johnnie Walker , a former Blackwater employee who was involved in the May 5 2009 shootings in Kabul :
CODEPINK activist Tighe Barry was attending the hearing and was shocked about the criminal behavior of Blackwater contractors that included stealing weapons , reckless use of weapons , drinking on the job , violating rules of their contracts , defrauding the US government and disregarding local Afghan laws .
“ During the recess in the hearing , I spoke out about the shameful actions of Blackwater personnel that led to the death of Afghan civilians and their own fellow employees .
Johnnie Walker , as he was leaving the hearing room , turned to me — within earshot of the U.S. Capitol Policeman Angel Morales–and said , “ I ’m gonna kill YOU . ”
Barry shouted out to the police and Blackwater management , “ Do you see the kind of people you hire –such loose cannons that they ’d threaten me in a Senate hearing room ? ”
Barry filed a complaint with the Capitol Police .
As I say , I did n’t witness this , but a trusted colleague claims to have seen it .
Update : I ’ve corrected the headline , as I ’ve been told Tighe Berry is a man .
My sincere apologies for my assumption .
TEL AVIV — Israel closed a stretch of beaches north of the Gaza Strip after two explosive - laden barrels washed ashore and Palestinian militants promised more , in revenge for what some in Hamas said was Israeli 's assassination of a top Hamas leader last month .
Maritime authorities warned civilian vessels to be alert to possible dangers in the Mediterranean after the military linked the barrels to two explosions at sea Friday .
At the same time , police deployed helicopters and mounted units to comb the length of Israel 's coastline ...

Words and music , such natural partners that it seems obvious they go together .
Now science is confirming that those abilities are linked in the brain , a finding that might even lead to better stroke treatments .
Studies have found overlap in the brain 's processing of language and instrumental music , and new research suggests that intensive musical therapy may help improve speech in stroke patients , researchers said Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
In addition , researchers said , music education can help children with developmental dyslexia or autism more accurately use speech .
People who have suffered a severe stroke on the left side of the brain and cannot speak can sometimes learn to communicate through singing , Gottfried Schlaug , associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School told the meeting .
" Music making is a multisensory experience , activating links to several parts of the brain , " Schlaug said .
Schlaug showed a video of one patient who could only make meaningless sounds learning to say " I am thirsty , " by singing the words , and another was able to sing " happy birthday . "
" If you have someone who is nonverbal and they can say there are hungry or thirsty or ask where the bathroom is , that 's an improvement , " Schlaug said of the Melodic Intonation Therapy .
As long as a century ago there were reports of stroke victims who could n't talk but who could sing , he said .
Now , they are doing trials to see if music can be used as a therapy .
But , he cautioned , the work is geared toward people who have had a severe stroke on the left side of the brain and the therapy can take a long time .
Nina Kraus , director of the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory at Northwestern University , reported that new studies show that musical training enhances the brain 's ability to do other things .
For example , she said , the trained brain gets better at detecting patterns in sounds , so that musicians are better at picking out the voice of a friend in a noisy restaurant .
" Musical experience improves abilities important in daily life , " she said .
" Playing an instrument may help youngsters better process speech in noisy classrooms and more accurately interpret the nuances of language that are conveyed by subtle changes in the human voice , " Kraus said .
When people first learn to talk and when they talk to babies they often use musical patterns in their speech , she noted .
" People 's hearing systems are fine - tuned by the experiences they 've had with sound throughout their lives .
Music training is not only beneficial for processing music stimuli .
We 've found that years of music training may also improve how sounds are processed for language and emotion , " Kraus said in prepared remarks .
Kraus said " the very responses that are enhanced in musicians are deficient in clinical populations such as children with developmental dyslexia and autism . "
New studies of brain waves , she noted , mimic the patterns of sound that the individual hears .
Whether speech or instrumental music is heard , it is actually possible to record the brain 's electronic waves and play them back to hear the sound — which she demonstrated with a series of recordings .
Aniruddh D. Patel of The Neurosciences Institute in San Diego said new studies show that music does n't involve just hot spots in the brain , but large swaths on both sides of the brain .
" Nouns and verbs are very different from tones and chords and harmony , but the parts of the brain that process them overlap , " he said .

IN the 35 years since Peter Singer ’s book “ Animal Liberation ” was published , jump - starting the animal rights movement in the United States , the number of animals used in cosmetics testing and scientific research has dropped significantly , and the number of dogs and cats killed in shelters has fallen by more than half .
Nevertheless , because the amount of red meat that Americans eat per capita has held steady at more than 100 pounds a year as the population has increased , more animals than ever suffer from injuries and stress on factory farms .
Veal calves and gestating sows are so confined as to suffer painful bone and joint problems .
The unnatural high - grain diets provided in feedlots cause severe gastric distress in many animals .
And faulty or improperly used stun guns cause the painful deaths of thousands of cows and pigs a year .
We are most likely stuck with factory farms , given that they produce most of the beef and pork Americans consume .
But it is still possible to reduce the animals ’ discomfort  through neuroscience .
Recent advances suggest it may soon be possible to genetically engineer livestock so that they suffer much less .
This prospect stems from a new understanding of how mammals sense pain .
The brain , it turns out , has two separate pathways for perceiving pain : a sensory pathway that registers its location , quality ( sharp , dull or burning , for example ) and intensity , and a so - called affective pathway that senses the pain ’s unpleasantness .
This second pathway appears to be associated with activation of the brain ’s anterior cingulate cortex , because people who have suffered damage to this part of the brain still feel pain but no longer find it unpleasant .
( The same is true of people who are given morphine , because there are more receptors for opiates in the affective pain pathway than in the sensory pain pathway . )
At 9:30 pm on Sunday , September 21 , 2008 , Goldman Sachs was saved from imminent collapse by the announcement that the Federal Reserve would allow it to become a bank holding company – implying unfettered access to borrowing from the Fed and other forms of implicit government support , all of which subsequently proved most beneficial .
Officials allowed Goldman to make such an unprecedented conversion in the name of global financial stability .
( The blow - by - blow account is in Andrew Ross Sorkin ’s Too Big To Fail ; this is confirmed in all substantial detail by Hank Paulson ’s memoir . )
We now learn – from Der Spiegel last week and today ’s NYT – that Goldman Sachs has not only helped or encouraged some European governments to hide a large part of their debts , but it also endeavored to do so for Greece as recently as last November .
These actions are fundamentally destabilizing to the global financial system , as they undermine : the eurozone area ; all attempts to bring greater transparency to government accounting ; and the most basic principles that underlie well - functioning markets .
When the data are all lies , the outcomes are all bad – see the subprime mortgage crisis for further detail .
A single rogue trader can bring down a bank – remember the case of Barings .
But a single rogue bank can bring down the world ’s financial system .
Goldman will dismiss this as “ business as usual ” and , to be sure , a few phone calls around Washington will help ensure that Goldman ’s primary supervisor – now the Fed – looks the other way .
But the affair is now out of Ben Bernanke ’s hands , and quite far from people who are easily swayed by the White House .
It goes immediately to the European Commission , which has jurisdiction over eurozone budget issues .
Faced with enormous pressure from those eurozone countries now on the hook for saving Greece , the Commission will surely launch a special audit of Goldman and all its European clients .
This audit should focus on ten sets of questions .
Which eurozone governments have worked with Goldman , and on what basis , over the past decade ?
All actions prior to and after the introduction of the euro need to be thoroughly reexamined .
What transactions has Goldman facilitated and how has that affected the reporting of European government debt ?
( Under the Maastricht Treaty , eurozone government debt is not supposed to exceed 60 percent of GDP . )
In the case of Greece , the accusation is that Goldman deliberately and in a premeditated manner conspired to hide the true degree of government debt .
Is this true , and to what extent has Goldman helped other countries engage in similar transactions , e.g. , countries now seeking entry to the eurozone ?
What is the full extent of Greek and other government liabilities , if these are accounted for properly ?
Without this reckoning , it is impossible to design a proper level of European Union ( or any other ) support for weaker eurozone countries .
Are there non-eurozone countries that have also been aided and abetted by Goldman in this fashion ?
For example , are the UK and Switzerland implicated – and thus endangered ?
Has Goldman extolled the virtues of government debt in Greece , or other countries , while at the same time helping to deceive investors on the true risks inherent in those debts ?
What were Goldman ’s own holdings of these securities ?
Is there evidence that Goldman has structured similar transactions for the private sector – enabling companies to conceal the level of their true indebtedness ?
Have securities issued by such firms also been endorsed by Goldman to the buying public ?
Were Goldman ’s US - based supervisors aware of Goldman ’s activities in Greece and other eurozone countries ?
Did they condone activities that undermine the integrity of the European Union ?
Where was the European Central Bank while all of this was happening ?
Has the ECB become dangerously enraptured with the new Wall Street and its “ techniques ” ?
Did any responsible official really think that what Goldman was constructing was really some sort of productivity - enhancing financial innovation – as opposed to a sophisticated form of scam ?
The Federal Reserve must cooperate fully with this investigation .
Ordinarily , the Fed might be tempted to sit on useful information , but they can now feel themselves in Senator Bob Corker ’s crosshairs .
Republican Senator Corker is willing to cooperate with Senator Dodd on financial sector reform , opening up the possibility of legislation that will pass the Senate , but he wants the Fed to lose its supervisory powers .
If the Fed refuses to help – willingly and fully – the European Commission with bringing Goldman to account , that will just strengthen the hand of Senator Corker and his allies .
If the Federal Reserve were an effective supervisor , it would have the political will sufficient to determine that Goldman Sachs has not been acting in accordance with its banking license .
But any meaningful action from this direction seems unlikely .
Instead , Goldman will probably be blacklisted from working with eurozone governments for the foreseeable future ; as was the case with Salomon Brothers 20 years ago , Goldman may be on its way to be banned from some government securities markets altogether .
If it is to be allowed back into this arena , it will have to address the inherent conflicts of interest between advising a government on how to put ( deceptive levels of ) lipstick on a pig and cajoling investors into buying livestock at inflated prices .
And the US government , at the highest levels , has to ask a fundamental question :
For how long does it wish to be intimately associated with Goldman Sachs and this kind of destabilizing action ?
What is the priority here – a sustainable recovery and a viable financial system , or one particular set of investment bankers ?
To preserve Goldman , on incredibly generous terms , in the name of saving the financial system was and is hard to defend – but that is where we are .
To allow the current government - backed ( massive ) Goldman to behave recklessly and with complete disregard to the basic tenets of international financial stability is utterly indefensible .
The credibility of the Federal Reserve , already at an all - time low , has just suffered another crippling blow ; the ECB is also now in the line of fire .
Goldman Sachs has a lot to answer for .

Álmozdonyvezetőt fogtak a MÁV belső ellenőrei - írja a Blikk .
A férfinak volt mozdonyvezető egyenruhája , sapkája , sőt , még táskája is , csak jogosítánya nem .
A Blikk információi szerint ennek ellenére többször is szállított utasokat .
A Blikk úgy tudja , hogy a csaló hónapok óta vezette a MÁV vonatait , kedvenc szakasza a Székesfehérvár–Budapest útvonal volt .
A MÁV Trakció szóvivője , Horváth Gergely megerősítette , hogy egy álmozdonyvezetőt kapcsoltak le , ugyanakkor tagadta , hogy a férfi vezetett volna mozdonyt .
- Éjfél után negyven perccel szolgálatra jelentkezett a 25 év körüli fiatalember , aki Szegedi Krisztián néven mutatkozott be .
A belső ellenőrzés már régóta le akart rá csapni , és csapdát állítottak neki – mesélte a Blikk informátora .
Hozzátette : a magabiztos fiatalember az eligazító helyiségben névről ismerte minden kollégáját , csak éppen róla nem tudta senki , hogy kicsoda .
A MÁV - Trakció közleménye szerint az ellenőrző szervezetük tudomására jutott , hogy a MÁV különböző szolgálati helyein már több alkalommal jelentkezett egy fiatalember , aki az ott leadott járművek kulcsához szeretett volna hozzájutni .
2010 . január 21 - én , a késő esti órákban a Budapest - Keleti pályaudvar mozdony - felvigyázó helyiségében telefonon érdeklődött , hogy nincs-e olyan mozdony , amit a szomszédos vasútállomásra kell vinni , mert úgyis arra van dolga , így a jármű eljuttatását el tudja végezni .
" Tekintettel arra , hogy ez a jelentkezés teljesen életszerűtlen , és a szolgálati gyakorlattól merőben eltérő volt , a fiatalember gyanússá vált " - áll a közleményben .
Ezután döntöttek úgy , hogy csapdát állítanak a férfinak , ezért egy mozdonyvezetési feladatot ajánlottak fel neki .
A telefonhívás után nem sokkal a szolgálat - jelentkezési helyen meg is jelent egy 25 év körüli fiatalember , mozdonyvezető formaruhában .
Miután a cég munkatársai megbizonyosodtak arról , hogy az illető az , akit vártak , értesítették a rendőrséget .

Consumers hate , hate , hate waiting for web pages to load , and they have no sympathy whatsoever if the site is being hammered during a " peak time . "
That 's the conclusion drawn by a soon - to - be- published survey by Gomez , which found that while consumers were more than willing to wait in long checkout lines in retail stores during the holidays , they had little to no patience for waiting in digital checkout lines as sites get slammed during the end - of - year rush .
A curious world we live , yes ?
The survey , which was conducted in December of 2009 , found that the vast majority of consumers expected web pages to load quickly regardless of what time of year the site was visited , and that goes for travel , retail and most any other type of " serious " site .
If it 's a business , and it 's online , consumers expect near - instant page loads .
Anything less , and all sorts of bad things begin to happen .
The Gomez survey had the following findings :
A third of online shoppers had a bad experience on a retail Web site during the recent 2009 Holiday shopping season and 15 percent found the problem to be “ unacceptable . ”
These bad online experiences caused nearly one in five online shoppers to shop at another site .
In general , 41 percent of online shoppers will only tolerate one or two bad online experiences before abandoning a retailer ’s Web site .
credit : Gomez Inc
Around 1500 people were consulted for the study , each of which were familiar with conducting online transactions during " peak " periods .
Over 2/3rds of those polled said that they had no more tolerance for slow page loads for peak times compared to normal times , and 78 % of the group said that they would click over to competing sites if they encountered slow page loads or other associated errors .
Even more startling was this : 88 % of those questioned said that they would be less likely to return to a slow performing site , with most of them admitting that they had other options and thus no real need to stick around and wait things out .
Are you one of those impatient ones ?
Do you give a site a second chance if they 're slammed during a peak season ?
How much tolerance do you have sites that load sluggishly ?

SANAA , Yemen —
In an unassuming mosque , adorned only with graffiti and ancient stained - glass windows , about 30 women and children sat on the floor , listening to a sermon .
The women wore black robes , but the veils that usually covered their faces were flipped up .
They listened to Imam Sami al - Fayek on a speaker , while the men congregated downstairs .
The imam spoke of the war in northern Yemen , and his hope that the government would end it .
“ We ask God to make them stop , ” he said , “ Because a lot of people have been killed . ”
When the imam finished his thoughts , he began the traditional melodic Friday prayers .
The women sat up , cupped their hands in front of them and responded gently , asking God to forgive them their sins .
When the service ended , they turned to each other , shook hands affectionately , and said “ Assalam alykum , ” peace be upon you .
Later in the afternoon , in a crisp white thobe and black turban , al - Fayek stood outside the beige brick building talking to friends and neighbors in the bright sun .
He was grateful , he said , because the capital Sanaa is peaceful .
“ Here , in our area , it is safe . ”
A mother walks with her children in Mukalla .
( Paul Stephens / GlobalPost )
That sense of security is rare in a country that is facing a Shiite insurgency , a secessionist movement in the south , a looming water crisis and crushing poverty .
And now the government is shifting its focus to fighting Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , a Yemen - based offshoot of Osama bin Laden ’s organization .
The capital Sanaa , surrounded by mountains , has been one of the few places that escaped the strife plaguing other regions of the country .
But the mood in the mosques and markets reflects the city 's unease about what the new - found focus on Al Qaeda might bring .
Many in this small , desperately poor country are afraid they will become collateral damage in the next front of America 's " war on terror . "
“ Everybody is worried about the future , ” said Ammar al - Maktri , an accountant who is friends with al - Fayek .
“ About Al Qaeda and the Americans . ”
Al - Maktri , like many Yemenis , has followed the events in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan on the news .
He believes that if the U.S. tries to battle it out with Al Qaeda in Yemen , it will be the Yemeni people who suffer most .
For weeks now , the chatter on the streets of Sanaa has focused on just how far the U.S. intends to go in this fight .
In December , U.S. - ordered air strikes killed at least 60 suspected Al Qaeda militants , Yemeni officials said .
And since a Nigerian born radical , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , tried to blow up a plane over Detroit after living in Yemen , it has become clear that the U.S. intends to retaliate .
Despite the fears in Sanaa , it is very unlikely that there will be a significant U.S. military presence in Yemen , said Steve Heydemann , a vice - president at the U.S. Institute of Peace and a specialist in Arabic politics .
Yemeni officials say U.S. soldiers would strengthen Al Qaeda by drawing Islamic extremists from abroad , and growing anti-Western sentiments at home .
It remains unclear though what form U.S. involvement might take , with options including aid , intelligence support and special operations .
The current military presence in Yemen is small , limited to technical support , training and help with intelligence .
Other experts say even successful , low key special operations designed to target Al Qaeda leadership could strengthen anti-Western sentiment .
Some kind of action on the ground appears to be inevitable , said Garry Clifford , a political science professor and foreign policy specialist at the University of Connecticut .
There is no “ loud drum beat ” in the U.S. to send troops to Yemen , but a “ persistent angry feeling that we ought to do something to retaliate , ” he wrote in an email .
Outside the mosque , a small crowd gathered to discuss what is perceived as the looming possibility of greater U.S. military presence in Yemen .
American soldiers could become targets , said a local police cheif Tofik al - Jawfi , which would ruin the two nations ’ friendly relationship .
He said he could not stand the idea of foreigners coming to Yemen and getting hurt .
“ Between us and America are good relations , ” he said .
“ They are our brothers . ”
Al - Jawfi said the Yemeni army has more than enough resources to defeat Al Qaeda , and , in a pinch , the Yemeni population is heavily armed .
“ All Yemeni people have four or five guns in the house , ” he said .
Yemenis insisted that reports are overblown about the dangers of life in their country .
In Sanaa ’s medieval Old City , on the serene rooftop of Center for Arabic Language and Eastern Studies , Administrative Director Mohammad Saleh Risk said the media scares people away by only presenting one aspect of the country .
“ New students are not coming , ” Risk said .
“ They imagine Yemen is just a terrorist place . ”
But Risk too said he was afraid of U.S. military involvement in Yemen .
“ People know what happened in Afghanistan and Iraq , ” he said .
“ We do n’t want [ the Americans ] to make the same mistake here . ”
About half of the 23 million people in Yemen are under 15 years old , and young people — even those with a good education — have a hard time finding work .
According to the CIA Factbook , 35 percent of the adults in Yemen are out of work .
“ There are other things that could kill terrorism , ” he said .
“ Young people have no jobs , and the government should fix it . ”
In the cobblestone market bellow , 17 - year - old Ahlam Aharhan agreed that young people are more likely to turn to extremism when they cannot find work .
With bright brown eyes peaking out of her black veil , Aharhan seemed surprised when asked what she thought of America ’s relationship with Yemen .
“ Everybody should stay in his own country , ” she said .

There is a lot of confusion about the meaning of “ functional ” and “ declarative ” as descriptions of programming languages and paradigms .
For instance , Haskell is sometimes advertised as a “ purely functional programming language ” and other times as “ the world ’s finest imperative programming language ” .
I added some playful confusion ( and clarity , I hope ) with my post
The C language is purely functional .
I still regularly hear people ask and disagree about whether Haskell ’s monadic I/O is “ functional ” .
I would say yes in one ( technical ) sense of “ functional ” .
But not the same sense in which we say “ functional programming has simple , precise semantics ” or “ functional programming has good compositional properties ” or “ functional programming is good for reasoning about ” .
Monadic I/ O is a clever trick for encapsulating sequential , imperative computation , so that it can “ do no evil ” to the part that really does have precise semantics and good compositional properties .
It ’s because of this confusion that I ’ve started using the more specific term “ denotational programming ” in my blog subtitle and elsewhere , as an alternative to what I used to call “ functional programming ” .
While there are other notions of “ functional ” , applicable even to monadic IO , I think “ denotational ” captures the fundamental and far - reaching benefits that we called “ good for reasoning about ” and “ powerfully compositional ” .
When I bash monadic I/O , my real complaint is n’t with the technical invention –which I like .
Rather , I ’m cranky about confusion and misleading communication , and about distraction from what we originally meant by “ functional programming ” –from what I call “ denotational programming ” .
I do n’t mind that we have n’t yet been liberated from the von Neumann model .
As long as remember we have n’t .
As long as we keep on searching .
There is a lot of confusion about the meaning of “ functional ” and “ declarative ” as descriptions of programming languages and paradigms .
For instance , Haskell is sometimes advertised as a “ purely functional ...
Lieber Herr Michalk ,
vor einiger Zeit haben wir uns bei einer Konferenz kennen gelernt , bei der ich mich zum Verhalten der Kulturindustrie im Allgemeinen und der Musikindustrie im Besonderen äußern durfte .
Ich echauffierte mich darüber , wie manipulativ Lobbyisten der Verwertungsindustrie mit Zahlen hantieren , wenn es darum geht zu zeigen , wie Urheberrechtsverletzungen ihnen zu schaffen machen ( gern als „ Piraterie “ oder „ Raubkopien “ bezeichnet , um zu suggerieren , dass es sich um ein Verbrechen handelt , bei dem Menschen Gewalt angetan wird ; oder auch mit organisierter Gewaltkriminalität und gar Terrorismus in Zusammenhang gebracht ) .
Demnach sollen den Rechteinhabern ( nicht den Urhebern ! ) durch Verletzungen von Imaterialgüterrechten 200 bis 250 Milliarden Dollar an Einnahmen verloren gehen und es würden 750.000 Jobs gefährdet .
Das Problem an den Zahlen ist nicht allein , dass nicht klar ist , worauf sie sich beziehen .
Gehen diese Jobs und diese Einnahmen pro Jahr verloren ?
Oder kumulativ ?
Über welchen Zeitraum ?
Sondern dass bislang auch unklar blieb , wie diese Zahlen zustande kamen .
Wer hat sie erhoben ?
Mit welcher Methode ?
Zum Glück gibt es Blogs .
Daher können wir beide den Machern von Ars Technica dankbar sein , die für einen wunderbaren Beitrag mit dem Titel „ 750,000 lost jobs ?
The dodgy digits behind the war on piracy “ aufwändig recherchiert haben , was dran ist an den Zahlen .
Ein Hinweis bietet schon der Untertitel : „ A 20 - year game of Telephone “ , sinngemäß „ 20 Jahre stille Post “ .
Die Antwort : nichts ist dran an den Zahlen .
Ausgedacht , weitererzählt , zitiert , dann wieder zitiert , dann nochmal zitiert , und schon hat man Quelle über Quelle , auf die man sich berufen kann – völlig unabhängig davon , dass es nie eine belastbare Aussage gab .
Sie waren bei der Konferenz mit meinen Einlassungen nicht einverstanden und haben mir in Ihrer freundlichen Art ( keine Ironie , ich finde Sie sehr sympathisch ! ) , gesagt , dass wir uns unbedingt zusammensetzen sollten um darüber zu reden , woher denn die Zahlen kommen .
Daran hätte ich großes Interesse , sagte ich und schickte Ihnen den Link zum Artikel von Ars Technica , den Sie aber nie kommentiert haben .
Ebenfalls großes Interesse hatte ich kurz nach der Konferenz am Artikel eines Kollegen des Guardian Illegal downloads and dodgy figures , der die Zahlenspiele der Musikindustrie im Besonderen unter die Lupe genommen hatte .
Sein Fazit : „ As far as I ’m concerned , everything from this industry is false , until proven otherwise . “
Er ist übrigens Wissenschafts - , nicht Musikjournalist .
Es dauerte dann noch mehr als ein halbes Jahr , bis wir uns tatsächlich trafen , nicht ganz unpassend im Einstein unter den Linden , wo sich Lobbyisten und Journalisten eben treffen .
( Ich habe mein Frühstück selbst bezahlt . )
Wir redeten kaum über Zahlen .
Es ging vielmehr darum , wie es in Zukunft weitergehen wird mit Internet und Digitalisierung , was die Aufgabe der Verwerter sein kann und wovon Kreative leben sollen .
Es war ein angenehmes Gespräch , und ich habe Sie als klugen und differenzierten Beobachter empfunden .
Dass wir bei den meisten
Themen nicht einer Meinung waren , hat mich nicht überrascht ( und Sie bestimmt auch nicht ) .
Wir sind ja erwachsen und können damit leben , dass es unterschiedliche Auffassungen gibt in dieser Welt .
Kürzlich habe ich dann in meinem Posteingang eine Email mit folgendem Bestreff gefunden : „ Bundesverband Musikindustrie veröffentlicht Positionspapier zur Kulturflatrate “ .
Und was lese ich da ?
Der Bundesverband Musikindustrie ( BVMI ) hat ein Positionspapier mit zehn Argumenten gegen die Kulturflatrate veröffentlicht .
„ Bei Diskussionen um das Urheberrecht in der digitalen
Welt fällt immer wieder das Schlagwort von der Kulturflatrate , obwohl eigentlich niemand genau weiß , was damit genau gemeint ist “ , so Stefan Michalk , BVMI - Geschäftsführer .
„ Was von den Befürwortern als Lösung aller Probleme gesehen wird , wäre letztlich nichts anderes als die Kapitulation der Politik vor der Komplexität des Urheberrechts in der digitalen Welt “ , so Michalk weiter .
In zehn Thesen , „ Argumente “ genannt , wird dann erläutert , warum die Kulturflatrate eine Kapitulation der Politik vor der Komplexität des Urheberrechts wäre .
Der Blogger Simon Columbus Markus Beckedahl hat diese Thesen bei netzpolitik.org sofort zur Diskussion gestellt .
Und auch sonst ist viel über die Flatrate geschrieben worden .
Keine Angst , ich will sie nicht überzeugen , dass sie eine tolle Idee ist – darum geht es gar nicht .
Denn ich bin ohnehin nur bis zu Punkt drei ihrer „ Argumente “ gekommen .
Da steht :
Die Kulturflatrate führt zu einer unverhältnismäßig hohen Belastung aller Konsumenten und benachteiligt sozial Schwache .
Mit fortschreitender Digitalisierung und zunehmendem Ausbau der Bandbreiten sind immer mehr Bereiche der Kultur - und Kreativwirtschaft vom unrechtmäßigen Gebrauch ihrer Produkte betroffen .
Eine Kulturflatrate müsste mittelfristig nicht nur Musik , Filme oder Bücher erfassen , sondern würde alle Bereiche der Kultur - und Kreativwirtschaft betreffen .
Nach Schätzungen der Bundesjustizministerin kämen auf jeden Verbraucher mit Internetanschluss zusätzliche Kosten in Höhe von 50 Euro pro Monat zu .
Gerade sozial Schwache können sich das nicht leisten .
Schätzungen der Bundesjustizministerin ?
Das ist interessant .
Können
Sie mir dafür eine Quelle nennen ?
Sie meinen doch hoffentlich nicht die Interviews , in denen die ehemalige Bundesjustizministerin Brigitte Zypries sagte , dass die Kosten für jeden Einzelnen bei fünfzig Euro im Monat liegen könnten , oder ?
Weil , wenn
Sie das meinen , dann muss ich Ihnen leider sagen , dass da ein Missverständnis vorliegt .
Frau Zypries hat einfach irgendwelche Zahlen genommen , die von den Befürwortern der Kulturflatrate ins Spiel gebracht worden waren .
Aber die können für sie ja keine Relevanz haben , da „ eigentlich niemand genau weiß , was damit genau gemeint ist “ , wie sie sagen , so dass genaue Zahlen nach Ihrer Ansicht gar nicht existieren können .
Schon gar nicht , wenn diese Schätzung der Befürworter offenbar noch mit einem Faktor zwischen fünf und zehn multipliziert wurde .
Wie Frau Zypries darauf kam , hat sie nicht verraten , musste allerdings recht schnell ihre Aussage zurücknehmen und erwähnte anschließend gar keine Zahlen mehr .
Sie waren wohl etwas vage .
Nicht zu vage allerdings , um von Ihnen acht Monate später als „ Schätzungen der Bundesjustizministerin “ verkauft zu werden .
Mich machen solche Tricks misstrauisch .
Als Journalist lernt man , wenn Namen und Zahlen nicht stimmen , verspielt man die Glaubwürdigkeit des gesamten Artikels .
Und irgendwann auch die Glaubwürdigkeit der Institution , die sie veröffentlicht hat .
Trotzdem bin ich nicht sehr optimistisch , was die „ Schätzungen der Bundesjustizministerin “ angeht .
Ich fürchte , es wird weiter abgeschrieben werden .
Und irgendwann werden eine Menge Menschen davon ausgehen , dass die Kulturflatrate jeden Bürger fünfzig Euro im Monat kostet und glauben , dass der Bundesverband Musikindustrie sich für die sozial Schwachen in unserer Gesellschaft einsetzt .
Ich hoffe , ich habe meinen
Teil dazu beigetragen , dass es dazu nicht kommt .
Und schließe mich dem Kollegen des Guardian an : Ich gehe ( weiterhin ) davon aus , dass alles , was von dieser Industrie kommt , als falsch betrachtet werden muss , bis das Gegenteil bewiesen ist .
Mit freundlichen Grüßen
Matthias Spielkamp

I recently spoke with the Scottish photojournalist Harry Benson , who is known for his images of world leaders , Hollywood icons , rock stars and everyday Glaswegians .
( He is , as I found out , also an amiable character and a charming raconteur . )
Mr. Benson ’s photos , particularly his early black - and - white images , are masterly studies in the use of natural light , and I wanted to ask him for tips on shooting in low - light situations .
Here ’s what he had to say .
What camera do you typically use ?
I usually use a Canon 1D Mark III .
The lens I like the best is the 24 - to 105 - millimeter lens .
For low light , I like very much the [ Canon f / 1.2L ] 50 - millimeter 1.2 .
It ’s a beautiful lens .
It ’s just amazing .
What are some of the most challenging photos you ’ve taken in low - light conditions ?
I have taken some photos under duress , like the Bobby Kennedy assassination .
It ’s the one time that I think about now and wonder how much better the photos would have been if I had had a digital camera .
There was almost no light , and Ethel [ Kennedy ] was screaming .
She came straight for me .
I like the photo because it shows the hell , the panic and the madness .
You could n’t use a strobe in this situation because you ’d get thrown out quickly .
What mode do you typically shoot in ?
I use aperture priority and manual , but where I ’ve gotten my best results is on program mode .
I have taken photos that I ’ve done both ways , and the program mode went into every corner of the picture to capture detail .
But when I ’m shooting sports , I use shutter priority .
What about ISO ?
I do n’t set ISO at the very top .
In fact , I would n’t go beyond 1000 because it gets noisy .
But sometimes I do n’t care about the noise , I care more about getting the photograph .
Do you adjust lighting in photo - editing programs like Photoshop ?
I never do any [ post - production ] manipulation because most of my career was spent using film .
If I manipulated the photos , I would feel that everything I did was fake .
I might take a scratch out but I do n’t adjust lighting — that ’s creating something that was n’t there .
When photographers start doing that , it ca n’t be called artwork .
Do you use autofocus or do you focus manually ?
It depends .
If I ’m in a dark situation , I do n’t trust autofocus so much because you ca n’t wait for it to make up its mind .
When I started out , the cameras did n’t have rangefinders , so you had to guess the distance , and I ’m quite good at that .
I do use autofocus but I will always go to manual if I ’m shooting a very important shot , like a president .
Any tips on using flash in low light ?
I prefer not to use flash because it tends to control and take over the photo .
I lose a lot of humanity with flash .
I do n’t want to use it in a position when I can use my brain instead .
Without flash , pictures can take on a grainy feel .
And if you take a photo of someone with a light in the background , the light gives a lovely warm tone to the photography .
What ’s the difference in light between shooting film and digital ?
On film , the results were unreliable .
If I was in a dark situation , the film had to be developed first so that I had an idea of how far to push it .
I ’d usually develop eight frames or so to judge the quality .
Digital put a stop to all that .
When you ’re a long way from home you do n’t want to come back with a load of film you ’ve messed up .
With digital you can take a look and immediately know that you ’re in business .
There was nothing worse than flying into Kennedy Airport and not knowing what you ’ve got until you get your film developed .
Another thing that digital does is give you information and detail in the picture .
For instance , I took a picture of a bar in Glasgow and every area of the bar was in detail .
You could n’t have set it up with light and got the same results .
The good thing about digital is that it lets your brain do the work , and you are n’t tied down with the technical stuff .
You can let yourself go and use your eyes .
With me it ’s always been about getting the picture , and then getting the first train out of Dodge .
And with digital I can certainly do that .
I go back to New York wagging my tail .
How long have you been using a digital camera ?
My first digital camera was the Canon 1D Mark II , which I started using about seven years ago .
I shoot all digital now .
I have a closet full of film cameras like Hasselblad , Nikon , and Rolleiflex , and every time I pass by the closet I hear , “ Help ! Help ! ” I feel terrible because they were all great cameras , but why should I use them when I ’m getting better results with digital ?
Do you use point - and - shoot cameras ?
I ’ve thought about it , and I ’ve seen some wonderful photos .
What ’s interesting is that I used to go to people ’s homes and they would show me their home photos and they were all crap .
Now when I go to people ’s homes I see a lot of very good photos .
But I wo n’t use a pocket camera until the technology advances .
Probably in the next two weeks they ’ll have a camera phone that ’s as good as the Mark III .
You know that ’s going to happen .
Until then , no .
I do n’t take photographs for fun .
If I ’m going to photograph a dog I want to do it with a good camera .
I ’m not playing around when I go out .
It ’s dead serious .
If you had one tip for taking better night or low - light photos , what would it be ?
Do n’t be afraid .
You ’ll be surprised just how good your photos will be .
Make sure there is some light on your subject ’s face .
But be brave about it .
The thing about is that I ’ve been awakened to see just what digital cameras can do in low - light situations .
It digs right into spaces that I never thought a camera could penetrate .
Feb. 3 , 2010  --
It was the scientific paper that served as a central pillar for the idea that vaccination could increase children 's risk of developing autism .
Now , with a formal retraction from the Lancet , the medical journal which in 1998 published this piece of research by Dr. Andrew Wakefield , most researchers will view the study as if it had never been published in the first place .
In a statement explaining its retraction of Wakefield 's paper , the Lancet said : " Following the judgment of the U.K. General Medical Council 's Fitness to Practice Panel on Jan. 28 , 2010 , it has become clear that several elements of the 1998 paper by Wakefield et al are incorrect ... in particular , the claims in the original paper that children were ' consecutively referred ' and that investigations were ' approved ' by the local ethics committee have been proven to be false .
Therefore we fully retract this paper from the published record . "
" The Lancet is an enormously prestigious journal with worldwide circulation , so its action of repudiation is very important , " said Dr. William Schaffner , chair of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine 's Department of Preventive Medicine in Nashville , Tenn .
" The retraction puts another nail in the coffin of this awful , painfully erroneous study . "
But the retraction is unlikely to close the Pandora 's Box that the Wakefield study opened , other vaccination experts said .
" Unfortunately , the idea that vaccines cause autism is already out there and the damage has already been done , " said Robert Field , professor of Health Management and Policy at the Drexel University School of Public Health in Philadelphia .
" Years of research have clearly disproven a vaccine - autism link , yet many people continue to believe in it .
If all of that research has n't changed their minds , the Lancet 's retraction is not likely to make much difference . "
Dr. Gregory Poland , editor - in - chief of the journal VACCINE and director of the Mayo Vaccine Research Group in Rochester , Minn. , called the Lancet 's action merely " procedural . "
" What is more important is that an investigator , on the basis of false pretenses , published a paper and propelled a controversial hypothesis forward that led to decisions among individuals and groups to reject vaccination , with resultant outbreaks of these diseases , " he said .
" The results are highly significant : millions spent needlessly , hundreds of thousands -- maybe even millions -- unimmunized , and a fog of suspicion cast upon vaccines . "
On Jan. 28 , the United Kingdom 's General Medical Council ( GMC ) found Wakefield guilty of acting unethically during the time he conducted the famous case report of 12 children that questioned if a childhood vaccine caused a new form of autism .
Ethical Questions Dog Controversial Autism Study
Wakefield 's hypothesis was that by combining vaccines for measles , mumps and rubella into a single shot , known as MMR , the vaccine weakened the immune system and damaged the gut .
He said that this , in turn , led to the development of autism .
The GMC concluded that Wakefield participated in " dishonesty and misleading conduct " while he conducted the research .
Specifically , it found Wakefield responsible for an ethics breach because he wrote that the children involved in the case report were referred to his clinic for stomach problems , when he knew nearly half of the children were actually part of a lawsuit looking into the effects of an MMR vaccine .
Some children did n't have stomach issues at all .
Wakefield also failed to disclose he was paid in conjunction with the lawsuit , or that he had a patent related to a new MMR vaccine in development when he submitted the case report for publication .
Moreover , according to one of the findings against the doctor , Wakefield took blood samples from children at his own child 's birthday party and paid them each five British pounds for their trouble .
Following the GMC's Jan. 28 ruling , Wakefield declined an interview with ABCNews.com , but issued a statement saying , " The allegations against me and against my colleagues are both unfounded and unjust and I invite anyone to examine the contents of these proceedings and come to their own conclusion . "
The GMC ruling is unlikely to erase the apparently false connection between vaccines and autism from the public mind .
Nor will it detract from Wakefield 's positive reputation among some activists groups .
Following the GMC 's decision , the advocacy group the Autism Society issued a statement in which it said it " strongly supports funding research into gastrointestinal pathology , as well as any links between this pathology and the symptoms of autism .
...
In this field , Dr. Wakefield 's contributions to our families and members are greatly appreciated and there are many who support him in his research efforts . "
Wakefield Study Had Big Impact on Vaccination Rates
Similarly , the parent groups who stood behind Wakefield in rallies and in press statements say his theories have led to anecdotally successful treatment in their children and also doubt that a finding by the GMC will change any minds .
It is on this point that critics of Wakefield 's work agree .
" In some ways I think [ the GMC ruling ] is irrelevant , " said Dr. Paul Offit , chief of the Section of Infectious Diseases at Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia , who has been twice threatened with lawsuits for critical statements he has made of Wakefield 's work .
According to Offit -- and international studies supported by the CDC as well as a 2004 review of large international studies by the Institute of Medicine -- high - quality studies could not confirm Wakefield 's hypothesis about vaccines .
Still , when the public got word of Wakefield 's work , worried parents skipped vaccines , and the percentage of children who were not vaccinated in the United States rose from 0.77 percent in 1997 to 2.1 percent in 2000 , according to an article by Dr. Michael Smith in the journal Pediatrics .
A similar rise in children not being vaccinated occurred in Britain .
Although the U.S. Centers for Disease Control declared the United States cleared of measles in 2000 , the lower vaccination rate brought back the disease in a 2008 outbreak .
At least 131 cases were reported to the CDC , and 11 percent of the cases were hospitalized .
A handful of children in Britain died of the measles around the time of the U.S. outbreak .
Since the publication of the 1998 article , Wakefield has left England and has set up an alternative research and treatment organization called Thoughtful House in Austin , Texas .
On April 7 , the GMC is scheduled to decide whether his ethical breaches constitute " serious professional misconduct " and if so , how Wakefield will be reprimanded or whether he will lose his license .
Regardless of the outcome , many vaccine efforts hope that this latest chapter in the debate over a connection between vaccines and autism will be the last .
" I think it is vital that the public and more importantly the press move past this issue , " said Dr. Nancy Minshew , professor of psychiatry and neurology and director of the University of Pittsburgh 's Autism Center of Excellence .
" It is time for a new script , " she said .
" In a time when scientists have discovered a prevention for ASD in infants and toddlers with the tuberous sclerosis gene , the public and press should be racing to understand how this came about and where the next discovery will come from . "
THOUGH ostensibly a tale of two cities , there 's little doubt where the heart of the exhibition Melbourne >< Brisbane lies .
The man behind it , David Pestorius , is a Brisbane - based former barrister , gallery owner and producer / promoter of art events , as well as a passionate archivist of the period from 1976 to 1983 when the music and art worlds seemed to fuse , randomly , radically and irrevocably .
'' It 's not about nostalgia , '' says Pestorius in the gallery of the Ian Potter Museum of Art at Melbourne University four days before the show 's opening .
'' I want people to see how what 's happening today was influenced by what happened then .
It 's an ongoing story . ''
I saw elements of this show two years ago on a visit to Brisbane , the city in which I grew up .
The Brisbane Sound at the Institute of Modern Art in the Valley struck me as being as much an exercise in fandom as it was history .
That did n't invalidate it , but all those fanzines , posters , band photos and set lists did make for a curious gallery experience .
At the Potter , Pestorius has built on that show significantly .
In one of the two rooms housing the show , there are four screens on which footage of Robert Forster plays continuously .
In all that footage , the musician , rock critic and former co-frontman of the Go-Betweens is performing in galleries .
The point , Pestorius says , is to illustrate the fact that in the punk and post - punk moment , the boundaries between art and music were all but obliterated .
Musicians such as Forster saw themselves as artists , just as many artists picked up guitars and keyboards and formed bands .
In the other room , there 's a cabinet full of releases by the Saints - often credited as having released the first true punk single with ( I'm ) Stranded in September 1976 - and the Laughing Clowns .
'' It 's a deliberately provocative gesture , '' says Pestorius .
'' I want people to think about the through line there . ''

In Berlin findet gerade der „ Europäischer Polizeikongress “ statt .
Dort kann man kostenlos teilnehmen , wenn man zur Presse gehört , Abgeordneter ist oder bei einer Sicherheitsbehörde beschäftigt ist .
Man kann aber auch 895 Euro bezahlen , um dabei zu sein .
Ein Berliner IT - Sicherheitsexperte war auf Firmenticket dabei und saß im Saal , als der Innenstaatssekretär Ole Schröder gerade redete .
Bis er aus dem Saal geholt wurde mit der Begründung , dass er vom Chaos Computer Club sei .
Er sei persönlich bekannt “ , was daran liegen mag , dass er ab und an für den Chaos Computer Club medial in Erscheinung tritt .
Man fragt sich ja , was das Innenministerium und / oder die Sicherheitsbehörden zu befürchten haben , wenn ein Hacker sich die Reden eines Staatssekretärs anhören möchte und auch dafür zahlt .
Update : Das Innenministerium weist mich zu Recht daraufhin , dass sie mit der Organisation nichts zu tun haben .
Es wäre aber freundlich , wenn man von Seiten des Innenministeriums trotzdem bei den Organisatoren Beschwerde einlegen würde .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. states face a total shortfall of at least $ 1 trillion in their funds for employees ’ pensions and retirement benefits , and their financial problems are quickly mounting , according to a report released by the Pew Center on the States on Thursday .
Illinois is in the worst shape , with only 54 percent of its pension obligations funded , according to the report , which looked at fiscal year 2008 .
Because the analysis did not encompass the final six months of calendar year 2008 -- most states ’ fiscal year ’s end during the summer -- it does not include the market downturn that devastated many funds ’ investment portfolios .
“ The funding gap will likely increase when the more than 25 percent loss states took in calendar year 2008 is factored in , ” the report said .
Regardless of stock market fluctuations , pension funds were destined to fall down a budget hole , the non-profit research center found .
“ Over the last 10 years , many states have shortchanged pension plans in good times and bad , ” said Susan Urahn , the center ’s managing director , who called the beginning of the century a “ decade of irresponsibility . ”
States did not save for the future and manage costs well , said Urahn .
She also cautioned that the 8 percent return on investments most states typically expect may need to be lowered .
Still , the dwindling value of the funds ’ investments from stock market problems has forced states to deposit more money into their accounts .
In 2000 , they were only required to pay $ 27 billion total into their funds .
By fiscal 2008 that amount had more than doubled to a $ 64 billion deposit .
This comes at a time when a long and deep economic recession has devastated states ’ revenues and made it nearly impossible for many to pay for basic costs such as salaries .
Describing state pension funds as operating similarly to credit card holders who make minimal monthly payments on their debt but continue to charge , Urahn said the funds were making their problems worse by not preparing for impending retirements .
“ The growing bill coming due to states could have significant consequences for taxpayers -- higher taxes , less money for public services and lower state bond ratings , ” she said .
A pension fund is considered healthy if it has a funding level equal to at least 80 percent of its liability .
In fiscal 2008 , 21 states were below that mark , compared to only 19 states in fiscal 2006 .
The rate of decline has been rapid , the center said .
In fiscal 2000 half of the 50 states had fully funded their pension systems but by fiscal 2008 only four -- Florida , New York , Washington and Wisconsin -- could boast being able to cover their costs .
Public employees often receive other retirement benefits such as health care , and states are struggling even more to meet those spending needs .
Only 5 percent of the $ 587 billion total liability they have is funded , the center said .
Alaska and Arizona are the sole states that have more than 50 percent of the assets needed to pay for other post - employment benefits , Pew said .
My anger has morphed into sadness , heartbreak actually .
As the decade of zeros ends I see nothing but a tragic , historic and deadening American Disappointment , a terrible replacement for a once noble American Dream .
The Great Recession was merely one symptom of the nation 's slide into slime , a quicksand created by the two - party plutocracy .
Free of delusion I have come to this sad reality :
Once upon a time Americans could confidently believe that their nation was on the right track , getting better , offering most citizens a decent chance of living securely and proudly .
Now , that view has been smashed by many years of undeniable evidence that our political system is frighteningly corrupt by forces that have ensured an economy serving the interests of the rich and powerful .
Their pursuit of happiness enslaves ordinary Americans .
America 's middle class is a disappearing and suffering set of distracted victims , slipping continually into the lower class of an inevitable two - class system .
Most are oblivious to their fate , to the electoral tyranny that manipulates and consumes them as fuel to keep the corpocracy humming .
New York Times columnist Paul Krugman was right about the past decade : " It was a decade in which nothing good happened , and none of the optimistic things we were supposed to believe turned out to be true . " the decade in which we achieved nothing and learned nothing . "
Do you think children noticed ?
The decade of numerical zeros was also the decade of nothing .
Nothing , as in not having a home anymore , not having enough money for food , not having health insurance , not having a decent job anymore , not having the friend or relative that lost their life in Iraq or Afghanistan , not having money and financial security for retirement and old age , not having any more illusions about politicians like President Obama who sell themselves as agents of change and reform but end up like all the other lying plutocracy - serving political hacks , only this time hiding behind blackness .
But learning nothing is even worse than having and achieving nothing .
Worse , because nothing is likely to stop the slide into slime .
Nothing promised by Democrats or Republicans is likely to revive the American Dream , now replaced by the American Disappointment .
Tyranny can prosper along with elections and even freedom .
That should have been a lesson learned by the many millions of Americans victimized by corporations and dysfunctional government agencies that did nothing to protect them from the greed , incompetence and criminality that savaged them .
What is even more inscrutable is that we do not see Americans rising up in righteous , populist anger and discontent to tear down the system killing them .
Why is there such stability in a system so corrupt , disgraceful and unjust ?
This is the great mystery that defines the American Disappointment .
A country founded on revolution is so sick it cannot see the need to use it again against domestic , elected tyranny .

Yea , the kids .
They still love you .
They want to come and see you .
They did nothing wrong .
But now you have nowhere ( other than the couch ) for them to sleep .
Sound familiar ?
Well then have I got a deal for you .
Feast your eyes upon the Grinding Wheels of Justice Bunkbed .
You see , it will get better .
The wheels of karmic justice may grind slowly , but they grind exceedingly fine .
You will reconstruct your ego , and your life .
Then you ’ll slowly start having a social life .
You ’ll fix some of those things about yourself you always wanted to fix but did n’t have the time / energy because you were so busy being provider / husband / father .
You ’ll meet a brilliant and gorgeous woman who , coincidentally , happens to be much younger than you .
You ’ll fall in love .
For her part , your ex will fall into bankruptcy , get all sorts of inappropriate tattoos , and basically ruin her own life without any help from you .
But the first step to all of that is having somewhere for the kids to sleep .
That ’s where the bunkbed comes in .
As you can see from the picture , it ’s steel framed , relatively new , comes with two mattresses , and the bottom bunk is a couch until you pull it out into a futon .
So here is the scale :
If any or all of this applies to you , if you are the one who was cheated ( male or female ) on and you STILL had to move out and need somewhere for your kids to sleep : $ 75 and hell , I ’ll throw in some pillows for you .
If you are a single mother or father , perhaps for other reasons , it ’s still a bargain at $ 100 If you are a young couple , working hard to make ends meet but doing pretty well , with your whole lives in front of you : $ 101 If you are the one who cheated in your marriage / partnership , the one who had to leave the house because you could not stop your libido from overruling your vows : $ 3,275 .
And I get to punch you in the face .
In fact , I 'll probably do that anyway , on the principle of the thing .
The full - face covering has inflamed passions in France The French government has refused to grant citizenship to a foreign national on the grounds that he forced his wife to wear the full Islamic veil .
The man , whose current nationality was not given , needed citizenship to settle in the country with his French wife .
But Immigration Minister Eric Besson said this was being refused because he was depriving his wife of the liberty to come and go with her face uncovered .
Last week , a parliamentary committee proposed a partial ban on full veils .
It also recommended that anyone showing visible signs of " radical religious practice " be refused residence permits and citizenship .
' Integration '
In a statement , Mr Besson said he had signed a decree on Tuesday rejecting a man 's citizenship application after it emerged that he had ordered his wife to cover herself with a head - to - toe veil .

" It became apparent during the regulation investigation and the prior interview that this person was compelling his wife to wear the all - covering veil , depriving her of the freedom to come and go with her face uncovered , and rejected the principles of secularism and equality between men and women , " he said .
Later , the minister stressed that French law required anyone seeking naturalisation to demonstrate their desire for integration .
Mr Besson 's decree has now been sent to Prime Minister Francois Fillon for approval .
The interior ministry says only 1,900 women wear full veils in France , home to Europe 's biggest Muslim minority .
In 2008 , a French court denied citizenship to a Moroccan woman on the grounds that her " radical " practice of Islam was incompatible with French values .

However , the actions of the Mr Soros 's investment fund however seem to be at odds with his own viewpoint .
During the World Economic Forum in Davos in late January , Mr Soros said : " When interest rates are low we have conditions for asset bubbles to develop , and they are developing at the moment .
The ultimate asset bubble is gold . "

Hyperinflation here we come
By Jon Herring
There are so many headwinds and cross currents in the market today , it is all but impossible to predict what will happen in the short term .
There is too much volatility and noise .
So , it pays to keep your eyes on the horizon , focused on the long term and the biggest trends .
Today , I want to tell about the biggest of all possible financial trends : the eventual bankruptcy of the United States government .
Or should I say the existing bankruptcy of the U.S. government ?
The United States government is facing an impending fiscal crisis .
Former Comptroller General David Walker calls it a “ cancer growing from within . ”
And the wheels for this were already set in motion well before the financial crisis .
With ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , a costly stimulus package and falling tax receipts , the U.S. was already neck deep in debt .
A Trillion Dollar Deficit ?
Even before the bailouts , the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) projected that the 2009 federal deficit would be nearly $ 482 billion .
Since then however , our government has jacked up spending by the trillions .
In just a few months , we have already charted a course to triple that deficit .
Some experts even suggest the 2009 deficit could be as high as $ 2 trillion !
But , believe it or not , this is just a drop in the bucket compared to the big picture
The True Scope of America ’s Fiscal Problem
Richard Fisher is the CEO of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank and a member of the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , which sets interest rate policy .
In a speech in May of this year , he stated that the total U.S. debt – including Medicare and Social Security – is more than $ 99 TRILLION !
Along the same lines , Laurence Kotlikoff , a Boston University economist , suggests that the “ fiscal gap ” – which is the difference between the number above and what we could reasonably expect to collect – is $ 66 trillion .
That is the definition of bankruptcy .
It is just a matter of time .
The scope and impact of our liabilities are stunning .
But let ’s play devil ’s advocate and consider where this kind of money might come from .
How can we possibly meet our obligations to retirees … as well as service our debt to foreign governments … and still operate our own government ?
It Wo n’t Come from Cuts in Spending
Let ’s listen in on Fisher ’s speech and consider what kind of spending cuts we would have to make to close the gap on what we owe :
“ To fully fund our nation ’s entitlement programs would be to cut discretionary spending by 97 percent .
But hold on .
That discretionary spending includes defense and national security , education , the environment and many other areas , not just those controversial earmarks that make the evening news .
All of them would have to be cut — almost eliminated — to tackle this problem through discretionary spending . ”
So , just to meet our current and future obligations , we would have to virtually clear out Washington , D.C.
And these changes would have to be made to perpetuity .
Now , Ron Paul might have cut government back to its constitutionally mandated functions , but do n’t expect anyone else in Washington to even consider the notion .
Congress has shown that it has NO moral regard for the long term economic viability of our country .
It Wo n’t Come from Tax Increases
Even if we did cut the government back to the bare minimum ( which we wo n’t ) , that still would n’t solve the problem .
We would also have to raise taxes .
By how much ?
Back to Richard Fisher :
“ Similarly on the taxation side , income tax revenue would have to rise 68 percent and remain that high forever .
Remember , though , I said tax revenue , not tax rates .
Who knows how much individual and corporate tax rates would have to change to increase revenue by 68 percent ? ”
We already do n’t collect enough tax revenues to pay the government ’s budget .
And with a recession taking hold and a depression on the horizon , where are the tax revenues going to come from ?
Taxation is simply not an option for this kind of money .
We Can’t Borrow it from Ourselves
During World War II , we borrowed the money we needed from ourselves .
But Americans had a high savings rate then .
This is no longer true .
Most Americans are upside down , with credit cards , mortgages , cars and other loans … not to mention growing unemployment .
It Wo n’t Come from Foreigners
For many , many years , the U.S. government has been able to pay for anything and everything we wanted to by borrowing the funds from other countries .
We did n’t even pay for the Iraq war … it has all been borrowed money .
But other countries are beginning to balk , and for a variety of reasons .
For one thing , the countries that do have reserves to lend us are turning their attention inward .
Just this week , China began to shift its policy away from plowing reserves into forex and instead is investing internally ( the Chinese government announced more than a half a trillion - dollar internal stimulus package this week ) .
This is BAD news for the U.S. government bond market .
Just as America ’s spending goes parabolic and we need to sell more debt than ever , the biggest buyer just left the trading floor .
Increases in spending and liabilities along with decreases in foreign lending equals a recipe for disaster .
So , where will the money come from ?
This is a job for the printing press .
While we are certainly facing deflation in the near term and a very choppy market , the groundwork has been laid for hyperinflation , soaring interest rates and exploding gold and silver prices .
So forget about the short term cross currents , and focus on the long term trends you can bank on .

It ’s been a week since HTC unveiled their new spring lineup .
The HTC Desire stole the show with it ’s huge 3.7 inch AMOLED screen and Snapdragon processor , but the HTC Legend still demands out attention .
Though the handset ’s specs are n’t anything to write home about , HTC has given the Legend a unique aluminum unibody design that gives the phone a distinct look and a solid feel .
Since the entire shell of the HTC Legend is crafter out of one piece of aluminum , HTC had to get a bit creative to find a way to fit in the battery , SIM , and microSD card .
At the bottom of the handset you ’ll find a small plastic cover .
Removing the cover reveals the battery compartment and metal connectors for the Legend ’s antenna .
To access the SIM card and microSD , simply flip back the protection cover .
You ’ll notice that you can easily remove both cards without having to remove the battery from the handset .
The battery is slotted in right above the SIM and memory cards .
The unibody design of the HTC Legend allows for a smaller and more compact shell .
Compared to the original HTC Hero , the Legend is nearly 3 mm thinner ( that ’s 17 % ) .

The majority of price cuts in the supermarket price wars between Asda and Tesco in the run-up to Christmas were just 1 p , a Guardian investigation can reveal .
In contrast , the majority of price increases imposed by the two retail giants during the same period were more than 10p .
This new analysis of supermarket pricing policy shows a " cynical manipulation of the language of value " according to independent expert Professor John Bridgeman , who criticised the use of " price flexing " .
Bridgeman , who as director general of the Office of Fair Trading from 1995 to 2000 conducted official inquiries into the supermarket sector , said the large number of 1 p decreases , promoted by Tesco and Asda as thousands of price cuts before the festive season , damaged the credibility of any marketing slogans they used .
" They are not in reality cutting prices but flexing prices , making them go up and down and destabilising the price structure , " Bridgeman said .
" All they are doing is introducing so much volatility no one can tell whether prices are going up or down .
It can only be to consumers ' detriment and it does their image no good . "
Data taken from Asda 's website by third - party analysts indicates that it cut nearly 800 prices between 16 and 23 December , with two - thirds of the cuts being just 1 p and 80 % of the total number being less than 10 p .
It also increased more than 850 prices that week .
In contrast , only 6 % of the rising prices went up by the same small increment of 1 p ; 53 % of the rises were more than 10p .
The pattern is repeated in data taken from the Tesco website : between 16 and 23 December it cut about 930 prices , 70 % of which were by just 1 p .
It also increased just under 1,000 prices in the same period ; in contrast 7 % of these rises were by the small increment of 1 p , and more than 600 – or 60 % – of the price increases were by more than 10p .
Both supermarkets said the majority of price increases in that period can be explained by products which had been discounted coming off promotion .
In Bridgeman 's view , the scale of price changing and the relative size of the cuts and rises is both confusing and misleading to consumers .
" The most dangerous thing [ for ] competition in this sector is price volatility , " he said .
" It confuses consumers , deters investors and has driven corner shops out of business because they do n't know what price they have to compete on , " he said .
Paul Dobson , a professor of retailing at Loughborough University who has been studying supermarket prices over a five - year period , says the pattern the Guardian had identified before Christmas matches the overall pattern .
Researchers at Loughborough and at Warwick University have found that , overall , price cuts made by the big four UK supermarkets – Tesco , Asda , Sainsbury 's and Morrisons – tend to be small and price rises larger .
His research has found the most common price cut among the big four over five years is 1 p .
Such low cuts have little impact at the checkout , but introducing them on large numbers of goods enables the supermarkets to claim they are cutting thousands of prices .
Over the five years , according to Dobson , these small cuts have been used to mask serious price hikes on a smaller number of lines with a big net effect on bills .
" In the big inflationary period of 2008 , there were two and a half times the numbers of price cuts in the big four as price rises , but in fact prices overall were rising very rapidly , " he said .
Dobson said his research shows that of the big four UK supermarkets , Tesco is the most prolific user of 1 p cuts , and Asda the second most prolific .
He also said Tesco changes its prices more than the other retailers .
Asda did not challenge the Guardian figures but said the explanation for the large number of 1 p cuts was " straightforward " .
" We wo n't be beaten on price .
So if a competitor goes lower than us on a comparable product , even by just a penny , we will always try and match or beat that price , " said a spokesman .
" Whichever way you look at the numbers , Asda is the undisputed lowest price supermarket – as independently verified by mysupermarket.com . "
Tesco also rejected Bridgeman 's interpretation of the significance of the number of small and large price changes :
In a statement , the company said : " We do not manipulate prices in this cynical way .
The Guardian and Professor Bridgeman are using data we do not recognise and his conclusion that we are deliberately confusing customers is nonsense .
" This is a competitive market and prices are lower this year than last year .
Our customers know us , shop with us every week , trust us and are not confused .
Instead of trying to find product price changes to fit a half - baked theory , Bridgeman and the Guardian should look at what has happened to the overall price of customers ' baskets .
As the current head of the Office of Fair Trading said last month , the sector is ' highly competitive ' and prices have ' come down enormously ' . "
Coming clean
A discount that ' disguised a rise '
The rise and fall in price of a leading brand of cleaner , CiF Antibacterial , provides a " perfect example of price volatility designed to confuse consumers " , according to Professor John Bridgeman .
In June last year the CiF cleaner was being sold at £ 2.50 in both Asda and Tesco .
In August it went on promotion briefly at Asda at £ 1 before returning to £ 2.60 .
Tesco dropped the price to £ 2 in September before putting it back up to £ 2.50 , and then discounting it again in November to half price at £ 1.25 .
By December Asda had put it up to £ 2.80 and higher , and the week before Christmas Tesco increased the price to £ 2.80 .
By the end of the year , both retailers had increased the price by what Bridgeman calls an " aggressive " 12 % over the price at the beginning at the summer .
Discounts have disguised a rise , he says .
Tesco rejected Professor Bridgeman 's interpretation of the significance of the number of small and large price changes :
" We do not manipulate prices in this cynical way .
The Guardian and Professor Bridgeman are using data we do not recognise and his conclusion that we are deliberately confusing customers is nonsense . "
Asda did not challenge the Guardian figures but said the explanation for the large number of 1 p cuts was " straightforward " .
" We wo n't be beaten on price .
So if a competitor goes lower than us on a comparable product , even by just a penny , we will always try and match or beat that price . "
You ’ve seen how a husband and wife team at UnderConsideration re-envisioned the holiday of love .
Now see the other winner of Studio 360 ’s Redesign Valentine ’s Day challenge , as picked by this week ’s guest , author and modern love expert Elizabeth Gilbert .
And , yes …it ’s bacon .
First place goes to the Broquet , a bacon bouquet , which was cooked up by Portland - based industrial designer Sarah Tisdale .
Last fall , Tisdale had just fallen for for her next - door neighbor when something brought his spirits down .
Tisdale
brainstormed an appropriate way to cheer him up .
“ I was n’t going to get him flowers or anything like that , ” she remembers , “ but I wanted to bring a smile to his face . ”
The two had bonded recently over their love for a winning combination : whiskey and bacon .
So Tisdale realized there was really only one option : A bacon bouquet .
Her house swirling with smoke , she
presented the neighbor with a dozen juicy pork blossoms .
He was thrilled , but the
relationship eventually fizzled , much like a grease on a hot skillet .
Tisdale has no regrets .
“ We ’re not
still dating , ” she says .
“ But it was very poetic and beautiful . ”
In an equally poetic twist , Tisdale herself was a vegan until bacon became–as it has for many recovering vegans–a gateway meat .
“ I do n’t know what it is , ” she says of the country ’s current obsession with bacon .
“ For me it ’s just this primal , salty thing . ”
Tisdale describes what she calls a “ bacon movement ” afoot in Portland , where house - cured meats are the pride of local sandwich shops .
“ You know , ” she confesses .
“ I ’m actually still mostly a vegan … except for bacon . ”
For Tisdale , the Broquet was a way for her to merge her love of food with her design skills–as well as her incurable inner Cupid .
“ I ’m a hopeless romantic , ” admits Tisdale .
“ I really love Valentine ’s Day , I love how silly and ridiculous and pretty and funny it is . ”
But she agrees that as a culture , we could all use a reminder about what Valentine ’s Day really means .
“ It ’s not just about romantic love , ” she says .
“ It ’s about sharing what you love with someone else . ”
Mexico City , Mexico ( CNN ) --
Leaders of more than 30 Latin American and Caribbean nations are meeting in Mexico from Monday to launch a group that will serve as an alternative to the Organization of American States .
The main difference between the OAS and the yet - to - be- named organization will be that the United States and Canada will not be members .
Leaders of Latin American countries have been meeting almost every year since 1986 when the Rio Group was created by countries including Brazil , Argentina , Mexico , Colombia and Venezuela .
This year 's summit is intended to take the Rio Group to a new level by creating the organization .
Among the main topics to be discussed at the summit is whether to recognize Porfirio Lobo as the legitimate president of Honduras .
Lobo , who took office in late January , was elected under a de facto government that resulted from a coup in June against then - president Manuel Zelaya .
The ousted leader was then forced out of the country .
Other topics on the agenda include the creation of a long - term plan to help Haiti recover from the devastating effects of the earthquake and Argentina 's conflict with Great Britain over oil drilling offshore from the Falkland Islands .
The Unity Summit of Latin America and the Caribbean will be held in Cancun .
Bayer to pay $ 1.5 million over GM rice

Who Is Brazil Catering to in Approving Bayer 's New Controversial Rice ? - Brazzil magazine ------ Reuters,5 Feb 2010http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE61421W20100205*
Second ruling of about 500 similar cases pending *
Company says will consider legal optionsFRANKFURT , Feb 5 ( Reuters ) - Germany 's Bayer ( BAYGn.DE ) was ordered by a jury in the United States to pay $ 1.5 million in damages to three farmers for losses they incurred because of contaminations of Bayer 's genetically modified rice , the second in about 500 similar cases pending .
The jury 's ruling in a St. Louis court against Bayer 's CropScience division follows a related case in December , in which Bayer was ordered to pay $ 2 million , the chemicals - and drugmaker said on Friday after the close of trading in Germany .
"
The company will assess this ruling thoroughly and consider its options , " a Bayer spokesman in Germany said .
" Bayer CropScience is standing by its view that the company has handled its biotech rice responsibly and appropriately at all times , " he added .
A rice variety whose genetic code had been modified by a Bayer subsidiary for research purposes and which was not approved for commercial cultivation was found in the food supply chain in August 2006 after it had been tested by a U.S. university .
As a result , Japan and the European Union restricted U.S. rice from crossing their borders , leading to a plunge in rice prices , a drop in exports and extensive losses incurred by U.S. rice farmers .
" Since the amounts claimed differ considerably from case to case , the rulings so far do not allow for conclusions regarding the outcome of the remaining cases pending , " Bayer said .
The long - grain rice in question had a protein known as Liberty Link , which allows the crop to withstand applications of a certain weed killer .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration said at the time there was no public health or environmental risk associated with the rice variety .
( Reporting by Ludwig Burger ; Editing by Rupert Winchester ) ------IN ANOTHER VERDICT FOR PLAINTIFFS : $ 1.5 MILLION AWARD TO RICE FARMERS IN ARKANSAS AND MISSISSIPPI , USA [ Media release via TGI Marketing Communications on behalf of farmers ' attorneys ]
A St. Louis , Mo. jury today found Germany - based Bayer Cropscience AG and several of its affiliates negligent in the second of several " bellwether trials " scheduled for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri , and awarded a total of $ 1.5 million to two Arkansas long - grain rice farmers and one in Mississippi whose crops and their livelihood , the jury determined , were harmed by Bayer 's genetically modified rice .
Joe and Jim Penn , of Portia , Ark. , were awarded $ 480,692 in compensatory damages and fellow Arkansas rice farmer Jerry Catt , of Corning , Ark. , was awarded $ 96,996 in compensatory damages .
Black Dog Planting Co. , of Lyon , Miss. , represented by partner Gary Goode , was awarded $ 923,154 in compensatory damages .
The suit was brought on behalf of the rice farmers based on economic damages they suffered from contamination of their crops by an unapproved genetically modified strain of rice seed produced by Bayer .
Discovery of the contamination led to a dramatic drop in U.S. rice prices , as the European Union stopped purchasing the U.S. rice .
The farmers suffered economic loss due to the much lower demand for their rice since 2006 , when the contaminated rice was discovered .
This trial , which began January 11 , is the second of five scheduled " bellwether " or test - trials scheduled by U.S. District Court Judge Catherine Perry that involves rice farmers in Missouri , Arkansas , Louisiana , Mississippi , and Texas .
These trials represent the first step Perry ordered in hearing the multi-district litigation involving some 6,000 rice producers in those five states .
St. Louis attorney Don Downing , of the firm Gray , Ritter & Graham , was the plaintiffs ’ lead attorney in the first two cases and is co-lead counsel of the multi-district litigation .
"
We 're pleased that another jury returned verdicts in favor of our clients and their family farming operations .
A second consecutive verdict against Bayer should send a clear and strong message to the company about its negligent conduct and the damages that conduct actually caused to American rice farmers , not only in this case but in the other matters that are scheduled for trial , " Downing said .
The jury used the same formula in awarding compensatory damages due to the price drop for all plaintiffs .
The awards varied because they were based on the number of acres each farmer planted and the impact of the contamination on their land .
More test trials involving Bayer and rice farmers are scheduled for this summer in the same federal courtroom and will include farmers from Louisiana and Texas .------ Verena GlassBrazzil ( magazine ) , February 2010http://www.brazzil.com/component/content/article/215-february-2010/10350-who-is-brazil-catering-to-in-approving-bayers-new-controversial-rice.htmlRice bagIt is possible that Brazil may win a sad new title in 2010 : the first country in the world to license the commercial planting of a new variety of genetically - modified rice , Bayer 's LL62 .
If CTNBio ( National Technical Commission on Biosecurity ) approves the proposal at a meeting later this month , the rice will be the 20th genetically - modified product grown commercially in the country .
CTNBio has maintained a steady flow of approval of GMO ( genetically - modified organisms ) licensing requests over the last years .
Between 2005 and 2009 , CTNBio gave licensing for two varieties of soy , eleven varieties of corn and six of cotton .
There seems to be little doubt that the commission will continue this trend and approve the rice , except for one thing : this time there is a generalized opposition to the rice from various sectors .
Opponents include researchers , consumer groups , environmental groups , and even groups that have traditionally been pro-transgenic , such as Embrapa ( Brazilian Agricultural Research Company , a public entity which has supported GMOs ) , Farsul ( Agricultural Federation of Rio Grande do Sul ) , and Federarroz ( Federation of Rice Grower Associations of Rio Grande do Sul ) .
According to Embrapa and Southern rice farmers , the major threat of Bayer 's rice is the possible transference of a genetic mutation of red rice , which is considered the most invasive plant of irrigated rice farming .
With contamination , this plant , which already causes damages to productivity and quality of the rice in areas which are highly infested , will become resistant to chemical control .
In other words , according to Embrapa , if transgenic rice is licensed , it will be a threat to food security , capable of contaminating other varieties of rice in the country .
Thus , if researchers ( concerned with scientific evaluations ) , producers ( concerned with economic questions ) , and consumers ( concerned with what they eat - Greenpeace has already gathered 20,000 signatures against the transgenic rice ) are opposed to the proposal , then one could ask the question , To whom is the CTNBio catering if it votes in favor of Bayer 's rice ?
Perhaps it would be imprudent to suggest that the sales of multinational transgenic companies is related to the licensing of GMOs in Brazil .
But the fact is , according to Exame magazine , Monsanto , which has had nine varieties of GMOs approved , earned in sales US $ 783.9 million in 2006 , US $ 899.2 million in 2007 , and US $ 954.8 million in 2008 .
According to the Law of Biosecurity , the commission , created in 2005 , was to " give technical and consultative support to the federal government in formulating , updating , and implementing the National Policy of Biosecurity , relative to GMOs , such as the establishment of technical norms and technical partners in regard to the protection of human health .
" Such protection also extended to other organisms and the environment , and activities which involve the construction , experimentation , farming , manipulation , transportation , commercialization , stocking , consuming , licensing and disposal of GMOs and their derivatives .
"
In order for a GMO to obtain commercial licensing , fourteen of the 27 members of the commission must approve the product .
According to entities of civil society who have watched over the work of CTNBio , many of the technical analyses in the processes of licensing GMOs have lacked scientific rigor and have not followed the principles of caution as outlined in the Protocol of Cartagena regarding Biosecurity .
In addition these processes have lacked research on national soil that proves the security of the commercial planting of the varieties that were licensed .
On the contrary , a strong characteristic of the majority of the commission 's members is that they favor GMO technology .
In 2003 , eight of the current members of CTNBio wrote an open letter in which they affirmed that " Brazil can not let go of transgenic technology " as it is " essential for sustainability and keeps agribusiness and small family farms competitive , and brings innumerous social and economic benefits to the country .
" Among current members , there are various who have or have had some personal relation with biotech companies or with the pro-transgenic lobby groups of Basf , Bayer , Cargill , Dow , Dupont , Monsanto , Pioneer , Syngenta , and others .
Regarding observance of adequate scientific criteria in the process of licensing GMOs , or in the establishment of security norms for protection against contamination of non-transgenic fields by GMOs , CTNBio has been repeatedly challenged by diverse institutions .
In 2007 , the licensing of Bayer 's transgenic corn Liberty Link and Monsanto 's MON 810 ( outlawed in France , Austria , Greece , Luxemburg , Hungary , Italy , Poland and Germany ) was questioned by Anvisa ( National Sanitation Agency ) and Ibama ( Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Natural Resources ) .
Both entities pointed out errors in the technical reports which were fundamental in the licensing .
In the case of Bayer 's corn , Anvisa pointed out the insufficient data around proof of the security of transgenic corn for human consumption .
According to Ibama , CTNBio ignored the inexistence of environmental impact studies and an analysis of risk .
The Minister of the Environment also pointed out the absence of " studies or literature which prove the absence of environment damage , something alone which should have impeded the licensing .
" Shortly after these charges were made , entities filed a civil suit which forced the Justice Department to demand of CTNBio the creation of norms which would in theory protect non-GMO corn fields from contamination .
In this case , minimal distances were established to protect non-GMO corn fields from transgenic corn - 20 to 100 meters depending on different types of barriers .
But over the past three years , various entities have reported the contamination of non-GMO corn fields .
The Department of Inspection and Agriculture Defense officially confirmed these accusations in 2009 , proving that the CTNBio's norms are inadequate .
" The preliminary reports indicate that under the present norms it is impossible to secure the coexistence of GMO fields , conventional fields , and organic fields , as at the present moment all areas monitored show cross-pollination at a distance much greater than the current norm provides , " affirmed the Secretary of Agriculture .
Given this information , at the end of October 2009 , various organizations of civil society promoted a civil law suit that ask for the suspension of the licensing for commercially planted transgenic corn until an adequate norm can be established .
The suit currently is awaiting a decision from a judge in ParanÃ¡ .
In response to this issue , a representative of the Science and Technology Ministry , Luiz Antonio Barreto de Castro , acknowledged the contamination of non-GMO corn , but stated , " the norms of CTNBio were established taking into consideration that not always would the contamination result in damage for the farmers who produce varieties called heirlooms ... even if contamination occurs , it will be to the advantage of the farmer .
" But contrary to Castro 's assertion , damages caused by contamination from GMO fields are recurrent in Brazil and in the rest of the world .
In 2004 , for example , Eco Brazil Organics Ltda in the state of ParanÃ¡ had its production paralyzed after their fields were contaminated - three million dollars worth of damage .
In 2006 , Bayer 's experimental fields for transgenic rice contaminated conventional fields and caused damages of one billion dollars around the world , according to a report issued by Greenpeace International .
CTNBio's generosity towards transgenic has already had its collateral effects .
Biotech companies originally argued that their technology would mean less use of chemicals and pesticides .
Yet one study shows that the use of herbicides on soy , for example , has actually increased .
In 2004 , 129.6 thousand tons of herbicides were poured into soy fields .
In 2008 the volume was raised to 192 thousand tons .
It is important to remember here that Brazil has become the biggest world consumer of agricultural chemicals , using nearly 673,890 tons per year .
The collateral effects of this : 6.3 thousand cases of human intoxication in 2007 resulting in 162 deaths .

Ironic headline of the decade :
Blizzard Dumps Snow on Copenhagen as Leaders Battle Warming
By Christian Wienberg in Bloomberg News
Dec. 17 ( Bloomberg ) —
World leaders flying into Copenhagen today to discuss a solution to global warming will first face freezing weather as a blizzard dumped 10 centimeters ( 4 inches ) of snow on the Danish capital overnight .
“ Temperatures will stay low at least the next three days , ” Henning Gisseloe , an official at Denmark ’s Meteorological Institute , said today by telephone , forecasting more snow in coming days .
“ There ’s a good chance of a white Christmas . ”
Delegates from 193 countries have been in Copenhagen since Dec. 7 to discuss how to fund global greenhouse gas emission cuts .
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive before the summit is scheduled to end tomorrow .
Denmark has a maritime climate and milder winters than its Scandinavian neighbors .
It has n’t had a white Christmas for 14 years , under the DMI ’s definition , and only had seven last century .
Temperatures today fell as low as minus 4 Celsius ( 25 Fahrenheit ) .
DMI defines a white Christmas as 90 percent of the country being covered by at least 2 centimeters of snow on the afternoon of Dec. 24 .
=====================
While I ’ve never put much faith in his forecasts due to the overhyped way he presents them , in this case Piers Corbyn was right .
See his November 30th forecast for Copenhagen here .
While his main start of snow was a bit late , he predicted then :
14th-16/17th
Dec will have more snow showers which will turn heavy with biting cold winds .
=====================
And now , send in the trolls .

Anthony Hamilton is planning to run a fleet of 2009 - spec Formula 1 cars in an effort to help young drivers gain mileage in current grand prix cars without being constrained by the testing restrictions , today 's AUTOSPORT reveals .
The father of 2008 world champion Lewis , Hamilton intends to lease year - old cars , along with equipment and personnel , from teams and run them independently in a programme called the GP Prep Drivers Academy .
He has already agreed terms with McLaren for the supply of two cars , and is in advanced talks with other teams .
Hamilton said that the idea was to give young drivers who would otherwise not get a chance to test an F1 car a chance to prove their potential .
" If you look at our sport .
drivers are very lucky to make F1 , because there 's no career path structure for it , " Hamilton told AUTOSPORT .
" There are guys who do n't get a look in .
The idea with GP Prep is to provide more of an opportunity for young drivers to be spotted . "
Costs are still being determined , although it is expected that a day 's testing will require a similar budget to a weekend of racing in a high - level open - wheeler .
Deals are also being finalised with circuits , although it is anticipated that most running will take place in the UK .
The programme is expected to be launched in March .
Working for a large company comes with a lot of baggage , the least of which is an RFID security badge .
For those small companies who can't afford such extravagantly wireless door key solutions there 's another option : this DIY project completed by a team of developers at Sunlight Labs .
It all centers around a Linksys WRT54GL , a Linux - based wireless router that , with a little firmware hackery and a bit of wiring , was tethered into the office 's door release buzzer .
The team then went about allowing SSH access to the router and created Android and iPhone apps that instantly connect to the device and open the door , authenticated by a PIN and a unique ID assigned to each device .
Users can also deliver their PIN via SMS or a simple phone call to open the door .

Budget Forecasts , Compared With Reality
Just two years ago , surpluses were predicted by 2012 .
How accurate have past White House budget forecasts been ?
To lead in this effort , however , our government must strike at the source of the problem -- with reforms that only Congress can enact and the president can sign .
We know that greenhouse gasses are heavily implicated as a cause of climate change .
And we know that among all greenhouse gasses , the worst by far is the carbon - dioxide that results from fossil - fuel combustion .
Yet for all the good work of entrepreneurs and inventors in finding cleaner and better technologies , the fundamental incentives of the market are still on the side of carbon - based energy .
This has to change before we can make the decisive shift away from fossil fuels .
For the market to do more , government must do more by opening new paths of invention and ingenuity .
And we must do this in a way that gives American businesses new incentives and new rewards to seek , instead of just giving them new taxes to pay and new orders to follow .
The most direct way to achieve this is through a system that sets clear limits on all greenhouse gases , while also allowing the sale of rights to excess emissions .
And this is the proposal I will submit to the Congress if I am elected president -- a cap - and - trade system to change the dynamic of our energy economy .
As a program under the Clean Air Act , the cap - and - trade system achieved enormous success in ridding the air of acid rain .
And the same approach that brought a decline in sulfur dioxide emissions can have an equally dramatic and permanent effect on carbon emissions .
Instantly , automakers , coal companies , power plants , and every other enterprise in America would have an incentive to reduce carbon emissions , because when they go under those limits they can sell the balance of permitted emissions for cash .
As never before , the market would reward any person or company that seeks to invent , improve , or acquire alternatives to carbon - based energy .
It is very hard to picture venture capitalists , corporate planners , small businesses and environmentalists all working to the same good purpose .
But such cooperation is actually possible in the case of climate change , and this reform will set it in motion .
The people of this country have a genius for adapting , solving problems , and inventing new and better ways to accomplish our goals .
But the federal government can't just summon those talents by command -- only the free market can draw them out .
A cap - and - trade policy will send a signal that will be heard and welcomed all across the American economy .
Those who want clean coal technology , more wind and solar , nuclear power , biomass and bio-fuels will have their opportunity through a new market that rewards those and other innovations in clean energy .
The market will evolve , too , by requiring sensible reductions in greenhouse gases , but also by allowing full flexibility in how industry meets that requirement .
Entrepreneurs and firms will know which energy investments they should make .
And the highest rewards will go to those who make the smartest , safest , most responsible choices .
A cap - and - trade reform wi ll also create a profitable opportunity for rural America to receive market - based payments -- instead of government subsidies -- for the conservation practices that store carbon in the soils of our nation 's farms .
We will cap emissions according to specific goals , measuring progress by reference to past carbon emissions .
By the year 2012 , we will seek a return to 2005 levels of emission , by 2020 , a return to 1990 levels , and so on until we have achieved at least a reduction of sixty percent below 1990 levels by the year 2050 .
In the course of time , it may be that new ideas and technologies will come along that we can hardly imagine today , allowing all industries to change with a speed that will surprise us .
More likely , however , there will be some companies that need extra emissions rights , and they will be able to buy them .
The system to meet these targets and timetables will give these companies extra time to adapt -- and that is good economic policy .
It is also a matter of simple fairness , because the cap - and - trade system will create jobs , improve livelihoods , and strengthen futures across our country .
The goal in all of this is to assure an energy supply that is safe , secure , diverse , and domestic .
And in pursuit of these objectives , we cannot afford to take economic growth and job creation for granted .
A strong and growing economy is essential to all of our goals , and especially the goal of finding alternatives to carbon - based technology .
We want to turn the American economy toward cleaner and safer energy sources .
And you can't achieve that by imposing costs that the American economy cannot sustain .
As part of my cap - and - trade incentives , I will also propose to include the purchase of offsets from those outside the scope of the trading system .
This will broaden the array of rewards for reduced emissions , while also lowering the costs of compliance with our new emissions standards .
Through the sale of offsets -- and with strict standards to assure that reductions are real -- our agricultural sector alone can provide as much as forty percent of the overall reductions we will require in greenhouse gas emissions .
And in the short term , farmers and ranchers can do it in some of the most cost - effective ways .

CHAMPAIGN , Ill . —
A pending U.S. Supreme Court ruling could aggravate the influence of corporate campaign spending that already has skewed justice in some of the nation ’s courts , a University of Illinois labor law expert warns .
Michael LeRoy says he found evidence that judges ’ rulings are being swayed by campaign contributions from businesses , based on a new study of more than 200 state court cases .
The study will appear in the Iowa Law Review .
He predicts justice would tip even more out of balance if the Supreme Court strikes down limits on election spending in a high - stakes challenge to the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reforms
Act of 2002 , commonly known as the McCain - Feingold bill .
The high court ’s ruling , expected as early as this week , could give corporations , unions and activist groups virtual free rein to run election - time ads for and against candidates , legal analysts say , and lay the groundwork for direct donations to political campaigns .
“ It would open up the spigot for judicial contributions and greatly aggravate the problem , further politicizing and polarizing some of these state courts , ” said LeRoy , a professor of labor and of law .
Debate over the looming court ruling in the case – Citizens United v. the Federal Election Commission – has centered largely on how the flood of money would affect presidential and congressional elections .
LeRoy says the impact on judicial campaigns is just as worrisome .
“ The influence of judges is extraordinary because they are the final word in the process and there is immediately a winner and a loser as a result , ” he said .
“ And both the winner and the loser have many other people in society who are equally affected because they are in the same position . ”
LeRoy says a torrent of corporate money already is flowing into judicial races , allowed by law in some states and contributed through faceless subsidiary organizations in others .
He says his new research suggests the election - time backing from business is yielding unequal justice .
The study examined 223 state court rulings on arbitrator awards in employment disputes from 1975 through 2008 .
Employees won only 32.1 percent of cases reviewed by party - affiliated judges , the study found , compared with 52.7 percent in cases decided by judges who were appointed or elected in non-partisan elections .
LeRoy says the findings are limited because the study did not examine whether any of the judges received campaign donations from corporate employers .
“ But it ’s hard to think of an alternative explanation , ” he said .
“ The inference I arrive at is that there ’s something about the election process that is influencing the outcome . ”
While the study examined arbitration awards , LeRoy says the influence of campaign contributions could affect rulings in a host of areas , from employers seeking to duck liability in workplace injury or wage and hour disputes to activist groups seeking favorable rulings in right - to - life or gun-control cases .
He says courts could eliminate the conflict of interest by changing standards for disqualifying judges from hearing cases .
Now , judges assigned to civil cases rule themselves on requests to appoint a new judge .
Under LeRoy ’s proposal , another judge would make that ruling if the assigned judge received campaign donations from a company or cause involved in the case .
“ I think that in itself would have a restraining influence , ” LeRoy said .
“ If corporations knew they might not get a particular judge , why pony up millions of dollars ? ”
He says the move would be a good first step to ensure that courts remain “ pure institutions , ” above the bias that can come with money .
“ Money should not decide a single case , ” LeRoy said .
“ The question I have is what is the difference between donating millions of dollars to a judge in hopes of getting a particular outcome and bribing the judge ?
There ’s a difference , but I ’m uncomfortable with the narrowness of the difference . ”

Kabul , Afghanistan ( CNN ) --
Six members of NATO - led forces in Afghanistan were killed Monday in three separate incidents , NATO announced .
It was the deadliest one - day total since October .
On two consecutive days -- the 26th and 27th -- seven members of the NATO - led International Security Assistance Force were killed .
On Monday , three U.S. service members died during a firefight with militants in southern Afghanistan , NATO officials said .
In eastern Afghanistan , two members of the NATO - led forces were killed in an engagement with enemy forces .
Although NATO did not supply the nationalities of the two fallen combatants , the French Ministry of Defense announced that one of its soldiers was killed in a gunbattle in the village of Alasay , which is in eastern Afghanistan .
Another soldier was killed by an improvised explosive device in eastern Afghanistan , the ISAF reported .
No nationality was given for that soldier either .
NATO did not offer additional details .
That ’s right kids , according to the latest issue of Playstation : The Official Magazine the game is apparently underway and should release within the year .

Never the less POM is not one to make up rumors , stating that “ inFAMOUS 2 will pick up a significant time after the first game , offering a reshaped metropolis . ”

No doubt inFAMOUS will get a sequel sooner or later , though our bet is on the later .

The gulf between marriage and divorce could not be greater or more significant .
Likewise , marriage and divorce records offer distinct legal definitions and information .
Divorce records , with which we are concerned with here at Divorcerecords.org , provide citizens or corporate entities detailed information concerning both former spouses , their respective addresses , the reason for the divorce , child custody rulings , and the names of both sets of lawyers and the judge presiding over the divorce proceedings .
Divorce records can also contain such sensitive information as the existence of restraining orders , counseling appointments , and the division of the former couples property .
The exact reason for the divorce is also codified in the records , which could make the reason for the divorce a matter of public scrutiny .
This could be embarrassing , but as a decree of divorce is a governmental record , it is subject to the Freedom of Information Act and is thus subject to the public domain .
Each state or county will make these records accessible in a unique way .
Some states fold divorce records into public records , other states have the records filed on the county level .
Almost all 50 states have some kind of electronic database that makes finding or requesting a specific divorce record much easier .
Some states require you to submit a request to view a divorce record in writing .
Once verified , the requested divorce records could take anywhere from 2 to 10 days to arrive in the mail .
In some cases this may require a fee .
Though it is a recent phenomenon , many people are scouring divorce records in search of genealogical information .
The electronic databases , as we know it , is approximately fifty year old .
Relatives have had to resort to finding death certificates and divorce records in order to trace long - lost relatives or loved ones .
Legal Differences Between Marriage and Divorce Records
marriage and divorce records
Though it may seem obvious , many people are confused as to the differences between .
Divorce Records are important public records that fall under the jurisdiction of the state or respective county .
They are subject to public scrutiny and can be accessed , often for a fee .
In contrast to marriage records , divorce records can be used to verify a background check or employment application .
Marriage records , on the other hand , are seldom scrutinized .
Though they must be presented to obtain passports , social security numbers , and in some cases to file joint taxes , seldom will a marriage record be used to verify someone ?s identity .
Marriage records are rarely requested , expect by the couple in question , and usually to replace a lost or misplaced marriage license .
All duplicate marriage records or licenses must be paid for electronically or in person .
Most duplicates cost between $ 15 and $ 30 and can be requested online , by mail , or in person .
At Divorcerecords.org , we are committed to helping you find all the divorce records you need .
Our search capabilities are all free of charge , but in cases requiring physical copies be accessed or mailed , you may have to pay a nominal fee to the state or county .
We can help you filter your search by name , address , date of divorce , location of divorce , and even by the state or county case number .
Breck Eisner , director of The Crazies , is currently heavily involved bringing a new , non-campy , 3 - D Flash Gordon film to life .
But how do you take the cheese out of Flash Gordon , with all its winged and furry - faced co-stars ?
Eisner explains .
Advertisement
We 've read a lot about your upcoming work , after The Crazies .
We heard you might be the director for The Brood , and that you are involved with a new take on the Flash Gordon franchise .
Which movie would come first ?
Well , The Brood , I was just approached about it .
I have n't decided .
I 'm not sure if its one I want to take on .
I love the original , and I 'm not sure if it's a movie that I think is ready for a remake .
I 've been soul - searching and deciding if I want to do that .
Advertisement
Flash Gordon is a project that I 've been pursuing for years .
I absolutely love that movie , and that strip .
It 's at Sony , we have the writers on , we 've done one draft .
I 've been brainstorming with them over the past couple months , when I finished post [ for The Crazies ] .
They are busy writing right now , so we will have a script from that in short order , hopefully .
It 's a big , giant movie .
And these things have a lot of different roads to go down before they get green light .
Hopefully we 'll get there , but it 's always a long - shot , but it 's one that I feel incredible passion for .
In developing it , I 've really gone back to the original Alex Raymond strips and pulled information from those .
I read that you really want to strip Flash Gordon of its campiness , what would have to go in order to accomplish this ?
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Yeah .
Well inherently there are two key elements , I think , that removes the camp from the movie .
When you re-read Raymond 's strips , which were drawn from ' 32 to about the mid-40s you can't read them as a human being living in today 's world .
You have to imagine living in a world pre-space travel , and the world of the 30s .
It 's kind of a more naive view of the Universe .
It 's a mistake to try and [ take ] the sensibilities from then , and transplant them into today .
So we , what the writers have been saying , is " What would it be like if Raymond was still alive today ?
If he was writing the strips now ?
What would he be doing ?
How much more sophisticated would it be ? "
And that 's one one of our points of view .
The other is , it 's not just the level of sophistication in the world and in Mongo , and the design and the creatures .
It 's also the sophistication of character in Flash , and Dale , and Ming .
What characters are more realistic and human ?
What characters have more flaws , and journeys to go on in the course of the movie ?
Advertisement
It 's such an iconic image , the Flash Gordon figure , just the costume and his boots alone .
It 's hard to imagine losing the costume or other classic images from the strip .
Are those the type of things you think you 'll have to do away with ?
No , I think it 's all a careful balance .
I can tell you there will be Hawkmen , there will be Lionman , [ and ]
Ming will be in the movie .
In a version that is going to take place on Mongo .
I love the source material , so lots of it is going to be in it .
I 'm not rediscovering , I 'm not recreating a take on his original material .
There are elements that will be in it , and there will certainly be elements that change .
And unique takes on it that might not have been in reflected on before .
Advertisement
So were you a fan of the TV series ?
No .
Not at all , [ ughhh ] .
I thought the TV series was not good .
I think it did a lot of damage to the brand .
To do Flash Gordon right — one of the reasons you can't is because of budget .
I do n't typically ever equate budget [ with ] a level of sophistication , or success in a project .
Certainly , if you have all the money in the world , it does n't mean you 're going to have a good movie .
But in a big movie like Flash Gordon , that takes place on another world , if you do n't have the budget to do it right or the technology to do it right , it 's going to inherently come out campy , whether you want it to or not .
It 's the only way that you can put that through to portray another planet .
My take on this is to not do it , unless we have the right budget and can do it the right way .

I ’ve just returned from the thoroughly enjoyable Fiction and British Politics conference , and hope to post a little more about it once I manage to marshall my thoughts into a suitable post .
For now , though , here is another review originally written for Political Studies Review .
The Constitution of the United Kingdom : A Contextual Analysis by Peter Leyland
The Constitution of the United Kingdom is the first book in Hart Publishing ’s new ‘ Constitutional Systems of the World ’ series , and the editors have presented an interesting challenge for the series from the outset .
Unlike many other constitutional systems , such as that of the United States , the constitution of the United Kingdom is uncodified , far less rigidly defined than other existing constitutions .
Commentators have occasionally spoken of the UK ’s ‘ back - of - an - envelope ’ constitution which depends as much ( or even more so ) on convention and precedent as it does on formal documents .
To include both the written and unwritten aspects of the constitution of the United Kingdom , the book first looks into the historical context of the system , examining the various sources of constitutional authority and the constitution ’s underlying principles as they have developed over the course of the country ’s history .
From the historical background , the analysis moves on to explore institutional structures and divisions of power — including power divisions within the government ; among national , regional , and local government ; and ( in the past half - century ) between the United Kingdom and the European Union .
Leyland ’s work covers the intricate structural framework of the British constitution , setting out sections on the changing role of the Crown , the relationship between Parliament and the executive , the judiciary , and devolved and local government .
There are short summaries of notable legal cases and of current constitutional debates , such as the place of the House of Lords as a second chamber , the case for abolishing the monarchy , the recent reformation of the office of the Lord Chancellor , and the ‘ West Lothian question ’ on devolved government for England .
At the end of each section is a guide to further reading , featuring useful texts and appropriate Web sites for those interested in exploring the subject in greater depth .
On the whole , the book provides a compact yet comprehensive analysis of the complexities of the British constitution , and presents the analysis in a straightforward , well - written manner .
As the first book in the series , The Constitution of the United Kingdom has set a fine example for the other books to follow , and one can only hope that forthcoming titles will be equally valuable for those who have an interest in constitutional systems of the world .

Physicists develop 3D metamaterial nanolens that achieves super - resolution imaging
( Nanowerk News )
A research team from Northeastern University has developed a new nanolens that can beat the diffraction limit to achieve so - called super - resolution imaging , better than can be achieved by current technology .
The nanolens is made from arrays of nanowires also called as metamaterials  manufactured materials not found in nature  and has superior imaging capabilities compared to current imaging technologies .
The research was conducted by a team led Srinivas Sridhar , Ph.D. , distinguished professor and Director of the Electronic Materials Research Institute at Northeastern University , and is featured in the January 11 issue of the journal Applied Physics Letters .
Conventional lenses construct an image of an object only using ordinary waves , discarding information regarding the fine , tiny details of the object that are contained in evanescent waves .
For this reason , conventional optical systems , such as microscopes , cannot accurately image very small , nano - sized objects .
Using a different approach , the research team organized and packaged nanowires to design a new type of lens .
By precisely aligning and arranging millions of nanowires  each one measuring 20 nanometers in diameter  they were able to control how light passed through the lens .
The lens is able to depict a clear , high - resolution image of nano - sized objects because it uses both the ordinary and evanescent waves to construct the image .
 This is the best superlens realized so far and is a significant development in the field of high resolution optical imaging ,  said Sridhar .
The researchers expect that the technology can be used to improve biomedical imaging and lithography techniques .
 We have the capability for the large - scale production of these nanolenses and hope to manufacture these devices in the near future ,  added Sridhar .
How to Reform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
Recent scandals have undermined the credibility of the international scientific body , yet the scientific evidence for climate change remains as strong as ever
[ H/t Heather . ]
Haiti was a nation of farmers , but thanks to the strings attached to U.S. aid , government policies made profitable farming impossible .
So the farmers were pushed to the cities to provide a cheap manufacturing labor force .
All those people you see on the TV in their shattered shantytowns ?
We helped put them there .
With exploitative loans and yes , even a classic CIA - backed coup , we helped create this mess .
Here 's Naomi Klein , the author of " The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism , " speaking Wednesday night at the Ethical Culture Society to warn us against it happening again :
But as I write about in The Shock Doctrine , crises are often used now as the pretext for pushing through policies that you cannot push through under times of stability .
Countries in periods of extreme crisis are desperate for any kind of aid , any kind of money , and are not in a position to negotiate fairly the terms of that exchange .
And I just want to pause for a second and read you something , which is pretty extraordinary .
I just put this up on my website .
The headline is “ Haiti : Stop Them Before They Shock Again . ”
This went up a few hours ago , three hours ago , I believe , on the Heritage Foundation website .
“ Amidst the Suffering , Crisis in Haiti Offers Opportunities to the U.S.
In addition to providing immediate humanitarian assistance , the U.S. response to the tragic earthquake in Haiti earthquake offers opportunities to re-shape Haiti ’s long - dysfunctional government and economy as well as to improve the image of the United States in the region . ”
And then goes on .
Now , I do n’t know whether things are improving or not , because it took the Heritage Foundation thirteen days before they issued thirty - two free market solutions for Hurricane Katrina .
We put that document up on our website , as well .
It was close down the housing projects , turn the Gulf Coast into a tax - free free enterprise zone , get rid of the labor laws that forces contractors to pay a living wage .
Yeah , so it took them thirteen days before they did that in the case of Katrina .
In the case of Haiti , they did n’t even wait twenty - four hours .
Now , why I say I do n’t know whether it ’s improving or not is that two hours ago they took this down .
So somebody told them that it was n’t couth .
And then they put up something that was much more delicate .
Fortunately , the investigative reporters at Democracy Now ! managed to find that earlier document in a Google cache .
But what you ’ll find now is a much gentler “ Things to Remember While Helping Haiti . ”
And buried down there , it says , “ Long - term reforms for Haitian democracy and its economy are also badly overdue . ”
But the point is , we need to make sure that the aid that goes to Haiti is , one , grants , not loans .
This is absolutely crucial .
This is an already heavily indebted country .
This is a disaster that , as Amy said , on the one hand is nature , is , you know , an earthquake ; on the other hand is the creation , is worsened by the poverty that our governments have been so complicit in deepening .
Crises — natural disasters are so much worse in countries like Haiti , because you have soil erosion because the poverty means people are building in very , very precarious ways , so houses just slide down because they are built in places where they should n’t be built .
All of this is interconnected .
But we have to be absolutely clear that this tragedy , which is part natural , part unnatural , must , under no circumstances , be used to , one , further indebt Haiti , and , two , to push through unpopular corporatist policies in the interests of our corporations .
And this is not a conspiracy theory .
They have done it again and again .

Below the fold is a guest essay from a friend of mine who is an internal medicine M.D. practicing in East - central Minnesota .

The post is a shortened version of a longer essay on the interrelationships between health care , human health , human happiness and resource use .
As the healthcare sector makes up fully 17 % of the GDP of the USA and therefore represents a significant fraction of our resource throughput , this is a very important topic in discussions of more sustainable systems .
If medical care is as inefficient as Rock climber thinks , healthcare policies focusing on basics might save considerable energy and other resources .
Abstract
I ’ve been working on problems completely removed from Peak Oil , but the ignorance of big problems and the solutions turned out much the same .
“ Medical Dark Matter ” is my metaphor for ignoring the causes of our relatively poor health .
Astronomers looked right past most of reality ( 96 % invisible “ dark matter ” ) until recently .
Doctors looked only inside the body and thereby missed about 85 % of what really makes people sick or healthy .
Although doctors can save some sick people , they have no power to make most people live longer .
Despite over $ 2 trillion a year of modern medical care , US life expectancy has dropped to 50th in the world ( CIA 2009 ) behind all of Europe and behind some very poor countries .
It seems to me that societal factors account for about 85 % of differences in life expectancy , with genetics and individual health care accounting for the remainder .
Social factors - differences in our artificially created everyday living conditions - are the real keys to human health .
Health is improved by money , social status , healthy early childhood , education and a good job .
Poverty and lack of control hurt health .
Chronic stress boosts hormones that may harm health .
Health choices ( diet , exercise , and smoking ) are shaped by the neighborhoods we live in , which are influenced by powerful business interests .
Income equality is an interesting and controversial factor influencing health .
The health of the wealthy may depend in part on the well being of the rest of society .
Money buys health for individual rich Americans , but has failed to make average Americans healthier .
What we decide about healthcare reform will have no effect on US life expectancy , since doctors have so little influence on health .
Our American lifestyle takes years off our lives and cannot be sustained indefinitely by available energy resources .
IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER : POPULATION HEALTH IS not individual health I practice conventional medicine ; you should keep seeing your doctor .
Introduction : Biology does n’t determine health
I am an internal medicine doctor and on really good days I save someone ’s life .
But in the past 20 years I discovered two facts :
1 . On the whole medical care has little effect on average lifespan .
2. Social factors can produce 5 year differences in life expectancy .
At first I thought this had nothing to do with Peak Oil .
But I realize the different questions have much the same answers .
Unless we realign our lives toward healthy sustainability we ’ll continue to wreck both our health and the planet .
Individuals and societies are largely blind to both our unhealthy lives and our dangerous oil dependence for much the same reasons .
We think the status quo is fine and industry “ experts ” are happy to tell us to keep giving medical and oil corporations trillions of dollars .
Like everything else in our artificial modern world , healthcare and energy problems are really economic and social policy issues .
Science is the most powerful way to look at the world .
But science once missed the biggest part of reality .
In grade school we learned everything in the universe is made of atoms .
But in the 20th century astronomers discovered invisible , exotic ‘ dark matter ’ and ‘ dark energy ’ actually make up 96 % of the universe .
( At least science corrects itself ; “ experts ” may not . )
American medicine might be the best in the world .
We buy more drugs and spend far more money than anyone else .
Then why is our life expectancy ( according to CIA statistics ) 50th in the world , behind every other industrialized country and some poor ones ?
My paper is about life expectancy and population health .
Lifespan is more accurate to measure than how well you feel , and usually correlates well with general health .
Population studies allow us to figure out average effects ( but “ your mileage may vary ” ) .
Population statistics explain how I save lives at the hospital , and yet doctors ca n’t do much for our national health .
There are big differences between your individual health and national population health .
Consider smoking as an example .
If you are really lucky you can smoke cigarettes and still live to be 101 .
If you get unlucky you might drop dead from a heart attack at age 50 .
When we look at a large group of smokers , we find smoking takes 5 years ( 60 months ) of life away from the average individual pack a day smoker .
Consider a country where 10 % of people smoke a pack a day .
The national average effect of smoking would be 6 months ( 10 % of 5 years ) .
All these numbers describe smoking risks .
Our very best drugs reduce the fatal heart attack risk in very sick patients from about 6 % to 4 % over 5 years .
That ’s a relative 33 % less ( 4/6 ) or 2 % absolutely less ( 6 - 4 ) , or a 1 in 50 ( 100/2 % = 50 = number needed to treat to save one ) chance of being saved in 5 years , or up to 2 months average life extension .
All these different numbers are accepted estimates for our best cholesterol drugs .
Luckily , having a truly life threatening problem is very rare .
Most people see doctors for aches or colds , or a chronic problem like cholesterol .
Over half my 3000 HMO patients never saw me for years .
( Most healthcare is received by “ frequent fliers ” ) .
Since most people seldom see doctors , the number of lives saved by modern medicine turns out to be far lower than I ( and everyone else ) once assumed .
( Population health is not individual health !
If you die it ’s tragic , but just a 1 in 300 million statistical fluke ) .
Medical journals since the 1980 ’s show that social factors are the real keys to human health .
The Whitehall study of British civil servants reported doormen at the bottom died an average 7 ½ years earlier than the bosses at the top .
60 % of that gap persists when adjusted for “ medical factors ” : smoking , obesity , exercise , and blood pressure .
More studies followed with similar results .
Social factors produce big differences in life expectancy :
- 50 plus year gaps between some poor and rich nations
- 4 years gaps between US counties , 6 years between US states
- 7 ½ years span from the janitor to the top boss
- 6 year gap between high school dropouts and college educated
- 5 or 6 year differences between different developed nations
- 5 year gap from black race in US , or from male gender
- 5 years individual smoking status ; few months population average
Medical factors produce very small differences in lifespan :
- Up to 3 month average individual effect of our very best drugs
- few days or no average effect of common preventive healthcare
- I estimate less than 2 months average from all health care effects
The basic circumstances of daily life are the main causes of health and disease .
Is it so surprising people living in tin shack ghettos have different health than inhabitants of Hollywood mansions ?
Anthropologists know undisturbed hunter gatherers ( now extinct ) had lifespans in the 70’s .
We are genetically identical to our hunter gatherer ancestors , but our cultures ( the sum of all beliefs and material goods ) are very different .
Our genes confirm we are all the same inside but live very differently .
Social factors make up our everyday lives : food , shelter and the computer I sit at tonight ( and the open sewers of Monrovia ’s ghettos ) .
No research is published about how much total medical care affects our lives .
I estimate the effect is probably less than 2 months average .
If we had no advanced medical care we might live to an average of 78 years instead of 78.1 .
I estimate 45 % social factors ( money , education , work and geography ) , 40 % neighborhood shaped choices ( exercise , diet and smoking ) , 12 % ‘ fixed ’ biology ( gender and genetics ) , and no more than 3 % healthcare determine average health in rich countries .
Society , not biology , underlies 85 % of human health .
Healthcare may make a 2 month difference , while social factors make 5 year differences in lifespan .
Doctors looked only inside our bodies , when they could have looked outside .
“ Medical dark matter ” points out our blindness :
Only 4 % of the universe is made of visible atoms - DARK MATTER is 96 % of total reality
Healthcare determines about 3 % of longevity in rich countries - Social Factors ( MEDICAL DARK MATTER ) are 85 %
This is dark material .
Some doctors have trouble believing what we do is as powerless as I believe .
Medical journals present convincing evidence that our profession ignores .
It ’s hard to admit what we do does so little good .
But our tests and medicines might be undone if the patient is poor , stressed out at work , and has no chance to get fresh fruit or walk in fresh air .
After hard questioning , I have come to believe the scientific data presented here .
Dark Matter in the Universe : 96 % invisible , 4 % atoms NASA
Medical Dark Matter : 85 % social , 12 % biology , 3 % healthcare ( Author estimate )
Healthcare ’s 2 months is 3 % of the 5 year lifespan gaps from social causes in rich nations .
DISCLAIMER : This paper is not about the overall relative merits of American medicine or of American society .
Health is shaped mostly by other factors , irrespective of the inherent quality of medical care .
Social factors likely excuse our poor outcomes .
America leads the world in individual freedom and prosperity , which may trump years of lost life expectancy .
II .
Social Determinants of Health
1. Social Status : Money , Education , Work
- Money ( Poverty )
Simple income is the biggest determinant of average life expectancy .
Differences between poor and rich countries can be over 50 years and show the importance of basic living conditions to human health .
Health vs. Money is a ‘ Preston Curve ’ .
In 2009 there is a 52 year gap between Swaziland ( 31.9 years ) and Macau ( 84.4 years ) .
Poverty inside rich countries also harms health .
Average people in the worst US county ( a South Dakota Indian reservation ) die 16 years before those in the longest living county .
These maps show poor counties ( top ) are usually unhealthier ( bottom ) :
- Education
Graduating from college doubles income ( to $ 56,118 ) and adds 5.9 years to life compared to high school dropouts .
Educated people tend to have and make better choices in life .
School dropouts are prone to smoking , dead end jobs , and poor health .
Globally , educating girls may save the human race .
In the developing world , literate women choose to have far fewer children ( the demographic transition ) .
This should continue to slow down the growth of the human population so it does n’t ruin all planetary resources and wipe out our species in 40 years .
- Work
Workers at the bottom have less control and face more hazards , then get a smaller check , fewer benefits and die 7 years sooner .
Occupational Class differences in Life Expectancy , England and Wales 1997 - 1999 .
Whitehall results .
2. Socially Influenced Choices : Smoking , Exercise , Diet
- Recreational Drugs
Smoking is the number one easily preventable cause of death .
The poor , uneducated and mentally ill smoke and abuse drugs more .
( Rich people drink more alcohol , but more poor people become alcoholic ) .
Doctors ’ advice has not been proven to help .
Powerful , politically connected businesses heavily promote the use of recreational chemicals , legal and otherwise .
Preventable causes of death in US .
Data from McGinnis 1993
People with rich , fulfilling lives are probably less likely to abuse drugs , analogous to Alexander ’s 1970 ’s animal experiments .
A caged rat will repeatedly press a lever for a narcotic high until it starves to death .
But if you put a bunch of rats in a big room with interesting toys , they ’ll ignore an open bowl of sugar flavored morphine .
The # 1 prescribed drug in America is now the narcotic pain killer hydrocodone ( written 121 million times in 2008 ) .
Opiates are now the opiate of the masses .
Are our lives now like lone caged rats ?
- Exercise , Diet , Obesity
76 % of Americans are overweight or obese .
Obesity is painful ( arthritis ) and shortens life ( heart attacks , cancer , diabetes ) .
Obesity cost the US $ 147 billion in 2008 , and diabetes cost $ 174 billion .
As bad as it is , obesity is not the biggest cause of Americans dying too early .
Whitehall found job status was more important than obesity and other “ medical ” factors .
Greeks are the second most obese people , but eat healthy food ( the Mediterranean diet ) and live long lives .
These maps show how much fatter we ’ve become state by state in 24 years :
I worked in Africa with people who all wanted to be fat .
It looks “ rich and comfortable , ” but they ca n’t afford enough food .
When I explained that most Americans are fat but wish to be skinny , they asked if Americans have a lack of willpower .
It ’s not quite that simple .
Obesity is a social problem , and especially affects poor and minority people inside rich countries .
Powerful government subsidized industries including agribusiness ( cheap sugar ) and petroleum ( cheap gas , compared to elsewhere ) influence how easily people can find healthy food or walk in their neighborhoods .
See HJ Kunstler ’s ‘ Big and Blue in the USA ’ to laugh and cry .
3. Social / Gene Interaction : Racism , Gender
Gender and race are social definitions .
Gender is unique in the oppressed outliving the oppressor ( rarely biology trumps society ) .
Racism is one of our oldest and most emotional social problems .
200 years ago we brought one fifth of our ancestors here as slaves in chains .
We put them to work on a continent that was already inhabited .
African Americans and Native Americans still do n’t get their full shares of the American dream .
Race rarely affects health , but racism , poverty and living conditions do .
4. Place , Environment
Our neighborhoods combine other social factors with soil , air and water that might be clean or polluted .
10,000 years ago humans were hunter gatherers living in pristine woods .
Then we invented agriculture , towns and cities .
Modern poor places have far more physical ( lead , cockroaches ) and social cigarette billboards ) hazards .
“ Choosing ” a healthy life is hard if you live in a city of a million people with bad schools , no jobs ( auto industry imploded ) , and not a single chain supermarket in town since 2007 ( Detroit ) and all but impossible during two decades of civil war ( Liberia , where I worked in 2004 ) .

III .
Income Inequality
“ As I ’ve often said , this ( increasing income inequality ) is not the type of thing which a democratic society - a capitalist democratic society - can really accept without addressing ”
What flaming liberal is so worried about income inequality ?
- Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan , testifying before congress June 2005 .
Countries ( like Sweden ) and US states ( like Minnesota ) that more evenly divvy up the money tend to be much healthier .
Income inequality causes or correlates with many social evils :
Shorter life expectancy , high infant mortality , obesity , teen pregnancy , mental illness , imprisonment , crime , low educational scores and less social mobility are correlations noted in The Spirit Level published 2009 by Wilkinson and Pickett .
I note apparent correlations with military spending , pharmaceutical advertising and spending , rampant consumerism , corporate power , television watching , low voter turnout , absence of labor unions , automobile use , gun ownership , fast food , sedentary indoor lives , living alone , younger and more mixed populations , and non-denominational religion .
A mix of factors including inequality may make some populations dysfunctional .
Some societies will decide costs of inequality are worth the gains for those on top .
US inequality worsened in the past 30 years .
In 2008 the top 10 % of the US population got 48.5 % of total income , the top 1 % got 23 % , and just the top 1/100 of 1 % ( 14,988 families ) took 6 % of it all .
The authors of the following chart are liberal social scientists , but they might be right about income inequality .
I ’m uncertain .
Correlation does not equal causation , but there are plausible theories how position in social hierarchy could harm health .
The 1.4 billion people living on less than $ 1.25 daily have trouble getting water , food and shelter .
The poor in rich countries are “ only ” relatively poor .
Still the poor , minorities and low level workers have more stress and shorter lives .
Stress and feeling lack of control boost neuroendocrine hormones that could shorten life .
Sapolsky found wild baboons have graded social stress too .
Stress hormones ( epinephrine and cortisol ) levels fall and lifespans increase step wise up the social ladder to the alpha male , the CEO of baboons .
He ’s cool as a cucumber , bosses every one else around , and outlives everyone else by years .
Sapolsky found baboon neuroendocrine stress hormone levels vary dramatically with rank in the social hierarchy
IV .
The American Paradox : we spend so much for so little
The United States tries to have the best medical care in the world .
Yet , in 2009 American life expectancy dropped again to 50th in the world ( CIA ) .
We were just surpassed by Wallis and Fatuna ( a terribly poor South Pacific territory ) .
This happened before :
A fable of total 2006 healthcare spending ( public plus private ) :
- Cubans spent $ 363 per person average ( 7.1 % of GDP ) ; life expectancy was 76 years men and 80 years women .
- Americans spent $ 6714 per person ( 15.3 % of GDP back then ) ; life expectancy was 75 years men and 80 years women .
- statistics from the World Health Organization 2009 .
American healthcare costs $ 2.1 trillion and one year did not quite match the results of a tiny country that spent only 5 % as much per person .
This outdated fact is totally anecdotal and totally true .
Almost all other industrialized nations and some poor ones now outlive us .
Since rich populations generally do better , this is particularly puzzling .
Our lifespan has slowly increased to 78.1 years , but is about 3 or 4 years behind Sweden , Australia and Japan .
The social factors we ’ve been discussing plus the fact medical care does not prolong life much on average explains our relatively poor health outcomes .
It ’s not the fault of doctors .
American medical care saves some sick people ’s lives , but is just overwhelmed by the negative bigger effects of social problems .
The US is very rich , but near the bad end of many other social determinants including income inequality , education ( ours kids have lower scores ) , and jobs ( our workers work longer for less benefits ) .
American lifestyle takes years off our lives ( and can not be indefinitely sustained by available energy resources ) .
V. Conclusion : Healthcare average effects are minimal
Medical Dark Matter is summarized in an outlandish true claim :
Only 4 % of the universe is atoms , and healthcare causes only about 3 % of health variation - a 2 month difference
Money helps individual rich Americans live longer , but it has not helped our relatively poor national health .
We spend $ 7000 a year per person on healthcare and live no longer for it .
Our annual $ 2.1 trillion dollars is misdirected by believing health is determined inside our bodies .
Without modern doctors Americans would probably live to an average 78 years instead of 78.1 .
How long we live is instead determined by real living conditions : our schools , workplaces , neighborhoods and other social factors .
Disclaimer :
My remarks apply only to populations , not to individual health .
I share my findings only to help you think about choices our society will make about health and social policy ( with or without you ) .
VI . Consequences
Healthcare ’s impotence has consequences for doctors , society and individuals .
The bad health of Americans is n’t doctors ' fault .
It would be nice to focus on what works best , but retired major journal editors confirm published research has often been skewed by profit interests .
Basics like vaccines , sick care and trauma surgery might save more lives than giving more pills to diabetics , but who knows .
Good schools and workplaces , and neighborhoods that assist good choices will improve health far more than medical care .
It would be cheaper and more effective to treat many diseases as the social problems they really are .
Good societal living conditions are the ultimate preventive medicines .
Teach girls to read , thus saving the world .
Americans pay to cling to life ( average medicare cost $ 46,412 in the last six months ) , but we do n’t buy anything that might really make us live longer .
Why ?
The medical industry is 17 % of GDP and rising .
Doctors fail to do basic healthcare analysis and industry supported “ experts ” gladly fill the gap .
Turning over medical care over to corporate interests had the expected results .
Deciding whether we want longer lives or bigger profits could be a good start .
Unfortunately healthcare reform may happen without any examination of whether medical care works and what it costs .
As a privileged American , I enjoy freedom ( I can write this paper ) and money .
I think everyone should get affordable access to basic healthcare and we should also improve peoples living conditions .
Some reasonable people will decide we should continue to maximize individual freedom and material prosperity over other values .
The doctor has informed you of benefits and risks .
You can decide whether what we get ( more money overall ) is worth the price ( shorter average lives ) of American lifestyle and healthcare .
Whatever we decide about healthcare is not very important for lifespan , which is determined by socially created living conditions .
Do n’t worry ( stress is unhealthy ) .
Healthcare reform is an important political and economic issue , but it ca n’t much affect the health of Americans .
For individuals , the biggest health factor is luck .
In the ER I sometimes see a 95 year old man who has n’t seen any doctor in 30 years , still rides a horse and is healthier than all my other patients .
There are no guarantees , but living right ( good choices and good neighbors ) can improve your odds .
Being born to wealth and privilege helps .
Working hard for money and an elusive CEO job may be counterproductive .
Downsizing your life can be quite satisfying , healthy , and good for the planet .
Whether your neighborhood is favorable or not , make yourself exercise a lot ( outside if possible ) and eat healthy ( vegetables , grains , whole foods , not to excess ) .
Working and playing outside with friends deeply satisfies my own hunter gatherer genome .
Please do n’t just buy a bunch of guns and hole up .
I ’m planning on some of you smart TOD people to realign our world financial system so I ’ll still have a 401 K account in 20 years ( and so all the people in Asia do n’t live just like us and kill the planet ) .
Optimists take heart : the global human lifespan probably grew 35 years last century .
US life expectancy is also growing slowly , and in 20 years may be where Sweden ’s is today ( they hit 78 years in 1989 ) .
Healthcare does little , but global human living conditions ( outside Africa ) are improving rapidly , and world population growth is slowing .
I believe humans overall will do just fine .
Liberians lived on less than a dollar a day , but were happier than most Americans .
Some things could be more important than health or money .
Final Disclaimer : Population Health is not Individual Health .
Doctors save the lives of many people every day .
I practice conventional medicine ; keep seeing your doctor !
You can decide if America ’s social policies are worth the costs .

Despite having some of the most gorgeous weather conditions on the planet , it is the Australians who are on average the most time active social media users .
Performing a global comparison , a December study by Nielsen concluded that Australians on average spend 6 hours and 52 minutes per month on social media sites , ahead of the Americans who spend on average 6 hours and 9 minutes per month .
Average time spend ( h:m:s ) on social media each month :
Australia – 6:52:28
United States - 6:09:13
United Kingdom – 6:07:54
Italy – 6:00:07
Spain – 5:30:55
Brazil – 4:33:10
Germany – 4:11:45
France – 4:04:39
Switzerland – 3:54:34
Japan – 2:50:21
Figures just released for December 2009 show a worldwide annual increase of 82 percent in time spent on social networks , up to an average of 5.5 hours per individual per month .
Unsurprisingly , Social Media was closely followed by online gaming and instant messaging .
Despite the Global data , the research only takes into account the following countries : U.S. , U.K. , Australia , Brazil , Japan , Switzerland , Germany , France , Spain and Italy .
Countries such as India and China would clearly also show similarly high results .
Entrepreneur and strategy consultant Ross Dawson shares some wonderful insights into why Australia appears to be leading the pack after a rather slow introduction to social media .
I highly recommend you read his full post but in summary ; it ’s primarily a blend of cultural and corporate attitude change , as well as the enormous population of Australians living abroad and therefore more inclined to use the tools available to stay in touch with friends and family .

Når man har gjeld som for eksempel et forbrukslån eller kredittkort , kan man refinansiere og betale ut noe av eller hele denne gjelden .
Dette kan man søke om lån til hos for eksempel expressbank .
Her kan man søke om å refinansiere lån og betale ut gammel gjeld dersom man ønsker dette .
Man kan også ta opp lån til ulike former for forbruk .
Rett som det er kan det komme uforutsette utgifter som man ikke hadde regnet med .
Disse har gjerne en tendens til å komme når det er lenge til lønnen kommer , eller det kan være snakk om et høyere beløp enn man klarer å cashe ut der og da .
I slike tilfeller kan refinansiering være et alternativ .
Man kan på denne måten løse denne situasjonen midlertidig .
Å ha en medsøker
Av og til kan det være ulike grunner til at man ikke får et lån alene .
Det kan også være at man er to stykker som skal gjøre noe sammen , og ønsker å dele på utgiftene .
Da kan det være greit å vite at man kan søke om refinansiering sammen .
Hos for eksempel Nordea stiller man sterkere dersom man har en medsøker .
Når man er to som søker sammen , har man større sjanse for å få lån med en bedre rente i følge refinansiere .
net .
Dette gjelder særlig dersom den ene har betalingsanmerkninger , eller har for lav inntekt i forhold til det beløpet man ønsker å søke om .
Når man er to som søker sammen , legges inntektene sammen og man kan søke om et betydelig høyere beløp enn om man søker om lån alene .
Kriterier
Når man skal søke om refinansiering sammen med en medsøker , stilles det noen krav fra banken .
Aller helst bør ingen av søkerne ha betalingsanmerkninger , men hos noen holder det at den ene ikke har det .
Det kreves at begge søkerne er over 18 år , at begge har fast inntekt og er norske statsborgere .
Noen banker krever sikkerhet , men slett ikke alle ber om dette .
De forskjellige låneaktørene stiller forskjellige krav til søkerne , selv om det er noen ting som går igjen .
Hos mange av bankene får man lån på dagen , dette har blitt mer og mer vanlig nå .
Man kan også legge inn en søknad til noen som sender søknaden til flere forskjellige banker .
De som anser søkeren eller søkerne som aktuelle kunder , tar direkte kontakt når de har vurdert søknaden .
Fordeler med å være to
Når man er to som søker om lån til refinansiering , har man økt sjanse for å få lån .
Dette er både på grunn av at man til sammen har høyere inntekt , og at banken har en sikkerhet i at man er to som er med på å betale tilbake gjelden .
Man kan også få høyere lån når man er to som søker sammen .
Når man søker sammen med en annen person , kan man ofte velge hvordan man vil fordele lånet .
Om den ene står som hovedsøker og den andre som sikkerhet , betales lånet ut til den som er hovedsøker .
Den andre personen fungerer i slike tilfeller som en ekstra sikkerhet for at banken skal være tryggest mulig på å få tilbake pengene de har lånt ut .
Ulemper
Når man tar opp lån sammen med en medsøker , kan man risikere at man blir sittende igjen med for mye gjeld alene .
Dette kan skje dersom man for eksempel er to som har en viss inntekt til sammen når man søker , får et høyere lån enn den ene ville ha fått alene .
Dersom medsøkeren plutselig får redusert eller mister inntekten sin , kan hovedsøker få et problem med tilbakebetaling .
Det er viktig at man er åpne med hverandre om økonomien sin og hvilke forutsetninger man har til å ta seg av et lån i fremtiden .
Man må være sikker på at begge vil klare å betale tilbake sin del av lånet , dersom det er meningen at begge skal betale på det .
Det er viktig at man har forutsigbarhet i økonomien , dette gjelder begge søkerne uansett .
Kort oppsummert , fordeler og ulemper
Man har større sjanse for å få lån og man kan få høyere lån
Den ene kan bli skadelidende dersom den andre ikke overholder sine forpliktelser
Det kan absolutt lønne seg å ha en medsøker når man skal refinansiere .
I tillegg til at man stiller sterkere til å få lån , kan man søke om høyere summer enn om man søker alene .
Man har også en viss sikkerhet i at den ene kan hjelpe til med lånet dersom man kommer i en situasjon hvor man får problemer med å betale .
With pundits already calling the 2010s the " Tea Party Decade , " and an inaugural national symposium in Texas scheduled for later this month , it is becoming clear the Tea Party is set to play a crucial role on the political stage for the foreseeable future .
( Watch Ron Paul discuss the Tea Party movement on CNN . )
But one thing that is n't clear is who exactly will emerge as the leader of this diverse network of disaffected voters .
Here is a guide to some frontrunners in the race to head up the movement :

The former Alaska governor shot to fame after being selected as Sen. John McCain 's running mate in the 2008 election — and now seems to be considering a run for president in 2012 .
Why ?
Palin is " the reigning queen of the disenfranchised , " says Mark McKinnon in the Daily Beast .
As the " keynote speaker " of the Tea Party symposium in San Antonio on January 24 , she will surely " generate " some " press " — and , perhaps , momentum for a future campaign ?
Why Not ?
She may be the Tea Partiers ' " kinsman , " writes Charles Cooper at CBS News , but " at this point , they need her more than she needs them . "
If she 's serious about running in 2012 , she needs to look beyond the " minority " represented by the fringe .
GLENN BECK
Who ?
One of Fox News ' highest - rated commentators , known for his conservative - leaning daily TV show .
Why ?
Without the profile given to them by Beck 's TV show , the Tea Partiers would n't exist , says Donald Hank at Renew America .
Beck has " changed the nation " with his broadcasting , and could do so again with his Tea Party leadership .
Why Not ?
Does the Tea Party really want a leader famous for " near lunatic rants and tearful outbursts ? , " asks Fernando Rendon at Florida Today .
He may have " quite a following , " but making him leader would do little for the respectability of the movement .
MICHELE BACHMANN
Who ?
An outspoken GOP congresswoman from Minnesota .
Why ?
Bachmann is one of the " few elected officials " to become a " tea party confidant , " says Kathleen Hennessy at the LA Times , and that " puts her in a position of rising influence . "
( Last fall , for instance , she organised her own Tea Party - esque rally at the U.S. Capitol . )
Why Not ? Bachmann 's call to voters in her district to " defy the Census " could cost her her job — and her political influence — if Minnesota winds up losing a congressional seat because of uncounted voters , says Eric Kleefeld in Talking Points Memo .
LOU DOBBS
Who ?
Former CNN commentator .
Why ?
He has crafted an identity for himself as a " star - spangled superhero , dazzling enemies with his ferocious smile as he restores truth , justice and the American Way , " says Joe Conason at Salon .
That image has always seemed more appropriate for a political candidate than a news anchor .
Why not ?
" I do n't think he has the fan base or , more important , the broader charisma , to make any kind of serious run " as a Tea Party presidential candidate , says James Poniewozik at Time .
MARCO RUBIO
Who ?
The 38 - year - old former speaker of the Florida House is challenging Florida governor Charlie Crist from the right for an open seat in the U.S. Senate .
Why ?
Rubio is an " inspiring leader for the next generation of the conservative movement , " says former GOP house majority leader Dick Armey , quoted in the Washington Independent .
His willingness to challenge the political establishment has energized Tea Partiers .
Why Not? Rubio may be the Tea Party 's " golden boy " now , says Thomas Francis in the Broward Palm Beach New Times , but his " appeal to the old - fashioned Republican set " seems more " convincing " — and this fact will eventually alienate the " temperamental " Tea Partiers .
GARY JOHNSON
Who ?
Republican governor of New Mexico 1995 - 2003 , a construction magnate and Iron Man triathlete .
Why ?
Johnson is a " natural fit " for the movement , says DaveG at Race42012.com .
As a fiscal conservative who is attractive to liberals , he 's a " more mainstream version of Ron Paul . "
Why Not ?
A a supporter of legalizing marijuana , Johnson is an avowed libertarian , according to Paul Wachter at Sphere.com .
Like Ron Paul , he 'd certainly generate " online buzz " — but " not very many votes . "
JIM DeMINT
Who ?
Last year , the Republican junior Senator for South Carolina has been ranked by the National Journal as the most conservative member of the Senate .
Why ?
DeMint is a " scourge for Democrats and some Republicans alike , " says Manu Raju and Josh Kraushaar in Politico .
Accordingly , the Tea Party movement " treats him like a rock star . "
Why Not ? DeMint may be making a " noise " promoting conservative ideals , says Jessica Taylor , also in Politico , but it is unclear whether this is impressing voters in South Carolina .
In a recent poll , only " 29 percent " said his first priority was " advocating " for the state .
DeMint " has his own reelection contest in 2010 , " and for the time being he 'll need to concentrate on that .
OTHERS :
Rep. Joe Wilson ( R - SC ) became a hero to Tea Partiers across the country when he shouted " You Lie ! " during Obama 's speech to Congress last September .
Gov. Rick Perry ( R - TX ) delighted many in the grassroots movement by suggesting that perhaps Texas should " secede " from the United States .
Like Wilson , he has spoken at Tea Party rallies .
Former Rep. Dick Army , who as president of FreedomWorks — a conservative political action committee ( PAC ) — has played a key role in the growth of the Tea Party phenomenon .

State lawmakers hunting for revenue are eyeing one source that could prove costly to millions of California consumers : Amazon .com .
The online retail giant has enjoyed an edge over many competitors in the state because it is not required to collect sales tax from residents who buy books , top - of - the - line plasma televisions , cases of diapers and thousands of other products from its website .
The Seattle corporation has no store , warehouse , office building or other physical presence in California , and the state cannot tax such businesses under a 1992 Supreme Court decision .
Consumers here are required to pay sales tax on the goods they purchase at Amazon but almost never do , because the state has no mechanism for tracking Amazon purchases and collecting the money .
Now California is one of several cash - strapped states exploring a novel legal strategy that could force Amazon and others like it , including Overstock.com , to start collecting tax from their customers .
New York launched the effort with a law that took effect in 2008 .
North Carolina and Rhode Island have passed similar laws ; other proposals have advanced in the statehouses of Virginia , Illinois , Colorado and Hawaii .
The Democrats who control California ’s Legislature plan to put their own bid on the governor ’s desk this month in hopes of reaping up to $ 150 million annually for state and local coffers .
The revenue would make only a tiny dent in the state ’s $ 20 - billion deficit , but supporters say every dollar counts in tight times , and there ’s a principle at stake .
Amazon has “ built an entire business model based on tax avoidance , ” said Assembly tax committee Chairman Charles Calderon ( D - Montebello ) .
The state Senate approved the legislation Thursday as part of a deficit - reduction package , and it is expected to pass the Assembly as well .
Officials at Amazon , which is fighting the New York law in court , did not respond to requests for comment .
But Jonathan Johnson , president of Overstock .com , called the California proposal illegal and predicted it would not harness any new taxes .
“ We collect and pay taxes where we have a real presence , ” he said .
“ We do n’t have a presence in California . ”
The California proposal seizes on the thousands of online sales affiliates that Amazon contracts with to get customers to its site .
Those companies advertise Amazon products , provide links to the company ’s website and get a percentage of the resulting sales .
Many of the affiliates are in California .
Supporters of the Democrats ’ bill , ABX8 8 , say that the connections amount to a presence for Amazon as well and that California should be able to force the firm to collect sales tax .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar effort last year after Overstock .com announced it would cancel all its contracts with affiliates in California .
Overstock backed down after the governor ’s veto , but Johnson renewed his vow to cancel the contracts if the new measure becomes law .
Amazon has also said it would cancel its California contracts .
Both companies have carried through with the threat in states that have imposed the sales tax requirement .
Such tactics should not drive lawmaking decisions , said Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Denise Moreno Ducheny ( D - San Diego ) : “ California is big enough that we should not submit to that kind of blackmail . ”
Beyond the $ 150 million in annual revenue that tax officials believe could be collected from Amazon and other companies , there is a bigger bounty to be had .
The proposals under consideration in California and other states are pushing some online companies , including Amazon , to come up with an alternative .
Some have signed on to federal efforts to create a uniform system for online sales taxation in all 50 states .
With such a system in place , California could theoretically force every online retailer that sells to a state resident to collect sales tax , potentially garnering billions of dollars in new revenue .
But skeptics say that online companies ’ support for such a system is merely a way to buy time , because it is years from becoming reality .
And a letter Amazon sent Schwarzenegger and lawmakers in June warned that a law to force tax collections would cost Californians jobs .
“ If this new tax collection scheme were enacted , Amazon would have little choice but to end its advertising relationships with California - based participants , ” the letter said .
The company also asserted that such a law would be unconstitutional .
Several tech companies and business organizations , including Google , EBay , Yahoo and the California Chamber of Commerce , have joined the fight against the idea .
Some are concerned that their affiliate arrangements could be affected .
In a letter to lawmakers last year , the companies said the proposal “ could impede numerous ways that California companies currently survive or earn money . ”
California Internet giant Netflix , however , has joined independent booksellers , local governments and unions in championing the bill .
Schwarzenegger spokesman Aaron McLear said “ it would be a tough sell ” for the governor to support the bill after vetoing one like it last year .
Proponents are nonetheless aware that Schwarzenegger will be gone at the end of the year and that if a Democrat succeeds him , an “ Amazon bill ” will probably be signed .

OXFORD , Miss . --
A University of Mississippi football player has died after collapsing during the first day of team workouts .
The university says 20 - year - old Bennie F. Abram died Friday at a hospital in Oxford .
The non-scholarship junior transferred from Itawamba Community College last fall .
Trainers noticed that Abram was having difficulty early Friday shortly after the workout started .
Officials say the trainers began first aid and called 911 .
Abram died several hours later .
Lafayette County Coroner Rocky Kennedy says an autopsy will be performed Saturday .
He says there 's no foul play involved .
The high temperature in Oxford reached 57 degrees Friday .
Coach Houston Nutt called Abram a hard worker and fine young man .
Greetings everybody , I hope I find you well .
First , an explanation !
With regards to where I have been , specifically - as some of you may know already from my Twitter feed ( if you do not follow me at the moment I encourage you to do so ) my partner and I have been travelling around visiting family and friends and telling them the good news of our pregnancy .
My partner in particular has many siblings spread throughout the country and as such we have stayed in a variety of places over the last few weeks .
The news has been well - received and we have been warmly congratulated , much to our delight .
Secondly , an update on my partner 's progress - she is currently doing very well .
She is full of life and vigor , and the various medical appointments have also gone smoothly .
I will keep you all posted as everything develops .
Now , to the community ; I would like to say a few things .
My fine moderators have been wonderful stewards of the community during my absence ; in this I must thank them and express my gratitude .
I would like to extend a warm welcome to the new members of the community , also , and say a big " hello , I see you " to all the various sites - blogs , journals , forums , podcasts , YouTube videos - who have been discussing and documenting our community and what goes on here .
Also , I would like to emphasize that posts to the community are still being moderated , and will continue to be moderated for the foreseeable future ; we are a community that emphasizes tolerance and stresses acceptance and equality ; as such we will not permit any facism or racism to be rained upon our members .
Rules and an FAQ have still to be drawn up and posted at a later date , if you have any ideas for these or would like to see anything in specific , feel free to mention your opinions in the comments section .
We appreciate constructive feedback .
On to the subject of today - today , we have a discussion prompt for you .
Today 's entry discusses the subject of Na'vinity .
Na'vini'ty is a new term , coined by I , Shey 'bu - what it is is a word that is not easy to define , indeed it is almost indefinable in that it is a word that means many things and describes an abstract concept and a feeling personal to the individual .
The way Na'vinity is experienced differs inherently from individual to individual .
It is a state of being , something understood in a fluid way and retained in the mind .
For simplicity 's sake and ease of discussion , I have decided to provide a working definition for this term .
Na'vinity [ noun ] :
Na 'vi identity in human form ; the expression of said identity ;
the experience of being Na'vi and all that it entails ; an abstract concept referring to the state of existence of being Na'vi ;
a state of being ; that which refers to being a Na'vi in mind and soul .
synonyms : divinity , identity
As I have said , Na'vinity is not a term or a concept which may be summed up in such a short paragraph .
However , I have provided this definition for practical working purposes .
I hope that it does not diminish the status of Na'vinity in your minds and would urge you to recall the primary synonym .
Here at this point I would like to emphasize that I am the creator of this term and that it is copyright to me - any uses of it you may find via search engines such as " Google " are illicit and unjust .
What does your Na'vinity mean to you ?
How would you define it ?
How does it relate to your experiences ?
What are the primary ways through which you express your Na'vinity ?
Discuss .

Sri Lanka 's tortured politics shifted into a new and murky phase after the re-election of the country 's president , Mahinda Rajapaksa , in January .
Rajapaksa soundly defeated retired Gen. Sarath Fonseka , the battlefield commander who helped destroy the Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam last year , ending Sri Lanka 's 26 - year civil war .
The election was a bitter contest between the two former allies and when Fonseka threatened to challenge the results in court — he said there was widespread vote rigging — the government had him arrested for plotting a coup .
Supporters of former army commander Gen. Sarath Fonseka chant behind a police line during a protest in the Colombo suburb , Maharagama , on February 11 , 2010 , the second day of street protests .
( Andrew Caballer0 - Reynolds / Reuters )
The arrest prompted demonstrations by Fonseka 's opposition supporters , and the country 's top Buddhist monks , who supported the war against the LTTE , urged Rajapaksa to release Fonseka from jail .
Meanwhile , the country 's top court has agreed to hear a petition seeking Fonseka 's release and the political powers are gearing up for April 's general elections , when Rajapaksa hopes to further strengthen his grip on power .
What about the Tamils ?
This latest power struggle , which is taking place mostly in the capital , Colombo , is overshadowing the very real problems that linger for Tamils , Muslims and indigenous people who are trying to remake their lives following the civil war that ended in May 2009 .
Freed from war , but still living in a fractured war zone , they all face a future filled with uncertain prospects .
The lack of homes , jobs and schools dominate their concerns .
But unexploded land mines remain a serious menace as well .
Less visible but no less important is the trauma from the loss of family and friends during the more than two decades of violence at the hands of the government in Colombo and the Tamil Tigers themselves .
Supporters of jailed army commander Sarath Fonseka and supporters of President Mahinda Rajapaksa throw rocks at each other during street demonstrations following the general 's arrest in February 2010 .

The UN estimates 7,000 civilians were killed in the closing months of the war alone and many Tamils do n't know the whereabouts of family members , having been forced to live these last months in wretched government - run camps on very modest rations .
The Rajapaksa government has rejected international accusations that this amounts to human rights abuse .
But the European Union is not convinced and last week brought trade sanctions against Sri Lanka to try to force it to do better .
Turn the page
For his part , President Rajapaksa says it 's time to turn the page .
Sri Lanka President Mahinda Rajapaksa won re-election in January by almost two million votes but the opposition is not melting away .
( Reuters )
" We will ensure equality and equity among all the ethnicities , " he said in Tamil shortly after his re-election , called after a surge of post - war support among the majority Sinhalese .
Economic development and integration of the formerly Tiger - held areas in the North and East , which the Tamils claim as a homeland , are Rajapaksa 's priorities .
But he indicated there will be no self - rule for Tamils .
By the end of the war , almost 300,000 Tamils were being held in internment camps but about 180,000 were freed in time for the presidential election .
Many drifted to their ancestral homes with government rations of about $ 250 , some dry food and a bunch of tin sheets to build temporary shelters .
Those who arrived home , where much of the recent the fighting was , found land that is so overgrown they say it may take months to clear it .
More than 100,000 Tamils remain in camps in Vavuniya because land mines need to be cleared near their old homes .
Some detainees are allowed to move about only if they have government passes .
Tigers
Another dark corner involves 12,000 or so suspected members of the rebel Tamil Tigers , one of the world 's more violent secessionist groups , who are being held by government soldiers at an isolated camp .
Although some have been released back to their families after a period of re-education , the government has refused to allow independent observers to visit the prison camps or even find out their names .
" Everything is devastated , " says Ahilan Kadirgamar , an activist with the Sri Lanka Democracy Forum , who returned to New York from a visit to the country in January .
" Schools , hospitals , everything . "
Sri Lanka 's losing presidential candidate , former Gen. Sarath Fonseka , the man who defeated the Tamils , says the vote was rigged .
He is shown here in early February 2010 , just days before his arrest .
( Dinuka Liyanawatte / Reuters )
He says resettlement is the most important issue at the moment .
" The government has been talking about reconstruction and development but so far , on the ground , there has n't been enough . "
When the government ran out of metal sheets to give returning refugees , the Chinese government stepped in and provided tents .
Kadirgamar says Tamils are freer now to move about and that the A - 9 , the only highway that connects Colombo to the northernmost Jaffna peninsula , is now completely passable after being part of the front line in the war .
The minister in charge of resettlement , Rizath Bathiyutheen , defends his work , saying no other country could have resettled that many people so quickly .
But while the government has provided some aid , it appears to be working around , rather than with , the Tamils .
And international agencies say there has been little consultation with the displaced civilians , a group that includes an estimated 80,000 Muslims who were expelled from the North by the Tigers and who are experiencing similar problems for their return .
Picking up the pieces
The long civil war had its roots in Tamil grievances that they were systematically discriminated against by the Sinhalese and Buddhist majority .
But it soon evolved into an especially violent conflict with international overtones .
The rebel group Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam ( LTTE ) is often said to have pioneered the use of child soldiers and suicide vests .
It routinely attacked civilian targets and assassinated high - profile politicians , including former Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 .
To this , the Sri Lankan government responded in kind to the point that anyone critical of the government risks being harassed or imprisoned .
The government has used its emergency measures laws to detain thousands of people .
Journalists also accuse the government of complicity in the disappearances and murders of reporters who have been critical of the war or written about government corruption .
Lasantha Wickrematunge , the outspoken managing editor of the Sunday Leader , was murdered in January , 2009 , claiming in an editorial , published after his death : " When I am finally killed , it will be the government that kills me . "
Even after the January election , journalists complained of continuing harassment and intimidation .
" I would imagine if he ( Rajapaksa ) is going to take legitimate measures to unite the country , he has to repeal draconian pieces of legislation , " says Sujith Xavier , a Tamil who studies international law in Toronto .
But Xavier , for one , believes the level of mistrust between Tamils and Sinhalese is too high at this point for much reconciliation .
Still , the crushing of the Tigers opens a path that had been closed , one where civil society and more democratic Tamil leaders may emerge to find common ground .
A vision for how that will work is still unclear .
Tamils are still , literally , picking up the pieces .
My pitch at the SXSW panel was this .
In creating a start - up , you ’re going to be faced with a thousand seemingly inconsequential decisions .
Tucked amongst those thousands of decisions are five decisions that actually matter .
These decisions will change the face of your company .
What I did n’t say was that I believe it ’s next to impossible to figure out which decisions matter and which ones do not .
How depressing .
Here ’s the deal , you can spend a lot of energy deciding what the big decisions might be , but that ’s much less important than making the decision … educated guess or gut instinct .
There ’s a pile of thoughts on creating decision friendly environments in the Taking Time to Think piece , but that article focuses on the idea of thinking in a team scenario and I want to talk about when you choose to take your thinking solo .
Let ’s start with the most infuriating email you ’ve ever received .
I ’m not talking about that jerk in Tech Support who is simply stupid , I ’m talking about the email from someone you trust … a peer … pissing you off in email .
You ’re going to want to react to this email in the same manner as if I came into your office and punched you in the face .
It ’s your animal brain at work and it served you well when you were living in a cave doing the hunter - gathering thing because reacting slowly meant you were eaten or punched again .
Now .
You have time to soak .
The soak is when you plant the seed of a thought in your brain and let it bump around in a rich stew of ideas , facts , and whatever other random crap that seems to relate .
The soak is a protected activity that will rarely occur during your busy day because you ’re busy reacting to the familiar never - ending flood of things to do .
The goal of the soak is simple : an original thought .
Whatever the problem is your stewing on , you want to find an glimmer of inspiration which transforms your response from a predictable emotional flame - o - gram into a strategic considered thought .
Emotion and Ignorance
At a prior gig , I was finally hitting my stride .
After a two year awkward getting - to - know the company phase , I was in the groove .
I knew who was doing what , who was hungry , and who was coasting .
I ’d turned a small bright idea of a product into a successful money maker , so my boss decided to saddle me with something completely different .
An entirely new product built on technology I ’d never used .
It was a strategic - shift product for the company which meant everyone would be watching .
This visibility would amplify potential fuck - ups .
This was the career defining product for me .
Holy shit .
Having no clue where to start on a new project and want to rip someone apart in email share one important characteristic .
The best move in both cases is to start with a good long soak .
I break soaking activities into two buckets : Active Soaks and Passive Soaks .
The Active Soaks are activities that you can direct and usually involve gathering content where as Passive Soaks are activities when you just point your brain in a random direction and pray .
Passive Soaks are were the real work gets done .
Let ’s start with the first :
Active Soaking
Ask dumb questions .
Your first job when faced with ignorance is information acquisition and , hopefully , there are folks out there who ’ve already done some soaking .
These folks have some facts , ideas , and opinions regarding whatever the problem might be and you need to hear them all .
The first five of these conversations can be awkward for managers because it ’ll be obvious after your first two questions ( “ What is it ? ” , “ How does it work ? ” ) that you have absolutely no clue what ’s going on and a manager ’s job is be clueful .
Suck it up , pal .
Soaking starts out uncomfortable , but with each ignorant question you ask , you ’re adding content to that managerial brain of yours .
Ever sat in a meeting with your VP where they were presenting product strategy ?
Ever sat there , unblinking , shocked and thinking , “ This guy , our leader , has absolutely no clue what doing ” ?
That ’s you in ten years when you ’ve a modicum of success and decided that success is a result of your MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY policy .
Asking dumb questions is the best way to start figuring out what is actually going on .
Furthermore , asking any question of your team is a handy way to indirectly say , “ I care about what we ’re doing enough to ask you what you think . ”
Pitch a stranger .
Once you ’ve asked enough dumb questions , a picture will start to form in your mind about what exactly you ’re doing .
It ’s a not a complete picture , it ’s more a rough sketch coupled with the mild relief that accompanies the sudden absence of ignorance .
Now you ’ve got to test your understanding with a qualified someone who is willing to listen to you ramble .
Pitch this person on your picture and see what happens .
Lots of nodding ?
Great , it ’s coming together .
Blank stare ?
Ooops , time for more dumb questions starting with the person you just pitched .
What I find when I pitch a stranger is that the words coming out of my mouth have very little to do with the picture that ’s in my head .
The act of linearly mapping my thoughts into words and sentences exposes flaws or gaps in my thinking that I never find when the ideas are swirling around my head .
This leads me to our next step .
Write it down , throw it away , write it down again .
Once your stranger is no longer totally confused by your idea , it ’s time to write it down .
This is the same process as pitching the stranger in that you ’re find another medium to capture your idea .
Like the pitch , seeing the words on a piece of paper or flat panel monitor will , once again , expose gaps you ca n’t see in the picture in your mind .
Those gaps prove you ’ve got more dumb questions , so go ask them , write it down again , and then throw it away .
That ’s right , do n’t just close the document window , you need to get rid of everything you just wrote down .
Toss it , empty the trash , and step away from the computer .
I know you ’re attached to some part of that document that you wrote .
Some witty thought that elegantly captured an angle on your problem , but remember what we ’re trying to solve here .
This is n’t whether or not you should get a blueberry - orange muffin on the way to work , this a decision that matters and solving it elegantly means you want to visit and revisit your response as many times as possible .
Consigning your first written draft to the ether might forever lose a piece of wit , but if that wit shows up in the second draft , I guarantee that it belongs there and you ’ll never lose it again .
Passive Soaking
Once you ’ve done all your active content acquisition , once you ’ve pitched some strangers , once you ’ve you ’ve written it down a few times , you need to stop actively working on the problem .
Remove that sticky from your screen , hide those second drafts on your desktop , and just stop working on it .
Yes , you need to make a decision , you need to respond to whatever the problem is , and while I am saying you should remove all the physical artifacts of your active soak , you ’re not going to stop .
You can ’t .
Your brain wo n’t let you .
Back to the original flame mail from your friend .
You ’ve received these before and you know the absolute wrong thing to do is immediately respond .
Of course , your animal brain is dying to do so because IT FEELS SO GOOD TO PUNCH BACK , but it ’s never the right move because your animal brain is defending itself , it ’s not resolving anything other than proving BOY CAN I PUNCH BACK OR WHAT ?
My advice regarding flame - o - grams and hard decisions is the same .
Sleep on it .
A night ’s rest is one best ways to calm and alter your perspective on a problem .
Ever gone to bed at night when the sky is falling and awoken to a blissfully simple way to easily prop the sky up ?
How ’d that happen ?
The answer is , your brain never stops working .
Better yet , it has the unique ability to subconsciously construct elegant solutions to hard problems when you least expect it .
Call it inspiration , call it intuition , but do n’t stare at it too long because it ’s a shy ability .
It does it ’s best work when no one knows it ’s there .
Soaking Takes Time
Do n’t tell anyone I work with , but I earn a majority of my pay during the forty minute drive to work in the morning .
I get in the car with my cup of coffee , hit the road , and let my mind wander to whatever music is playing .
Never do I think , “ Ok , Phil flamed me pretty hard yesterday … how am I going to deal with this ? ”
My mind stumbles , it strikes out in random directions , and I never know where it ’ll end up .
Still , if I ’ve spent time actively soaking on the Phil problem the day before , my wandering often ends up somewhere Phil - like and , sometimes , the mental journey reveals a nugget of inspiration .
As practical advice goes , the soak is pretty thin .
If your boss is waiting for you to weigh in on a critical decision I am not advising you to say , “ I have no clue what to do , I ’m going to go ask dumb questions , pitch a stranger , write it down and then throw it away , and then forget everything I did ” .
What I am saying is that any big decision , any big problem deserves time and consideration .
If you ’ve got years of experience under your belt , you can probably wing it pretty well , but you ’re still going to be faced with situations where the right decision is to not decide , but think .
The soak is , hands down , the favorite part of my job .
What I ’m doing when I ’m soaking on something is an act of creation .
It ’s design work .
It ’s strategy .
It ’s removing the emotion and ignorance from a problem and then constructing an original solution that shows those I work with that I ’m actively caring about what I do .
