Please see my earlier posts on New Home sales too : July New Home Sales and More on July New Home Sales .
The Census Bureau revises the New Home sales number three times ( plus annual revisions ) .
During a housing down turn , most of the revisions from the Census Bureau are down .
This is important to keep in mind when looking at a new monthly report .

This chart shows the cumulative revisions for each month since sales activity peaked in July 2005 ( annual revisions are not shown ) .
The last time there was a positive cumulative revision ( red column ) was in September 2005 .
The median change for the first revision is a decline of 1.6 % ( average decline of 1.8 % ) over the last two years .
The cumulative median change for the second revision is a decline of 3.6 % .
The cumulative median change for the third revision is a decline of 4.8 % .
Since the last upward cumulative revision ( Sept 2005 ) , the range has been from a small decline of 0.2 % in Dec ' 05 , to a decline of almost 11 % for May '06 .
The new homes sales number today will probably be revised down too .
Applying the median cumulative revision ( 4.8 % ) suggests a final revised Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate ( SAAR ) sales number of 828 thousand for July ( was reported as 870 thousand SAAR by the Census Bureau ) .
Just something to remember when looking at the data .

You ’re losing money right now .
This very minute .
You ’re losing money if you own an apartment .
You ’re losing money if you own a country home .
You ’re losing money if you own a stock or bond mutual fund .
You ’re losing money if you have a pension plan .
You ’re probably losing money here or there , you ’re probably losing money everywhere ( except maybe from your savings account and wallet ) .
But this is no Dr. Seuss story .
It ’s more of a John Steinbeck tale , and we are the victims , a new generation of Tom Joads , and it ’s the damn bankermen who broke us .
No , there wo n’t be a police officer to investigate , and the government , at least this federal government , wo n’t save us .
Our tale of woe starts not in New York but in flashy places like Las Vegas and South Beach and faraway onetime Okie haunts like Riverside , San Bernardino , and Ontario , California .
In these towns , and dozens more like them , housing companies erected colossal communities of homes .
Eager homebuyers and speculators fought each other for these properties , armed with cheap financing , courtesy of Alan Greenspan , who wanted to boost an economy reeling from 9/11 and create a legacy of homeownership for all , including those who could not document steady income or , for that matter , citizenship .
We think of him as Saint Alan now , but in a few years he will be known as the reckless
Fed chairman who encouraged the creation and use of exotic mortgages that required you to put down very little money , odd creations like the “ 2 and 28 , ” an adjustable mortgage with low interest payments the first two years that explode into gargantuan fees for the next 28 .
Do n’t have the money to pay for the 2 before the 28 ?
Go “ piggybacking ” :
Take out a home - equity loan against your new house to meet those minimal payments .
Where did the money come from ?
Banks lent it , mortgage brokers lent it , and even home builders themselves got into the act .
The housing markets were so hot the lenders barely had time to check if their buyers were deadbeats , cheats , speculators , or actual honest - to - Betsy hardworking people who wanted nothing more than what Tom Joad wanted 70 years ago .
Oh , and the buyers did n’t have time to check out the terms , either ; the value of the houses was going up too fast .
Gotta close now !
Nor did the regulators tap the brakes — whoops , there were no regulators .
If something went wrong , who cares ?
The buyers could always sell their ever - appreciating home to the next guy on the reservation list or the ten after him .
The builders , brokers , and bankers then shipped these mortgages east to the big Wall Street firms , which bundled them together and merchandised them as high - yielding bonds often backed up by nothing more than the full faith and credit of , well , no one .
Over and over , Greenspan hailed these fabulous financial breakthroughs that gave everyone a chance at the American Dream ( or multiple dreams , in the case of speculators who took down homes and flipped them ) .
And why not ?
Do n’t homes always increase in value ?
Wo n’t there always be willing buyers armed with ARMs ?
Except that was n’t how it went down .
The same guy who prescribed the mortgage elixir for all Americans then laced it with seventeen straight interest - rate increases , increases that brought rates to levels so high that legions of people who bought a home with a teaser rate could n’t afford the payments .
Between 2004 and 2006 , just as interest rates started spiking and homes kept being churned out in these saturated areas , 14 million families purchased houses , many taking advantage of teasers and piggybacks .
Given that the average home went for about $ 250,000 , that ’s hundreds of billions in loans that cost a lot more per month than when they were taken .
Now these people are stuck .
They ca n’t refinance because the rates are too high , and they ca n’t sell their homes to repay their mortgage , either .
In every area of this country — and in particular , in the once - hot markets like the ones I mentioned earlier — there are just too many other homes for sale and too many new homes still being pumped out .
What do the woes of these folks have to do with you ?
Can a housing fire sale in Phoenix or Fort Myers really affect your Hamptons beach house or your newly purchased Upper West Side classic six ?
Well , yes , and in even bigger ways than you might think .
That ’s because the people who ultimately bought the bonds backed by what now look to be billions in bogus mortgages are those who run most of the big pension - , hedge - , and stock - and - bond - market mutual funds in this country .
These suckers bought such bonds because bonds backed by mortgage - payment streams paid a tiny bit more than United States Treasuries , a comparable low - risk , if low - return , vehicle , and were supposed to have very little or no risk themselves .
Some managers , however , borrowed huge sums to buy tons of these mortgages to turbocharge their results .
And the most aggressive managers bought billions in mortgages given to less creditworthy individuals , the so - called subprime loans you keep hearing about .
Even though these loans have been losing value for years , it was n’t until June 2007 that any of this mattered .
That ’s because of what is known in the trade as the “ marks , ” the value of a stock or bond as it ’s “ marked ” by a firm .
You are getting poorer by the second because many of these mortgage bonds were priced way too high because nobody thought that large numbers of borrowers would ever walk away from their homes rather than pay the interest that backed the bonds .
Such a disaster had happened only once , in the thirties , and that was before loans were federally secured .
The buyers and sellers accounted for the bonds as if they were as reliable as cash , because as long as employment was robust — and it is — they thought they would be fine .
But now all hell ’s broken loose on Wall Street because of those mismarks .
This spring , as many homeowners stopped paying , the mortgage bonds — for the first time — starting losing value .
Hundreds of billions in bonds that were thought to be worth more or less the price they were sold at , it turns out , are worthless .
That ’s triggered a chain reaction : Brokers like JPMorgan , Goldman Sachs , and Merrill Lynch that lent money to the firms that bought the bogus loans — most famously , Bear Stearns — basically foreclosed on those firms to get their cash back .
But the firms , which are always running full tilt , did n’t have the money to pay up .
Bear , at the direction of the now - fired former co-president Warren Spector , let one fund just go down the drain .
But Spector thought the other was still worth a great deal , so he put up $ 1.3 billion to pay back what the fund owed to the lenders and take direct control of the mortgage bonds .
Spector , maybe one of the best minds in the bond business , genuinely believed that these mortgage - backed bonds still had substantial value .
If someone as savvy as Spector thought these bonds were still good when they were actually worthless , that tells you that thousands of other managers are simply dreaming if they think their portfolios are worth anything near what they claim they ’re worth .
In other words , we ’re looking at the start , not the end , of the lending meltdown .
Now these funds , which were supposed to be brimming with cash — the “ liquidity ” you hear about all of the time — turn out to have not much at all , and there are virtually no buyers anywhere for these mortgage - backed bonds , because who knows if the mortgages that are in them are worth anything ?
We only know that each day they are worth less than the day before , because every week , thousands of borrowers are being foreclosed .
Seven million people could lose their homes .
New York , where the architects of card houses live , will feel the full force of the storm .
Here ’s another layer :
The panicked managers of these firms were supposed to be the buyers for all of the high - yielding corporate bonds being issued to pay for the private - equity deals of Cerberus , KKR , Blackstone , and other private - equity firms .
They were supposed to lap up the paper for all of the leveraged deals that are in the hopper for underperforming companies like Tribune Corporation and Chrysler .
The Goldmans and JPMorgans had already promised the money to the Blackstones and KKRs .
They are on the hook — “ hung , ” to use the grisly vernacular — but they ca n’t sell the bonds to their usual pension - , hedge - , and mutual - fund clients because those clients do n’t have anywhere near the money they thought they had and are facing redemptions from furious investors .
Now , pretty much every large financial institution in the country is caught in a web it ca n’t get out of .
Bogus mortgage paper is infecting the system , and no one has a cure .
Which brings us back to your money and why you ’re losing it .
Unless you keep your money in cash or Treasuries or CDs or the First National Bank of Sealy , there ’s a pretty good chance that you ’re in a fund or funds that are mismarked and worth less than they and you think .
If you own a home , you ’re in the financial crosshairs , too .
It ’s not just that the lending crisis is causing interest rates to rise , jacking up your monthly nut if you have an ARM .
It ’s that the value of your home is endangered because of the hit Wall Street — the industry , if not the stock market — is set to take .
In the past half - dozen years , the major brokerages in New York added hundreds of thousands of jobs in three areas : mortgage - bond sales and trading , private equity , and prime brokerage ( the management of hedge funds ’ brokerage accounts ) .
Each has grown by leaps and bounds each year .
Now all three are frozen .
There are no mortgages to package and sell and no clients who want them .
The private - equity deals are all hung .
And the way I see it , the hedge - fund business is liable to be cut in half by the chain of mismarking and redemptions .
I think that many of these firms have as many as 30 percent more people than they need right now in these departments , and all of them will be cashiered by the end of the year .
The lists are being drawn up ; the HR people notified .
Not too close to the holidays , please !
And for those who are left , sorry , no bonuses .
The money was all eaten up by severances .
Unlike other times on Wall Street , the jobs will dry up across the board , because so many firms have beefed up the same divisions .
This time , get laid off at Bear , no walking across the street to Lehman .
The departed will be cut off from billions in disposable income that fuel the New York economy .
What can thaw this nuclear winter ?
What can cause these markets to defrost fast enough to save the jobs , and home values , of the rich in New York , if not the newly poor and evicted in Rancho Cucamonga ?
Spooked by the news that major foreign banks are now getting hit by the lending crunch , investors took stocks down sharply last week , prompting Fed chairman Ben Bernanke to order up a quick injection of liquidity into the system on Friday .
I think the Fed will also cut interest rates soon — certainly sooner than it otherwise would have .
That said , this Fed has been famously inflation - wary , and it may be reluctant to loosen rates too much , lest it overheat the economy , especially since the Fed seems to believe that the nonfinancial economy , the part not connected with home building or lending , is thriving .
Of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , only two , Citigroup and JPMorgan , are directly connected to this mess .
If Bernanke ’s right , and the rest of the economy is as solid as he seems to think it is , it ’s possible the lending crisis could be contained to only those who work in and around the credit business .
But that ’s a big if .
If the lending debacle keeps spreading , or the rest of the economy heads south , the Fed may find itself too far behind the curve to do much good .
Who else can unlock the jam ?
Maybe we get some help from overseas , a Chinese buyer of a major brokerage , perhaps ?
A Middle Eastern purchase of some of a big bank ’s equity — Washington Mutual , maybe ? — would n’t hurt .
That ’s what saved Citigroup in 1990 .
Perhaps Warren Buffett can come in and buy a Bear Stearns ; hey , he saved Salomon in a different decade .
What we need is some deep , untorn pockets to step up and buy some of the good paper that is being thrown away with the bad , so the trading desks can catch their breath and stabilize themselves .
Giant losses would still happen , but perhaps not institution - threatening ones .
In other times , you might expect a president or a Treasury secretary to get involved , perhaps to pressure Fannie Mae , the organization set up in the thirties to issue emergency loans to alleviate just the kind of homeowning credit squeeze that we have right now , to lend a hand .
But this administration seems to be either totally clueless or totally heartless , or both , and does n’t want to goad Fannie Mae into helping .
Maybe they hate that quasi - governmental institution set up by bleeding - heart Democrats to help struggling home buyers of a different , more liberal and compassionate , era .
Or maybe they just think that anything short of an FDR - era Agricultural Adjustment
Act for homes , where we bulldoze whole housing projects instead of cornfields to get price stability , just wo n’t work .
I fear that the pain and contractions in the housing and credit markets could cause as many as 7 million homeowners who bought houses in the past few years to flee or be tossed from their dwellings , even if the rest of the stock market thrives .
It ’s why I went off the reservation and screamed about this problem on television the other day ( my latest unhinged rant ) .
I see what could go wrong .
I see how the forgotten man gets forgotten , and I feel helpless because I do n’t see anyone doing a whole hell of a lot about it .
Thousands of miles from where the walls began tumbling down , New York , the town where the architects of card houses live , will soon feel the full force of the storm .
So much of our economy depends on these financial builders and their minions who buy and sell the products that the pain may actually end up being felt worse here than in the epicenters of the problem .
You just do n’t know it or feel it yet .
It ’s all happened too fast , in just a few weeks of another sweltering summer , with the worst , much worse , yet to come .
Which is why I bet that in the time it took for you to read this article , the Tom Joad effect just took another few bucks out of your pocket .
Get ready , many more dollars will soon vanish before you discover you ’ve been robbed .

Wake up and smell the pencil lead , says Japanese stationery and writing instrument manufacturer Pentel , who has combined the power of nanotechnology with the knowledge of expert aromatherapists to develop a new type of fragrant pencil lead .
Featuring a long - lasting aroma designed to enhance mental capacity , the pencil lead -- called " Ain supplio " -- recently won the coveted Stationery of the Year Award ( 2007 ) .
Unlike previous types of fragrant lead , which use weak aromatic surface coatings that tend to lose their smell quickly , Ain supplio relies on fragrant ingredients trapped in nanocapsules , or tiny air bubbles , which are infused into the lead itself .
The microscopic size of the nanocapsules gives them extra strength to hold their fragrance for long periods of time -- about 3 years if kept in the unopened package , 2 years if kept in their plastic case , and more than 3 months out in the open air .
Tentatively priced at 210 yen ( under $ 2 ) per set , Ain supplio comes in three flavors -- Refresh , Healing and Positive -- each prepared by aromatherapists working with ingredients such as rosemary , mint , lemongrass and green tea .
The aromatic blends are specially designed to boost the learning capacity of those in smelling range , says Pentel , who hopes the product will appeal to students .
Ain supplio will hit shelves in September , just in time for the fall semester .

Attorney General John Ashcroft was " feeble , barely articulate ( and ) clearly stressed " when then - White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card visited his hospital room to push for legal approval of a warrantless wiretap program approved by President Bush , according to newly released notes from FBI Director Robert Mueller .
The notes were released Thursday by Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , who chairs the House Judiciary Committee that is investigating the legality of the warrantless wiretapping program .
Mueller 's notes of the March 10 , 2004 incident outline a dispute between the Justice Department and the White House over the legality of a National Security Agency surveillance program .
" [ Then deputy Attorney General James Comey ] tells me Card and J. [ Judge ]
Gonzales are on the way to hospital to see the AG , but that AG is in no condition to see them , much less make decisions to authorize continuation of the program , " Mueller writes .
Comey previously testified to Conyers committee that Ashcroft had refused to approve the NSA warrantless wiretapping program before a 45 - day deadline on a previous justification was to expire .
" Director Mueller 's notes and recollections concerning the White House visit to the Attorney General 's hospital bed confirm an attempt to goad a sick and heavily medicated Ashcroft to approve the warrantless surveillance program , " Conyers said in a prepared statement .
Rep. Arthur Davis ( D - AL ) said , " Director Mueller 's notes leave an unmistakable impression of a White House determined to do an end - around the constitution . "
The notes confirm disputes within the administration over the warrantless wiretapping -- which became known as the Terrorist Surveillance Program after President Bush acknowledged its existence .
Davis said Mueller 's notes and his previous testimony are " at odds with the benign description the Attorney General provided under oath , " and he promised the Judiciary Committee would continue to probe " whether Alberto Gonzales was truthful rather than misleading " in congressional testimony .
According to Mueller 's notes , he was out to dinner with his family on March 10 , 2004 , when Deputy Attorney General James Comey called at 7:20 p.m. and informed him Gonzales and Card were on their way to the hospital where Ashcroft was recovering from surgery .
Mueller arrived at the George Washington University hospital 20 minutes later , but the White House officials had left by then .
" Comey tells me that they saw the AG ( Ashcroft ) and were told by the AG that he was in no condition to decide issues .
...
The AG also told them that he was barred from obtaining the advice he needed on the program by the strict compartmentalization rules of the WH , " Mueller wrote .
Conyers called the latter revelation " particularly disconcerting . "
Mueller 's notes show he attended meetings in Card 's office the day before the hospital visit that included Gonzales and Vice President Dick Cheney , among other officials .
The day after the visit , Card requested a meeting with Mueller that lasted 40 minutes , after which Mueller spoke to Gonzales and met with Comey .
Notes on those meetings are redacted from the released documents , which were sent to the committee from the FBI .
" Unfortunately , this heavily redacted document raises far more questions than it answers .
We intend to fully investigate this incident and the underlying subject matter that evoked such widespread distress within the Department and the FBI , " Conyers said .
" We will be seeking an unredacted copy of Director Mueller 's notes covering meetings before and after the hospital visit and expect to receive information from several of the individuals mentioned in the document . "
The original Manhunt game was blamed for a teenager 's death
The video game Manhunt 2 was rejected for its " unrelenting focus on stalking and brutal slaying " , the British Board of Film Classification said .
It means the Manhunt sequel cannot be legally supplied anywhere in the UK .
The parents of a Leicester schoolboy who blamed the original game for the murder of their 14 - year - old son said they were " absolutely elated " .
There is sustained and cumulative casual sadism in the way in which these killings are committed
BBFC director David Cooke
The original Manhunt game was given an 18 classification in 2003 .
Manhunt 2 , for PS2 and Nintendo Wii consoles , is made by Rockstar Games .
The company has six weeks to submit an appeal .
The last game to be refused classification was Carmageddon in 1997 .
That decision was overturned on appeal .
David Cooke , director of the BBFC , said : " Manhunt 2 is distinguishable from recent high - end video games by its unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone .
" There is sustained and cumulative casual sadism in the way in which these killings are committed , and encouraged , in the game . "
' Morally irresponsible '
The original Manhunt game caused huge controversy and was blamed for the murder of Stefan Pakeerah .
The boy was stabbed and beaten to death in Leicester in February 2004 .
Stefan Pakeerah was murdered in 2004
His parents believe the killer , Warren LeBlanc , 17 , was inspired by the game .
Stefan 's mother , Giselle Pakeerah , had condemned the sequel , branding the gaming industry " morally irresponsible " .
" We have been campaigning against these games for a long time and the BBFC made the right decision , " she said .
Police said robbery was the motive behind the attack on Stefan in Stokes Wood Park on 26 February 2004 - and not the video game blamed by Stefan 's parents .
Manhunt 's maker Rockstar North has always insisted its games are geared towards mature audiences and are marketed responsibly .
Leicester MP Keith Vaz , who campaigned with the Pakeerahs against the original version of Manhunt , praised the decision to ban Manhunt 2 .
He said : " This is an excellent decision by the British Board of Film Classification , showing that game publishers cannot expect to get interactive games where players take the part of killers engaged in ' casual sadism ' and murder . "
The war in Iraq is about to get worse — much worse .
The Democrats ’ decision to let the war run its course , while they frantically wash their hands of responsibility , means that it will sputter and stagger forward until the mission collapses .
This will be sudden .
The security of the Green Zone , our imperial city , will be increasingly breached .
Command and control will disintegrate .
And we will back out of Iraq humiliated and defeated .
But this will not be the end of the conflict .
It will , in fact , signal a phase of the war far deadlier and more dangerous to American interests .
Iraq no longer exists as a unified country .
The experiment that was Iraq , the cobbling together of disparate and antagonistic patches of the Ottoman Empire by the victorious powers in the wake of World War I , belongs to the history books .
It will never come back .
The Kurds have set up a de facto state in the north , the Shiites control most of the south and the center of the country is a battleground .
There are 2 million Iraqis who have fled their homes and are internally displaced .
Another 2 million have left the country , most to Syria and Jordan , which now has the largest number of refugees per capita of any country on Earth .
An Oxfam report estimates that one in three Iraqis are in need of emergency aid , but the chaos and violence is so widespread that assistance is impossible .
Iraq is in a state of anarchy .
The American occupation forces are one more source of terror tossed into the caldron of suicide bombings , mercenary armies , militias , massive explosions , ambushes , kidnappings and mass executions .
But wait until we leave .
It was not supposed to turn out like this .
Remember all those visions of a democratic Iraq , visions peddled by the White House and fatuous pundits like Thomas Friedman and the gravel - voiced morons who pollute our airwaves on CNN and Fox News ?
They assured us that the war would be a cakewalk .
We would be greeted as liberators .
Democracy would seep out over the borders of Iraq to usher in a new Middle East .
Now , struggling to salvage their own credibility , they blame the debacle on poor planning and mismanagement .
There are probably about 10,000 Arabists in the United States — people who have lived for prolonged periods in the Middle East and speak Arabic .
At the inception of the war you could not have rounded up more than about a dozen who thought this was a good idea .
And I include all the Arabists in the State Department , the Pentagon and the intelligence community .
Anyone who had spent significant time in Iraq knew this would not work .
The war was not doomed because Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz did not do sufficient planning for the occupation .
The war was doomed , period .
It never had a chance .
And even a cursory knowledge of Iraqi history and politics made this apparent .
This is not to deny the stupidity of the occupation .
The disbanding of the Iraqi army ; the ham - fisted attempt to install the crook and , it now turns out , Iranian spy Ahmed Chalabi in power ; the firing of all Baathist public officials , including university professors , primary school teachers , nurses and doctors ; the failure to secure Baghdad and the vast weapons depots from looters ; allowing heavily armed American units to blast their way through densely populated neighborhoods , giving the insurgency its most potent recruiting tool — all ensured a swift descent into chaos .
But Iraq would not have held together even if we had been spared the gross incompetence of the Bush administration .
Saddam Hussein , like the more benign dictator Josip Broz Tito in the former Yugoslavia , understood that the glue that held the country together was the secret police .
Iraq , however , is different from Yugoslavia .
Iraq has oil — lots of it .
It also has water in a part of the world that is running out of water .
And the dismemberment of Iraq will unleash a mad scramble for dwindling resources that will include the involvement of neighboring states .
The Kurds , like the Shiites and the Sunnis , know that if they do not get their hands on water resources and oil they cannot survive .
But Turkey , Syria and Iran have no intention of allowing the Kurds to create a viable enclave .
A functioning Kurdistan in northern Iraq means rebellion by the repressed Kurdish minorities in these countries .
The Kurds , orphans of the 20th century who have been repeatedly sold out by every ally they ever had , including the United States , will be crushed .
The possibility that Iraq will become a Shiite state , run by clerics allied with Iran , terrifies the Arab world .
Turkey , as well as Saudi Arabia , the United States and Israel , would most likely keep the conflict going by arming Sunni militias .
This anarchy could end with foreign forces , including Iran and Turkey , carving up the battered carcass of Iraq .
No matter what happens , many , many Iraqis are going to die .
And it is our fault .
The neoconservatives — and the liberal interventionists , who still serve as the neocons ’ useful idiots when it comes to Iran — have learned nothing .
They talk about hitting Iran and maybe even Pakistan with airstrikes .
Strikes on Iran would ensure a regional conflict .
Such an action has the potential of drawing Israel into war — especially if Iran retaliates for any airstrikes by hitting Israel , as I would expect Tehran to do .
There are still many in the U.S. who cling to the doctrine of pre-emptive war , a doctrine that the post - World War II Nuremberg laws define as a criminal “ war of aggression . ”
The occupation of Iraq , along with the Afghanistan occupation , has only furthered the spread of failed states and increased authoritarianism , savage violence , instability and anarchy .
It has swelled the ranks of our real enemies — the Islamic terrorists — and opened up voids of lawlessness where they can operate and plot against us .
It has scuttled the art of diplomacy .
It has left us an outlaw state intent on creating more outlaw states .
It has empowered Iran , as well as Russia and China , which sit on the sidelines gleefully watching our self - immolation .
This is what George W. Bush and all those “ reluctant hawks ” who supported him have bequeathed us .
What is terrifying is not that the architects and numerous apologists of the Iraq war have learned nothing , but that they may not yet be finished .
Chris Hedges , the former Middle East bureau chief for The New York Times , spent seven years in the Middle East .
He was part of the paper ’s team of reporters who won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for coverage of global terrorism .
He is the author of “ War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning . ”
His latest book is “ American Fascists : The Christian Right and the War on America . ”
A Minnesota man accused of drunk driving has sued to see the source code of the Intoxilyzer 5000EN machine that busted him , and the state Supreme Court is allowing the request to go forward .
The St. Paul Pioneer Press is reporting that Dale Lee Underdahl has challenged the effectiveness of the breath analyzer used by police to arrest him for drunk driving , and he 's demanding to see the source code in order to make sure the machine works as advertised .
His attorney told the paper , " The problem is , the manufacturer of the thing thinks they can hold it back and not tell anybody how it works .
For all we know , it 's a random number generator . "
That seems ... unlikely , but it is interesting that the state does not want to reveal the information that would show whether its law enforcement tools are truly accurate .
The company that makes the Intoxilyzer , CMI Inc. of Owensboro , Kentucky , also has no desire to turn over the code .
The state is n't sure that it has the rights to the source code , though the agreement between CMI and the state does appear to give the state the necessary control of the source code .
A succession of Minnesota courts have now ruled that the defendant has a legitimate right to make sure the device is accurate , and with the recent Supreme Court decision , the matter appears to be settled .
The " source code defense " has become more popular in recent years and has occasionally resulted in the code being disclosed .
In 2005 , a group of Florida defendants also won the right to examine the source code of a machine .
It only seems legitimate for the accused to know if the tests are accurate and if the software in the machines works as advertised .
Security researcher Ed Felten made this point back in 2005 after the Florida case hit the headlines .
The issue , he said , is about " fairness for the accused .
If they ’re going to be accused based on what some machine says , then they ought to be allowed to challenge the accuracy of the machine .
And they can't do that unless they ’re allowed to know how the machine works . "
As a bonus , if a company proves unwilling to turn over the code , the case is often thrown out without any need to prove that the source code is in fact flawed .
One of the common criticisms ( which is also made of voting machines ) of breath devices is that the " state - certified " models are updated even after they are certified .
The companies that manufacture the machines make tweaks , bug fixes , and even add new features , but the machines are not generally recertified after every single source code change .
This means that any given machine could potentially be running non-certified code , code which may or may not have errors .
And as voting machine software has shown , assuming that such source code is rigorously locked down and tested can be a a bad idea .

EHarmony sued for excluding same - sex matches
2007-06-01 13:30:14 PDT
-- Linda Carlson was looking for a partner and decided to try eHarmony , the Pasadena - based online dating service that advertises its ability to " deliver matches that have the foundation of compatibility based on a lifetime of joy . "
When the San Mateo County woman tried to log in , she was given two options : " man seeking a woman " or " woman seeking a man . "
Neither suited Carlson , who was seeking another woman .
Her complaint to the company this February got nowhere , and on Thursday , she filed suit in Los Angeles accusing eHarmony of violating a California law that prohibits businesses from discriminating based on sexual orientation .
" The case is about moving gay rights into this century , " Todd Schneider , a lawyer for Carlson , said Friday .
" It could not possibly be OK to say no black people allowed , or no Chinese people allowed , but for some reason , this Web site thinks it 's OK to say no gay people allowed . "
But Lanny Davis , a lawyer for eHarmony , said the company is n't violating California law by excluding gays and lesbians .
He said the law prohibits only arbitrary discrimination that lacks a legitimate business purpose .
" Our rational business basis is that our research database comes from a clinical psychiatrist observing successful marriages vs. non-successful , " observations based entirely on opposite - sex marriages , Davis said .
He said a claim of discrimination against same - sex partners is comparable to a suit against a Japanese restaurant " for discriminating against people who like French food . "
In a statement , eHarmony 's chief executive , Greg Waldorf , said , " Nothing precludes us from providing same - sex matching in the future .
It 's just not a service we offer now , based upon the research we have conducted . "
The lawsuit asserted , however , that , " there is no reason for eHarmony 's policy of exclusion except for discrimination . "
EHarmony was founded in 2000 by Nell Warren , an associate of James Dobson , leader of the conservative religious organiza- tion Focus on the Family .
The company still promotes itself as a Christian matchmaking service , but has cut its ties with Dobson .
EHarmony says it has had more than 15 million subscribers since its founding and says its matches result in 90 marriages a day .
Unlike other dating services that allow participants to choose their own partners , eHarmony says it matches each subscriber with a compatible partner based on scientific analysis of a detailed questionnaire .
It 's also the only prominent matchmaking service that excludes gays and lesbians , said Jeremy Pasternak , another lawyer for Carlson .
The proposed class - action suit seeks damages for any gay , lesbian or bisexual Californian who was denied access to the Web site or refrained from using it because of its policy , and an injunction requiring equal access .
The proposed class - action suit comes on the heels of a similar case against an online adoption service , Adoption.com , by two San Jose men whose profiles as a would - be adoptive couple were kept off the company 's Web site .
The Arizona - based firm settled the suit last week with an announcement that it would no longer post profiles of California couples , rather than including same - sex or unmarried couples from California .
That does n't appear to be an option for California - based eHarmony , Carlson 's lawyers said .
US Politics Open Letter to Congressman Ron Paul By Joel S. Hirschhorn
Published June 06 , 2007
There are numerous reasons to admire you , as I have for many years .
Clearly you are running for president as a Republican , rather than a third party candidate , for the purpose of getting richly deserved media and public attention not available to those outside the two - party duopoly .
In last night 's debate among Republican presidential candidates you proudly described yourself as a " champion of the Constitution . "
However , you are missing a major opportunity to demonstrate your courage and allegiance to our constitutional republic .
You have acknowledged the appropriateness of amending the Constitution .
In fact , you introduced legislation for an amendment that would stop giving automatic citizenship to babies born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents .
You said :
Our founders knew that unforeseen problems with our system of government would arise , and that 's precisely why they gave us a method for amending the Constitution .
It 's time to rethink birthright citizenship by amending the 14th amendment .
Personally , I endorse this particular amendment .
More important , however , I am disappointed that you have never latched on to the long history of Congress ' failure to honor and obey the part of Article V of the Constitution that gives Americans the right to a convention for the purpose of proposing amendments to the Constitution – an alternative to Congress proposing amendments .
Interestingly , the particular amendment that you favor will probably never emerge from Congress , but might have a better chance through an Article V convention .
Why have you failed to acknowledge that Congress has ignored over 500 applications from state legislatures from all 50 states for an Article V convention ?
As a champion of the Constitution , surely you know that the one and only requirement explicitly stated in Article V is that two - thirds of state legislatures ask for one .
Surely you also know that Congress has never passed any law that expands or modifies this single explicit constitutional requirement .
So , I ask you Congressman Paul :
Why have you remained silent on the Article V issue ?
If you do not believe that Congress should honor Article V's provision for a convention , why not say so publicly ?
If you believe that it should never be used , then why not call for an amendment to delete it from our Constitution ?
Please , Congressman Paul , as a champion of the Constitution , do not behave like other members of Congress and silently veto a crucial part of the Constitution that the Framers wisely gave us .
They anticipated that eventually Americans could lose confidence in the federal government .
You clearly have earned the respect and support of millions of Americans because you object to so many policies and actions of the federal government .
Thus , you , more than virtually any other member of Congress , should appreciate the wisdom of the Framers in giving us the Article V convention option .
I beg you to speak up and demonstrate just how much of a champion of the Constitution you really are by bringing national attention to the Article V convention issue and supporting its use .
As a founder of Friends of the Article V Convention I invite you to play a leading role in giving the United States of America its first Article V convention .

It seems that the International Energy Agency , the intergovernmental energy watchdog , has been going in overdrive lately .
First , we had the interview of its chief economist warning us that we were going toward a wall without Iraqi oil , then the recent publication of their yearly outlook report predicting shortages within 5 years , and now we have another disquieting interview in Le Monde , the big French daily , with Claude Mandil , the head of the Agency , who pulls no punches , despite an apparent denial of " peak oil " .
Follow me below the fold for a translation .
L'OPEP s'est inquiétée des déclarations de pays consommateurs en faveur d'une réduction de la dépendance au pétrole et d'un axe Washington - Brasilia sur les biocarburants .
Ces craintes sont - elles fondées ?
Certaines déclarations du président américain George Bush ont semblé très inquiétantes pour l'OPEP , mais ses membres n'ont aucunes craintes à avoir .
La demande de pétrole conventionnel va croître dans les années à venir , et compte tenu du recul annoncé de la production des pays non-OPEP ( Russie , Grande - Bretagne , Norvège ... ) , la part du marché mondial de l'OPEP progressera en valeur absolue d'ici à 2050 .
Quant aux biocarburants , l'OPEP sait que la substitution n'est pas possible .
Ils ne représenteront jamais plus de 10 % de la consommation mondiale .
Cela ne devrait pas lui donner de cauchemars .
OPEC worries about declarations by consumer countries about lowering dependency and talk of a Washington - Brasilia biofuels axis .
Are these worries legitimate ?
Some speeches by Bush may have sounded worrying for OPEC , but its members should not worry .
Demand for oil will increase in the coming years and , taking into account the decline from non-OPEC country production ( Russia , Norway , UK , ... ) , OPEC 's share of the world market will increase in absolute value by 2050 .
As to biofuels , OPEC knows that substitution is impossible .
They will never make up more than 10 % of world production .
This should not cause them nightmares .
Beyond the now familiar criticism of biofuels ( boy has the wind turned on that topic ! ) , the most interesting thing to note here is the inclusion of Russia in the list of countries in decline .
While his statement is slightly ambiguous as he only mentions the 2050 date , I believe that it is a significant acknowledgement .
When you look at where production increases have come in the past 5 years , Russia tops the list - in fact , the catch up in Russian production after the precipitous decline of the 90s ( caused by Soviet collapse in a context of an already declining industry - Russia 's production peak is and remains in 1986 ) was the main reason the massive demand increase of the past few years has been absorbed relatively painlessly .
Noting that this solution is gone puts the focus , more than ever , on OPEC production .
L'OPEP ( Organisation des pays exportateurs de pétrole ) refuse de produire plus , affirmant que le marché est bien approvisionné .
N'est - elle pas la vraie responsable ?
L'OPEP connaît la situation : le marché n'est pas bien approvisionné .
Elle doit vite augmenter sa production .
Il est d'ailleurs possible qu'elle le fasse discrètement dans les mois à venir .
C'est une abondance en trompe - l 'oeil et saisonnière .
Les raffineries devront fonctionner à pleine capacité pour produire de l'essence pour cet été et répondre à la forte demande des troisième et quatrième trimestres pour le fioul domestique .
Les stocks risquent de ne pas suffire .
La situation des prix est préoccupante .
Mais je crois que le meilleur moyen de les faire baisser est encore d'améliorer l'efficacité énergétique , notamment dans les transports .
OPEC refuses to produce more , saying that the market is well supplied .
Are they responsible ?
OPEC knows the facts : the markets are not sufficiently supplied .
It must increase its production .
It is quite possible that it will do so in the coming months , discreetly .
Today , we have a seasonal and misleading oversupply .
Refineries should be working at full capacity to produce gas for this summer and to respond to strong 3rd and 4th quarter demand for domestic fuel .
Stocks might not be sufficient .
The price situation is worrying .
But i think that the best way to get them down is to improve energy efficiency , especially on the transport front .
So : confirming market tightness and worries for the rest of the year , and essentially begging OPEC to put more oil on the table - while appearing to say " do n't worry , we are dealing with this behind the scenes , trust us " .
A strange mix of messages ...
Le thème du déclin rapide de la production pétrolière a ressurgi .
Votre réflexion a - t - elle évolué sur ce point ?
Je ne crois pas aux analyses des tenants du " peak oil " .
Le fondement de leur théorie , c'est de dire que l'on ne trouve plus de gisements géants .
Pourquoi ?
Parce que les réserves sont dans des pays où les compagnies nationales ont le monopole .
Pourquoi voulez - vous , aux cours du pétrole actuels , que la Saudi Aramco fasse de l'exploration - production ?
Les réserves géologiques restent très abondantes , mais se trouvent dans des régions fermées aux investissements occidentaux , comme le Moyen - Orient , ou de moins en moins ouvertes , comme la Russie et le Venezuela .
Il est vrai que les zones d'exploration sont aussi des zones difficiles à exploiter ( Grand Nord , offshore profond ) .
Les grandes compagnies comme Exxon , Shell , BP ou Total ont un sérieux problème : leurs cibles se raréfient .
Le problème essentiel , pour la sécurité d'approvisionnement , c'est que le monde va dépendre d'un nombre de plus en plus réduit de pays producteurs .
Si , en plus , ils ne peuvent pas investir pour différentes raisons , la guerre en Irak ou des freins politiques et administratifs en Iran , on va au - devant de gros problèmes .
The theme of rapid oil production decline has cropped up again .
Has your position changed on this topic ?
I do not believe in the " peak oil " theories .
The foundation of their theory is that we no longer find giant oil fields .
But why is that ?
Because reserves are in countries where national companies have a monopoly .
Why would Saudi Aramco want , with current oil prices , to do any Exploration & Production ?
Geological reserves remain abundant , but are in regions closed to foreign investors , like the Middle East , or increasingly hostile , lie Russia or Venezuela .
It is true that current exploration zones are hard to put into production ( far north , deep offshore ) .
Big oil companies like Exxon , Shell , BP or Total have a serious problem : their targets are getting scarce .
The main problem for security of supply is that the world will be increasingly dependent on a shrinking number of countries .
If , in addition , they cannot invest for various reasons , the war in Iraq , political or administrative brakes in Iran , we go towards big problems . "
The question was loaded , starting as it did with the " rapid decline " of oil production , which is probably not the first thing that can be said about peak oil .
and it draws the usual denial ( which Mandil delivered to me in person ( he knows me and that I 'm a blogger ... ) a couple of weeks back when I met him at an energy conference in Brussels ) .
But Mandil 's longer response is worth commenting in detail :
he is , like the IEA , unambiguous on the shrinking resource base directly controlled by " friendly countries " and , more widely , available to Western oil majors .
The IEA report last week was quite scathing on these companies ' preference for dividends and share buy - backs over investments , but he is more focused here on the fact that these companies simply no longer have access to reserves .
As I 've noted before , these companies have seen their production shrink in the past 5 years , despite the record oil prices .
his main argument against peak oil is that countries like Saudi Arabia and Iraq are under - explored and have plenty of untapped resources ( he made that point more explicitly to me orally at that conference ) .
So peak oil is simply not a worry because the resources are there , we just do n't have access to them ( and thus do n't know about them )
while that argument above is a matter of belief , in the absence of proof ( and we can certainly argue that the burden of proof should be on him and not on the peakoilers in that instance ) , in practie it matters little because , as he specifically notes , these reserves are ( i ) not accessible and ( ii ) controleed by entity that have no incentive to put them in production and every incentive not to do so .
So the corresponding production , from his very admission , is unlikely to take place .
Whether it is for geological or political reasons is fundamentally irrelevant - the oil will not be there , or , in any case , not in the volumes desired .
.
So the corresponding production , , is unlikely to take place .
Whether it is for geological or political reasons is fundamentally irrelevant - , or , in any case , not in the volumes desired .
in effect , Mandil confirms that previous statements of his agency about a coming crunch and the utter inadequation of demand to supply .
Furthermore , he notes that supply , even as it is constrained , will nevertheless be increasingly concentrated in unfriendly hands , a dire warning whatever the cause .
So , to his credit , Mandil put the blame squarely where it belongs , and points in the right direction for solutions :
Comment analysez - vous la reprise en main du marché par les producteurs ?
Les pays consommateurs en sont largement responsables .
Ils ne veulent pas se lancer dans une politique d'efficacité énergétique , pourtant la moins coûteuse .
C'est une priorité absolue .
Il faut notamment prendre des mesures sévères dans le secteur des transports comme la surtaxation des grosses cylindrées , la réduction des 4 × 4 , les limitations de vitesse ...
How do you analyse the domination of the markets by producing countries ?
Consuming countries are largely repsonsible .
They do not want to launch energy saving policies - despite the fact that these are the cheapest available .
It 's an absolute priority .
We need to take tough measures in the transport sector , such as stiff taxes on large cars , limitations on SUVs and speed limits ...
We are reponsible .
Not the evil Russians , Saudis or Iranians .
They are our dealers .
That 's bad , but it 's just a consequence of our addiction .
Ending that addiction will require changes , some of which appear wrenching or painful , but which are necessary , and which will in fact free us .
At least Mandil , despite his ( officially motivated ? ) soothing - if wildly optimistic - words about Saudi reserves , is right about where the blame lays - and where any solution can start .
Church - state question before justices
The Wisconsin - based Freedom From Religion Foundation has sued to get rid of crosses in city parks , to end Good Friday public holidays and , most vigorously , to thwart President Bush 's faith - based initiative .
Now , the group that for 30 years has sought a firm divide between church and state will be at the Supreme Court on Wednesday in a case that could affect taxpayers ' ability to challenge — and government 's ability to defend — a multitude of public programs that involve groups with a religious affiliation .
The White House Office of Faith - Based and Community Initiatives was set up in 2001 to help religious groups compete with secular organizations for federal grants to provide social services .
The case before the justices focuses on regional conferences that promoted the initiative .
The Freedom From Religion Foundation likened the conferences to " revival meetings " and said they boosted the grant prospects for religious groups " without similar advocacy for secular community - based organizations . "
The legal question is not whether those conferences violated the constitutional separation of church and state , but more fundamentally when a taxpayer may even get into court to challenge such mingling of government and religion .
It 's a question that could have national significance .
Numerous outside groups have joined both sides of the case .
Twelve states , backing the Bush administration , are trying to block the lawsuit .
On the other side are atheists and religious organizations such as the American Jewish Congress and the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty .
" If the Bush administration were to prevail , " says Annie Laurie Gaylor , co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation , " nobody would be able to challenge these programs .
We feel that our litigation and educational efforts have never been more important . "
U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement , representing the administration , counters that if the foundation wins , judges could end up scrutinizing " every government encounter with religion … at the behest of any one of the more than 180 million taxpayers in the United States . "
Typically , taxpayers cannot sue over how the government spends money , but in a 1968 case known as Flast v. Cohen the justices carved out an exception for lawsuits based on the separation of church and state .
The Constitution 's First Amendment says government " shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . "
The Bush administration says the Flast case allows challenges to congressional spending but not to executive branch actions .
The Bush faith - based initiative was created by executive orders , not specific congressional appropriations .
A U.S. trial court dismissed the foundation 's lawsuit , but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit reversed it in January 2006 .
" The line proposed by the government … would be artificial because there is so much that executive officials could do to promote religion in ways forbidden by the establishment clause , " that court said .
In the administration 's appeal , Clement says Flast and other cases since 1968 connect taxpayers ' right to sue with the legislative taxing and spending power .
Washington , D.C. , lawyer Andrew Pincus , representing Freedom From Religion , says neither the 1968 case nor American history requires a distinction between legislative and executive actions .
" The Framers ( of the Constitution ) were well aware of the potential for abuse of executive power in the area of religion . …
There simply is no basis for concluding that they were less concerned about exercises of executive discretion than about the actions of Congress . "
Enlarge By Morry Gash , AP Annie Laurie Gaylor , at her foundation 's headquarters , says its efforts " have never been more important . "
Constitutional Topic : Official Language
The Constitutional Topics pages at the USConstitution .
net site are presented to delve deeper into topics than can be provided on the Glossary Page or in the FAQ pages .
This Topic Page concerns an Official Language for the United States .
No official language is mentioned or contemplated in the Constitution .
Many people are surprised to learn that the United States has no official language .
As one of the major centers of commerce and trade , and a major English - speaking country , many assume that English is the country 's official language .
But despite efforts over the years , the United States has no official language .
Almost every session of Congress , an amendment to the Constitution is proposed in Congress to adopt English as the official language of the United States .
Other efforts have attempted to take the easier route of changing the U.S. Code to make English the official language .
As of this writing , the efforts have not been successful .
Here is the text of a proposed amendment .
This particular bill was introduced in the House of Representatives as H.J. Res. 16 ( 107th Congress ) :
The English language shall be the official language of the United States .
As the official language , the English language shall be used for all public acts including every order , resolution , vote , or election , and for all records and judicial proceedings of the Government of the United States and the governments of the several States .
Also introduced in the 107th Congress was this text from H.R. 3333 :
The Government of the United States shall preserve and enhance the role of English as the official language of the United States of America .
Unless specifically stated in applicable law , no person has a right , entitlement , or claim to have the Government of the United States or any of its officials or representatives act , communicate , perform or provide services , or provide materials in any language other than English .
If exceptions are made , that does not create a legal entitlement to additional services in that language or any language other than English .
Often these bills are in response to legislation recognizing non-English languages in public discourse of some kind .
H.R. 3333 , for example , also explicitly repealed the Bilingual Education Act which authorized funds to educate American students if their native tongue as well as to provide specialized training in the learning of English .
The most recent efforts to promote English as the official language has come as more and more immigration from Spanish - speaking and Eastern nations ( such as China and Vietnam ) has brought an influx of non-English speakers to the United States .
According to the 1990 Census , 13.8 percent of U.S. residents speak some non-English language at home .
2.9 percent , or 6.7 million people , did not speak English at all , or could not speak it well .
The ACLU , which is part of a group opposed to establishing a national official language , has published a paper detailing reasons that such a move should be opposed .
It starts by mentioning an effort by John Adams , in 1780 , to establish an official academy devoted to English , a move which was rejected at the time as undemocratic .
The ACLU notes past efforts at English - only laws that abridged the rights of non-English speakers or which generally made life difficult for large non-English speaking populations .
One example cited in Dade County , Florida , where , after a 1980 English - only law was passed , Spanish signs on public transportation were removed .
The ACLU believes that English - only laws can violate the U.S. Constitution 's protection of due process ( especially in courts where no translation service would be offered ) and equal protection ( for example , where English - only ballots would be used where bilingual ones were available in the past ) .
English - only proponents like U.S. English counter that English - only laws generally have exceptions for public safety and health needs .
They note that English - only laws help governments save money by allowing publication of official documents in a single language , saving on translation and printing costs , and that English - only laws promote the learning of English by non-English speakers .
One example offered is that of Canada , with two official languages , English and French .
The Canadian government itself has addressed this issue , noting that in 1996 - 7 , only 260 million Canadian dollars were spent on bilingual services .
There has been at least one interesting contrast to the pro-English efforts .
In 1923 , Illinois officially declared that English would no longer be the official language of Illinois - but American would be .
Many of Illinois ' statutes refer to " the American language , " ( example : 225 ILCS 705/27.01 ) though the official language of the state is now English ( 5 ILCS 460/20 ) .
According to U.S. English , the following states have existing official language laws on their books : Alabama , Alaska , Arkansas , California , Colorado , Florida , Georgia , Hawaii , Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , Kentucky , Louisiana , Massachusetts , Mississippi , Missouri , Montana , Nebraska , New Hampshire , North Carolina , North Dakota , South Carolina , South Dakota , Tennessee , Utah , Virginia , Wyoming .
A small handful date back more than a few decades , such as Louisiana ( 1811 ) and Nebraska ( 1920 ) , but most official language statutes were passed since the 1970's .

Post - Agile Manifesto
Posted 14 years , 5 months ago on June 14 , 2007
Now you can now download a copy of the hotly anticipated Post - Agile Manifesto and see what all the fuss has been about .
If you 'd like to become a signatory to the manifesto , why not arrange a bunch of electrons into the shape of a message and launch them in my general direction
Faced with public anger and pressure from authorities , providers of online credit checks recently agreed to alter a service that allowed Swedes to snoop through each other 's finances anonymously and free of charge .
" Your neighbour knows what you 're making , your brother - in law knows what you 're making , and people around you can know whether you 're on any records for outstanding payments .
It 's private and a bit embarrassing , " said Hans Karnlof , a lawyer at the Swedish Data Inspection Board .
Online credit checks became a popular pastime in Sweden after a web site called Ratsit.se in November started publishing financial details , free - of - charge , from the national tax authority .
The site has some 610,000 registered users - in a country of 9 million - and handled an average of 50,000 online credit checks a day .
The service allowed users to snoop financial information simply by typing in someone 's name and clicking on " search . "
Authorities said the noble purpose of Sweden 's transparency laws was being abused for frivolous credit checks , and pressured Ratsit and similar web sites to impose some restrictions .
Now , information on personal income and debt can only be accessed for a fee - 10 requests a week for 15 kronor ( $ A2.50 ) each , and 25 kronor ( $ A4.30 ) for each additional request .
Also , the financial checks are no longer anonymous - people whose finances have been viewed online will be notified by mail who checked their details .
A more extensive report , including information on financial and property assets , costs 49 kronor ( $ A8.20 ) per search .
" I do think our service is justified because things like wages should be transparent , " said Ratsit 's chief executive , Anders Johansson .
" A lot of people use it to negotiate their pay . "
Employers also use the service as part of background checks to see if potential hires have any outstanding debts , he added .
The principle of openness is deeply ingrained in Swedish society .
The first freedom of information act was established in 1766 to allow citizens insight into the affairs of the government .
Those rights were gradually expanded and now allow Swedes unfettered access to almost all records that the state keeps on the population .
It is a gold mine for journalists , who routinely sift through tax forms and income statements to get information on public officials .
But private citizens are generally more shy about heading down to the tax office and requesting information on their neighbours .
It is different online , though .
" There 's a big difference in sitting hidden at home and being reasonably anonymous than to trot off to the tax office and sit in the waiting room and tell a person eye - to - eye whom you want to check , " said Karolina Lassbo , a 27 - year - old lawyer in Uppsala , a city famous for its university .
Lassbo said she had used Ratsit once " because I wanted to see what it said about me . "
But her curiosity got the better of her : " Then I checked friends and celebrities . "
Normally , credit information companies must inform the target of their credit check , but these rules did n't originally apply to online sites .
That is because a 2003 law change made it possible for web sites to get publishing rights , protected by the freedom of the press .
When Ratsit started making use of that right last year , it quickly became one of Sweden 's most popular web sites , but also one of the most controversial .
Many Swedes were uncomfortable that their intimate financial details , like debts and salaries , are so easily accessible .
Only some 10,000 people , who have protected identities because they live under some form of threat , are excluded from the public records .
The Data Inspection Board received " an avalanche " of complaints at the end of 2006 from people who thought the online credit checks were being abused , said Karnlof , the lawyer for the board .
" This type of access to financial information is in no way available in other countries like it is here , " he said .
" Visitors we 've had from Ireland and Germany , for example , just drop their jaws when they hear about it . "
Personal integrity issues aside , authorities expressed concern that sites like Ratsit could help anyone intent on fraud to more easily steal people 's identities by examining their personal details .
The National Tax Board decided to throw a spanner in the wheel .
While the law obliges the board to give out tax information , it does not say in what form .
So tax authorities simply threatened to supply the information on paper , instead of electronically , which is the standard .
That would have created a major headache for the credit information agencies , forcing them to scan millions of records .
To avoid the hassle , the companies agreed to some restrictions on how the material is accessed .
Before the new rules kicked in June 11 , Ratsit saw a big spike in traffic .
More than 2 million credit checks were made in the previous two weeks , said Johansson , the company 's boss .
Ratsit , which also allows users to browse the finances of Swedish companies , expects the personal credit checks to drop by half under the new rules , but is revamping its free service with other information to attract new users .
The free service has now added marital status and a " singles - index , " showing how many people in a specific postal code district live on their own .
Ratsit also plans to include phone numbers .
" I think it will attract even more visitors , " Johansson said .

( reads : 3784 , responses : 27 ) Python Metaclass Programming as ordinary instances ( objects ) are built out of classes , classes themselves are built out of metaclasses .
Most of the time , you do not need to worry about the implicit metaclass ( named type in Python ) that is used in class construction , but occasionally , deliberate control of a class ' metaclass can produce powerful effects .
For example , metaclasses allow " aspect oriented programming , " meaning you can enhance classes with features like tracing capabilities , object persistence , exception logging , and more .
Python remains the language techniques laboratory for the masses .
Other approaches for experimenting with this sort of thing would be implementing an object system in Scheme / Lisp , using CLOS , or playing with Smalltalk MOP .

( reads : 2208 , responses : 0 ) Type theorists put the question , " What is the type of a type ? " , on a solid theoretical footing years ago and provided many useful models for answering such questions .
Metaclasses are n't one of these answers .
The superstition that metaclasses have something to do with types of types does the world more harm than good .

That 's a good question .
I 'm not a well - studied language designer , but I was recently creating a compiler for a toy object - oriented language .
Imagine my confusion when I realized I did n't know whether the type of the " Class " object should be " Class " ( recursively ) or " Object " .

( reads : 2141 , responses : 1 ) Tim - in this case you have to accept Python for what it is , a pieced together scripting language .
It is popular and productive , in spite of its lack of solid theoretical foundation .
And so in this light , this report is really about making power Python programmers more productive .
It has almost nothing to do with theory .
Perhaps the next revolution will belong to a more pure language .
I am not as crazy about Python as I am even other " dynamic " languages .
But I have come to accept Python 's popularity and utility .

( reads : 2165 , responses : 0 ) What is the type of a type ?
That 's a good question .
I 'm not a well - studied language designer , but I was recently creating a compiler for a toy object - oriented language .
Imagine my confusion when I realized I did n't know whether the type of the " Class " object should be " Class " ( recursively ) or " Object " .
This is a good question ...
I 'll explain this based on my current understanding , both to help clarify it in your mind and in the hope that someone can correct me when I go wrong .
Typically , all values in a language are given types .
If the language provides some way of reifying type information about a value as another value , these values too have types .
Java , for example , provides a limited form of this which corresponds to your example above .
I can write , for any object foo : Class classOfFoo = foo.getClass ( ) ; I 'm left with a Class object , which is an Object like anything else , and is an instance of a class ( the class Class , to be precise ) .
classOfFoo is a regular value , with a regular type , just like everything else .
In effect , I 've pulled foo 's type information down to the level of values .
Types of types are something different .
I 've always seen them referred to as " kinds " , but there may be other jargon as well .
By definition , types are meta - information about values , and thus cannot be manipulated directly by the programmer , without somehow converting them to ( " reifying them as " ) values ( which then have types of their own ) .
Types are typically manipulated by some other ( usually considered " higher " ) layer of the language , and if this layer is sophisticated enough to warrant its own type system , then kinds are introduced and you may end up with kind - checking , kind - inference , and all the familiar baggage .
In a language like SML the distinction between these two layers is clearly specified : the Definition of Standard ML contains separate chapters on " static semantics " ( the type layer ) , and " dynamic semantics " ( the value layer ) .
The type layer is simple enough , AFAIK , not to warrant the use of kinds .
I hope this helps , rather than just confusing you more .
I 'm sure I have n't explained this clearly , and I 'm equally sure I 've made mistakes .
But I encourage you to read more about it , as it's a pretty fascinating subject .
I 'm particularly interested in systems that flatten the distinction between these two layers , and in flattening them , telescope from a 2 - level system to an infinite - level system .
What I have in mind is a system whose language for manipulating types is identical to its language for manipulating values , which of course would also be true then for the languages of kinds , kinds of kinds , and so on .
This is analogous to the famous " meta - circular reflective tower " model of Lisp meta- programming , and I 'm really curious about how far this goes .
Could such a system be implemented ?
Would it be usable ?
I mean , could one actually write comprehensible programs ?
If so , would it be useful ?
What new idioms would be suggested ?
What , exactly , is the relationship between the type - language reflective tower and the macro- expansion reflective tower , if any ?
My guess is that this is probably nothing new for many people on LtU , and I 'd really appreciate thoughts or pointers to related work ...

( reads : 2085 , responses : 0 ) Metaclasses do have something to do with types !
They are precisely Russell 's paradox encoded as a programming language feature .
Type theory was invented precisely to forbid this possibility , by keeping people from constructing self - referential propositions , as you can do in naive set theory .
However , self - reference is extremely useful in practice , which is why metaclasses keep showing up .
And not all uses of self - reference will lead to unsoundness , so there 's no reason to be unreasonably biased against it .
There 's probably some kind of weirdo category - theoretic kung fu you can use to avoid Russell 's paradox without forbidding self - reference in toto .
I 've run across references to something called " monadic reflection " , which would seem to have the right combination of buzzwords :) , but I do n't know enough to say for certain whether this is what we want .
Certainly , things like dynamic loading , ( un ) marshalling , and anything else that changes the program at runtime will need some kind of reflection to work right ....

( reads : 2076 , responses : 1 ) Ruby differentiates between type and class .
The type of an object is defined by , and only by , the way that it responds to messages .
Classes and modules define reusable implementations but do not constrain the types of subclasses .
Apparently in Ruby , type is not meta - information that cannot be changed by the programmer .
Just the opposite , type is simply the observed run-time behavior of an object .

Tim Sweeney - Re : Python Metaclass Programming
4/23/2003 ; 5:07:42 PM
( reads : 2092 , responses : 1 ) Well , I made similar design mistakes in past languages I shipped .
In UnrealScript ( http://unreal.epicgames.com/unrealscript.htm), as in Java , there is a " Class " class which stores metadata about classes ; its class is also " Class " , and its superclass is " Object " .
I did n't know much about type theory then .
Now that I do , I recognize this model as unnatural , and think we can get MUCH better end results by exposing a real type - theoretic notion of types , and that this would only make the language more powerful and practical for everyday programming .
Here 's how I look at types now : - A type describes a set of values .
The set may be empty , finite , or infinite .
In this interpretation , the " int " type is shorthand for " the type containing .. , - 1,0,1,2 , .. " . - A type does n't " contain " any more information than the set of values it describes .
It 's not like a record or struct type that contains member functions , member variables ( " the type 's name " ) , etc. - Two types are equal if they describe the same set of values , unequal otherwise ( full extensionality ) .
However , comparing two types need not be a decidable operation .
-
The operations allowed on types depend on your language : * In the most basic example , simply typed lambda calculus , there are no operations on types .
The only way that types are used is to limit the values which the compiler accepts in a certain place ( for example , in a function application for a given function ) .
This information is statically checked at compile - time , and erased by runtime , therefore no aspects of types are visible at runtime .
*
Some languages allow dynamic casts , the ability to see whether an arbitrary value , known precisely only at runtime , belogs to a certain type .
This need n't imply dynamic typing ; there are constructs like " ifcast ( x , value , type ) then a{x} else b " which maintain static type safety in the presence of casts .
Here types , can't be completely erased , so some aspects of the type systems are exposed to the runtime .
*
More advanced languages support dependent types , intersections of types , non-disjoint unions of types , testing types for inhabitance / emptyness dynamically , etc. -
It 's valid to talk about subtyping in full generality .
For example , there is ( at least conceptually ) " the type of all integers except - 3 and 7 " , and it 's a subtype of the type of integers .
-
For general purpose programming , you tend to want an empty type containing no values - you might call this " uninhabited " - note there can be only one by extensionality , and a universal type ( conceptually ) containing every value that is valid in the language - you might call this " object " .
-
For any type t , there is such a thing as " the type containing all the subtypes of t , and nothing else " ( similar to the powerset from set theory ) .
If you have a universal type " object " , then the type of all types is precisely the type of all types that are subtypes of object .
You can iterate this process to obtain " the type of all types of types " and the result is valid and non-circular .
Each iteration you 're narrowing the set of values you 're talking about , and each time you 're just dealing with a subtype of object and nothing fancier than that .
-
For sufficiently advanced type theories , we need to accept undecidable typechecking ( i.e. for dependent typing in the presence of recursion , the type system is Turing - complete ) .
This does n't mean that we have to accept unsafe typing , it means the compiler may have to reject some programs that are actually safe , and users may have to work around these limitations .
-
It 's valid to talk about functions that take types as parameters , and return types as results .
These are considered functors in stratified type systems , but if you see types as just a certain kind of value , then you only have functions , and not any special " forall " quantifiers or type - level lambdas .
-
This level of generality is n't unreasonable for future languages .
For example , see McAllester 's Ontic for a framework that combines most of these concepts .
- Practical programmers want metadata , reflective capabilities , the ability to mix and match open - world and closed - world programming models to fit their needs , a combination of nominal and structural typing capabilities , and a mechanism for reusing implementations ( i.e. inheritance or encapsulation ) .
These features can all be supported in a sound type framework , but we must n't confuse metadata and types .
Metadata is something that you want certain record - like data structures to contain , so that you can use reflective programming techniques .
Here 's how I 'd redesign a modern language like Java in this light : - Java uses " object " to denote " the type of things that contain fields " .
Change this name to " record " , a more specific term that 's generally recognized as meaning " something that contains fields " .
- Java uses " int " to denote " the type of integers " , and " Int " to denote " the type of integers that have been boxed up into a record " .
In Java , " int " is not a subtype of " object " , but " Int " is .
Ok , we blew it here .
Keep " int " as - is and eliminate " Int " .
We wo n't need " Int " . -
Add a new type " object " which , this time around , really means " the type of all objects " , not just " the type of all records " .
Now EVERY type is a subtype of object .
" int " is a subtype of object , " char " , etc. - " object " does n't have any member functions or other fields ( remember , it 's not a record type now ) .
Given an object , you can't do anything with it , except try to cast it to other types .
- Expose functions as first - class language values , with proper variance rules for their parameters and return types .
Add a new base type " function " , the type of all functions .
It 's a subtype of objects .
Now you can pass around functions freely .
- Eliminate any thought of this C# " automatic boxing " concept .
Now we see this is a just a flawed workaround to a previous language flaw : what it 's really doing is encapsulating ints ( which are now objects ) as records , which was only necessary then because we did n't have a real type theoretic " object " type previously , so if we wanted to pass stuff around polymorphically , we had to stick it in a record .
-
Add a new " type " type , to mean " the type of all types " .
" int " is a value of type " type " , as is " record " , " string " , and so on .
Eliminate " class " .
-
Then , add a metadata framework to allow optionally attaching reflective metadata to records .
This could look a whole lot like the current Java class / reflection approach , but we would stop pretending that classes had something to do with types , and recognize them as optional metadata tacked onto records .

In some places type is a set of values , in others a set of sub types .
The first definition makes sense , but the second might have problems because you seem to then include type as a subtype of type .

Without implying any criticism of his views , here is my view formulated as a response to his post :
A type describes a set of values .
Types are not sets , they are algebras .
The underlying representation , be it a set or a poset or a doowhatsit is irrelevant : all we care about is how it behaves .
A type does n't " contain " any more information than the set of values it describes .
The additional information is the operations supported by the type , and the equations they obey .
Two types are equal if they describe the same set of values , unequal otherwise ( full extensionality ) .
Since we never care about the underlying representation , the values , we never talk about type equality , except trivial equality , but rather type isomorphism : types are isomorphic iff they behave the same way .
In the most basic example , simply typed lambda calculus , there are no operations on types .
The arrow operator is a binary operator on types in simply typed lambda - calculus .
The only way that types are used is to limit the values Types do n't limit values : they enable operations .
Some languages allow dynamic casts , the ability to see whether an arbitrary value , known precisely only at runtime , belogs to a certain type .
Every `value ' belongs to exactly one type , which never changes ; talking about run-time types is meaningless .

> we never talk about type equality , except trivial equality , but rather type isomorphism : types are isomorphic iff they behave the same way .
< This is certainly the mainstream view .
I prefer to see extensional type equality exist and be exposed as a first - class operation , though it 's undecidable in the general case .
( If a compiler is going to accept undecidability in some aspects of typechecking , why not go all the way ? )
Consider finite types , for example .
Do you consider " the type containing just 3 and 7 " to be isomorphic to " the type containing just ' x ' and 'z ' " ?
It 's easy to come up with a bijection between them , as it is between many conceptually different types ( integers and character strings , for example ) .
I do n't think type isomorphism gives you much useful information from a type system perspective .
On the other hand , knowing whether two types are extensionally equal ( or in a subtype relationship ) gives you useful information about which values are allowed in which contexts .
Andrew :
There are logical pitfalls with notions from naieve set theory , such as a universal type ( " the type of all values allowed in the language " ) , a type - of - all - types ( itself a type ) , and Russell 's paradox ( " T is the type containing all types that do n't contain themselves .
Does T contain itself ? " ) .
There are various ways of resolving these problems : -
The simplest is to disallow such constructs entirely , which is sound , but reduces the power of the type system .
For practical programming , it 's really useful to have a universal type ; for dependent - typed programming a " type of all types , itself a type " is very useful .
So foregoing these constructs has a cost .
-
These is a little bit of work on non-wellfounded set theory and related type theories that eliminate the paradoxes by changing the underlying axiom systems .
Applying such systems to programming languages would be quite speculative .
-
Type systems like the one in McAllester 's Ontic paper achieve a middle ground by exposing tiered types that are sound and almost as useful for practical purposes , but have some limitations .
- Finally , if you 've accepted the presence of undecidability in your type checker , you can expose true universal types , while masking the paradoxes behind the vale of undecidability .
For example , you can form a " type containing all types that do n't contain themselves " , and verify that simple types belong to it and that the universal type does n't belong to it , but it 's impossible to decide or prove ( within the type system 's axioms ) whether it belongs to itself .
Not much formal work has been done in this area , but I think it can be made sound , though using such constructs in practice feels quite subversive .

( This is what threw me about embedded and implemented - one is a subset of the other , afaik ) .
So if a ring ( alone ) is a kind , rather than a type , does that mean a Java interface is a kind ( all I mean here is that it 's like a partial type specification and so a way of unifying several types ) ?

( reads : 1899 , responses : 0 ) Tim : Does n't this view deny the existance of subtypes ?
It depends on what you mean by subtype .
It is not hard to formulate a notion of subtype in this framework , but instead of a subtype of A being a subset of A , you have a subtype being an equivalence class of injections into A .
A virtue of this framework is that you can define this notion of subtype for things which are not sets , though .
For example , what one type does the value 7 belong to ?
The type of rational numbers , the type of integers , the type of natural numbers , the universal type ?
That depends : are you talking about the rational number 7 , the integer 7 or the natural number 7 ? :)
In a type system supporting full powerset style subtyping , 7 belongs to , and only to , every type that is a supertype of the type containing just 7 .
Full subtyping can be useful in practical programming .
For example , if you have arrays of fixed length , it 's useful to have " the type of natural numbers less than n " for every n , so that you can index into arrays with the type system guaranteeing indices are in range ( rather than runtime checks that throw exceptions . )
Yes , but my framework can support this .
A difference is that , in your framework the way in which the elements of different - sized arrays are numbered will be fixed by the way you define arrays , whereas in my framework it is a separate concern .
For example , suppose you define character arrays of length n as functions from the naturals less than n to the type char : chararray ( n ) = { 0..n - 1} -> char
Then , since { 0..3 } < { 0..4} , presumably : chararray ( 4 ) < chararray (3 ) Suppose you pass a value of type chararray ( 4 ) to a context expecting a chararray ( 3 ) , which tries to get the first element by applying 0 to the array .
Your array elements have to be numbered the same way for subsumption to work , and this is a global condition which must be respected by all programs .
However , there are many ways of injecting { 0..3} into { 0..4} , corresponding to reordering the indices and forgetting one of them .
In my framework this is additional information which is required to coerce chararray ( 4 ) into a type of chararray ( 3 ) ; alternately , you can omit the information if you are passing to a context which behaves the same way no matter how array indices are chosen to be ordered ( for example , a function which sums the elements ) .
This implies an absolute separation between types and values , which is the norm in most popular type systems .
Yes , it definitely does .
But this separation limits the expressiveness of the type system , and I want to go beyond this and be able to intermix values and types freely , for example in dependent types , type - forming operations , and value extraction operations .
I do n't care about mixing values and types , because that is n't an end in itself .
However , I do want to be able to treat types as if they were values , to do computations with them , and that is possible in my framework .
This can be done soundly , but requires breaking down the " do n't care about underlying values " barrier .
Then you are taking a step backwards modularity - wise .
Concretely : I want to be able to write functions that take any mix of types and values as parameters , and return any mix of types and values as results .
I want to cartesion - dependent - product up types and values in arbitrary ways .
If you have a natural number i , be it statically known or only dynamically known at runtime , I want to be able to form the type of natural numbers less than i , and use it dynamically , for example in runtime casts , and I want the compiler to verify that everything I do is decidable and typesafe .
Well , this is sort of what I want too , but I want to retain the ability to have abstract datatypes .
Consider finite types , for example .
Do you consider " the type containing just 3 and 7 " to be isomorphic to " the type containing just ' x ' and 'z ' " ?
If by `type ' you mean set , then certainly .
I do n't think type isomorphism gives you much useful information from a type system perspective .
Do you think lists are useful ?
Or trees ?
Inductive datatypes in general ?
They are all defined by type isomorphisms .
How about products , sums and function types ?
They are also all defined by isomorphisms , as are continuation types and just about everything else .
On the other hand , knowing whether two types are extensionally equal ( or in a subtype relationship ) gives you useful information about which values are allowed in which contexts .
First , I have a feeling that your extensional equality relation is obtainable from the iso relation by quotienting and making a global choice .
Second , the iso relation gives you less information .
But the iso itself gives you more , because it tells you precisely how values are related .
So , on the contrary , extensional equality gives you less information because it only tells you when two types are represented the same way , not when they are related in a more complicated fashion .
For example , consider polar and cartesian coordinates , different associations or symmetries of a product or sum , curried and uncurried versions of a function type .
Andrew :
So that means that it 's Tim 's set plus operations
It need not be a set .
This is an important fact in practice , actually , since you need to use algebras over things other than sets if you want to allow for non-terminating programs .
Tim 's framework is not limited to sets either ; anything sufficiently " set - like " will do .
Technically , these set - like collections have to form what is called a topos .
A ring by itself is n't a type , but a ring over ( on? of ? ) integers is , for example )
Well , it depends on your type system , of course , but a ring could conceivably be a type in itself , just as polymorphic lists are a type in themselves , and you do n't need to mention the element type .
the alternative would imply that you could add an integer and a polynomial No , it would n't , just like you can't append a list of integers to a list of booleans in ML .
So if a ring ( alone ) is a kind , rather than a type First , it is n't really meaningful to speak of something being a type or a kind in isolation ; you need to specify a type system .
Second , it is n't really meaningful to say that rings are kinds or a types , any more than it is meaningful to say that a `box ' is made of cardboard .
Some boxes are made of cardboard , and some are made of aluminum , but those are n't intrinsic to the notion of `box ' .
[ I just thought of a better analogy .
Is a disc an object in 2 - space or 3 - space ?
To describe a disc , you need at least two dimensions , so you can say it is a 2 - dimensional object , but certainly you can talk of discs existing in 3 - space , provided you give them a certain orientation .
Incidentally , the difference between Tim 's framework and mine can be thought of in these terms .
A value is like a 3 - dimensional object and a type is like a 2 - dimensional object .
He allows computing with values and types in exactly the same way , whereas I require that any type which is used like a value must be equipped with additional information .
The geometric analogy is that he picks a default way of embedding 2D objects in 3 - space , whereas I require an explicit embedding for each object .
He needs to make more global decisions than I do because the default is global . ]
In type frameworks like Tim's , you can speak of rings whose carriers are types and rings whose carriers are values .
( The carrier is the collection of `elements ' : integers , or polynomials , for example . )
On the other hand , in my framework a ring would always be a type .
( Even this is n't entirely true , though .
My framework actually subsumes Tim's , and could admit all his features at the price of desirables like decidability . )
There is an analagous , weaker structure at the kind level called a 2 - rig , though .
does that mean a Java interface is a kind No , in Java , an interface is definitely a type .
Java has no notion of kind , AFAIK .
Tim Sweeney - Re : Python Metaclass Programming
4/25/2003 ; 4:29:48 PM
( reads : 1856 , responses : 1 ) Having these discussions reinforces how much one 's choice of type theory is a matter of opinion and choice rather than " right or wrong " .
Frank :
Ok , let 's see if I understand what you 're advocating .
In your type system , given an integer x , I should be able to compare it to the integer constant 7 , similarly if both are rational numbers .
But if I have an integer x and a rational number y , your compiler would say something like " You ca n't compare integers and rational numbers , because they 're not the same type " ?
So , given an integer x , to convert it to a rational number , you 'd need to call some function ( perhaps in the same module number where the abstract " natural number " type where declared ) to convert it .
I 'm coming from the opposite perspective , where I want type relationships ( like subtyping ) to directly correspond to what people expect in the given domain .
For example , in mathematics , the set inclusion hierarchy between natural numbers , integers , rationals , imaginaries , complex numbers , etc .
I want the type system to directly reflect this , so you can pass integers to functions that expect rationals directly , without any conversions .
This approach need n't prevent one from using abstract types .
It 's actually sound to mix structural subtyping and nominal subtyping in very interesting ways ( though , as far as I 've found , this is quite difficult and not very well studied ) .
What I mean concretely is that you can hide the implementation of " rational numbers " in a module that exposes certain operations ( comparison , arithmetic , etc ) , exposes the constrant that they are a supertype of the integers , yet still hiding their representation type .
So , given such abstract defintions of integers and rationals , you can freely pass integers to functions expecting rationals , but not vice - versa .
However , even if rational numbers are implemented as ( for example ) a pair of integers in some cannonical form ( in lowest terms , etc ) , this fact is hidden outside the module , so that you can't ( for example ) compare a rational number to a naked pair of integers .
With this approach , I think you get the best of both worlds :
You can hide the implementations of things , yet expose the subtyping relationships that users would expect in the problem domain .
The only drawback I 've found to this approach so far is that naked ( non-abstract ) values in this type system can be compared in ways that programmers do n't expect in other languages .
For example , you can write code like " fac ( x : int ) : int= > if x= ' 0 ' then 1 else x* fac ( x - 1 ) " where you 're comparing x to the character ' 0 ' instead of the number 0 , and this is a valid comparison which always evaluates to false .
To be sure this is n't taken out of context , I 'm only proposing this approach from a high - level language point of view .
The programmer would see integers as a subtype of rationals .
When the compiler and linker get down to actually translating such code into efficient runnable form , things are implemented quite traditionally , with inlining , boxing , and conversions / coercions to ( for example ) extend integers into equivalant rational numbers , and so on .
Regarding the array subtyping issue you mention : I 've found practical advantages to exposing both contravariant functions and invariant functions .
Invariant functions behave like arrays from a typing perspective : they can only be equal if their domains are equal .
Contravariance gives you record - style subtyping and the ability to extend a function " + " from integers to rational numbers while maintaining compatibility ( so , for example , you can have " the ring of integers " be a subtype of " the field of rationals " -- great , but contravariance has two big disadvantages : 1 . In a type system that admits some comparisons to be undecidable and some decidable , any values of record or array type built from contravariant functions much necessarily be incomparable , because the domain of any value not known precisely at compile time may be extended in a way that allows returning incomparable values .
So if you build arrays out of contravariant functions , it 's impossible to compare them .
2 . From a user 's perspective , having { 1,2 , " x " ,9.5} <: { 1,2} is not something one expects of arrays .
Invariant functions allow you to write arrays which are guaranteed to be comparable given comparable range and comparable finite domain , and make { 1,2 , " x " ,9.6} distinct from { 1,2} .
Taking this further , you can then have invariant functions be subtypes of identically declared contravariant functions , and think of contravariant functions ( conceptually ) as an infinite union of the identical invariant function with every possible extension of its domain .

It sounds like you 've had some practical experience with your ideas , and I 'm wondering whether this experience was gained on paper on by writing actual executable programs .

( reads : 1660 , responses : 0 ) In your type system , given an integer x , I should be able to compare it to the integer constant 7 , similarly if both are rational numbers .
But if I have an integer x and a rational number y , your compiler would say something like " You ca n't compare integers and rational numbers , because they 're not the same type " ?
Of course it all depends on the type of the function you are using to `compare ' them but , yes , there is generally no default way of comparing values of distinct types for equality .
If I wanted a language which supported such a thing , I would be using assembler .
Put differently , the whole pointing of assigning distinct types to distinct values is that there is no default way of comparing them .
So , given an integer x , to convert it to a rational number , you 'd need to call some function ( perhaps in the same module number where the abstract " natural number " type where declared ) to convert it .
Yes .
But you are looking at it the wrong way .
Why would I want to convert an integer ( let 's say natural instead ) to a rational ?
There must be a larger reason for it , a context , and that context will influence which coercion I want to use .
For example , in some cases I might want the obvious embedding which takes the natural 3 to the rational 3 , but in some other cases I might want the embedding to be Cantor 's diagonalization function ( which takes , as I recall , 3 to 1/2 ) .
I am not really opposed to subtyping per se , and I want to be able to model your `mathematical ' inclusion hierarchy mentioned below .
What I am opposed to is a global subtyping hierarchy , because any such hierarchy is artificial and , as I explain below , I think placing an artificial emphasis on numbers is counterproductive .
In any case , though with simple and well - known kinds of numbers like integers and complex numbers there is a good case for subtyping because of a historical accident , when you get to more exotic , and even not - so - exotic , kinds of data I really think that searching for and instituting one particular coercion as the `default ' one is counterproductive .
For example , here is an example from Paul Taylor 's book ` Practical Foundations ' .
The powerset of a set forms a complete semilattice w.r.t. set inclusion .
By forgetting some of the structure at each step , you can regard such a powerset as a poset , a set and finally a relation ( the equality relation on the set 's elements ) , but every powerset is also equivalent to another relation , the subset membership relation .
Which should be the `default ' ?
There is no obvious choice .
For more exotic structures , the possibilities are even more obscure .
In other words , I do n't think subtyping scales .
I 'm coming from the opposite perspective , where I want type relationships ( like subtyping ) to directly correspond to what people expect in the given domain .
People expect lots of things , some of which are inconsistent , so this is not highest on my list of priorities .
For example , they expect that if they write something like : f :: Int ->
Int f x | x == 0 = 1 | x /=
0 = 2 that the compiler will be able to check that the function is total , yet we know that that is generally undecidable .
For example , in mathematics , the set inclusion hierarchy between natural numbers , integers , rationals , imaginaries , complex numbers , etc .
This hierarchy is overspecified and , I think , old - fashioned and ultimately wrong - headed .
It 's overspecified because , for example , there is nothing intrinsic about the naturals which justifies forcing them to be a subset of the integers , when it is just as good to say that the naturals are isomorphic to such a subset .
It 's old - fashioned because modern algebra has moved from the emphasis of the subject from the study of sets to the study of homomorphisms , and there one no longer finds much benefit in forcing subalgebras to be subsets .
And finally , it 's wrong - headed because ( and this may sound heretical , but bear with me ) no one really cares about numbers themselves : they are just a means to an end .
Here is an example I learned from Paul Taylor ( or maybe it was John Baez ) which illustrates that point , and how numbers are typically used to encode phenomena which can be represented more directly if you recognize the algebraic structure instead .
Suppose I 'm a shepherd and I want to make sure after a day's work that I have n't lost any of my flock .
You might tell me that I should count ( using the natural numbers ) how many I have in the morning and again at night and compare the two numbers for equality .
But do I care about the numbers ?
No , what I care about is that I have as many sheep at the end of the day as I did at the start .
I 'm not a mathematician , I 'm just Joe Q.
Shepherd , I can't even count , and all I want is to make sure I have enough to eat at the end of the month .
To do my job , all I need to do is establish an isomorphism between the flock I had at the morning and the flock I have at night .
By counting my flock in the morning , I am assigning to each sheep a number ; by counting my flock in the evening , I am assigning to each sheep another number .
And note that if I want to regard the equality check as the identity , then I have to make sure I assign the same number to the same sheep both in the morning and at night .
By counting the flocks twice , I am mapping from the morning flock to the natural numbers by conjuring up a linear order , to the natural numbers again via an iso ( which may be the identity ) , and then to my night flock via another artificial linear order .
That is a perfectly correct way of doing things , but not only does it involve an indirection but it also depends on two artificial linear orders which have nothing to do with the problem , only your solution .
You can eliminate one ordering if you regard the equality check as an identity but then again you are overspecifying the problem , because you have to assign the same number to the same sheep both times .
But who cares about how my sheep are numbered ?
Only an accountant .
The direct way to do this is to forget about the natural numbers , and just recognize that what I said at the beginning , that all I need to do is establish an iso between the morning and night flock , is basically saying that a flock of sheep behaves for my purposes algebraically just like a set .
This immediately leads to a solution which does n't require me to know how to count , or remember which sheep is assigned which number : every morning tie a rope to each sheep and tether one end inside the sheep pen ( or to yourself ) ; to check that you have n't lost any sheep , just rein each rope in and untie it until there are no ropes left .
( An eminently constructive solution , do n't you think ? )
So , the point of this story is that , though you may feel that I am complicating things by refusing to identify things unnecessarily , even when they are treated that way traditionally , in fact I think I am doing just the opposite , and treating them more directly .
Just as the shepherd does n't need to know how to count to use this method , a programmer wo n't have to know anything about , say , the theory of ordinals to use a module which implements container objects .
This approach need n't prevent one from using abstract types .
It does n't prevent it , but it is n't sufficient to enable it .
I suspect that the type framework I 've outlined provides almost exactly the additional conditions which are necessary to do that enabling .
In other words , I think that if you generalized your framework to allow any type to be made abstract , you would basically get my framework ( modulo undecidability , which I am not willing to admit ) .
What I mean concretely is that you can hide the implementation of " rational numbers " in a module that exposes certain operations ( comparison , arithmetic , etc ) , exposes the constrant that they are a supertype of the integers , yet still hiding their representation type .
So then you get a type , rational , which is isomorphic to a type , the representation , yet the representation type is not a subtype of rational , or vice versa , so you need to stick in a coercion whenever converting back and forth , so you get the same issue you objected to in my framework .
Regarding the array subtyping issue you mention : I 'm afraid I did n't understand this bit .
How did we get to talking about variance ?
My point was that any choice of a subsumption relation ( which I understand to be the effect of subtyping on values , i.e. , the coercion involved ) artificially restricts the ways you can implement functions which operate on types involved in the subtyping relation .

( reads : 1509 , responses : 2 ) Kimberley :
One researchy attempt along these lines is McAllester 's Ontic ( http://www.autoreason.com/ontic-spec.ps).
Unfortunately I 've never seen any compilers that apply these concepts to real - world programming languages , but I 'm trying to implement one .
My experience so far is that it 's achievable , but is difficult to nail down all of the proper typechecking rules and to model real - world programming constructs ( like inheritance and open - world programming ) from such low - level primitives .
Re counting sheep : Real - world programming is more about sheep than isomorphisms of sheep .
Are two sheep the same sheep ?
Given two sets of sheep , are the sets the same ?
Given a set of sheep and a sheep , does the sheep belong to the set of sheep ?
What elements belong to the set of all subsets of the set of all sheep ?
These are useful concepts for typechecking .
Hiding equality and forcing programmers to deal with explicit isomorphisms is a strictly less useful technique than directly exposing subtyping and type equality .
First , because compilers are capable of pretty impressive verification of subtyping properties , even for really powerful languages ( where , though the general problem is undecidable , there is a very expressive decidable subset of the language ) .
Verifying anything related to isomorphisms is far harder .
Have you tried doing this for serious programming languages ?
In a practical implementation , I think you end up with progammers writing a ton of explicit coercions which are claimed to be isomorphisms but in practice are just a bunch of arbitrary functions the programmer hopes are correct isomorphisms .
Second , because most of practical programming practice today requires subtyping .
Any serious app written in C++ , Java , or C# would become way more verbose if subsumption were explicit , with explicit coercions all over the place .
I mention that my philosophy on this topic is very much a result of studying McAllester 's papers in the past year .
In ( mostly minor ) language work I did in the 15 years previous to that , my thinking was very similar to yours , that in the ideal type system , types are an utterly distinct from values , that concepts like type equality do n't necessarily follow from value equality , etc .
Since then , I 've looked at the basic constructs in McAllester 's paper as the basic building blocks of future type systems : a type - forming " the - set - of - all " construct , an element extraction construct " an-element - of " , types as values , types - of - types available in a structured way ( " a - subset - of " ) , etc .
Sadly the terminology and programming style there tends to obscure the fundamental breakthroughs there .
Re array subtyping :
You had pointed the unnaturalness of " {0..3 } < { 0..4} " leading to the conclusion that " chararray ( 4 ) < chararray ( 3 ) " .
You used it as an example of the arbitrarity of subtyping .
An alternative view is that subtyping is fine , but there are really two different kinds of function - like things , one where a->b <: c->d iff b< :d and c ) where a ~ > b <: c ~>d iff b<:d and c=a .

( reads : 1518 , responses : 1 ) I can see that this discussion is going nowhere and you would need a more concrete exposition to be convinced ( not surprising ) , so this will probably be my last post on this subject here .
Real - world programming is more about sheep than isomorphisms of sheep .
First , " real - world " programming as opposed to what ?
Second , my type system is much closer to the type systems of ML and Haskell , which have been used successfully for many years in practice , than yours , which has only seen serious use in theorem provers , and never been applied to writing larger applications .
Third ( and this is approaching the level of a comedy now , but ) , my little story was not about " isomorphisms of sheep " , which makes no sense , but rather isomorphisms of sets .
Given two sets of sheep , are the sets the same ?
Given a set of sheep and a sheep , does the sheep belong to the set of sheep ?
What elements belong to the set of all subsets of the set of all sheep ?
These are useful concepts for typechecking .
Useful , perhaps , but not sufficient .
For example , the notion of graph isomorphism is more useful than the notion of graph equality because , though one may care about what set of nodes and edges a graph possesses , the point of forming them into a graph is to express a structure which is essentially parametric in the choice of particular representatives for nodes and edges , namely the adjacencies .
Equality , membership and containment of objects are problems one wants to solve when the objects involved are values .
But when the objects involved possess additional structure , as is the case with `collections ' of inter-related objects such as types , the problems one needs to solve naturally become more complex .
This is a well - established principle not only in semantics and category theory , but also in physics and topology .
But , believe me , I know that programmers and even many type theorists are not comfortable with it .
Hiding equality and forcing programmers to deal with explicit isomorphisms is a strictly less useful technique than directly exposing subtyping and type equality .
First , I am not necessarily saying that equality is unavailable , but rather that the equalities which are imposed on types are all trivial .
However , I suppose that from your point of view this is the same thing , because the equalities you regard as intrinsic I regard as extrinsic .
Hence you speak of " exposing " subtyping , whereas I regard it as " imposing " .
Second , I believe that in my framework I could also force extra equalities as you do , without compromising the ability to deal with things up to iso , but then I would end up with the same undecidability issues as you .
So , if you prefer , you can tack on the additional equalities in a hypothetical implementation .
( However , if I ever implement such a thing , it will likely be the last feature I add . )
Third , and most importantly , the point is absolutely not to force programmers to deal explicitly with isomorphisms .
Indeed , just the opposite .
It is in your framework that all isomorphisms must be dealt with explicitly ; to compensate for this fact , you try to avoid the need to deal with them by rendering them as equalities whenever possible ( and it is n't always possible , BTW ) , and consequently you end up limiting your choices of representations and stumbling into undecidability problems .
In contrast , in my framework the type checker is aware of a certain class of type transformations which preserve a certain class of polymorphic isos which are inferrible from their typings .
For example , the iso ( which I am sure is not an equality even in your framework ) : forall a , b , c. ( a * b ) * c -> a * ( b * c)
Because these isos are inferrible from types , they can be inserted automatically by the type checker , and hence behave as if they were type equations .
Because they are uniquely determined , the language of types behaves as if it were an equational language , and consequently one can compute with types as if they were values , though they are not .
The price of this is that , if you want to force a type to have a particular representation , you must insert an iso explicitly : obviously , because you need to specify which representation you wish .
OTOH , it becomes possible to write code which operates uniformly over all isomorphic representations , so if you never force a particular rep , or only force a rep at the " beginning " or " end " of your code , you are hardly paying any price at all .
First , because compilers are capable of pretty impressive verification of subtyping properties , even for really powerful languages ( where , though the general problem is undecidable , there is a very expressive decidable subset of the language ) .
Verifying anything related to isomorphisms is far harder .
Sure , checking whether two objects are isomorphic is more difficult than checking if they are equal .
That 's partly why it 's a problem worth tackling .
Have you tried doing this for serious programming languages ?
It has already been done for polymorphic lambda - calculus .
The problem is not computing the isos , but rather figuring out how to factor them out of the rest of the type system .
So far , I can do it for non-commutative linear languages , and I think I now see how to do it for intuitionistic ones like simply - typed lambda - calculus .
From there the step to polymorphic lambda - calculi will probably not be too difficult .
In a practical implementation , I think you end up with progammers writing a ton of explicit coercions which are claimed to be isomorphisms but in practice are just a bunch of arbitrary functions the programmer hopes are correct isomorphisms .
No , the isos are not implemented by the programmer ; they are generated by the compiler , since they are computable from the types , if you are careful to design your type system suitably .
I am not interested in all isos , anyway : only a certain class called coherence morphisms .
The idea of trusting programmers to write correct code is too horrible to contemplate .
It has never been part of my plan ; the whole idea for the type system is partly founded on the fact that these isos are computable .
Second , because most of practical programming practice today requires subtyping .
Because the only languages practitioners use are ones which make subtyping mechanisms convenient , and alternative mechanisms inconvenient , and because practitioners are only taught how to exploit subtyping mechanisms .
Any serious app written in C++ , Java , or C# would become way more verbose if subsumption were explicit , with explicit coercions all over the place .
Do n't program in C++ , Java or C# with explicit coercions then .
I would n't try doing higher - order functional programming in these languages either .
Clearly you are fixated on subtyping , but you should know by now that I am not .
I am not particularly fond of subtyping for the reasons I 've already indicated , though I 'm willing to use it where it makes sense .
I did OO programming for several years ( in industry ) , and have taught Java to students , but I 've been programming for many years now in languages like ML and Haskell and have found few cases where exploiting subtyping would have led to a genuinely better program .
So I do n't really find arguments predicated on the idea that subtyping must be ubiquitous convincing , especially when subtyping does not preserve behavior .
I mention that my philosophy on this topic is very much a result of studying McAllester 's papers in the past year .
In ( mostly minor ) language work I did in the 15 years previous to that , my thinking was very similar to yours , that in the ideal type system , types are an utterly distinct from values , that concepts like type equality do n't necessarily follow from value equality , etc .
Then your experience is opposite to mine , since when I started getting interested in PL theory I also thought that dependent types were the bee 's knees , but as I got deeper into the subject and more widely read , and in particular when I started getting into non-elementary category theory , I realized that there are more subtle and practical alternatives which ( I was surprised to learn [ and continues to surprise me ] ) fit quite well with extant type systems like ML's , which are used in practice .
Nowadays , dependent types and impredicativity are used like a sledgehammer .
Whenever someone runs into a problem with their type system , immediately you hear , " ... but this problem could be solved with dependent types . "
( The same sort of situation holds for partial evaluation . )
For example , for years people thought that to support printf in a typesafe way required dependent types ; then Olivier Danvy published Functional Unparsing .
The number of situations in which dependent types are genuinely required gets smaller every year .
It 's really not so different from the phenomenon wherein dynamic typing advocates complain of the restrictiveness of static type systems .
Because they sense ( perhaps correctly ) that one type system is inadequate for expressing a particular solution , they declaim static type systems altogether .
Every static type system will be inadequate for some particular program ; we know that .
But the depths of even relatively restrictive type systems like that of , say , core ML ( compared to full ML ) , are not plumbed by most applications written in a conventional style , though if you try to carry in conventions like optional arguments from dynamic languages , you are certain to run into problems .
A change of mindset to some degree is necessary .
I think the same situation exists vis -a - vis your framework and mine .
Undoubtedly my framework is inadequate in some way ( actually , I can think of one now ) that your framework can handle , since decidable type checking ( and inference ) restricts a system 's expressiveness in some way .
But , if you changed your techniques a little bit and thought about programming problems a bit differently , I think you would find the limitations are not so great in practice .
Since then , I 've looked at the basic constructs in McAllester 's paper as the basic building blocks of future type systems : a type - forming " the - set - of - all " construct , an element extraction construct " an-element - of " , types as values , types - of - types available in a structured way ( " a - subset - of " ) , etc .
Sadly the terminology and programming style there tends to obscure the fundamental breakthroughs there .
Maybe I do n't know all the details , and I only glanced through McAllester 's paper , but frankly I have yet to see any way in which your system differs significantly from existing dependent type systems like the Calculus of Constructions .
( The nondeterminism aspect in McAllester 's paper seems novel , but you have n't mentioned that bit . )
If you want to do programming with dependent types , you can do it today , with systems like Coq , LEGO , Yarrow or Cayenne .
Yarrow even supports subtyping .
They are n't industrial - strength compilers , but surely you can prototype with them and test your ideas .
I think you will find that dependent typing is better in theory than in practice .
The system I 've been describing , OTOH , would be genuinely new .
It 's largely based on ideas from cutting - edge research in higher - dimensional weak category theory , developed by some of the smartest people in the world , and has yet to bubble down through the computer science community .
Some of that work has even been motivated by issues in the dependent type systems above , though you will have to wade through reams of category theory to discover that fact .
It also has real applications in other fields , like physics and topology , which shows that it is a robust idea .
You had pointed the unnaturalness of " {0..3 } < { 0..4} " leading to the conclusion that " chararray ( 4 ) < chararray ( 3 ) " .
You used it as an example of the arbitrarity of subtyping .
An alternative view is that subtyping is fine , but there are really two different kinds of function - like things , one where a->b <: c->d iff b<:d and c<:a , and the other ( call it ~ > ) where a ~ > b <: c ~>d iff b<:d and c=a .
So you are saying that you want an array of b's indexed by a to be a " function - like thing " of type a ~ >b?
Then you would get no subtyping relationship between chararray ( 3 ) and chararray ( 4 ) at all .
How is that an argument for subtyping ?
Because it eliminates consideration of the " unnaturalness " I mentioned ?
I would rather have a system which was unnatural in the way I mentioned than one which puts arbitrary restrictions on array subtyping .
Or is there another reason you want to restrict the variance of arrays which I did n't get ?
I still do n't understand things like this ( for example ) : Invariant functions behave like arrays from a typing perspective : they can only be equal if their domains are equal .
I think you are confusing the variance of -> with the variance of its values .
The type of updateable arrays has to be invariant in the type of elements but contravariant in the type of indices / domain , precisely the opposite of your ~ >.
( N.B . I did not assume that chararrays are updateable in my earlier post . )
This means that the type of updateable arrays of elements of type b and indices of type a is a subtype of the function type a ->b.
This has nothing to do with the variance of a function used to represent a non-updateable array , which information presupposes that the indices and elements themselves carry an order , which is sensible for the indices , of course since they are usually linearly ordered , but not generally the case for the elements .

This has been a very useful discussion for my understanding of type system decisions .
I 'm not making these arguments because I 'm confident you 're wrong , but because I 'm worried that I 'm wrong .
I 've definitely encountered the broad outlines of the problems you mention , of naked equality ( where 3 = 'x ' is a valid comparison , a useful degree of typechecking is lost ) , and of dependent types often being an unnecessarily complex solution to certain problems .
Just a few quick notes : >>
So you are saying that you want an array of b's indexed by a to be a " function - like thing " of type a ~ > b? << Yes . >>
Then you would get no subtyping relationship between chararray ( 3 ) and chararray ( 4 ) at all .
<< Right ; this one point is certainly sound and not speculative .
It turns out this is what you want for arrays , because given an array a ~ > b where a is a bounded natural number type , one of the fundamental operations you want need is length - extraction .
If the domain is invariant , then you can decidably extract the length of any array value .
With this invariant domain approach , you can precisely specify the type of a 7 - character array as " ( x:nat < 7 ) - > char " , or an unknown - length array of characters precisely as ( exists y: nat ) . ( x: nat <y ) -> char .
If the domain where contravariant , domain extraction would be more subtle ( because the domain could be expanded to be anything ) , and array comparison would be undecidable .
Continuing this exercise , we have -> for modelling contravariant - domain functions , and ~ > for modelling invariant - domain arrays .
What is the covariant - domain version of this ?
From the subtyping rule , it 's the dependent - pair type constructor ! >>
How is that an argument for subtyping ?
Because it eliminates consideration of the " unnaturalness " I mentioned ?
<<
This does n't do much to sell subtyping , it just counters the ( true ) argument that " modelling arrays as contravariant - domain functions leads to unnatural results " by providing a natural , subtyping - friendly way of modelling arrays .
Of course , as you point out , the big argument against subtyping is n't this , but that subtyping can be regarded as an arbitrary imposition , especially when viewed from a category theory point of view ( as opposed to a types - as - sets - of - values point of view ) .
One final note with regard to subtyping : in a framework like Ontic , it 's not really possible to avoid subtyping , because types do n't exist as a separate concept , but only as " quoted " ( the - set - of - all ) nondeterministic collections of potential values .
From a categorical / iso point of view , I suppose this is heresy , but it seems the most powerful and natural way of modelling types if one takes a types - as - sets - of - values point of view .
I will definitely try to rekindle this argument in the future when I can present something much more concrete .

This has been a very useful discussion for my understanding of type system decisions .
I 'm not making these arguments because I 'm confident you 're wrong , but because I 'm worried that I 'm wrong .
It 's big of you to say that .
As I recall , you 're in the games industry ( is this you ? ) , and I applaud anyone working in the programming industry who takes a serious interest in advanced programming languages ( not least because I hate buggy games and the modern release - then - patch - ad - infinitum style of software development :) .
I have the advantage now that I can spend all my time studying and thinking about this stuff and also bounce ideas of other people who are interested and knowledgeable about PL theory , but I know how hard it is to be an autodidact , since I also got into PL theory when I was still in industry .
So , my hat 's off to you .
It turns out this is what you want for arrays , because given an array a ~ > b where a is a bounded natural number type , one of the fundamental operations you want need is length - extraction .
If the domain is invariant , then you can decidably extract the length of any array value .
It seems a odd to have to fix the variance of the function type just to support length extraction , but OK .
Still , your representation of arrays seems rather complex .
If it were me , working in your system , I would start with the obvious fact that an array of b's of length n should be representable as an n - fold product of b' , where b' is isomorphic to b .
( The iso probably needs to be there if you want to nest arrays . )
Then I would write a function which takes any type and returns its " length " n as a value , and conversely a function which takes a natural and a type b and converts it to a type , an n- fold product of b' .
And finally implement the projections and tuplings .
From a categorical / iso point of view , I suppose this is heresy , but it seems the most powerful and natural way of modelling types if one takes a types - as - sets - of - values point of view .
Category theory is not a religion , so there is no possibility of heresy . :)
CT is perfectly adequate for treating types up - to - equality , though it is not the preferred way of handling things , and indeed there is no shortage of categorical models of dependent type systems .
Ehud : Could you summarize ( with bullets ... ) how what you envision is different than the type systems in current functional languages ?
Probably not .
If I had a clearer idea , I would already have an implementation running .
At the moment , what I know is : there is a redundancy in ML - style type systems which can be factored out , shifting a burden on the programmer to one on the compiler .
the redundancy is that certain isos are inferrible .
eliminating the redundancy permits writing programs at the type level in a way analagous to programs at the value level .
eliminating the redundancy does n't compromise existing semantic features of an ML - like language , but may change the syntax ( so I am not 100 % sure it can be formulated as a backwards - compatible extension ) .
eliminating the redundancy probably involves introducing a primitive notion of `structure ' , which is a collection of values , collectively typed by an environment .
certain lawful datatypes ( datatypes which satisfy invariants ) can be expressed declaratively as programs on types .
The type of a type is a kind , so these are actually datakinds ; certain functions between these kinds model rewrites of a normalizing rewrite system which implements the laws / invariants .
linearity and monads are essential concepts for realizing this semantically , but might be avoidable in the syntax .

In my experimental compiler and type system , I have arrays and n- fold products not only being isomorphic but identical : they are extensional , invariant - domain functions from natural numbers less than some bound to the product 's type .
In the case of uniformly typed products , these are simple functions , and in the case of arbitrary products ( say int* string * char ) , they are dependent - typed functions .
The theory of the all this is debatable , but it does work nicely from a practical programming point of view .
Here 's a quick view of this in my actual syntax ( a blend of C constructs with Pascal - style declarations , in other words very non-Haskell / ML style ) .
The type of functions from integers to integers .
( : int ) : int A function from integers to integers .
( x:int ) x+3
Same as above , but with an optional type declaration .
( x:int ) : int=>x+3
The type of functions from natural numbers in the range 0..3 to integers .
( x:nat < 4 ) : int
An actual function like the above .
( x:nat < 4 ) : int= >x+7 Recursive function .
f( x:int ) : int= > if x=0 then 1 else x *f( x - 1 )
The type of arrays of 4 integers .
Arrays are like functions , but the domains subtype invariantly , and they evaluated and typed extensionally .
[ : nat < 4 ] : int Alternate syntax for the same thing .
{:int , : int , :int , :int}
You can give the elements of the array names .
{x: int , y: int , z:int , w:int} A concrete array of 4 integers .
{ 3,6,9,12} Equivalant way of expressing the above .
Like lambdas , but for arrays .
[ x :nat < 4 ] x * 3
A non-uniform array type .
{x: int , y : string} Equivalant way of expressing that .
Note type - dependence .
[ i :nat < 2 ] if i=0 then :int else : string Combining some of the above : A function from 2 - element arrays of integers to integers .
( x:int , y:int ) : int= > ( x - 1 ) * ( y - 1 ) Arrays can have recursive value dependence .
See Hickey 's " Very Dependent Types " paper for elaboration .
For example , { 4,2} is an element of this type and { 5,6} is not .
{x : nat , y : nat < x} Equivalant to the above .
f{:nat , : nat < f [ 0 ] }
Equivalant to the above .
f[ i : nat < 2 ] if i=0 then :nat else : nat < f [ 0 ]
The type of all pythagorean triples .
{ x:nat , y:nat , z:nat=sqrt(x*x+y*y ) }
My thinking here is that , without diverging too much from mainstream applications programming language style , you can gain remarkably more statically typecheckable expressiveness by unifying some of the constructs .
Java / C# notions of functions , arrays , structs , and open - world objects are all represented as different sorts of functions differing in domain variance , extensionality , and dependence .
Evren Anil died from a head injury
Evren Anil , 23 , died eight days after being punched by a teenager who tossed a half - eaten chocolate bar into his sister 's car in south - east London .
Detective Chief Inspector Cliff Lyons said : " People are entitled to challenge these yobs ' behaviour . "
Five people have been bailed over the attack in Crystal Palace on 5 August .
Mr Anil , 23 , of Upper Norwood , south - east London , fell into a coma soon after hitting his head on the pavement during the attack , and died on Tuesday .
Your life is worth more than a chocolate bar
DCI Cliff Lyons
DCI Lyons , who is leading the murder investigation , said : " We have got a 23 - year - old university graduate starting his way in life , with a new job and a close - knit family .
" He challenges their behaviour and this is what happens .
" When they produced the knife he tried to get back in the car .
Your life is worth more than a chocolate bar . "
Mr Anil was in the front passenger seat when the pair threw rubbish through an open window as the car waited at traffic lights on Central Hill .
Police said an elderly passer - by intervened when the youths produced a knife , but that person left the scene when the blade was put to his throat .
The passer - by then alerted the emergency services .
I would not wish this upon anyone else
Elif Anil
Mr Anil 's sister Elif told BBC London : " What I and my family have been through , I can't describe it .
It 's very hard , very hard .
" I would not wish this upon anyone else .
And this needs to be sorted out . "
Both suspects , who were described as being black and in their late teens , ran off into the nearby Central Hill Estate .
Her brother had recently graduated with a first class degree in computer science from Kingston University .
DCI Lyons said there were people in the local community who knew the identity of the killers but had refused to come forward .
He said : " But we are not talking about a stolen bottle of whisky off the back of a lorry .
We are talking about a young man 's life . "
Mr Anil 's cousin , Mehmet Aray , said : " We have got youngsters running riot on our streets , carrying knives .
" But it is normal for us now .
It is just another part of our lives . "
College :
You finally made it .
But now that you 're here , how should you spend your first few weeks at school ?
By filling up the hard drive of your brand - new Toshiba R500 with loads of music and video files , that 's how .
By harnessing the full file - sharing power of a high - speed , university - class network .
But how ?
Is it safe ?
Legal ?
Faster than asking your parents to burn a few DVDs and put them into their monthly care package ?
Excellent questions – the mark of a true student .
Welcome to File Sharing 101 .
How to Get What You Want
Assuming you 've got your machine connected to the internet and cleaned of viruses and spyware , it 's time to choose a network .
Heard of Napster or BitTorrent ?
Both are peer - to - peer networks through which your computer , equipped with the proper software , can find files to download .
The actual file transfers happen between your computer and other computers using protocols that distribute the file - sharing load among all the computers , or " peers , " on the network .
There are several networks , and for each one , a wide variety of clients ( the software that runs on your computer ) that will let you connect and share files .
Network choice is important because it determines how much privacy you have and how much you have to share in return for obtaining access .
We recommend two : BitTorrent and Direct Connect , plus a third option – one - click hosting services – for the truly paranoid .
( Educating yourself about legal issues is an important part of your research .
Check the second page of this article for more information on the risks involved before you dive in . )

BitTorrent
As a true P2P network without a central server to be sued , raided by police or otherwise confiscated , there 's little chance of BitTorrent ever being shut down .
The protocol 's great popularity means there 's no shortage of juicy intellectual property to fill every last perpendicularly stored bit your hard drive has to offer .
Be prepared to Google for your content : Before you can start downloading , you 'll need to find trackers ( which list files that are available through BitTorrent ) , and most trackers are hosted on websites that are just as likely to be shut down as their centralized P2P counterparts .
( One possible exception : The Pirate Bay , which is based in copy - friendly Sweden , has so far resisted legal efforts aimed at its destruction and has recently announced that it will revive Suprnova , an now - defunct search engine for torrent trackers . )
WIRED
The more popular a file , the faster the download .
Lots of legal content is available as well .
TIRED
No anonymity – anyone downloading the same file can see your IP address .
No incentive to share content means niche files may never finish downloading .
Ads ( some for explicit content ) plague many tracker sites .
Many colleges block BitTorrent traffic .
Recommended clients : uTorrent ( Windows ) or Transmission ( Mac )
How to get your content : Search the BitTorrent Download Guide , The Pirate Bay , TorrentBox , Torrentspy and TorrentReactor , or use Google searches with your search term plus the phrase filetype : torrent to locate files you can download .
Direct Connect
Relying on central hubs for indexing purposes , Direct Connect is somewhat risky business for college students who seek large quantities of internet content .
Every new public hub you visit is one more that might reveal your queries and the files you 're sharing .
However , over a high - speed local area network ( like the one running through the walls of your dorm ) Direct Connect 's weakness becomes its greatest strength .
Set up a private hub with university - limited IP ranges and password protection , and you have yourself a bona fide darknet capable of transfer speeds that put BitTorrent to shame .
WIRED Serious darknet potential allows for speedy sharing and privacy – outsiders need to be on the same LAN and have the password to snoop effectively .
Simple search feature finds what you want fast , assuming it 's there .
You can browse through each user 's shares individually .
Get to know your dorm mates better using integrated chat .
TIRED
Cut off from the outside , darknet content quickly gets stale .
There 's also the inherent dilemma of whom to invite :
More users mean more shared files , but also a greater chance that the password will leak to the wrong individual .
Direct Connect is slow and unsafe over the public internet .
Recommended clients : DC ++ ( Windows ) , Valknut ( multiple platforms )
How to get your content :
Set up your own hub and invite your friends to join , or bribe the existing nerd ringleaders with your HD DVD collection .
One - Click Hosting
When privacy is at a premium and download speed does n't matter , it 's hard to beat one - click hosting services like Megaupload , RapidShare and Sendspace .
Upload your file to the server , send a friend the URL and you 're done .
Pick a hosting solution outside the United States , and you may even be able to evade the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
WIRED Simple sharing has maximum privacy .
TIRED Registration is often required .
Maximum file - size limits are common .
It 's often faster to carry a flash drive to your on - campus friends .
How to get your content : Reach out and IM someone you know .
Legal Risks
Legal interpretations may vary about what constitutes legitimate sharing of copyrighted content , and we 're not lawyers .
Sharing a few music clips with your friends may not violate copyright law , but distributing the latest Hollywood blockbuster to 30,000 other fans almost certainly does .
So give some thought to your file sharing before you start .
While one - click hosting is fairly private at the moment and darknets keep content away from prying eyes , it 's all for naught if your university actively monitors traffic and is determined to shut down peer - to - peer activity .
We recommend you check your college 's " acceptable use policy " and similar documents to determine their position on file sharing before engaging in potentially illegal activity , or at least make sure you save three grand , the going rate , in case you get caught .
For the legal perspective , go right to the source : the United States Copyright Office FAQ .

It makes me shudder to think that this dangerous knowledge is now unleashed on the world . . . .
Another caveat is to be careful of reflective surfaces .
When using this , you may instinctively avoid pointing it directly at yourself or another person , but you might hit some unnoticed shiny surface and bounce enough energy into someone 's eye to cause trouble .
Also , while a limited exposure may not " blind " you , it will probably kill off small bits of your retina each time .
Your brain will do some error - correction so you wo n't really notice it , but repeated damage will have a cumulative effect .
Please be careful .
On another note , what I 'd really want would be a combined red " pointer " laser with a " burning " laser .
I could then get a lock on a small target ( a cockroach or a fly sitting still ) , then activate the burning laser to kill it .
Maybe a timed switch would prevent me from messing up my aim when I make the switch over .
So , find the insect , press the timer switch to activate the pointer for 5 seconds .
Lock on the insect in that time and hold still .
Burn the insect when the DVD laser kicks in for some predetermined time .
Many invertebrates , including insects , are unable to see red light , and so are not disturbed by a red laser pointer .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush should announce on September 15 a small initial pullout of U.S. troops from Iraq to spur the Iraqi government to take steps toward political reconciliation , an influential Republican senator said on Thursday .
Virginia Sen. John Warner said Bush should “ announce on the 15th that in consultation with our senior military commanders he has decided to initiate the first step in a withdrawal of our forces . ”
Warner , a senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee who has pressed Bush to change his Iraq policy , suggested a withdrawal of “ say 5,000 ” troops , who could be home by Christmas in December of this year .
Warner said the United States needed “ to show that we mean business ” when it says its commitment to Iraq is not open ended .
He spoke following his return from an Iraq visit and after the release of a U.S. intelligence estimate projecting that political progress in Iraq would remain elusive over the next year .
The report said the position of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ’s government would become more precarious .
Warner said he did not advocate “ rapid pullout ” from Iraq and pointed out he had voted against any timetable for withdrawal .
Congress has asked for a progress report on Iraq by September 15 .
U.S. troops had delivered on their commitment to enhance security in Baghdad and elsewhere , but Maliki ’s government had “ let our troops down , ” Warner said .
He said he could not go “ as far ” as Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan who called for Maliki to be replaced .
Three boarding school students strangled two younger boys in hopes the school would cancel classes after the deaths , police in India alleged on Saturday .
The three male students , aged 12 and 13 , confessed to strangling the brothers , aged eight andfive , said S. Sethi , a police officer in the Jalna district , about 320 kilometres east of Mumbai .
" When questioned , the boys said they knew this school gave a holiday when a child had died last year and thought they could get another holiday this year , " Sethi said .
Police allege the three boys lured the two younger boys so they could kill them , and dragged their bodies to an unused washroom .
The bodies were discovered the following day when their older sister reported them missing .
An autopsy confirmed the two boys had been strangled , Sethi said .
Tommy spends most of his time writing and drawing
Now , Tommy , 54 , spends every moment he can drawing , sculpting and writing poetry .
Tommy 's stroke appeared to unlock his creative side .
This phenomenon is extremely rare , with only two other cases of " sudden artistic output " following brain injury documented worldwide .
Tommy 's stroke was caused by two small bleeds in both sides of his brain known as subarachnoid haemorrhages
Surgeons at Fazakerly Hospital in Liverpool repaired the bleeds using a clip and a coil .
Creative compulsion
Ten days later , Tommy returned home with " a woman they said was my wife " .
Tommy said he was jumbled and confused for the first few weeks after the operation .
" I did n't know much about who I was and what I was .
My brain was n't telling me I was hungry , I was talking in relentless rhymes .
Everything was a rhyme . "
I just plough into it , finish it , move away and then go and maybe make a clay head .
Tommy McHugh
Unable to understand him , his ex-wife who was caring for him at the time gave Tommy a pen and paper and asked him to write down what he meant .
" I started writing poetry in rhymes about what I was experiencing .
The personalities I was living with at the time were revolving like a chamber in a gun , " he said .
Tommy began to draw pencil sketches and felt tip drawings in the hundreds .
This was followed by large - scale pastel drawings on the walls of his house and by sculpture in a number of different media .
" I 'd spend 10 hours doing a mural on a wall thinking it was only 10 seconds , " he said .
Tommy describes his thinking as split minded .
" It 's like memories are jigsaw patterns for me .
I can get a bit of it and fit it together and it will fall apart .
It 's like standing on the edge of a cliff with the brick underneath your feet crumbling . "
He says his creativity is the same .
" It 's like Mount Etna exploding .
Fairy liquid bubbles of intelligence and they are popping around me all the time - grabbing one and trying to remember it before it floats away , popping .
" I just plough into it , finish it , move away and then go and maybe make a clay head .
I finish that and go and play with a bit of stone , come back and do another picture , sit down and write a poem , get up and make a butterfly out of birds ' feathers . "
Tommy said his personality also changed following the stroke .
Personality change
Before the stroke he led what he calls a violent life , with a long history of heroin addiction .
Now , Tommy says he is in touch with his feminine side and is happier now .
" I like what I 'm being , what I am .
I 'm happy being the Tommy I am now , not the Tommy people remember .
" Whatever happened inside my brain I find it absolutely fantastic , " he said .
Dr Mark Lythgoe , neurophysiologist at University College London said : " It may be that the brain damage that Tommy has sustained has caused disinhibition of brain pathways , allowing Tommy 's creativity to surface .
" Perhaps , whatever was keeping his artistic talents hidden or dormant has been damaged just enough to allow them to pour through .
Somewhere , it seems , a floodgate has been opened .
" We are still a long way from understanding the brain bases of the artistic drive , but we hope that by studying rare and intriguing cases like Tommy's , we might get a glimpse of what could be going on , " he said .
Dr Lythgoe is due to publish a paper about Tommy McHugh this year along with psychologists Tom Pollak and Michelle de Haan .
Mr Pollak said : " We have tested Tommy on a large variety of neuropsychological tests in the hope that we might be able to get an idea of what has been happening in his brain . "
He 'll make things out of anything .
If you sit him in a room he 'll be making something out of a paper cup while you are talking to him
Marion Kalmus , international artist and Artist in Residence at the Institute of Child Health
Tommy 's art has been exhibited at various local libraries and galleries and he has begun to make something of a name for himself as a local artist .
Marion Kalmus , international artist and Artist in Residence at the Institute of Child Health , is conducting an analysis of the evolution of Tommy 's artwork since he started producing .
" He 'll make things out of anything .
If you sit him in a room he 'll be making something out of a paper cup while you are talking to him , " she said .
" It 's not that it gave him tremendous technical abilities - he 's not become Leonardo da Vinci or anything like that .
" It 's all very passionate and done very quickly .
It 's like a compulsion , like a volcano .
Many artists experience their creative moments in the same way , " she said .
Tommy and Dr Lythgoe will discuss Tommy 's changes at the Science Museum 's Dana Centre in London on Thursday as part of an evening of events dedicated to exploring the creative mind .
To the Army 's 1st Information Operations Command , the " media " is just another threat – along with " al Qaeda , " " hackers , " and " drug cartels . "

No wonder the Army has put out new rules that could very well kill the sites off .

TUCKER , Ga. --
Ripping open one of four waist - high cardboard boxes on a cargo bay here , Steve Ekin pulled out corkscrews , pocketknives and assorted hand tools before finding an electric impact drill as long as his arm .
" You 'd think people would know better , " he said .
The original price tag , still on the drill , read $ 170 .
Mr. Ekin planned to sell it for about $ 15 at a store opened last October in a warehouse district northeast of Atlanta .

CLIMATE CHANGE is about to move from the headlines into the personal lives of Californians .
While scientists continue to debate the probabilities of various worst - case scenarios — a 31 - inch rise in sea level or an 8 - degree jump in average temperatures by the year 2100 — few dispute that we face a future of potentially catastrophic environmental conditions if the proliferation of greenhouse gases is n’t checked .
In contrast to the federal government , which only recently recognized the human element in climate change after years of denial , state and local governments , as well as regional agencies , are devising policies that address global warming .
Much of this activity is spurred by lawsuits and lobbying by environmental organizations that seek to compel public agencies to consider climate change when making decisions on land use , transportation projects , energy production and other issues .
In California , seven high - profile suits have been filed , mostly by the Center for Biological Diversity , a nonprofit organization based in Arizona .
All challenge the legitimacy of environmental impact reports and permit approvals that do not analyze the effects that proposed developments might have on global warming .
Most recently , the center , joined by the California attorney general , sued for that reason to block implementation of San Bernardino County ’s long - range land - use plan governing development , road construction , utility services and related issues .
Developers , business groups , energy producers , water agencies and local governments are all trying to get out in front of the lawsuits and expected legislation on global warming .
They recall the years of struggling to catch up with previous waves of environmental regulation , such as the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act .
So far , California has led the way nationally with passage of a law requiring the rate of greenhouse gas emissions in the state to be cut to the 1990 level by 2020 , a 25 % reduction .
Climate change will create uncertainty and conflict on a variety of fronts in California .
Home construction will become more difficult and costly as its effects on climate change become a factor in the approval process .
Already , the Center for Biological Diversity and the Natural Resources Defense Council have challenged three large residential projects in Riverside County and the Sacramento River Delta because the agencies that approved them did not consider their effects on global warming .
If such suits prevail , developers will need to learn quickly how to minimize the climate change effects — the “ carbon footprint ” — of their projects by making them more energy efficient , less traffic generating and less dependent on water , among other things .
Otherwise , they may face years of litigation , resulting in higher costs for some projects and abandonment of others .
If sea levels rise 8 to 31 inches over this century , as predicted by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , and if severe ocean storms become more common , as groups such as the Global Business Network have warned , development along California ’s coast will be further restricted or stopped altogether , in the same way it is occurring in the hurricane - prone Southeastern states .
California ’s legendary water wars will intensify as parts of the state compete for reduced supplies caused by global warming .
A study published by the National Academy of Sciences predicts higher temperatures and less precipitation inland , resulting in a reduced snowpack in the Sierra and diminished runoff that feeds the state ’s rivers , lakes and reservoirs .
A study by the National Research Council expresses similar concerns about the Colorado River , a major water source for Southern California .
Even though changing weather patterns are expected to increase coastal rainfall , a serious shortage of storage capacity there will allow much of the water to escape into the Pacific .
A federal court in Sacramento has already blocked increased water deliveries from the Sacramento delta to the Central Valley and Southern California , saying the plan failed to address scientific predictions of reduced water supplies because of global warming and how that would affect the habitats of endangered species .
California law requires developers of large housing projects to demonstrate the availability of long - term water supplies for those projects , and state lawmakers are proposing even tougher rules .
The state Supreme Court recently halted development of a 6,000 - acre community outside Sacramento because its developers could not guarantee water sources .
If projections of less water availability because of global warming turn out to be true , this and similar developments may be a thing of the past .
The power shortages that Californians endured in 2001 are likely to become commonplace as rising temperatures produce more frequent heat waves , boosting the demand for air conditioning .
Unfortunately , existing electricity plants , especially those burning coal , are among the foremost generators of greenhouse gases .
Tougher energy - efficiency standards in construction , better insulation and requirements for fluorescent lighting will help reduce demand for electricity .
But until alternative energy sources fill the power gap , climate change will further strain power supplies and sharply raise living costs .
The hotter , drier weather will greatly reduce — or even shut off — access to such popular recreational areas as the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains because of the heightened risk of wildfires .
Just how dangerous it can be living in urban areas close to parklands was recently demonstrated by the Griffith Park and Catalina Island blazes .
Fire officials already are placing stricter controls on development in such fire - prone areas , meaning that communities such as Lake Arrowhead and Idyllwild probably wo n’t see more housing or tourist facilities .
The Legislature is considering nearly 60 bills on global warming issues .
The most prominent ones would require climate change analyses in water supply and transportation planning .
The governor ’s office is drawing up regulations to implement the law mandating cuts in greenhouse gases .
Meantime , the current lawsuits are heading toward decisions , and more suits will surely be filed .
However it all plays out , land - use policy and development in California will be forever changed .
Rush Limbaugh has made so many racist and borderline racist comments throughout his career , that it should n't come as a big surprise when he goes way over the line .
But it 's still jarring to hear it .
After all , this is man who told an African - American caller , " Take that bone out of your nose and call me back . "
Who said , " Have you ever noticed how all composite pictures of wanted criminals resemble Jesse Jackson ? "
Then later said , " The NAACP should have riot rehearsal .
They should get a liquor store and practice robberies . "
He has also complained that the media roots for Donovan McNabb because he is black .
And my favorite , the media also roots against Rex Grossman because he is white ( that 's why you never hear a kind word about Peyton Manning , Tom Brady or Brett Favre , the media just hates white athletes in this country ) .
On some of these occasions Limbaugh has claimed he was joking , though most people did n't find it very funny at all .
On many of these occasions , he was n't even pretending to be joking .
He means exactly what he says .
But this week , he has no excuses .
What he said was completely serious and completely racist .
This is Rush Limbaugh from his radio show earlier this week :
LIMBAUGH : Yeah .
This is -- you 're not going to believe this , but it 's very simple .
And the sooner you believe it , and the sooner you let this truth permeate the boundaries you have that tell you this is just simply not possible , the better you will understand Democrats in everything .
You are right .
They want to get us out of Iraq , but they can't wait to get us into Darfur .
CALLER : Right .
LIMBAUGH : There are two reasons .
What color is the skin of the people in Darfur ?
CALLER : Uh , yeah .
LIMBAUGH : It 's black .
And who do the Democrats really need to keep voting for them ?
If they lose a significant percentage of this voting bloc , they 're in trouble .
CALLER : Yes .
Yes .
The black population .
LIMBAUGH : Right .
So you go into Darfur and you go into South Africa , you get rid of the white government there .
You put sanctions on them .
You stand behind Nelson Mandela -- who was bankrolled by communists for a time , had the support of certain communist leaders .
You go to Ethiopia .
You do the same thing .
You can hear the audio of this here .
Media Matters has the whole transcript here .
So far , most of the criticism of Limbaugh for these comments has been focused around the Darfur comments .
But look at what he says about Nelson Mandela and South Africa .
Who is against Nelson Mandela ?
Communist ?
What century is Limbaugh from ?
But put all that aside , he criticized the idea of replacing the white government of South Africa .
I think he has officially become toxic .
How can anyone want to be associated with a guy who wishes we still had the white government of South Africa holding down millions of black people ?
It 's an unbelievable comment .
As a person who grew up without much exposure to racism , I literally have a hard time believing that people can be this racist .
And if Limbaugh thinks that it was a great idea for the white people of South Africa to deny black citizens all of their rights , you have to wonder how good an idea he thinks it would be here as well .
Remember Republican politicians -- including Dick Cheney earlier this year -- still go on Limbaugh 's program .
Anyone who does so from now on , should face a litany of questions about legitimizing a man like this .
Do they share his sentiment ?
I argued against firing Don Imus .
I leave it to you to conclude what you think should happen to Limbaugh 's job .
But I think it is self - evident that what Limbaugh said is far worse than what Imus said .
And at the time , every politician who had ever been on the Imus program was asked whether they supported him and would go back on his show after hearing his comments .
This is exactly what should happen to the politicians that have been on Limbaugh 's program -- at the very least .
Do you stand with Rush Limbaugh or do n't you ?
I can't wait to hear what Republicans have to say about that .

Jesuit missionaries may soon venture into Second Life , intent on saving virtual people from virtual sins .
Writing in the Italian Jesuit journal La Civilta Cattolica , whose contents are approved by the Vatican , Father Antonio Spadaro has told fellow Catholics that they should n't be wary of venturing into Second Life 's virtual world , arguing that the online alternate universe might be the perfect place to land converts , Reuters reports .
" It 's not possible to close our eyes to this phenomenon or rush to judge it , " Spadaro said .
" Instead , it needs to be understood ... the best way to understand it is to enter it . "
A regular contributor to the Jesuit journal , Spadaro has also lauded Tom Waits as a Christian role model .
With his latest piece , the 40 - year - old academic warned that " the erotic dimension is very present " in Second Life , explaining that users often buy virtual genitalia for their virtual avatars and that Linden Lab's 3D world is " open to any form of erotic stimulation from prostitution to pedophilia . "
But he also said that Second Life is home to various churches and temples , quoting a Swedish Muslim who says " his avatar prays as regularly as he prays in real life , " and though this sort of thing is far from the norm , Spadaro believes that many who venture into Second Life 's virtual den of iniquity may be calling out for virtual help .
" Deep down , the digital world can be considered , in its way , mission territory , " he said .
" Second Life is somewhere where the opportunity to meet people and to grow should not be missed , therefore , any initiative that can inspire the residents in a positive way should be considered opportune . " ®
Brexit : les députés britanniques approuvent le projet de loi controversé sur le marché intérieur
Ce texte contredit plusieurs points de l’accord conclu avec Bruxelles pour encadrer la sortie du Royaume - Uni de l’UE .

Illustration by Ronald Kurniawan __Jerry Bromenshenk threads __a tiny microphone through the front of a standard wooden - box beehive .
The mic is flexible and about as thick as spaghetti , so it can be inserted without disturbing the honeybees .
Not that there are many bees left to disturb .
Bromenshenk , an entomologist at the University of Montana , has decided to wire this hive because he believes it's in the early stages of " colony collapse disorder , " a syndrome that has caused the deaths of billions of bees nationwide — and baffled scientists .
Colony collapse disorder is bad news for anyone who eats .
Typically , almost a third of an American 's diet comes from fruits and vegetables , which require pollination , and no technology gets the job done as effectively as Apis mellifera , the humble honeybee .
Wild bee populations in the US have declined steadily over the past half century , and today most of the remaining 2.4 million colonies are domesticated .
To pollinate their crops , farmers rely almost completely on the latter — and now these hives are endangered , too .
Working honeybees live short , tough lives .
Many beekeepers haul their hives from farm to farm — blueberries in Maine , alfalfa in South Dakota , apples in New York , almonds in California — from spring through fall .
All that travel sealed up in boxes is hard on bees , and die - offs are not uncommon .
There are also periodic catastrophes , like the twin invasions of parasitic mites that wiped out half of the US honeybee population in the 1980s .
Colony collapse disorder looks even more ominous .
The alarm was first sounded late last year , when entire colonies started disappearing , practically overnight .
There were no signs of attack on the hives , no dead bees , and very few clues .
Soon , Bromenshenk and other experts were fielding phone calls from befuddled beekeepers across the country .
Some had lost up to 90 percent of their bees .
Researchers have begun looking at several possible explanations : a newly evolved parasite or virus , poor nutrition , or stress - induced immune suppression .
Chemicals could also be to blame .
Neonicotinoids , a relatively new class of agricultural pesticides , are known to cause disorientation in insects .
Their long - term effects on bees are unknown , but they could build up in the hive and , over time , reach concentrations that might impair bees ' navigational abilities .
The bees may leave the hive to forage and simply be unable to find their way back .
Bees have a highly developed sense of smell — at least 40 times more sensitive than humans .
" Within 30 seconds of exposure to a chemical agent , a colony of bees will change the sound it produces , " Bromenshenk says .
And it 's not simply that they get louder ; all the frequencies shift and change , producing a unique sonic signature that can be used to identify the agent .
Hence the tiny microphone set up at the entrance to the threatened hive .
Since 2004 , Bromenshenk has worked on technology for the US Army that uses bees as sentinels to detect airborne toxins , and it occurred to him that studying colony collapse would be a perfect proof of concept .
Since December , he 's been crisscrossing the country , taking sound samples from affected hives for analysis back in his Montana lab .
Eventually , Bromenshenk hopes to package a mic , digital recorder , and software in a handheld device that beekeepers could use to quickly assess hive health .
" We think we can produce the actual working version of Dr. McCoy 's medical tricorder from Star Trek , " he says .
" Only for bees . "

The Legitimacy of Violence as a Political Act ?
Noam Chomsky debates with Hannah Arendt , Susan Sontag , et al .
December 15 , 1967
ROBERT B. SILVERS : … Under what conditions , if any , can violent action be said to be “ legitimate ” ? …
NOAM CHOMSKY : My general feeling is that this kind of question ca n’t be answered in a meaningful way when it ’s abstracted from the context of particular historical concrete circumstances .
Any rational person would agree that violence is not legitimate unless the consequences of such action are to eliminate a still greater evil .
Now there are people of course who go much further and say that one must oppose violence in general , quite apart from any possible consequences .
I think that such a person is asserting one of two things .
Either he ’s saying that the resort to violence is illegitimate even if the consequences are to eliminate a greater evil ; or he ’s saying that under no conceivable circumstances will the consequences ever be such as to eliminate a greater evil .
The second of these is a factual assumption and it ’s almost certainly false .
One can easily imagine and find circumstances in which violence does eliminate a greater evil .
As to the first , it ’s a kind of irreducible moral judgment that one should not resort to violence even if it would eliminate a greater evil .
And these judgments are very hard to argue .
I can only say that to me it seems like an immoral judgment .
Now there is a tendency to assume that a stand based on an absolute moral judgment shows high principle in a way that ’s not shown in a stand taken on what are disparagingly referred to as “ tactical grounds . ”
I think this is a pretty dubious assumption .
If tactics involves a calculation of the human cost of various actions , then tactical considerations are actually the only considerations that have a moral quality to them .
So I ca n’t accept a general and absolute opposition to violence , only that resort to violence is illegitimate unless the consequences are to eliminate a greater evil .
With this formulation , however , one moves from the abstract discussion to the context of concrete historical circumstances where there are shades of gray and obscure complex relations between means and ends and uncalculable consequences of actions , and so on and so forth .
Formulated in these terms , the advocates of a qualified commitment to nonviolence have a pretty strong case .
I think they can claim with very much justice that in almost all real circumstances there is a better way than resort to violence .
Let me mention a couple of concrete instances that may shed some light on this question .
I read in the Times this morning an interview with Jeanette Rankin , who was the one member of Congress to vote against the declaration of war on December 8 , 1941 , to the accompaniment of a chorus of boos and hisses .
Looking back , though , we can see that the Japanese had very real grievances , and that the United States had quite a significant share of responsibility in those grievances back in 1941 .
In fact , Japan had rather a more valid case than is customary to admit .
On November 6 , 1941 , just a month before Pearl Harbor , Japan had offered to eliminate the main major factor that really led to the Pacific war , namely the Closed Door Policy in China .
But they did so with one reservation : that they would agree to eliminate the closed door in China , which is what we ’d been demanding , only if the same principle were applied throughout the world — that is , if it were also applied in , say , Latin America , the British Dominions , and so forth .
Of course , this was considered too absurd to even elicit a response .
And Secretary of State Cordell Hull ’s answer simply requested once again that they open the closed door in China and he did n’t even deign to mention this ridiculous qualification that they had added .
Now that qualification was of the essence and had been fought about for the preceding ten years .
And it was one of the factors that led to Pearl Harbor and the war .
Of course , it was politically impossible after Pearl Harbor for the United States not to declare war ; we know how very difficult it is to restrain from striking back , even when you do know that the guilt is distributed .
But we ’re talking about what is legitimate and what is moral , not what is a natural reflex .
And the advocates of nonviolence are really saying that we should try to raise ourselves to such a cultural and moral level , both as individuals and as a community , that we would be able to control this reflex .
Now what were the consequences of striking back and what was our own role in creating the situation in which the violence took place ?
On December 8 , we struck back quite blindly , quite unthinkingly , and I ’m not at all sure in retrospect that the world is any the better for it .
It ’s quite striking to read the dissenting opinion at the Tokyo tribunal of the one Indian justice who was permitted to take part , and who dissented from the entire proceedings , concluding himself that the only acts in the Pacific War that in any way corresponded to the Nazi atrocities were the dropping of the two atom bombs on Japanese cities .
A.J. Muste in 1941 - 2 predicted that we would adopt the worst features of our adversaries , of the object of our hatred , and that we would replace Japan as a still more ferocious conqueror .
And I think it ’s very difficult to deny the justice of that prediction .
So even after Pearl Harbor , I would accept advocacy of nonviolence , not as an absolute moral principle , but as conceivably justified in those particular historical circumstances .
In short , there may well have been alternatives to the Pacific War .
A second case , which I guess is the one everybody ’s got on their mind , Vietnam , raises interesting and difficult questions in this regard .
I ’m not going to discuss the situation post - February 1965 but rather the earlier period .
From 1954 to 1957 there was large scale terror instituted by the Saigon government , and the reason was pretty simple , it was n’t just blind and wild .
The reason was — this is Buttinger ’s theory and I think accurate — that any democratic institutions that would have been created would have been taken over by the Vietminh and therefore it was impossible for the Saigon regime to allow any sort of democratic expression .
It was necessary to resort to violence and terror .
Then , in the period from 1957 to 1965 , there were two sorts of violence , roughly .
There was the mass violence conducted by Saigon and the United States ; Bernard Fall estimates about 160,000 killed during that period .
And there was also the selective violence , selective terror carried out by the Viet Cong as part of a political program which succeeded in gaining the adherence of a good part of the population .
During both of these periods , Americans tended to accept and condone the violence that was conducted by the United States and the Saigon government , reserving their indignation for the much more limited Viet Cong terror .
For my part , of course , there ’s no question about justifying the American and Saigon government terror .
But what about the harder question , that of the terror practiced by the National Liberation Front ?
Was this a legitimate political act ?
The easiest reaction is to say that all violence is abhorrent , that both sides are guilty , and to stand apart retaining one ’s moral purity and condemn them both .
This is the easiest response and in this case I think it ’s also justified .
But , for reasons that are pretty complex , there are real arguments also in favor of the Viet Cong terror , arguments that ca n’t be lightly dismissed , although I do n’t think they ’re correct .
One argument is that this selective terror — killing certain officials and frightening others — tended to save the population from a much more extreme government terror , the continuing terror that exists when a corrupt official can do things that are within his power in the province that he controls .
Then there ’s also the second type of argument … which I think ca n’t be abandoned very lightly .
It ’s a factual question of whether such an act of violence frees the native from his inferiority complex and permits him to enter into political life .
I myself would like to believe that it ’s not so .
Or at the least , I ’d like to believe that nonviolent reaction could achieve the same result .
But it ’s not very easy to present evidence for this ; one can only argue for accepting this view on grounds of faith .
And the necessity of releasing the peasant from this role of passivity is hardly in question .
We know perfectly well that , in countries such as North Korea and South Vietnam and many others , it was necessary to rouse the peasants to recognize that they were capable of taking over the land .
It was necessary to break the bonds of passivity that made them totally incapable of political action .
And if violence does move the peasantry to the point where it can overcome the sort of permanent bondage of the sort that exists , say , in the Philippines , then I think there ’s a pretty strong case for it .
An interesting sidelight to this issue in the Vietnam situation is a recent Rand Corporation study which claims that the areas in which American control is most firm are the areas in which there has been least disruption of the old feudal social order , where the peasants are docile , where they do n’t raise political issues , where they do n’t cause trouble and then begin to act politically — which in Vietnam means acting as members of the Viet Cong , apparently .
There ’s also a third argument in favor of violence which on the surface sounds pretty abhorrent , but I ’m afraid it has a point , from the point of view of the revolutionary guerrilla groups .
That is the idea that violence , say by the Viet Cong , will lead to reprisal , often overreprisal , and reprisal will win adherents to the Viet Cong .
Of course , that ’s what happens , in fact .
The first year of the massive American bombardment of South Vietnam , the number of recruits for the Viet Cong increased enormously , tripled at least .
With all these arguments in favor of this type of violence , I still think there are good grounds to reject it .
It seems to me , from the little we know about such matters , that a new society rises out of the actions that are taken to form it , and the institutions and the ideology it develops are not independent of those actions ; in fact , they ’re heavily colored by them , they ’re shaped by them in many ways .
And one can expect that actions that are cynical and vicious , whatever their intent , will inevitably condition and deface the quality of the ends that are achieved .
Now , again , in part this is just a matter of faith .
But I think there ’s at least some evidence that better results follow from better means .
For example , the detailed studies of Viet Cong success , like those of Douglas Pike , indicate quite clearly that the basis for the success , which was enormous , was not the selective terror , but rather the effective organization which drew people into beneficial organizations , organizations that they entered out of self - interest , that they to a large extent controlled , that began to interlace and cover the entire countryside .
Other studies also show that it was the attractiveness of their programs for rural Vietnam that led to the NLF successes , which by 1965 had led in effect to their victory .
I think the course of collectivization in China and the Soviet Union can also be instructive .
It ’s clear , I believe , that the emphasis on the use of terror and violence in China was considerably less than in the Soviet Union and that the success was considerably greater in achieving a just society .
And I think the most convincing example — the one about which not enough is known and to which not enough attention is paid — is the anarchist success in Spain in 1936 , which was successful at least for a year or two in developing a collective society with mass participation and a very high degree of egalitarianism and even economic success .
Its successes , which were great , can be attributed to organization and program , not to such violence as occurred , I believe .
Such examples seem to suggest that there is a relationship between absence of terror and the degree of organization , meaningful programs and spontaneity , on the one hand , and success in achieving a just society on the other .
This is a sort of Luxembourgian and anarchist conception , that a just society cannot really be imposed on the masses of people but must arise out of their own spontaneous efforts , guided by their own developing insight .
I think that this is a valid conception which has some support from modern history .
A final case I ’d like to refer to is the anti-war movement in the United States , where I think the argument for nonviolence is overwhelming — so overwhelming that I do n’t think I need argue it here .
A couple of days ago I was rather despairingly trying to think of something illuminating that I might say about this subject , and I decided to turn back to some of Tolstoy ’s essays on civil disobedience .
I ’m not sure I found anything very deep there , but I was surprised to discover a note of optimisim that I had n’t expected , and , since that ’s a kind of a rare treasure these days , I ’d like to quote a couple of remarks just to relieve the prevailing gloom .
He has an interesting essay that was written in 1897 called “ The Beginning of the End ” [ audience laughter ] in which he points out that until recently men could not imagine a human society without slavery .
Similarly , one cannot imagine the life of man without war . “… a hundred years have gone since the first clear expression of the idea that mankind can live without slavery ; and there is no longer slavery in Christian nations .
And there shall not pass away another hundred years after the clear utterance of the idea that mankind can live without war , before war shall cease to be .
Very likely some form of armed violence will remain , just as wage labor remains after the abolition of slavery , but at least wars and armies will be abolished in the outrageous form , so repugnant to reason and moral sense , in which they now exist .
“ Signs that this time is near are many .
These signs are such as the helpless position of governments which more and more increase their armaments ; the multiplication of taxation and the discontent of the nations , the extreme degree of efficiency with which deadly weapons are constructed , the activities of congresses and societies of peace ; but above all , the refusal of individuals to take military service .
In these refusals is the key to the solution of the question . ”
We live in a society which is the most aggressive in the world , and we live under conditions of almost unparalleled freedom .
We therefore have the opportunity to eradicate a good part of the illegitimate violence that plagues our lives and that is destroying the lives of many who are much less fortunate .
I think we have no choice whatsoever but to take up the challenge that ’s implicit in this prediction of Tolstoy ’s .
If we do not take up this challenge , we will help to bring about a very different state of affairs which was reportedly predicted by Einstein , who was once asked his opinion about the nature of a third world war and replied that he had nothing to say about that matter , but that he was quite certain that the fourth world war would be fought with clubs and stones .
ROBERT SILVERS : I think that we now will have discussion by the panelists .
HANNAH ARENDT : … I very much agree with Mr. Chomsky ’s assertion that the nature of new societies is affected by the nature of the actions that bring them into being .
And our experiences with such new societies are , of course , by no means encouraging .
It would be really fooling ourselves if we looked upon them with enthusiastic eyes , with which I sympathize but which , I am afraid , simply do not see the truth .
As to the Viet Cong terror , we cannot possibly agree with it , just as we could n’t agree with the terror of the National Liberation Army in Algeria .
People who did agree with this terror and were only against the French counter - terror , of course , were applying a double standard …
… I have the impression that many people today — at least a number of people in the so - called New Left — who are against our country ’s intervention in Vietnam ( as I am , too ) would like us to interfere , only in favor of the other side .
And though I do not think this would be as horrible as what we are doing now , I definitely think that it would be very wrong indeed …
… American political attitudes are known as “ moralistic ” all over the world ; in this country we seem not to be aware of the seriousness of this reproach .
Moralistic attitudes in politics tend to provide moral justifications for crimes , quite apart from leading into pseudoidealistic enterprises which are obviously to the detriment of the intended beneficiaries ….
CONOR CRUISE O’BRIEN : … Mr. Barrington Moore in his important book , The Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy , asks a pertinent question — one he says he ’s almost afraid to answer :
For which is the price heavier , the price for violent revolution , as in China , or the price for peaceful stagnation , as in India ?
And he leans rather toward the view that the price for peaceful stagnation may in fact be higher .
The question has also been raised here about the terror used by the National Liberation Front , and by other revolutionary movements .
I think there is a distinction between the use of terror by oppressed peoples against the oppressors and their servants , in comparison with the use of terror by their oppressors in the interests of further oppression .
I think there is a qualitative distinction there which we have the right to make .
ROBERT SILVERS :
Do you want to say something , Noam , about this ?
CHOMSKY : Let me make just a couple of quick comments .
Dr. Arendt takes rather an absolutist view , that I do n’t share , about certain historical phenomena such as the character of the new societies that have emerged .
I do n’t feel that they deserve a blanket condemnation at all .
There are many things to object to in any society .
But take China , modern China ; one also finds many things that are really quite admirable .
Many things , in fact , do meet the sort of Luxembourgian conditions that apparently Dr. Arendt and I agree about .
There are even better examples than China .
But I do think that China is an important example of a new society in which very interesting positive things happened at the local level , in which a good deal of the collectivization and communization was really based on mass participation and took place after a level of understanding had been reached in the peasantry that led to this next step .
Indeed , a recent article in the China Quarterly — which is hardly a pro-Red Chinese journal — compares Chinese and Russian communization to the very great credit of the Chinese communization , precisely for these reasons , pointing out that its greater success in achieving a relatively livable and to some extent just society was correlated with the fact that these methods involved much less terror .
This relates to a point Dr. O’Brien raised .
I ’m not at all convinced that the alternatives are hard and fast , either / or , violent revolution or peaceful stagnation .
What one has to ask about a revolution is whether its success is based on its violence ; and if we look at revolutions that have taken place I think it ’s not at all clear that the success has been based on the violence .
In fact to a significant extent it seems to me that the successes have been based on the nonviolence .
Now again a blanket statement on this is not possible , but I suggest there are elements of truth in this characterization .
I ’m quite convinced , as I indicated , that , to a very considerable extent the revolution that took place in China , after the Nationalists were defeated , was successful because of its nonviolence , because the ground had been prepared , because people were moving to the next stage out of a sort of necessity that was widely felt .
And the anarchist revolution in Spain , I think , is a nearly classic example of this sort of thing , where the great success of the revolution was largely due to the very long period of preparation — extending over a generation , in fact — during which the groundwork was laid for what turned out to be a very sudden , spontaneous , and I think highly successful revolutionary action .
And , in a way , one of the most striking examples of all is precisely the National Liberation Front .
If you examine the careful studies that have been made of NLF success , it turns out that this success was not due to its use of violence .
Therefore I think one has to be rather cautious about accepting as absolute the alternatives peaceful stagnation and violent revolution .
There ’s also a possibility of spontaneous revolution that uses both violence and nonviolent tactics , that minimizes the use of terror except as necessary in defense .
I certainly do n’t think that things like the mass slaughter of landlords in China contributed in any significant way to the revolutionary successes , just as I do n’t think the slaughter of landlords in North Vietnam contributed in any respect to the successes of the revolution there , such as they were ; and in fact the North Vietnamese agree with this judgment .
As to the NLF terror , I think Dr. Arendt and I agree in conclusion but probably disagree on the reasons .
For me , her vision is too absolutistic .
I do n’t accept the view that we can just condemn the NLF terror , period , because it was so horrible .
I think we really have to ask questions of comparative costs , ugly as that may sound .
And if we are going to take a moral position on this — and I think we should — we have to ask both what the consequences were of using terror and not using terror .
If it were true that the consequences of not using terror would be that the peasantry in Vietnam would continue to live in the state of the peasantry of the Philippines , then I think the use of terror would be justified .
But , as I said before , I do n’t think it was the use of terror that led to the successes that were achieved .
To turn to another point raised , it ’s quite true that American policy is often accused , as Dr. Arendt said , of being moralistic , that it tries to give a facade of legitimacy to acts that ca n’t be legitimated .
The policy of every rising imperialism has been moralistic in exactly that sense .
For example , Japanese imperialism in East Asia a generation ago used the sort of rhetoric that we use and it was just about as moralistic as we are .
The Japanese argued that clearly they were just building up a sphere in which their technical know - how would be used for the benefit of the oppressed masses of Asia who were being terrorized by fascists and bolsheviks or Western imperialists .
In fact , people like Tojo went so far as to argue that truly no one could accuse the Japanese of being imperialistic for any crass material gain , because they were pouring out more money for the benefit of those backward peoples than they would ever get back in return .
In truth , just about every argument that ’s part of the American repertoire was used by the Japanese .
Now , of course , I ’m opposed to such speciously rationalized moralistic policy but I ’m not in the least opposed to truly moral policies .
And I do n’t see the slightest reason why moral considerations must be left out until some final stage is reached at which destruction is imminent .
It seems to me that , particularly in a society which is the beneficiary of both past and present violence , moral questions should be raised at the very first point .
Quite apart from whether the West reached its present stage because of exploitation of the Third World ( so called ) , the rape of India , and so on and so forth , quite apart from that issue , we should , for example , press for the proper use of the capacities that exist in this country to alleviate the misery and backwardness of much of the rest of the world .
Toward that , we would need to organize our society properly and organize our concepts and morals properly .
That ’s a moral act , of course , and I do n’t see the slightest reason why we should refuse to take that moral act .
ROBERT SILVERS : Perhaps we should give the audience a chance .
Susan ?
SUSAN SONTAG : … It ’s personally hard for me to understand how in December 1967 in New York the discussion has at no point turned actively to the question of whether we , in this room , and the people we know are going to be engaged in violence .
Only Mr. Chomsky in one sentence — breathtakingly short — said :
Of course , it goes without saying that we in the peace movement in America should not use violent means .
That ’s the issue I think we ought to be discussing here .
CHOMSKY : I had intended to talk about that and even have some notes about it .
I hoped that by that quote from Tolstoy I would at least imply what I felt , namely that the real issue today is the all - importance of the refusal to participate in violence , the refusal to fight .
I think that ’s not only crucial for the Vietnam War but a terribly crucial , central thing for us citizens of the world dominant power , the world ’s major aggressive power — that we use the freedoms that still exist in it to try to build up resistance to participation in war .
As to the tactics of the peace movement , I think there are very strong reasons in favor of nonviolence .
The first reason — which Professor Hans Morgenthau described quite eloquently — is that the government happens to have a monopoly of terror .
Therefore violence is simply suicidal .
There is no way of combatting the terror , the violence that the government can use in response to any use of violence that the peace movement might adopt .
And the situation is clearly getting worse .
As some of you may know , the major universities are participating quite actively now in developing new techniques of control of demonstartions and crowds .
The Institute of Defense Analysis which is run by a consortium of ten major Eastern universities — Columbia , Princeton , MIT , and so on — has been working on crowd control , which means control of blacks , students , peace demonstrators .
And the technology for doing this is extrememly efficacious and will only improve .
So that ’s one reason for nonviolence .
The second reason for nonviolence , I think , is that clearly violence antagonizes the uncommitted .
And what we want to do is not antagonize them , but attract them to , involve them in , the resistance to the War .
We want to get them to take part in active resistance to this and whatever future war the United States will attempt to conduct .
Toward this end , violence carried out by peace demonstrators would be a serious “ counterproductive ” tactical error .
And , as I mentioned before , I think that these tactical considerations are not in the least to be disparaged , but are actually the only considerations that have , ultimately , any moral charcter to them , because they are the considerations that involve the human costs .
And I think the same is true even in the case of the confrontation with authority .
Sitting next to Mr. O’Brien , who was just beaten up by the police a couple of days ago , I hesitate to say that one can appeal to the policeman by nonviolence .
I , myself , have not been beaten up by the police , but I was kicked around a little bit by them a couple of weeks ago and I certainly did n’t feel so optimistic about such appeals at that moment .
But despite that , I do think there have been historical occasions when this was possible , when in fact there was defection from the ranks of authority .
And we may not be too far from that now .
For example , last summer , the paratroopers who were sent into Detroit consisted of 25 percent Negroes and I think it was extremely stupid of the government to be willing to take the gamble that they were going to fire their guns in one direction and not in the opposite direction .
Next summer , it may work the other way .
One technique for making it happen would be the choice of appropriate means , and in this case I think it has to be nonviolent tactics .
Another very convincing reason for limiting oneself to nonviolent action is that in a way that ’s pretty hard to characterize , immense harm is done to the individual who participates in violent action .
Almost invariably he becomes much the worse for it .
On the other hand , the participant in nonviolent action very often does achieve a kind of tranforming effect .
And I do believe we need a moral revolution in certain sectors of American society which can then perhaps extend to other sectors .
If these people are contaminated , and if their potential for transforming the society is destroyed , that ’ll be a terrible tragedy .
On the other hand , if they can reach the kind of maturity and dignity , and depth of understanding , that was in fact reached by many of the Southern Negro participants in the civil rights movement — and nobody who ’s seen any of that or taken part in it can doubt that it was achieved — if that kind of moral , human transformation can be achieved , I think it could be an enormous benefit to the society at large , and might even save the world from destruction — which may otherwise not be too far off . [… ]
ROBERT SILVERS : I wonder if there ’s anyone here who believes there is a strong case to be made for some kind of violent role within the peace movement .
MAN IN AUDIENCE : I agree with those who say that the use of violence is usually only successful if you have first built very strong political foundations .
But it surprises me that no one has raised the example of Cuba , where you have the amazingly successful use of violence as a tactic by a small group to create the political foundations … .
Secondly , I ’m surpised that the issue of the ghettos has only been raised tangentially .
It seems to me that the violence employed by the people in getting mattresses and clothes and a supply of liquor for the winter is a constructive and revealing form of violence … .
A third point … is that it ’s not as if people have n’t tried the democratic procedures .
It ’s not as if the violence in the slums and the violence in South Vietnam arose in a vacuum … .
It seems to me that until you can begin to show — not in language and not in theory , but in action — that you can put an end to the war in Vietnam , and an end to American racism , you ca n’t condemn the violence of others who ca n’t wait for you … .
CHOMSKY : Of course , the alternatives are not either violence or democratic procedures .
For example , draft resistance is not violence , but it is also not the use of democratic procedures .
And draft resistance , I believe , has had a significant impact on the War in Vietnam , by imposing some kind of ceiling on troop - sending .
Now , you talked about the fact that the blacks in the ghettos had been provoked to the use of violence by the failure of democratic procedures and the failure of nonviolent action .
I ’m sure that ’s accurate .
But I do n’t think that deals with the question of whether they were correct in having acted upon this provocation .
Maybe they were very justified because they were provoked beyond reason , but it still does n’t follow that that was the most politically effective and rational reaction .
Frankly , I doubt very much that it was .
Somebody may be provoked to a certain action and you can understand his being provoked to it and not make any moral condemnation of it , but that does n’t necessarily mean that you then go out and tell him , Yes , that was the right thing to do .
Maybe it was n’t the right thing to do .
For example , I think that large segments of the American people who understood very little about what was going on were provoked to war on December 7 , 1941 — and from the information available to them , justly so .
But , as I said previously , I am not at all sure it was the right reaction , to go to war .
In general , one has to distinguish justification from legitimacy .
Legitimacy brings into account the consequences of the action for the people themselves and for all concerned .
So I see it as a tactical , hence , moral question whether violent reaction is going to be more efficacious in the slums , let ’s say , than some forms of nonviolent reaction that have so far not been terribly effective or , perhaps , other forms that ’ll be invented .
But the fact that certain things have n’t workd so far does n’t mean that some particular other tactic is necessarily legitimate politically .
It ’s got to be shown that that ’s more likely to work ; in this case I do n’t think that ’s been done .
As to the question of looting , I myself would n’t regard that as violence .
I do n’t see why it ’s more violent for a person to go into a store and take what ’s there than it is for a person who has money that was achieved by violent methods to go into the store and take what ’s there by handing over the money .
I think one can give a good argument that looting is n’t violence at all .
In a sense , most of us are looters , or at any rate we are benefiting from others ’ looting .
Now with regard to Cuba , I really do n’t see much historical evidence for the Debray thesis that the successful revolutionary situation was created by the use of violence .
That ’s based on an assumption , which I think was probably false , that the peasants were participating actively in the revolution in Cuba ; actually , it appears that it was largely middle - class elements .
And whatever support was given by the peasantry has not been shown to have been due to the success of the violence .
This thesis was recently tested in Bolivia with utterly disastrous effects .
So to sum up : if violence could be shown to lead to the overthrow of lasting suppression of human life that now obtains in vast parts of the world , that would be a justification for violence .
But this has not been shown at all , in my view .

What is Guilt For ?
A new experiment suggests the function of guilt is both to punish the self and encourage us to make amends .
At school my good friend Dave and I used to sit together in Biology classes .
One day we were there as usual trying to get our heads around the metamorphosis of tadpoles , or something similar .
We were perched on high stools next to high wooden lab benches , the kind with generations of pupil ’s engravings underneath the varnish .
Good solid science benches .
I stood up to talk to someone behind me , not moving far from the stool on which I was sat – I knew it was right behind me .
Then , when I went to sit back down , I suddenly heard myself cry out in pain .
Next thing , I was sitting on the floor , something warm oozing from the back of my head .
Everyone was staring at me but I had no idea what was going on .
It was only on the way to the doctor I pieced together what had obviously happened .
Dave had whipped the stool away and I ’d fallen backwards , catching my head a glancing blow on the bench .
A couple of stitches
It was n’t a bad injury , I had a couple of stitches ; no real harm done – except to my relationship with Dave .
What was interesting was that although I told him it was no big deal , in the years following he barely spoke ten words to me .
We certainly did n’t sit together in Biology any more .
I always found this puzzling .
It was Dave that caused the accident , I had told him we were cool so what was the problem ?
I never found out directly from Dave – it ’s possible he did n’t even know himself why he was avoiding me .
The only really plausible explanation I ’ve been able to come up with is that he simply felt so guilty he could n’t face me .
If I was around it just reminded him of what he had done .
And that was too much for him so he preferred to avoid me .
If my explanation is right , then it not only shows how powerful guilt can be but also how it can promote avoidant behaviour .
But does guilt always encourage this kind of avoidant behaviour or is it a more sophisticated emotion with complex effects on motivation ?
In short : what is guilt for and what does it make us do ?
Theories of guilt
Freud thought guilt served to effectively regulate social behaviour .
If people did n’t feel guilty , so the argument goes , they ’d be much less likely to care about hurting other ’s feelings or damaging their property .
This is all very well , but what exactly is guilt ’s function , what does it motivate us to do ?
One theory has it that guilt is all about punishing the self , another has it that it encourages us to try to heal the social damage we ’ve done .
Still another suggests we are only motivated to act in order to make ourselves feel better about our transgression .
In a new study published in Psychological Science , Amodio & Harmon - Jones ( 2007 ) argue the first two theories are compatible .
Guilt , they argue , acts both to punish the self and to help us heal the damage we ’ve done .
And they use a thorough experiment involving measuring behaviour and electrical activity in the brain to provide evidence for their view .
Inducing
White guilt
Experimentally , the first problem is making people feel guilty in the lab .
Here ’s what the authors came up with .
Participants are brought in , have an EEG cap put on their head to measure electrical activity in the brain , and then they are told to watch a series of faces appearing on the screen .
Some of the faces are White , some Black and some Asian .
They do n’t have to do anything other than look at the faces .
The participants have been specifically chosen because they are themselves
White but have expressed positive views of Blacks .
The researchers have to avoid recruiting racists otherwise the experimental results will be difficult to interpret .
Afterwards the participants are shown bar graphs supposedly interpreting measurements of the electrical activity in their brains .
These indicate that while the participants reacted positively and neutrally to White and Asian faces , they reacted negatively to Black faces .
The ‘ results ’ seem to show that our liberal participants are somewhat racist – whether consciously or unconsciously .
These graphs are , of course , just made up .
Participants are then told the first experiment finished early so would they mind taking part in a different experiment .
The second , apparently unrelated study , is actually still part of the first .
In this participants choose which of 19 different magazine articles they find the most interesting .
Three of the articles are about reducing racial prejudice .
I wish the ground would swallow me up
As you ’d expect participants felt guilty about apparently being racist – this was measured in two ways .
First they indicated in self - report measures they felt guilty .
Second the EEG measures showed a significant reduction in left - frontal activity .
This reduction in activity is associated with decreased ‘ approach motivation ’ .
In other words they just wanted the ground to swallow them up .
Then when choosing the magazine article they were more likely to choose the article about reducing racial prejudice .
At the same time the EEG recording showed a shift of activation onto the left side of the brain .
This indicates an increase in approach behaviours .
So now they were motivated by their guilty feelings to try and make amends .
Guilt is a complex social emotion
One of the reasons this study is really interesting is that it shows the complexity of the interplay between guilt and motivation .
Previously psychologists have tended to see emotions in terms of having one particular purpose or effect .
For example , happiness motivates people to approach others while sadness causes people to withdraw .
Guilt can , however , cause a more complex pattern of behaviours : first withdrawal , then approach .
It ’s this dynamic model that provides a much better way of analysing how guilt affects our behaviour .
One limitation of this study , however , is that the results may only be applicable to prejudice .
We will have to wait for future research to confirm if this dynamic model is seen in other guilt - inducing situations .
Dave and I
Nevertheless , applying the results of this study to what happened between Dave and I makes me wonder if it really was all about guilt .
After all , he never really tried to make amends , he just hid his head in the sand .
For good .
I suppose I will never know the truth .

It may be bad manners , but it 's also necessary : Every 40 seconds or so , a cow burps .
Scientists are now scrambling to make them burp less – not to make more polite cows , but a cooler planet .
As cows digest their food ( up to 150 pounds of grass , hay , and silage per day , along with 20 pounds of concentrated feed ) , myriad microorganisms – bacteria , protozoa , fungi , and archaea – busily break down the fibers and other nutrients in their rumens .
In the process , hydrogen and carbon dioxide are released .
The archaea ( a kind of bacteria ) transform the two gases into methane ( CH4 ) , up to 100 gallons of it per cow per day , and the cows get rid of it mainly by burping .
How could a burp matter ?
But it does .
Odorless , colorless methane – the primary of natural gas – is a powerful greenhouse agent .
According to the US Environmental Protection Agency , pound for pound methane is about 21 times more effective at warming Earth 's atmosphere than carbon dioxide is .
Globally , ruminant livestock – including cattle , goats , and buffaloes – produce about 80 million metric tons of methane a year , accounting for about 28 percent of man-made methane emissions annually .
Recently , researchers from the Japanese National Institute of Livestock and Grassland Science in Tsukuba calculated the environmental impact of a serving of beef and published the result in The New Scientist .
According to them , the production of one kilogram of beef ( 2.2 pounds ) results in the emission of greenhouse gases with a warming potential equivalent to 80 pounds of carbon dioxide .
In other words : Serving steak to your family is the greenhouse - gas equivalent of driving 155 miles .
What 's a cow to do ?
As the demand for meat steadily rises globally , the question is how can we keep cows from burping .
British researchers have begun a $ 1.5 million government research program to propose ways to change cows ' diets in order to reduce methane production by feeding them grasses with higher levels of sugar , which facilitate digestion .
" These grasses present a better balance of nutrients to the microbial population in the rumen and are used more efficiently , " says Prof .
Mike Theodorou , head of the UK's Science Development at the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research in Aberystwyth .
" In doing so , more of the ingested carbon and nitrogen will be converted to meat , milk , hide , and wool . "
The scientists are investigating how such plants can be bred to contain even higher sugar content and to grow more abundantly on pastureland .
Other researchers suggest adding certain plant ingredients to livestock menus .
Michael Kreuzer , head of the Swiss Ruminant Nutrition Group in the Institute of Animal Science of ETH Zurich , proposes adding extra fat ( from coconuts , crushed flaxseed , or sunflower seed ) , as well as extracts rich in tannins and saponins ( already available in powdered form ) .
Unlike antibiotics , these plant - based additives seem to have no secondary effects on milk or meat .
And " measurements showed that by using them it's possible to reduce the emission of methane up to 20 percent , " Professor Kreuzer says .
In order to control the cows ' exhalations , he puts them in respiration chambers for 48 hours , feeds them , and measures the concentration of methane from the chamber every few minutes .
The animals are n't always amused .
They are not used to eating more fats .
Moreover , saponins taste soapy , and tannins are bitter .
For the cow , tannin is like drinking a cup of black tea , Kreuzer says : " The more you put into their feed , the merrier it is , but the more awful it tastes . "
Furthermore , controlled feeding is not possible everywhere – especially not in Canada , Brazil , Australia , Argentina , and India , where huge herds of animals roam free on huge grazing lands .
To reduce their burping , Prof. Winfried Drochner of the Institute of Animal Nutrition at the German University of Hohenheim proposes administering a bun-size pill filled with methane - reducing substances that would dissolve in a cow 's gut over a period of months .
It would be a bitter pill for cows to swallow .
But at least it would n't give them bad breath , as another proposal might do .
Prof. Jamie Newbold , at the Institute of Rural Sciences at the University of Wales , is experimenting with a feed laced with garlic .
Initial results show that the extract reduces the amount of gas produced by up to 50 percent , as the garlic directly attacks the methane - producing organisms in the cow 's digestive tract .
But the garlic cure could not only cause halitosis , but also odd - tasting milk and meat .
Kreuzer notes that in Switzerland there 's a law against feeding dairy cows garlic and onions .
Kangaroos may hold the key
One strategy that Australian scientists have embarked upon suggests not only changing the cattle 's diet , but also part of their intestinal tract by making them more like a kangaroo .
Australia 's heraldic animals do n't emit methane from fermentation .
The microbes in their stomachs – while performing functions similar to those in the digestive tracts of cows – are markedly different .
A kangaroo's digestive microbes produce acetate ( C2H3O2 ) , which aids digestion .
Athol Klieve and his team from the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries in Queensland isolated 211 bacteria from the eastern gray kangaroo's gut and screened them to determine which are best at digesting native pasture .
The most promising ones could be grown in a laboratory and introduced into cattle .
If this approach succeeds , one day there could be less methane in the air – and a little bit of kangaroo in every cow .
Representative Thomas Caltagirone , Chair of the House Judiciary Committee , took action today through his subordinate , John Ryan , to shut down my local blog Berks Democrats because I wrote an article critical of his using his campaign committee as his personal piggy bank and for exposing a contribution he made to Republican Tom Corbett .
Ironically we had a conversation about the article prior to this morning 's Berks County Democratic Committee meeting and I was prepared to come home afterwards and add his comments and rebuttal to what I wrote .
Had he left well enough alone I would have done so .
He related to me the funds he 's generously given over the years supporting Democrats and I would have been happy to mention that , as I am here .
The point of the article , however , was that if you use subordinates to plant stories about your opponent 's campaign reports yours had better be spotless and Tom 's are anything but .
So this morning he first attacked me for writing on my local blog about how our Committee does not seem to have any checks and balances over our fiinancial affairs , no expenditures seem to be authorized as per the by laws , and no record of any such authorizations are ever provided to the members , even today .
No Auditing Committee , required by the by laws , exists to even oversee the financial affairs as is required by our by laws .
Then Mr. Ryan , who works for Caltagirone , made an extremely hostile motion to demand that I stop using the name Berks Democrats for one of my blogs .
He maintains it is confusing because people will think it 's connected to the Berks County Democratic Party .
If you go to the blog and look directly under the name of the blog you 'll find a disclaimer that clearly spells out that it is n't .
I do n't understand how I can make that clearer .
The County Committee neglected to buy all possible permutations of their domain names and I bought that one .
I bought the name ending in ( .com ) and that is the one I use .
It is internet protocol for non profit groups to use the domain ( .org ) and that is the name BerksDems.org uses , the Committee website .
Anyone regularly using the internet understands the difference between domain name extensions .
The reason for these different extensions ( com , gov , edu , org ) is to accomplish exactly what Mr. Ryan carelessly attempted to force upon me today : differentiation between websites .
My blog is not affiliated with a group ( other than the three Berks Democrats who do actually write for the blog , thus the name ) which is non profit , thus it is appropriately , and legally , designated dot com .
That is the proper and legal internet protocol .
If the County Committee is threatening legal action against me ( and they are ) if I refuse to change the name of that website I have considerable counterclaims against them .
Let 's be clear what this is actually all about .
That blog has been in existence since last fall and no one has objected to the use of the name .
Even today 's resolution presented to the County Committee was in error because John Ryan stated I must stop using the name " Berks Dems . "
I do n't use that name so his entire effort was wasted and was a worthless waste of time .
See , I do n't use the name " Berks Dems . "
This was a power play by Representative Tom Caltagirone , the same man who prevented Pennsylvania Democrats from electing a Democratic Speaker of the House last January .
He does n't like what I write about him so he 's trying to shut me down .
Let me give you an example of the sort of men Reading Democrats have to pick from next spring .
Two weeks ago one of Caltagirone 's staffers was murdered , shot with a gun .
Caltagirone staunchly supports the NRA in spite of representing a District rife with gun violence .
His opponent Mike Morrill was scheduled to canvass that Saturday with a flier questioning Caltagirone 's NRA membership and opposition to common sense gun safety laws with the epidemic of gun violence in the District .
Morrill suspended that canvassing on the gun issue after the tragedy in deference to the tragedy .
Would Caltagirone have done the same thing ?
Looking at today 's conduct by him I say not .
People are getting gunned down constantly in the 127th House District and it's partly because their State Representative opposes all laws restricting handgun sales to one per month , child trigger locks , reporting of lost or stolen weapons , etc .
Tragically his Reading office Chief of Staff was murdered by her estranged husband , with a handgun , two weeks ago .
Instead of mourning her he then launched an attack upon his opponent , who did nothing wrong , through a surrogate .
I responded because I 'm supporting his opponent .
I spent four hours sifting through his campaign finance reports online and wrote the article below .
The result : Caltagirone hardball tactics against me through his employee John Ryan .
You may be successful shutting down the local blog
Tom but you cannot shut down this one and this one has state , national , and international readership .
Be careful what you wish for .
Update : Help us defeat Rep. Caltagirone and go to Act Blue and help us elect a true liberal Democrat to this seat .
Reuters
THE past week has been a terrible one for America 's embattled president .
First , on June 28th , his own Republicans scuppered his cherished — and , in the view of this newspaper , enlightened and brave — plan to reform the country 's broken immigration system , decisively blocking it in the Senate .
Then a group of prominent Republican senators joined forces with the Democrats to speak out against his policy of reinforcing Iraq .
And on July 2nd George Bush brought fresh waves of vitriol down onto his own head , by annulling the 30 - month prison sentence given in June to a top White House aide , Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , for perjury and obstruction of justice .
Mr Libby , a former chief of staff to Dick Cheney , the vice - president , was convicted in May in a complicated case that revolved around the leaking of the name of an undercover CIA agent to newspapers .
It was claimed that this was an attempt to discredit the agent 's husband , a former diplomat who had challenged the Bush administration 's case that Saddam Hussein had been seeking materials to make nuclear weapons .
The court did not find that a crime had been committed in the leaking .
Disclosing the identity of an undercover agent is a serious offence , but only if the disclosure is deliberate .
But it did find that Mr Libby had been repeatedly untruthful in his answers to questions about the affair , rejecting his contention that these were honest errors of recollection .
Mr Bush did not pardon Mr Libby outright , saying that he accepted the verdict .
But he did quash his 30 - month sentence on the ground that it was too harsh ( though it was imposed by a judge Mr Bush had himself appointed , just as the case against Mr Libby had been brought by a prosecutor appointed by the administration ) .
Mr Libby now walks free , and his $ 250,000 fine will surely be met by the rich Republican supporters who campaigned for his pardon .
Yet perjury and obstruction of justice are very serious crimes .
Even Paris Hilton , the wags are noting , had to go to jail for a few days .
Of course , there is hypocrisy on all sides in this matter : Democrats ought to remember that Bill Clinton was never punished for having obviously perjured himself over his activities with Monica Lewinsky .
And commuting sentences and issuing pardons are constitutional rights of any president .
But they are ones that should be used sparingly : remember the Republican outrage when Mr Clinton pardoned Marc Rich , a fugitive financier , and his own half - brother Roger ?
A dangerous freedom
Mr Bush 's action serves to remind people of three of his weaknesses .
One of them is his tendency towards cronyism , which led him to appoint a wholly unqualified friend to run the government 's disaster - relief agency .
The consequences were disastrously manifest during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .
Other examples include his failed attempt to appoint his own lawyer , Harriet Miers , to the Supreme Court .
A second flaw is the hold that Mr Cheney appears to have over the man who is nominally his boss .
The past few days have seen a series of articles in the Washington Post detailing the extent to which Mr Cheney has talked Mr Bush into bypassing all normal channels of debate to take questionable decisions .
A third effect of the decision , and perhaps the most serious , is that it reinforces the perception that Mr Bush sees himself and his cronies as above the law .
Sometimes he has made this explicit , attaching “ signing statements ” to hundreds of bills sent to him by Congress asserting his right to interpret those bills as he deems fit .
Sometimes he has done so covertly , wire - tapping Americans with no authorisation or permitting the use of torture with consequences felt at Abu Ghraib and in secret CIA prisons in black holes like Uzbekistan .
Perhaps , in the end , Mr Bush 's decision came down to a simple calculation that he has little left to lose .
He is not seeking re-election , his approval ratings can barely go any lower , and any hopes for legacy - polishing bipartisan co-operation with Congress seem to have evaporated .
So why should Mr Bush not please his few remaining friends and placate his vice - president by springing the loyal Mr Libby ?
It makes a kind of sense , but a deeply troubling one .
What else , one wonders , might so isolated a president do before he goes ?
In 2005 , North Carolina State University paleontologist Mary Schweitzer made headlines when she reported finding soft tissue in the femur of a T. rex .
Until then , researchers believed that such tissue would have degraded eons ago .
Now Schweitzer ’s team has sequenced 68 - million - year - old collagen proteins from the T. rex , the oldest sequences ever reported .
They were similar to chicken collagen , adding to the mountain of evidence that dinosaurs are most closely related to birds .
“ Now we can compare these organisms at the sequence level , which is very powerful because you do n’t have to rely on what types of bones you ’re finding or how intact the fossil was , ” says Harvard University mass spectrometrist John Asara , who led the sequencing project .
Schweitzer ’s finding follows on the heels of another study led by Harvard biologist Chris Organ , who managed to estimate how much DNA dinosaurs had , despite the lack of any surviving genetic material .
Organ suspected that he could estimate the size of a dinosaur ’s genome indirectly by taking advantage of data from living animals .
In existing vertebrates , genome size correlates very closely with bone cell size , so Organ used the size of dinosaur bone cells to predict how much genetic material the extinct animals possessed .
According to Organ ’s analysis , the largest creatures ever to walk the earth had staggeringly small genomes , most comparable in size to . . . modern birds .
Previously , biologists assumed that birds ’ compact genomes emerged around the time they took to the skies , but now it seems that millions of years ago their ancestors had similarly puny genomes .
“ The genomic structure of birds ends up being — like feathers and parental care — not avian but dinosaurian in origin , ” Organ says .
BERKELEY , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
There 's a worldwide initiative to push out the de facto standard for the storage of word - processing documents , Microsoft Corp .'s " .doc " file format , and replace it with Open Document Format , a supposedly universal and open format .
This kind of sniping will never end as long as Microsoft is Microsoft MSFT , - 1.04 % .
Maybe it 's time to seriously think of breaking up the company into smaller companies .
The individual parts would flourish and benefit the stockholders to an extreme .
In the meantime , the attacks on Microsoft are set to continue the world over .
Some of the rationale is the fear outside the United States that Microsoft already has too much power .
There 's also the fear , which is discussed less , that Microsoft has been compromised by American spy agencies , and for all anyone knows secret documents saved in Word could be sent to the NSA with the push of a button .
This would be kind of like the zombie bot - networks that use compromised machines to send out spam .
The problem is that nobody has ever found any evidence of anything like this .
Microsoft worries less about Asia , since it has allowed rampant piracy of its products to continue unabated .
In this case , piracy is a weapon against Linux and open source .
But where 's the profit in this defensive measure ?
I love to tell the story about a speech I gave in Kuala Lumpur .
I asked a large audience of techies , " How many of you use Linux ? "
Something like two out of 500 of them raised their hands .
This is abnormally low anywhere in the world .
It turned out that you could buy any Microsoft product or any of its operating systems openly in retail storefronts for a $ 1 a disc .
" Why should we use Linux when Windows is free ? " I was told .
This is the equivalent of a holding pattern for a company that has too many balls in the air to deal with Asia properly , with a real strategy .
In Europe , where piracy is controlled , a few too many European countries and municipalities discuss using Linux on the desktop , by fiat .
This is Microsoft 's biggest fear .
Microsoft can tolerate the Linux server platforms and all the homebrew Web servers running Linux .
It just can not let Linux migrate to the desktop .
So the company obsesses on the possibility that there will be a groundswell of support for Linux and a desire for users to use it as their main OS .
I 'd argue that if Apple Inc. AAPL , - 0.75 % , with its appealing desktop platform and amazing marketing machine cannot unseat Microsoft , then how can the slow - moving open source manage to do it ?
Is it just because Linux is cheaper ?
The perception that Linux is a serious problem is there with Microsoft stuck in the mud , and the stock reflects it .
So after you look over the situation and look at the Microsoft share price , you have to wonder if the halcyon days of the stock doubling every year will ever return .
I have always believed that the best thing for Microsoft to do is break itself up into three or maybe four separate companies , and go from there .
It has distinct mini-corporations within the structure already .
“ You have to wonder if the halcyon days of the stock doubling every year will ever return . ”
This breakup would benefit the shareholders with diversity , and probably result in the sum of the parts being greater than the whole .
In other words , the separate businesses would be worth more overall than what we now have .
As things stand , Microsoft has become stodgy and rumpled .
I cannot imagine what would happen to the stock price if the company ever turned in a bad quarter .
And that has to happen someday .
I can assure you that when you read about Microsoft in the news , it 's a mundane story about the software giant 's defensive strategy against one thing or another .
It 's old .
Break up the company while it makes sense .
アイデンティティはオープンソースプログラマ
かずひこ
2007/5/17
自分のキャリアを考えることは、自分のアイデンティティを考えることにほかならない。自らのアイデンティティを「オープンソースプログラマ」と定め、オープンソースと自分の可能性を追いかけるために海を渡ったITエンジニアがいる。今回、そのITエンジニアが転職の経緯を語った。
■ 自己紹介
皆さんこんにちは。オープンソースプログラマのかずひこです。大学では建築を専攻しましたが、卒業後はグラフィックデザインの会社に就職し、その後、オブジェクト指向言語Rubyの作者まつもとゆきひろさんが勤める会社であるネットワーク応用通信研究所に転職。そして2007年4月にオープンソースERP「ERP5」の開発で世界的に知られるフランスのNexediに転職し、現在に至ります。
今回はそんな私の転職の経緯をご紹介します。皆さんの参考になれば幸いです。
■ Nexediとの出合い
NexediのCTO（最高技術責任者）は、おくじさんという日本人のエンジニアです。おくじさんはブートローダの「GNU GRUB」の開発者でもありますので、お世話になっている方もたくさんいるでしょう。
おくじさんとは前からずっとお会いしたいと思っていたので、おくじさんのブログで2006年の9月に一時帰国されると知ったとき、思い切って「関西でお会いしませんか」と聞いてみたところ、実際にお会いすることができました。
おくじさんと会う日に、関西のRuby勉強会でお世話になっている研究室がちょうどゼミ合宿をしていたので、おくじさんにそこで講演をしてもらうことになりました。
おくじさんの講演は、 「 フランスの真実 」 「 フランスとオープンソース 」
「オープンソースのプロになる」という3つのテーマによるお話で、「フランスの哲学『自由・平等・博愛』はオープンソースの精神に合致する」というお話が特に印象的でした。そして、話を聞く中でオープンソースソフトウェアを使うだけでなく、作る企業としてのNexediとそこでの仕事に興味を持ちました。
■ Nexediへの転職の決意
おくじさんと日本で会ったとき、たまたま私は自分のキャリアプランについて漠然と考え始めたころでしたが、その時点では海外企業ありきで転職を考えていたわけではありません。当時の私は、これからの自分が働く場の希望として以下の4つの選択肢を考えていました。
・松江 のRubyの会社（つまり残留）
・東京 のWeb 2.0 なPerlの会社
・東京の成長著し いRailsの会社
・フランスのオープンソース のPythonの会社（Nexedi）
ここで大切なのは、最初から転職をしようと思っていたのではなく、そのまま元の会社に残留することも十分に魅力的な選択肢の1つとしてあったことです。実際、これら4つの選択肢はどれも魅力的だったので、どうやって決めるのがいいか悩みました。そこで、どうせなら最も予測不可能な選択肢にチャレンジするのもいいかな？ と考えたのです。
それともう1つ、キャリアプランを真剣に考えようとすると、「自分のアイデンティティとは何か」を自分自身に問い掛けることを避けては通れません。当時の私を言葉で表現すると、「いろんなオープンソースソフトウェアの開発をしている、日本語を話すRubyプログラマ」というごちゃまぜな感じでした。そんな自分にとって一番のアイデンティティは何かを考え続けた結果、「日本語を話すから私なのか」「Rubyを使うから私なのか」ということは否定できたとしても、「オープンソースを愛するから私なのだ」ということだけはどうしても譲りたくないと感じました。そして、自分とオープンソースの未来のさらなる可能性を追いかけたいと強く思うようになりました。
そんなわけで、最もチャレンジングで、最もオープンソースのために働けて、ついでにフランスものは車でもワインでも映画でも音楽でも大好きという理由から、Nexediへの転職を決意したのです。
■ 選考の過 程
2006年の9月におくじさんから仕事の内容や会社の様子を聞いて興味を持った後、しばらくして、おくじさんから「うちのCEOもかずひこさんに興味を持っているので、レジュメ（履歴書）を送ってください」という電子メールをもらいました。そこで早速、英語で簡単な職歴とこれまでに携わってきたオープンソースプロジェクトについて記して送ったところ、「一度フランスで会えないか」ということになり、10月の終わりに家族（妻と当時9カ月の子ども）を連れて10日間フランスに行ってきました。
小さい子どもを連れていくのはむちゃな話ですが、もしかしたら住むことになるかもしれない街を家族みんなで見ておきたいと思ったので、私にとっては疑問の余地はありませんでした。
さて選考のプロセスですが、Nexediは高い技術力を持つ会社です。私も例外なしに技術テストがありました。CTOのおくじさんから与えられた課題は、とある問題を解くプログラムを作成するというものでしたが、私の場合は「短期間に新しい環境に適応できるかどうかも知りたい」という理由から、当時の私がほとんど知らなかった「 Pythonで書く」という制限が課せられました。
テストが終わりひと安心と思ったら、その翌日にCEOが「私もテストしたい」という話になり、「現在のシステムのボトルネックに対してどのような解決策が考えられるか」という課題が与えられました。この課題は、私の回答を評価するというよりは、どれくらいの時間でどういう考え方をするかを見たいという意図のものでした。
そして、限られた時間の中で自分なりにいくつかの案とその評価を提示した結果、幸い高い評価を受けることができました。
さらにいくつかのヒアリングを受けた後、CEOから私に対する評価と、その評価を基に私にしてもらいたいという仕事の範囲を聞きました。私はその評価が自分にとって妥当なものだと感じたので、Nexediで働くことに対する不安がかなり解消しました。
採用のプロセスは企業が私たちを評価する場だと考えがちです。しかし同時に、私たちが企業を評価する場でもあります。特に人事におけるセンスの良しあしは、その企業の将来を大きく左右します。そのため、自分の評価について満足できたことはとても重要なポイントだと思います。
■ Nexediでの毎日
フランスでの労働ビザの取得に時間がかかりましたが、4月中旬にようやく渡仏して、待ちに待ったNexediでの仕事が始まりました。
皆さんは、欧米の職場というと成果主義でみんな目がギラギラしていると想像しているかもしれません。私も少なからずそんなふうに予想していましたが、実際に入社してみるとその予想とはずいぶんと違うことが分かりました。
例えば出社時や退社時に、社内にいるメンバー全員と握手しながらあいさつをします。仕事中はほかのプロジェクトの人と会話することはあまりありませんが、社員間のコミュニケーションをみんながとても大切にしているように感じます。また、仕事の中でお互いの成果を評価するようなケースでも、若いフランス人のエンジニアは概して控えめな表現をしているように感じます。むしろ、同じ日本人であるおくじさんの方が、CTOという立場もあるのでしょうが、直截（ちょくせつ）な表現をしているくらいです。
社員間のコミュニケーションで用いる自然言語は、ケースバイケースです。メーリングリストは原則として英語（米語ではありません、念のため）です。口頭でのコミュニケーションはフランス人同士や日本人同士では母国語を使うこともありますが、周囲に聞こえることに意味のあるケースでは英語を用いています。実際、おくじさんと私もよく社内で英語で会話をしています。
■ やっぱり語学力はとても大事
社内は英語でいいとしても、一歩会社の外に出ると、そこは当然フランス語にあふれた環境です。よく「フランス人はいじわるだから英語を話してくれない」なんていいますが、日本でいきなり英語で話し掛けられても答えられない人がたくさんいるように、多くのフランス人も英語をほとんど話せないように感じます。
いずれにしても、語学力はコミュニケーションの基礎なのでとても大切です。例えば、「英語が苦手なので海外で仕事なんてあり得ない」という人がいるかもしれません。しかし人生いつ何が起きるか分かりません。「語学力が弱い」というだけの理由で自分の可能性を狭めるのは本当にもったいないことだと思います。
■ リスクを乗り越えてチャレンジするには
私の性格は、怖がり屋さんのくせにチャレンジャーですから、本当に怖い思いをしてばっかりの人生です。そんな私にとって今回のチャレンジは「ちょっとやりすぎたかも……」と内心びびっていたりもします。でも、たった一度っきりの人生です。こんな思い切ったチャレンジの機会に出合えたことを感謝しながら、今日も楽しくフランスで暮らしています。
また、海外の中小企業に勤めるのはリスクのあることではないかと聞かれることがあります。しかし、私はエンジニアですので、いわば商売道具を常に持ち歩いているようなもの。もし仮にある日突然会社がなくなったとしても、それは自分の人生のリスクではないと考えています。もちろんそう考えるためには最低限の自信が必要で、いまはそう思えない人もいるかもしれませんが、そう思えるような自信をできるだけ早く身に付けられるといいんじゃないかなと思います。
大企業で働こうと、中小企業で働こうと、独立して働こうと、多かれ少なかれいろんなリスクはあります。それに対するチャレンジもあるでしょう。そのときに、リスクを乗り越えてチャレンジに成功するだけのスキルと勇気と幸運が皆さんにありますように。

ふぇみにん日 記
This is another entry in my ongoing series of articles I have been writing for GreenOptions .
Check out GreenOptions every Wednesday to see my newest article , check this site for last weeks article .
I used to work for a renewable energy contractor .
We would get calls from people all the time who wanted to install solar panels , solar thermal panels , wind turbines , even geothermal systems .
The very first questions we asked were , what is your current lighting system , your current heating system , the amount of insulation in the homeâ€ ¦it was around this point that they would interrupt us and ask what any of this has to do with the shiny new solar panels they want on the roof .
Solar panels are cool , they are the slick blue pimps of the renewable energy world .
The concept is just so simple , shine sun on panel , get electricity .
They have no moving parts , work for ever ( 25 - 50 + years ) and are pretty easy to put up .
What isnâ€™t so sexy is making sure your walls have the proper amount of insulation , and that you replace all your old fashion light bulbs with CFLâ€™s .
People get so caught up in the image of â€œfreeâ€ power from the sun , or the wind that they forget that the cheapest energy is the energy you donâ€™t use .
For every dollar you spend on home efficiency you will save three to five dollars on your renewable energy system .
It is that simple .
Use less energy ; buy fewer solar panels to supply that energy .
So what should you do to get your house into fighting shape ?
Here is a quick check list of things you should have done before you even think about installing a renewable energy system on your home .
In fact these steps will save you money even if you donâ€™t intend to install a renewable energy system on your home .
Lighting and appliances :
Make sure you are using the most efficient lighting you can .
That most often means compact fluorescent and perhaps LED lighting .
You can replace the old incandescent lights without waiting for them to burn out and still realize a significant savings .
With large appliances like washers , dryers , refrigerators , water heaters , sump pumps , most people wait till the old one breaks .
However when it comes time to buy that new stove , spending 100 extra dollars to get the energy efficient one will save you far more over the lifetime of the product .
Insulation and weather sealing :
You want your home to be as sealed as possible against both the cold and the heat .
This means weather sealing windows and doors ( or even replacing them if you have the money to more insulated ones ) .
Getting the attic re-insulated ( or insulated ) sealing up the foundation and basement , and perhaps blowing in insulation into the walls .
In order to determine what kind of work you need , I recommend that you get an energy audit .
Many utilities or municipalities offer then for free or for a low fee .
Even if you have to pay for one it is money well spent .
Finding out that your home has no insulation on one whole side because it was built 100 years ago and whoever built the house ran out of money for insulation half way though is something you want to know about .
Roofing :
If properly installed a solar system could last at least 25 years .
How old is your roof ?
If your roof is in need of new shingles , or needs other repair , there is no point in putting a solar system on the roof that is going to need to be removed in five year to re-shingle .
It is much cheaper to install the solar system while you install the new shingles , than to do the two separately
Home ownerâ€™s associations and neighbors :
Do you live in a historic district ?
What is your HOAâ€™s policy on solar roofs ?
Before you spend your money on the solar panels , invest in a little research and neighborly friendliness .
Many historic districts were made in the 70â€ ™s during the first oil crisis and many have bylaws dealing with renewable energy .
Some only apply if your home is visible from the street .
Some require a permit .
Bring a pitcher of lemonade over to the neighborâ€™s house and have a discussion with them about your plans for a solar panels system on the roof .
Bring some pictures of other such installations .
Who knows you might even have a good time .
This step is especially important if you plan on installing a wind turbine , or if your neighbors trees shade your roof .
It is often possible to trim a tree without cutting it down in order to free up a little sunshine for your roof ; a skilled arborist can handle this problem .
Spending the time and energy talking with your neighbors will not only make you some friends , it will save you a lot of hassle , headaches , and money in the long run .
Heating system :
The one thing I heard more than any other was â€ œI want to get solar panels , and then use electrical heating to heat my home .â€ 
This seems so logical , solar panels make electricity , use the electricity to heat your home , a match made in heaven .
It is true that electrical heat is very efficient , meaning that of all the electricity that you feed into the system a very large portion of it goes towards actually heating your home .
The only problem is that a very large amount of electricity has to go into the system .
We are trying to get the home to use as little energy as possible .
Electric heat is not the way to got .
That goes for electric water heaters as well .
If money was no object I would suggest you switch to radiant floor solar thermal heating .
No only will the bathroom floor be nice and warm in the middle of winter , but your cats will love it as well .
If you canâ€™t go with radiant floor , gas heat is the second best .
One thing for sure is , you want to have your heating system as efficient as money and resources will allow .
Once you have tackled all of these issues , THEN you are ready to call up your handy renewable energy installer and get those super cool solar panels .
Spending a significant amount of money on home efficiency improvements will radically reduce the size ( number of solar panels , size of wind turbine etc ) and therefore the cost of your renewable energy system .
It will also lower your monthly bills making the payback time on your investment that much quicker .
Seoul 's fears over North Korea delayed the command transfer
The agreement ends a 50 - year pact that gave the US wartime command of South Korea 's army , dating to the Korean War .
Under pressure in Iraq , the US had wanted to hand over in 2009 .
But South Korea pushed for a slower transition .
The US currently has 29,500 troops on the Korean peninsula and Seoul 's military numbers 680,000 .
North Korea has more than one million troops .
Troop redeployment
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates and South Korean Defence Minister Kim Jang
Soo made the announcement after talks in Washington on Friday .
They agreed on a transition " road map " starting in July and ending with a military exercise in March 2012 .
" The two sides will disestablish the current ROK - US Combined Forces Command on April 17 , 2012 and complete the transition to the new supporting - supported command relationship between US and ROK forces at the same time , " the US said in a statement after the meeting .
The US has reduced its troop numbers in South Korea by 10,000 , down from 40,000 when US President George W. Bush came to power .
It plans to further reduce this number to 25,000 by 2008 .
But Seoul 's fears over North Korea 's nuclear and missile tests last year were a factor in delaying the transfer until 2012 .
A South Korean parliamentary committee this week opposed making any transfer of command until security was stabilised in the region .
The countries also agreed to speed up relocating US military headquarters in South Korea from Seoul to Pyeongtaek , about 65 km ( 40 miles ) south of Seoul .
South Korea ceded control of its military to a US - led UN force during the Korean War , which ended with a ceasefire in 1953 .
It was given peacetime command of its forces in 1994 but the US would still take over should war break out on the peninsula .
( ARD report on The Monitor translated as a public service to prevent other family tragedies ) Terrorism : How the Turkish Workers Party attracts recruits under the noses of the BND and Interior Police ( Rough and Ready Translation ) Sonia Mikich : Recruiting for the war .
How a young man from a nice family was led astray – and to the battle in far way Iran .
Incidentally as a consequence , we asked ourselves who practices these terrorist attacks on Iran from the ostensibly peaceful Northern Iraq .
There is a secret war there unnoticed by the world and tolerated by the Americans .
The clues led to Germany , to Cologne as Stephan Buchen and John Goetz found out .
They met extremists who proselytize young people under the noses of our secret services , completely in the shadows .
Langenfeld North Rhine - Westphalia
The K family has lived here for 34 years .
The parents feel happy and safe in Germany .
However the major conflicts in the Middle East have intruded into their everyday life .
Their son Sertan has been missing for the last eight months .
Photographs from happy times .
His mobile [ phone ] does n’t answer anymore .
He was a student at the higher vocational school in Leverkusen - Opladen .
Today Sertan is 21 years old .
The parents have n’t heard from their son for 8 months .
We found the son in north eastern Iraq , near the Iranian border , in one of the most dangerous crisis zones in the world .
In this mountain zone he is learning the trade of the Guerrilla .
Sertan :
We call the weapon Karnas .
It is a sniper rifle for assassinations .
I was specially trained for assassinations of great generals .
Sertan belongs to an organization called PJAK , the party of a New Life in Kurdistan .
Unnoticed by the rest of the world a war is happening here .
The young recruits push into Iran and carry out attacks .
Sertan : Especially with explosives , with mines .
The mines are prepared ….
So that we can detonate them from a distance by radio .
They are being developed .
We have trained specialists Bomb Experts .
Three months ago the friends attacked and killed 13 - 14 soldiers of the Iranian Army .
Your son a Terrorist .
Ready to die for the Kurdish cause ?
The family learns form us where Sertan is .
They are speechless .
Mother ( translation ) I feel very bad I want my son to come back .
I am upset .
Sister of Sertan :
He promised mother that he would stay here .
He has n’t kept his promise .
Ideological indoctrination :
We observe how Sertan and other recruits are made enthusiastic for the battle .
The Commander preaches about the bullets of the guerrilla which will light up the darkness .
He demands from the young men and women self - sacrifice , praises the picture of martyrs .
Sertan the boy from Langenfeld takes copious notes .
This is how he is brought on line so quickly .
The high ideals of PJAK can be reached : Overthrow of the Iranian Government , Installation of democracy , and freedom for the Kurds in Iran The Kurdish guerrillas control a small strip in the north of the US Occupied Iraq .
They send fighters across the border from here .
They are believed to have killed at least 200 people in the last two years in attacks .
PJAK a pseudonym , as the organization owes allegiance to Abdulla Ocalan the boss of the Kurdish Workers party PKK .
It is proscribed in Europe and the US as a terrorist organization .
Food rations is all Sertan gets for his work .
His rise to fighter started in NRW .
He was recruited there by PKK members he told us .
He spent three months in a PKK camp in Belgium .
Eventually he landed here with two young Kurds of German nationality .
Sertan : More and more are coming from Germany .
From Germany , from Norway , from Sweden we already had two or three new members .
But especially from Germany and France Formal Parade of the recruits in front of the Boss of PJAk Address of Haji Ahmadi Boss of PJAK : I am very happy that you are ready for this holy battle says Haji Ahmadi .
The Kurds provide an example of what it means to fight to the last man .
Haji Ahmadi sees great times coming for his organization .
It receives protection from the highest levels .
American generals in Iraq look not unfavorably on his activities .
They have visited his camp and walked together with respect .
We have positive effects for the Americans .
We have the whole mountain chain from Armenia and Azerbaijan under our control .
If we were n’t here then the Islamists would take over .
Reporter :
You mean to say that essentially you are supported by the Americans .
Haji : 100 % Is that is why the flow of new fighters from Europe works so smoothly ?
Haji : Many Kurdish youths and girls are joining the fight from Europe .
Many go to Northern Kurdistan and also to turkey Haji Ahmadi is always temporarily visiting his people in North Iraq .
His main residence is Cologne NRW .
He has a German passport he says .
He makes contact from here with western politicians and intelligence services .
Even the BND have visited him .
Haji Ahmadi :
He was a young man and said he was from the BND .
He asked the same questions you are asking .
Reporter :
But that means that the German authorities know what you are doing , who you are and what your objectives are .
Haji :
They know exactly what I am doing I have been in Europe for 43 years mostly in Germany ……
BND and Interior Police confirmed that they know PJAK and are watching them .
Are young people being recruited for the war against Iran in Germany ?
We asked Representative Hans Christian Stroeble a member of the parliamentary intelligence oversight committee .
He suspects that severe consequences might befall the authorities .
Stroeble :
If the suspicion exists of illegal activities and especially such extremely illegal activities as terrorist links to overseas or the recruiting of for a foreign power then the German Justice authorities are obliged to report and investigate the matter and see if enough evidence exists for charges .
So far no sign of action by the Federal authorities .
Setan ’s family want their son back , but they are afraid that the PKK will do something to their son
Seltan ’s father :
The PKK told me should n’t call the police .
Sertan is well .
We have n’t called the police because we thought that could put our son ’s life in danger .
The German authorities offer no help .
To get his son back they have to trust the PKK .
So far without result .

The price for something like this can go up to $ 300 , depending on the design .
When the founders called the site TorrentSpy , this is n't what they had in mind .
In a recent court ruling , made public last week , a federal judge ordered TorrentSpy.com to track the behavior of its own users - a means of gathering evidence in a lawsuit against the site by the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) .
On Friday , the judge granted a stay of the order , and TorrentSpy plans to appeal .
The MPAA filed suit against TorrentSpy in February last year , accusing the BitTorrent - based site of facilitating illegal downloads of copyrighted material .
The new court order requires the site to turn over server logs of user activity , including IP addresses and downloaded files .
TorrentSpy already collects this data in memory , but never saves it to disk .
The site says that keeping server logs would violate its privacy policy .
" We have succeeded in delaying the court order to turn on logs while we appeal it .
TorrentSpy will not create logs of what you do on the site without your consent , " reads an open letter from the site to its users .
" We are dedicated to your privacy .
We are fighting for your rights . "
With the order , Judge Jacqueline Chooljian , a federal judge in the Central District of California , argues that TorrentSpy is not protected by its privacy policy .
" The key detail in the order is that the site can't rely on a self - serving privacy policy as a means of avoiding its obligation to provide evidence , " says Ian Ballon , a California intellectual property lawyer and the author of Ecommerce and Internet Law : Treatise With Forms .
What 's more , the ruling orders TorrentSpy to " mask " the IP addresses it provides to court , so they can't be associated with particular people .
" So [ TorrentSpy ] would n't be violating anyone 's privacy anyway , " says Todd Bonder , a new media copyright expert with the international law firm Rosenfeld , Meyer , and Susman .
He expects the decision to be upheld .
If the decision is upheld , some believe it 's capable of eroding end - user privacy across the Net. Before Judge Choijian 's ruling , no US company has been required to log memory data and turn it over to a court as evidence .
" We think it 's a very troubling ruling that goes well beyond TorrentSpy , " says Fred von Lohmann , a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a privacy watchdog .
" It potentially allows any company 's privacy policy to be re-written by its adversary 's lawyers .
It 's a bad precedent to set . " ®

Notes marked NB from SDS were added by Sam Steingold .
Step 1 : Compile CLISP
On Linux , you need to have built your CLISP with the -- with - module=bindings / glibc option , and you should make sure that you have it compiled with readline .
See the CLISP build instructions and Makefile .
Step 2 : Make CLISP a valid shell
Put /usr / bin / clisp ( or /usr / local / bin / clisp ) in /etc / shells so it looks ( something ) like this :
# /etc/shells : valid login shells #/ bin/ash / bin / bash / bin/sh /usr / bin/ clisp
Step 3 : Modify your PATH to be able to run X
You can set up your $ PATH in /etc / login.defs by modifying the entry for ENV_PATH to look ( something ) like this :
ENV_PATH PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin
Once you have your CLISP shell set up , you can control the environment variables ( on Linux ) via the glibc bindings ( see $ {clisp-src}/modules/bindings/glibc/linux.lisp ) : setenv , putenv , getenv , etc .
NB from SDS
CLISP has a setf able built - in ext:getenv , e.g. , ( setf ( ext:getenv " foo " ) " bar " ) .
Step 4 : start X
The startx command is a shell script , so we can not use it .
As a temporary fix , I have defunned thus :
( defun startx ( ) ( execute " /usr/X11R6/bin/xinit " ) )
Which works for me .
Although I have n't investigated all the consequences of not going via shell 's startx .
Also I do not use GNOME or KDE which may complicate things for you if you do .
I use fvwm2 and have this in my .xinitrc :
exec fvwm2
Once CLISP is set up , you will also be able to type :
> #[ xinit ]
from Lisp to start X .
NB from SDS
You should be able to run a shell script using the CLISP built - in function ext : shell .
Step 5 : set up the reader macro
For conveniently running external programs ( i.e. , I do not want to have to type ( run-program " ls " :arguments ' ( " - lh " ) ) every time ) I have set up a read macro .
Put the following in somefile.lisp :
( set-macro- character # \ ] ( get-macro-character # \ ) ) ) ( set-dispatch-macro - character #\# # \ [ ( lambda ( stream char1 char2 ) ( declare ( ignore char1 char2 ) ) ( setf ( readtable - case * readtable * ) : preserve ) ( unwind - protect ( let ( ( command - line ( read - delimited - list # \ ] stream t ) ) ) ( list ' ext : run - program ( princ - to - string ( car command - line ) ) : arguments `' , ( mapcar #' princ - to - string ( rest command - line ) ) ) ) ( setf ( readtable - case * readtable * ) : upcase ) ) ) )
NB from SDS
I heavily modified this macro .
Note that ext : run - program will not execute shell scripts , while ext : shell will invoke a shell for each command - these are the trade - offs .
Step 6 : set up the readline shortcut
It 's also a PITA to have to type " # [ " and " ] " everytime you want to run a command , so add the following in your $ HOME /. inputrc :
# for clash : prints the square brackets to run an external command " \ec " : " # [ ] \ C- b "
When you type ESC-c ( or META - c ) readline will print " # [ ] " to the console and put the cursor inside the brackets .
If you are running CLISP as your shell , and do this , you will then be able to run programs ( more or less ) normally .
You will need to escape the dot in any filenames that start with a dot , e.g. ,
> #[cat \.xinitrc ]
and sometimes ( eek ) a colon .
Step 7 : try it out
Do NOT modify your /etc / passwd yet !
Start up a clisp with
$ clisp - K full - i somefile.fas
Hit ESC c , type ls -l , hit Enter and see if it works .
You do not have command line completion for external programs inside the read - macro .
So hitting tab will just give you a list of all CLISP 's possibilties , which is not much use here .
However , ext :run - program ( which is part of what 's hiding behind the read macro ) does search your path for executables so you do n't have to do #[ / bin/ls - l ]
NB from SDS
There are CLISP built - ins like ext : dir and ext:cd , and most other shell built - ins can be implemented in CLISP pretty easily .
Step 8 : Dump a memory image
If you are happy , and think you can live with this setup then you must do the following :
Dump a memory image from a CLISP with the read macro and any convenience stuff loaded , as described in impnotes .
Make a backup of /usr / [ local ] / lib/ clisp .
( wherever yours is installed )
Rename the " base " directory in /usr / lib / clisp to " orig - base " .
Now rename the " full " directory to " base " .
Replace the memory image in your new " base " directory with the one you dumped .
Step 9 : Dive in !
Change your /etc / passwd to reflect your new shell .
Light 13 candles in a circle round your Linux box , Sacrifice a white rooster , invoke Saint IGNUcious and ...
Login again .
If you start pining for Bash , you can run :
> #[ bash ]
You will have to explicitly source all your configuration files ( . profile etc )
TODO
Get indentation on the command line .
Do command redirection .
Get name completion for arguments which are filenames .
Have fun ,

July 9th , 2007 by skippy
This story is specifically why people I know thought I should keep writing stuff .
It never made it to my list , seek because I never received any orders governing it .
Early on in my military career , way back when I was a PFC , my Battalion would occasionally have “ Fun Runs ” .
A Fun Run is just like running for several miles .
Except that it ’s fun .
Because people that outrank you say so .
This is pretty much the Army equivalent to declaring “ Our office is so much fun !
On Friday we get to wear Hawaiian shirts ! ”
It ’s awesome if you happen to love Hawaiian shirts , but just kinda sucks if you have taste .
One of the features of the Fun Run was that afterward the Battalion would gather together and hold a pie auction .
The point of the pie auction was that if you bought a pie , you could pick any soldier who was present , and hit them with the pie .
So as you can imagine , an awful lot of repressed rage got transferred into pie kinetics after these runs .
The important thing to know here is that by tradition , the first pie always got thrown at the Battalion Commander .
This whole exercise was to raise money for the Battalion Family Support Group .
In theory , this was an organization that would help the families of deployed soldiers manage during the long separations that military life often inflicts .
But in reality , FSG was more like a cross between the homeowners association from a sit-com , and a social club for unemployable wives of military officers .
And when I say social club , imagine the kind that gets taken down a peg by a scrappy band of misfits in an 80 ’s comedy movie .
To sum this up : the Family Support Group was not very popular with most of the soldiers .
The night before one of these delightful Fun Runs , I received special instructions .
“ Bring in a pie for the auction . ”
I ’m not sure how much the pay has gone up , but back in those days if a Private First Class had a child he automatically qualified for food stamps .
So I did n’t have much money .
And most of what I did have was generally earmarked for important things , like strippers and alcohol , and more strippers .
Purchase Levitra on the recommendation at http://howmed.net/order-levitra-vardenafil/ and forget about erectile dysfunction .
A pie does n’t cost that much I guess .
But it was the principle that bothered me .
The Army has billions of dollars and I have barely any .
And now they want me to buy stuff for them .
Now technically , it was n’t an order .
It would be against regulations for my supervisor to * order * me to spend my own money on the Family Support Group .
It was just , technically , a suggestion .
And it ’s just peachy to make suggestions .
And if soldiers choose not to follow the suggestions , well , someone has to be assigned to that toilet cleaning detail .
So that night , I went out and I bought a premade pie crust .
And a tub of Cool Whip .
And then I stopped by a Korean grocery store and purchased a whole , frozen squid .
And sprinkles .
I got back to the barracks , and started the preparations for the morning .
Which pretty much just means I started thawing the squid in a shower stall .
My roommate was a bit surprised when he got back .
“ Is that a squid in our shower ? ”
“ Yep . ”
“ What ’s it doing in there . ”
“ Thawing . ”
“ Goodnight . ”
The next morning I packed it all in a cooler , and set out for the Fun Run .
After about three miles of fun the Battalion gathered for the auction .
I quickly assembled the secret weapon , and added it to the pie table .
I then notified the auctioneer about my special pie .
Of course she selected my pie for the first auction .
The bidding started fairly briskly , as many people wanted to hit our Commander with a pie .
But soon enough bidding started to peter out , and that ’s when the auctioneer let everyone in on the secret .
“ This is a special pie . ”
“ What ’s so special about it ? ” called someone in the crowd .
“ It ’s a squid pie . ”
“ I beg your pardon ? ” said the Commander
“ I said it ’s a squid pie sir . ”
“ There ’s no such thing . ”
So she reached in , pulled out a tentacle , and waved at the Commander with it .
“ WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ? ” asked the Commander with , all things considered , a reasonable tone of voice .
“ It ’s a tentacle sir . ”
“ PIE DOESN ’T HAVE TENTACLES ! ”
“ Normally you ’d be correct .
But this is a squid pie sir . ”
And the bidding immediately picked up again .
My pie raised close to five hundred dollars , which was a new record for the pie auction .
I did n’t get into any trouble because nobody wanted to look like a bad sport .
And I got to watch my CO take a high velocity mollusk to the kisser , which is a good morning no matter what branch of the military you are in .

That single word has come to sum up the very best of football .
It stands for artistry , inspiration and genius , for the combination of sublime individual skill and collective fluidity to create a whole that is both beautiful to watch and devastatingly successful .
The country has produced 50 years ' worth of great players - Garrincha , Pele , Jairzinho , Tostao , Socrates and Zico to name but a few .
Having won the World Cup a record five times , not surprisingly Brazil head into the 2006 tournament as the hot favourites to lift the trophy this summer .
More than that , though , with outstanding individual talents such as Ronaldo , Ronaldinho and Kaka orchestrating the team , there are also high expectations they will produce more moments that will live on in football legend .

But how does Brazil produce so many great teams and wonderful players ?
With the help of some of the country 's biggest football names , BBC Sport finds out what makes Brazil so good .
A NATIONAL OBSESSION
The story of Brazil 's domination of world football starts with the sport 's uniquely important position in national life .
" The national football team , " says its coach Carlos Alberto Parreira , " is the symbol of national identity , the only time the nation gets together . "
Football is the single most important thing in Brazilian national life " Football in Brazil is like a religion , " adds Carlos Alberto Torres , captain of the side that won the 1970 World Cup .
" Everybody talks about it all the time - not only now we are close to the World Cup .
" This is the difference between Europe and Brazil .
After the World Cup , people in Europe start to think about life , business .
Here in Brazil , we breathe football 24 hours a day . "
According to Parreira , no - one is quite sure why .
" Sociologists , psychologists have tried to explain , but nobody can find one reason , " he says .
" Maybe because we did n't have to fight for independence , we do n't have earthquakes or things like that .
We did n't go to war . "
Journalist Alex Bellos , author of Futebol - A Brazilian Way of Life , believes it was also due to the relatively late abolition of slavery at the end of the 19th century , and a lack of positive symbols .
Whatever the reason , Brazil very early " recognised football in our future and tradition and ( as ) our opportunity to communicate to the world that we are powerful , " says 1994 World Cup winner Leonardo .
" In the 1930s , we started to organise a team to be competitive in the World Cup , and the 1950s were the beginning of this big dream to make Brazil the best international team in the world , " he added .
Losing the final to Uruguay in 1950 was viewed as a national tragedy , but it only heightened the desire to win .
And it led to a little - known aspect of Brazilian football .
Believing they had let themselves down through personal weakness and a lack of research , the national side came to see comprehensive preparation and innovative tactics as crucial to success .
There are no more players from the beach or from the street - this is a myth , a legend
Carlos Alberto Parreira
Brazil coach Contrary to the popular belief that Brazilian teams are defensively naive , the idea of the modern back four originated in the 1958 World Cup - winning team .
Through a careful evolution of the way they played , Brazil continued to have a tactical lead until 1970 .
Allied to detailed planning and a concentration on physical training beyond that in Europe - not to forget the sheer quality of players - Brazil 's plan met with unprecedented success .
They won three of the four World Cups between 1958 and 1970 .
A UNIQUE COUNTRY
Having an entire nation obsessed with football and , by extension , winning the World Cup , has developed a degree of self - fulfilment .
For some children , sport is the only way out of poverty in Brazil Brazil is a big country - 183 m people - and that is a lot of potential footballers , especially when , as Parreira says , " the whole of Brazil " is playing the game .
But for some in Brazil football is more than just a game .
It is , says journalist Lito Cavalcanti , a " life solution " .
Many of Brazil 's greatest footballers grew up in favelas - the shanty towns in its sprawling cities .
Here , life is hard , and football offers an escape from the crippling poverty .
" It 's the only way out of misery , " says Cavalcanti .
" The lower classes have no effective schooling .
They live in favelas where drug dealers control their lives .
Sport is the only way out , and in Brazil football is the only sport people care about .
" What makes them so good ?
Necessity .
It 's the only life they have ahead of them .
That is their drive . "
A DIFFERENT GAME Carlos Alberto Torres recently received a Fifa award for the most beautiful goal to have been scored in World Cup history - his thunderbolt in Brazil 's 4 - 1 win over Italy in the 1970 World Cup final .
Nine Brazilians were involved in the move , with Rivelino , Jairzinho and Pele providing memorable cameos before the coup de grace - Alberto 's unstoppable shot .
The idea of the system and the collective is different - the system is more important in Europe than it is in Brazil
Leonardo
Brazil World Cup winner 1994
" Now I realise how beautiful and how important that goal was , " said Alberto .
Alberto was just 25 when he scored that goal , but his artistry had been honed day - by - day , week - by - week , year - by - year as a young child .
In Brazil children learn football in a very different way from their European counterparts .
There are no leagues or competitive matches for young children - such a concept is seen as likely to hinder a player 's creative impulses .
" The children play a lot but it 's always very free , " says Leonardo .
Watch how Ronaldinho does his tricks
" We do n't tell eight - year - olds you have to play right - back . "
Parreira agrees : " We do n't put them in a cage , say ' you have to be like this ' .
We give them some freedom until they are ready to be coached . "
And that sense of creativity is never lost .
Being the world 's number one requires years of hard work " In Europe if you are dancing in the team bus before a World Cup final match it would be viewed as not concentrating , " says Leonardo .
" But in Brazil if you are not speaking and laughing on the bus that is seen as being afraid .
" It is a different mentality .
The idea of the system and the collective is different .
The system is more important in Europe than it is in Brazil , even if we know it is important . "
Brazil 's success , though , stems from more than talent and the freedom to express it - behind Ronaldinho 's gleaming smile lies hours of hard work .
" The English academy system is one where players are training for just four hours a week , " says Brazilian football expert Simon Clifford .
" Compare that to Ronaldinho when he was a 16 - year - old with Gremio , where he would have been training for up to 20 hours a week .
" Parreira adds : " In Brazil players are fabricated , they are produced .
We say in Brazil that a great player is born every day
Carlos Alberto
1970 World Cup winning captain " They come to the clubs when they are 10 - 12 and then they start in categories according to age .
" There are no more players from the beach or from the street .
This is a myth , a legend .
They are built , grown in the clubs . "
Tactically , too , Brazil remain to this day very different from other international sides .
Former Republic of Ireland coach Brian Kerr says Brazil are unique in international football .
" The only two players who are really defenders are the centre - backs , " says Kerr .
" The shape of the team is 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 , with the full - backs playing high up the pitch .
" That is how they would line up , but after that anything could happen that might lead them to have three wide players on the left .
Can anyone stop this bunch of geniuses winning the World Cup ?
" It was different from anything I had seen and it was the quality of the players that allowed them to do that . "
Brazil 's football production - line has its fair share of casualties - Ronaldo was the only player from the under - 17 Brazilian team who went on to become a professional .
Only the very best make it through to Brazil 's starting 11 to display their extravagant skills on the world 's stage .
As Brazilian journalist Emerson Vicente points out , Lyon midfielder Juninho would be an automatic choice for most international sides , but he is unlikely to start for Brazil in the World Cup .
In Ronaldinho , Adriano , Kaka , Ronaldo and Robinho , Brazil have five potential match winners - most teams are happy to have just one such player in their side .
And success has bred success for more than half a century .
" You go to the schools here , " says Carlos Alberto Torres , " and you see the kids saying I want to be like Ronaldo or Pele or Zico .
" They are examples to the kids - and we have lots of them , not only one or two .
" We say in Brazil that a great player is born every day . "
That might well be so .
But just as important is that Brazil 's unique environment ensures they actually become one .

Forget beanie babies , Tickle Me Elmo and babbling Spongebobs , the must - have toy for politicos this Christmas season is a talking George W Bush doll .
That 's right .
Dubya has a doll , or rather an " action figure " featuring some 17 Bushisms , from patriotic to painful .
The California creator of the Dubya doll has been overwhelmed with orders and interview requests .
Better hurry .
You will have to order on the website soon to guarantee delivery by Christmas .
Bushisms
The super - smiley presidential poppet utters some of Mr Bush 's inspiring statements after the 11 September attacks in his own voice .
" Freedom itself was attacked by a faceless coward , and freedom will be defended , " the doll says at a push of a button .
Sales of the dolls really took off when they were featured on the Drudge Report website and described as the " hottest political stocking - stuffer this holiday season " by the conservative Washington Times newspaper .
You 're working hard to put food on your family
One of the doll 's 17 Dubya soundbites
But even Democrats can find something to love .
The doll also features some of Mr Bush 's infamous gaffes , such as , " You 're working hard to put food on your family . "
And it is the buzz of Washington .
One Washington DJ lists the George W Bush talking " action figure " on her list of holiday gift suggestions , right up there with a Victoria 's Secret musical holiday thong , which plays a medley of carols at the touch of a button .
Flying off the shelves
The Dubya talking action figure is the brain child of John Warnock .
When he is not coming up with in demand dolls , he remodels garages .
But he and his father - in - law have been inundated and he has had to hire a publicist to handle all the media requests for interviews .
Mr Warnock had 20,000 of the dolls made in a factory in China , and he said he is selling them by the thousands .
He is already in talks with several retailers who want the $ 30 doll on their shelves , including mega - retailer Wal - Mart .
And politically oriented stores in Washington are being overwhelmed by shoppers looking for the doll .
" I 've been taking calls about it all morning , " said Linda Gross , a manager for Made in America , which sells political and patriotic gifts in Washington 's Union Station .
She expected a shipment of the dolls in the next day and expects it will be on store shelves before the end of the week .
The store 's website , Americastore.com , has already been selling the doll , said district manager Andrea McNiff .
" The interest has been phenomenal .
We download the orders every hour , and we continue to double our orders " hour to hour , she said .
They have already sold thousands of the dolls through their website , and shoppers have overwhelmed their offices with calls .
What does Dubya think about his action figure ?
No comment yet .
Mr Warnock sent an e-mail to the White House but has yet to receive a reply .
UTRECHT , The Netherlands ( Reuters ) - Dutch researchers are trying to grow pork meat in a laboratory with the goal of feeding millions without the need to raise and slaughter animals .

Dutch researchers are trying to grow pork meat in a laboratory with the goal of feeding millions without the need to raise and slaughter animals .
REUTERS / File
“ We ’re trying to make meat without having to kill animals , ” Bernard Roelen , a veterinary science professor at Utrecht University , said in an interview .
Although it is in its early stages , the idea is to replace harvesting meat from livestock with a process that eliminates the need for animal feed , transport , land use and the methane expelled by animals , which all hurt the environment , he said .
“ Keeping animals just to eat them is in fact not so good for the environment , ” said Roelen .
“ Animals need to grow , and animals produce many things that you do not eat . ”
Developed nations are expected to consume an average of 43 kg per capita of poultry , beef , pork and other meats this year , an amount that rises around 2 percent annually , data from the United Nations ’ Food and Agriculture Organisation shows .
Asked whether people would be repulsed by lab - grown meat , Roelen said he believed there would be enough demand , as much of what people eat today is already extensively processed , from the feed that animals consume to the conditions under which they are raised and the preparation of meat after slaughter .
“ I can imagine that some people will have problems with it , ” he said .
“ People might think it is artificial .
But some people might not realize that some part of the meat they eat is artificial . ”
Research is also under way in the United States , including one experiment funded by U.S. space agency NASA to see whether meat can be grown for astronauts during long space missions .
But it will take years before meat grown in labs and eventually factories reaches supermarket shelves .
And so far , Roelen and his team have managed to grow only thin layers of cells that bear no resemblance to pork chops .
Under the process , researchers first isolate muscle stem cells , which have the ability to grow and multiply into muscle cells .
Then they stimulate the cells to develop , give them nutrients and exercise them with electric current to build bulk .
After perfecting that process , scientists will then need to figure out how to layer tissues to add more bulk , since meat grown in petri dishes lacks the blood vessels needed to deliver nutrients through thick muscle fibers .
And then there is the question of fat , to add flavor .
DECADES AGO , I clutched an official New York state examination booklet as a proctor threatened me and hundreds of my nervous schoolmates with a felony conviction if we cheated .
We dutifully signed a statement that declared we would not .
Students still sign declarations on examination booklets , but the lingo has changed .
Choice is now in .
The official blue examination booklet at UCLA , where I teach , requires students to affix their signatures to a clause swearing that they have not committed “ academic dishonesty . ”
The penalty for transgression , it warns , is suspension or dismissal .
Yet instead of dropping it there , the credo continues and the tone shifts .
“ There are alternatives to academic dishonesty , ” it suggests , and counsels that the student see a professor or dean “ to discuss other choices . ”
“ Discuss other choices ” ?
I have pondered this wisdom -- and its plural formulation .
What other choices ?
“ There are alternatives to academic dishonesty . ”
How many alternatives are there ?
Five ?
10 ?
Is honesty just one alternative among many and , depending on the season , another might be equally acceptable ?
What would a good professor or dean say to the student who exclaims that academic honesty is just not working and that he or she wants to pursue other “ choices ” ?
We live in a choice - addled society .
The jargon of choice , a second cousin of diversity and multiculturalism , undermines intellectual integrity and coherence .
“ Choice ” and “ diversity ” are universal passwords that unlock all doors .
Who can oppose them without appearing authoritarian ?

These terms dazzle an academic and liberal left , which regularly uses them to disassemble a curriculum .
For instance , reformers some years ago floated to great effect a proposal “ to teach the conflict . ”
If some instructors could not decide whether a classic English novel was homophobic or imperialist , they should “ teach ” the “ conflict ” and let the students decide .
The notion was seductive , but it opened the way to teach anything and everything in the name of airing a dispute .
Were television situation comedies great literature ?
Teach the conflict .
For a while , one counted on resolute conservatives to resist this intellectual guff and to remind us that not every view is worth teaching .
No longer .
Conservatives and even religious fundamentalists now talk the talk of diversity and choice .
Adherents of “ intelligent design , ” for instance , which is now mandated to be taught in five states and proposed in 20 others , often defend it as giving students choice .
Students should be allowed to choose between Charles Darwin ’s evolution and the notion that God created species .
The Kansas Board of Education recently agreed .
As supporters of the decision explained it to reporters , they were simply trying to “ open the curriculum ” to alternative viewpoints .
The Kansas chairwoman of a conservative group , Judy Smith , employed familiar leftist cant in defending the board .
“ Teaching the controversy will enhance Kansas students ’ ability to look at the evidence and ... ultimately make their own decisions about origins [ of life ] . ”
To this sentiment Smith added , “ Academic freedom is what we hope for in the education of our children . ”
But the jargon of choice and diversity actually corrodes academic freedom , which once referred to the freedom of college instructors to teach what they considered salient , subject to the review of their peers , not outside authorities .
Today , it increasingly means the freedom of students to hear what they -- or their parents -- want .

Several conservative groups now view academic freedom through the lens of diversity and choice .
An outfit called Students for Academic Freedom , which claims chapters on hundreds of campuses , collects information on what it considers one - sided or controversial classes .
The group pushes the so - called Academic Bill of Rights , written by the conservative activist David Horowitz .
It defines academic freedom as lots of choices for students .
“ While teachers are and should be free to pursue their own findings and perspectives in presenting their views , ” reads Principle No. 4 , “ they should consider and make their students aware of other viewpoints . ”
It adds that professors should “ welcome a diversity of approaches . ”
As attractive as these principles seem to be -- diversity , choice , alternatives -- what do they actually mean in the classroom ?
Must an astronomer teach astrology ?
The course on early Christianity include militant atheists ?
A class on the Holocaust , the Holocaust deniers ?
A lecture on 9/11 , the conspiracy theorists ?
These “ other viewpoints ” all have a bevy of experts behind them .
The few qualifiers tossed into the proposed Academic Bill of Rights , which specify that diverse views be aired only “ where appropriate , ” do not undo the damage .
Under such proposals , the locus of academic freedom moves from teachers to students and parents .
“ Diversity ” and “ alternatives ” and “ choice ” for students actually signal the eclipse of academic freedom for teachers , and the spread of bland , if not dishonest , courses .
Teachers become purveyors of choice in a full - service cafeteria .
Let the students decide between Darwin and Trofim Lysenko or “ The Origin of Species ” and Genesis .
Mesmerized by the jargon of choice , we forget a basic principle : Truth itself is partisan .
A Rocket to Nowhere
" The goal can not be to have a safe space program - rocket science is going to remain difficult and risky .
We have the right to demand that the program have some purpose beyond trying to keep its participants alive .
NASA needs to take a lesson in courage from its astronauts and demand either a proper , funded mandate for manned exploration , or close the program .
The commercial , technological , and intellectual allure of manned exploration is so great that it will not be a hard case to make . "

Sure , we 'd all like to own a robot – to do our homework , to exchange quips with our moisture vaporators , to infiltrate our ragtag fleet of exiled starships – but they 're so goshdamned expensive .
The Honda Asimo , for instance , costs a million dollars to make and they still have n't figured out how to keep the " v " attached to the end of its name .
Even a low - end Roomba costs a hundred bucks , and my cat - frightener budget does n't go that deep .
Luckily , capitalism has a cure for this , as it does for everything except capitalism .
We 're lucky enough to live in what future generations will no doubt call the Cheap Plastic Robot Age .
To be fair , these are n't all robots in the scientific sense of " a machine designed to replicate the complicated behaviors of human beings , " but rather the marketing sense of , " You know , a robot !
Like , a future thing , but cute .
And it should have silver parts . "
For the next three weeks , I will be taking a look at robots you can buy for 30 bucks or less .
So sit back and enjoy a cut -rate slice of steaming future .
Idog
I 'm convinced that robots will never conquer civilization , because we will never get them out of their packaging .
This " robotic pooch " has enough wires and pieces of tape holding it in place to satisfy the bondage needs of an extremely kinky rhinoceros .
Once freed , it resembles a collision between a bag of marshmallows and a cell phone , with vague canine overtones .
The main problem is that it lacks a face , making it look like one of those deformed baby animals that are so popular on Boing Boing these days .
Once you get the batteries into it , a flower - shaped array of colored lights substitutes for a face .
This is not an improvement .
The conceit with this strange little creature is that you " feed " it music , and it responds appropriately .
I immediately set it up with an IV drip of ' 80s New Wave music , and it responded by tilting its head , wiggling its ears , and blinking its many colorful , spiderlike eyes at random .
This is , remarkably , the usual response I get from people when I play Kajagoogoo .
When I paid closer attention , the color patterns and head spasms seemed to have a vague relationship to the music , but I think with another beer I could have convinced myself they had a vague relationship to the Tokyo Stock Exchange .
The thing is supposed to develop a personality based on what music you play through it .
The instruction book says the music I played for it caused it to develop a " rap / hip - hop " personality , so I imagine it will be getting into a shootout with my pencil sharpener pretty soon .
How it could make your life easier :
You can send it to a rave in your stead , saving you money on smartdrinks and E and letting you get some work done .
Shooter Bots : The Game
I like that little " the game " there .
Because someday there 's going to be Shooter Bots : The Movie and Shooter Bots : The Novelization of the Movie and you do n't want people to be confused .
Shooter Bots is like Lazer Tag , only you do n't have to have any friends .
Instead , there 's a robotic tank and a futuristic gun you can shoot it with .
The tank tries to shoot you too , so it 's less of a friend than a co-worker .
Anyhow , we had a quick fight and it used some clever tactics like bouncing its little tank light off of a well - varnished drawer to hit me in the gun , and running under the couch and attempting to procreate with a universal remote I lost under there .
And hey , it won !
Toward the end , I considered using the tactic of hiding the gun behind my back , but I felt that would be cheating .
In true robot form , the Shooter Bot was not encumbered by my weak human notions of fair play and was able to take me down with cold logic and hot infrared .
How it could make your life easier :
It should adequately protect you from burglars with plastic , battery - powered guns .

Some have called the idea outlandish .
A better word seems to be insane .
And yet , Dynamic Architecture , a company in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates , is marching ahead with their plans for a skyscraper powered by wind turbines .
The buildings look like a carnival attraction , and might make you dizzy just looking at them .
Each of the 59 floors is rotating unevenly around a central concrete core .
Wind turbines are stacked horizontally between each floor , so that when exposed to the atmosphere 50 or 100 or 500 feet off the ground , the wind turns the turbines , generating electricity for the buildings ’ use — and more .
These buildings might soon dot the skyline of Dubai , making the city the first to display the revolutionary — and energy efficient — so - called " dynamic architecture . "
From the energy point of view , the building is an independent and aesthetic source of alternative energy .
Each turbine generates 0.3 megawatts of electricity , so that the building ’s 50 total turbines can generate 1,200,000 kilowatt - hours of energy per year .
As an average family ’s annual power consumption is about 24,000 kilowatt - hours , each turbine can supply energy for about 50 families .
The tower will have 200 apartments , which will use just four of the turbines for their energy needs .
Another four of the remaining 44 turbines would provide power to the neighborhood of the building , and there would still be 40 extra turbines , which could supply power for 5 - 10 more buildings .
How safe would it be to live on a floor rotating 58 stories above the ground ?
Dynamic Architecture , the company building these structures , says that they ’re actually safer from earthquakes than normal skyscrapers because each unit is independent and flexibly moves with the wind .
At first , the idea may sound extremely expensive .
Actually , architect David Fisher , well - known for his restoration projects in New York and Italy , uses a revolutionary construction process to reduce costs .
Only the central core ( which contains the elevators , plumbing and other utilities ) is built on site , while each floor is prefabricated in a factory , reducing construction time and maximizing cost - effectiveness and quality control .
The floors are then assembled from the top down , hoisted up on the central core at a rate of one floor in three days .
Combined with solar panels , the wind turbines could produce about $ 7 million of surplus electricity per year , making the design a potentially profitable long - term investment .
But , of course , much of the funding for this project would likely come from the UAE ’s fortunate geological position and the rising cost of oil , which has already funded other massive architectural projects .
Plus , Dubai is growing , both as an industry hub for media and technology , and as a tourist attraction .
The Dynamic Architecture structures do n’t yet have plans to be built , but the idea is being seriously considered .

Justin is traveling , his column will be back on Monday .
It was 40 years ago this June 8 that the USS Liberty  a large , armorless , refitted freighter that was gathering intelligence in the Mediterranean at the outset of the Six Day War  was attacked by Israeli fighter jets and torpedoes .
Thirty - four U.S. sailors were killed , and 172 were wounded .
The Liberty limped back to Malta .
A U.S. Navy court of inquiry was on board investigating the damage , but  for some reason  the investigators were not allowed to proceed to Israel to find out what really went on .
Orders from the top echelons of the Pentagon nixed the inquiry , and today , the families of the fallen still have n’t gotten any answers as to why Israel was allowed to get away with it without even so much as a slap on the wrist  nor even any public acknowledgment that it was a deliberate attack .
Far from apologizing , the Israelis have to this day denied that they attacked the Liberty on purpose , and  incredibly  they stoutly maintain that the whole thing was an “ accident . ”
This in spite of the fact that the Liberty was proudly flying a U.S. flag and was easily identifiable as an American vessel .
The Israel Lobby has even gone so far as to publish a book , The Liberty Incident , by Jay Cristol , that makes the case for the “ accidental ” scenario , but the survivors ’ families  and a number of credible commentators  are n’t buying it .
One of those commentators is a former captain in the Judge Advocate General Corps assigned to the Liberty investigation , Ward Boston , who has signed an affidavit stating unequivocally :
“ The evidence was clear .
Both Admiral [ Isaac C. ]
Kidd and I believed with certainty that this attack was a deliberate effort to sink an American ship and murder its entire crew .
It was our shared belief , based on the documentary evidence and testimony we received firsthand , that the Israeli attack was planned and deliberate . ”
Capt .
Boston says that Adm. Kidd , who was in charge of the subsequent inquiry , frequently referred to the Israelis as “ murderous bastards , ” and a number of intelligence experts and U.S. officials seem to concur , albeit not in precisely those terms .
Says former CIA director Richard Helms : “ The board of inquiry [ concluded ] that the Israelis knew exactly what they were doing in attacking the Liberty . ”
Former Secretary of State Dean Rusk says :
“ I was never satisfied with the Israeli explanation .
Through diplomatic channels we refused to accept their explanations .
I did n’t believe them then , and I do n’t believe them to this day .
The attack was outrageous . ”
Even more outrageous was the cover - up by the Pentagon  and the White House of Lyndon “ Hey Hey LBJ , How Many Kids Did You Kill Today ? ” Johnson .
According to officer David Lewis , who was below deck at the time of the attack :
“ [ 6th Rear Fleet Adm. Lawrence Geis ] told me that since I was the senior Liberty survivor on board he wanted to tell me in confidence what had actually transpired .
He told me that upon receipt of our SOS , aircraft were launched to come to our assistance , and then Washington was notified .
He said that [ Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara ] had ordered that the aircraft be returned to the carrier , which was done .
RADM
Geis then said that he speculated that Washington may have suspected that the aircraft carried nuclear weapons so he put together another flight of conventional aircraft that had no capability of carrying nuclear weapons .
These he launched to assist us and again notified Washington of his actions .
Again McNamara ordered the aircraft recalled .
He requested confirmation of the order being unable to believe that Washington would let us sink .
This time President Johnson ordered the recall with the comment that he did not care if every man drowned and the ship sank , but that he would not embarrass his allies . ”
Rather than embarrass his “ allies , ” the president of the United States caved in to the Lobby and buried the truth about the death of American servicemen under a mountain of obfuscation and official silence .
As Tim Fischer , a former deputy prime minister of Australia and a former army officer , put it in The Age :
“ If Israel did deliberately attack the most powerful nation on Earth , it knows it can do so and get away with murder .
Worse still , U.S. military personnel now know that if the truth is politically inconvenient , they and their legacy are expendable . ”
When it comes to the calculations of the Lobby , we are all expendable  that is the bitter lesson we are learning as a futile war in the Middle East not only rages on but threatens to expand beyond the borders of Iraq .
Our “ ally ” Israel is an albatross hung ’round our necks , and it is slowly strangling America ’s chances of defeating Islamic extremism in the battle for the hearts and minds of Muslims worldwide .
Will no one rid us of this troublesome “ ally ” ?
I ’m afraid they wo n’t .
The power of the Lobby , as explicated by scholars John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt , is as formidable as ever , if not more so .
They ensure that there is no real debate over our Middle Eastern policy , either in Congress or in the councils of government policymakers .
Their spies are allowed to get away with all sorts of activities that any other foreign power would soon feel Washington ’s wrath over .
Their demands are considered the starting point for all policy decisions , and they are rewarded for their lack of loyalty to their main benefactor by being showered with all manner of gifts : “ foreign aid , ” loan guarantees , and technology transfers that have enabled them to build up a military capacity  including nuclear weapons  that knows no rival in the region .
The attack on the Liberty and the subsequent whitewash of the Israelis is proof  if any more were needed  that Israel enjoys a position of preeminence within the councils of state that belies its small size and relative weakness as a settler colony totally dependent on outside infusions of support .
Critics may aver that this is all ancient history , that there is no reason to bring up the attack on the Liberty , and even if it was n’t an accident , it ’s time to let bygones be bygones .
The Lobby constantly asserts that anyone who even mentions this “ incident ” is nothing but an anti-Semite , because , after all , why talk about it now ?
The reason is that it underscores the utter falsity of the argument that Israeli and American interests are uniquely and perpetually in perfect alignment .
The Israelis attacked the Liberty , according to several books and a BBC documentary on the subject , in order to prevent the U.S. government from learning of Israeli plans to occupy the Golan Heights  a sliver of land that rightfully belongs to Syria , and which is still causing a great many problems for U.S. interests in the region .
The stunning fact of the American government ’s complicity in hiding the truth about an attack on its own soldiers is all we need to know about what ’s wrong with American foreign policy  and what is the exact source of the problem .
The central banks of China and Russia have joined private companies in calling on Swift , the international financial intermediary , to pull all non-US data from America , The Register has learned .
SWIFT has found itself caught between a rock and a hard place .
The organisation secretly handed over personal data to comply with demands from the US to aid the country 's investigation into terrorist finances after the September 11 attacks .
By doing so , it broke the data protection laws of many EU countries .
The move raises questions about the perceived security of commercial data held in the US .
Swift conducts its own privacy audits of US counter - terrorism subpoenas on financial transactions it manages for the banking industry .
The EU also struck an agreement with the US last week to establish its own oversight of the US operation .
SWIFT has also applied for Safe Harbor protection of its data in the US , yet is still taking pressure to withdraw from the US seriously .
" There are other countries that would like to see data situated in the EU rather than the US , " said a well - placed source .
China and Russia were " notable " among countries whose central banks had expressed their concerns to Swift .
The European Central Bank , which also used Swift 's services , has been criticised by EU authorities for letting the US look at European financial data in secret .
Swift is trying to break into the domestic banking markets in China and Russia and is keen to get off on the right foot with local authorities .
In India , where Swift is also trying to make a splash , the banks are said to be investigating alternatives .
Swift is also trying to establish itself as a broker between multinational corporations and their banks .
The private firms have also " raised questions " about the US data centre in meetings with Swift , the source said .
The European Commission is investigating if other banking firms and even firms in other sectors were also having their data subpoenaed by counter - terror investigators at the US Treasury .
Swift told the European Commission last month after its meeting of board directors - all private banking executives - that it would be moving all data related to transactions within Europe from US soil .
The organisation is drawing up a plan to establish a new mirror site , possibly in Europe , which will be presented at its next board meeting in September .
Officials there do not expect the answers to be forthcoming .
The subpoenas on Swift had been happening since late 2001 .
The controversy attached to Swift since the investigation was unearthed last year by the New York Times will have discouraged other firms from admitting they had also been subpoenaed , but kept the information secret from shareholders and customers .
The EU was concerned about the subpoenas because it considered US privacy laws inadequate to protect the privacy of the clients whose details are stored in the financial records . ®
Captain 's log , Stardate 2325.2 .
We have encountered a great deal of trouble after beaming down to a desert Class M world , known to the inhabitants as " Tatooine . "
We were graciously invited to the home of a jovial fellow named Jabba .
Upon our arrival , we were ambushed by Jabba 's agents and imprisoned in his dungeons .
I fear he plans to use us for entertainment this evening .
He has selected the strongest of us , Worf , to fight in unarmed combat against a fearful opponent .
We have not yet seen the opponent , but know only his name , " Chewbacca " , and his situation .
It seems if Chewbacca wins , the life of his friend " Han Solo " is spared .
Worf must win if we are to regain our freedom .
Chewbacca must win if he is to save the life of his friend .
We can only wait for the outcome .
What is Worf led by ?
While he occasionally shows anger , rage , etc. , Worf is primarily led by an emotionless sense of duty .
He will be fighting mainly to save his fellow crewmembers .
Why this is noble , yes , his desire will fall well short of what is required to defeat the wookster .
As the two competitors circle each other , sizing each other up , Worf is calculating the best possible approach .
While he is busy evaluating the best strategy , Chewbacca steps up and literally knocks his head off .
( BTW , If this were Worf and the crew from TOS , Worf would undoubtedly win since Kirk would say f*** the Prime Directive ( tm ) and get everybody out of there .
Picard 's too much of a pansy to get involved . )
STEVE : That last point is definitely true .
However , your earlier arguments show that you lack some basic insight into this duel .
Let 's start off with training .
Worf practices his fighting daily in the Holodeck .
Every day his skills are honed to that of an awesome fighting machine .
What does Chewy do ?
He hangs out in strange alien bars with his buddy Han .
When he's not doing that , he 's sitting in a cockpit flying the Millenium Falcon .
That 's just not a healthy lifestyle !
Although he is a big Wookie , under all that fur there is just a bunch of flab .
Hans and Franz could do a whole show about him .
Another issue here is that Chewy just can't seem to do anything on his own .
He always needs help from Han , Leia , or Luke .
When was the last time he showed some initiative ?
He 'll probably just mope around until the fight , and then Worf will come and easily defeat him .
Worf in less than a minute .
BRIAN : I lack the basic insight into this duel ??!!
How is it then that the examples you give in favor of Worf actually work against him .
Oooh , Worf trains in a holodeck .
Big deal .
The Holodeck ( tm ) may seem lifelike , but it 's relevance to real violence is about as significant as that of Space Invaders ( tm ) .
And , yes , Chewie does hang around in bars alot ... getting into fights !
And winning !
He 's kicked alien ass all over this galaxy .
A Klingon is nothing compared to some of the species he 's come across .
He 's learned some dirty tricks in those bar room brawls , too .
And when he's " sitting around the cockpit " remember that he is also engaged in constant shoot outs due to their renegade lifestyle -- picking of galactic patrollers and Empirical TIE fighters ( tm ) will hone one 's reflexes better than any holodeck .
And , despite what you say , Chewie can handle it alone .
Yes , he knows how to work on a team , but he can also be a one - wookie wrecking crew .
Worf , on the other hand , is just a sycophant doing whatever Jean - Luc ( tm ) tells him .
And , as I said before , Chewie HATES to lose .
Chewbacca in one swipe .
STEVE : Gimme a break !
How can you compare shooting down TIE fighters from a cockpit to hand - to - hand combat ?
I think you 're stretching just a bit far on that one .
In addition , holodeck training is far better than bar fighting .
What takes more skill : A ) Attacking a specially created opponent whose skill level is such that it pushes your limits , or B ) knocking off some delirious drunk alien off a bar stool ?
I think the answer is obvious .
Finally , I 'd like to point out an interesting similarity .
Did you ever notice that both Worf and Chewbacca both wear those silver sashes ?
Coinicidence ?
I think not .
There must be some intergalactic conspiracy going on !
Either that or the K - Mart next to the movie studio had a sale on them .
Thanks to the many people ( such as Gordon Buchan and Craig Silvey ) who suggested either this or a similar match - up .
According to our records , however , we came up with it a long , long time ago .
The Results
Chewbacca ( 946 )

RESPONSE OF THE WEEK ( TM )
Worf vs. Chewbacca , BABY !
IT 'S SHOWTIME !
And talk about a mismatch .
Worf is WAY out of his league .
We 're talkin ' St. Leo's at Georgetown , Baby !
I mean , Worf does great in - conference against other Klingons and holodeck projections .
BUT NOBODY LOSES TO KLINGONS AND HOLODECK CHARACTERS !
IT MEANS NOTHING !
Let 's look at the non-confs .
He was beat up by a couple of Ferengi in The Last Outpost .
He lost to GUINAN on the firing range .
ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?!
FERENGI ?!
GUINAN ?!
You gotta beat those guys for me , baby !
We 're talkin ' CUPCAKE CITY !
Meanwhile , Chewie is dominating all over .
I LOVE THIS GUY !
He beats up everybody !
He 's ripping the arms off droids !
He 's throwing people out of Scout Walkers with ONE HAND !
He beats up stormtroppers IN HANDCUFFS !
If he wore clothes , he would be one of my diaper dandies , BABY !
DIPSY - DOO , DUNK - A-ROO !
BLOWOUT CITY !
Worf 's headin ' for the basketball court in the sky !
NOTE : For the college basketball impaired , we offer this alternative conmentary from 13 - time WCW world champion , Ric Flair :

[ As Worf and Chewie circle each other , a flash of light bursts out ]
Q : In a bit of trouble , Microbrain ?
Worf : Q !
I should 've known you were responsible for this !
Q : Why , Microbrain , I 'm hurt .
Here I am , allowing you the chance to explore those strange new worlds you 're always blabbering about , giving you the chance to do what you Klingons so love doing , bashing another living being 's brains out , and what thanks do I get ?
None .
Picard ( from sidelines ) : Q , I demand you stop this nonsense at once !
Q : Not quite yet .
I want to see the fight .
( snaps fingers , and two men appear on either side of him )
Steve : What the ...?
Brian :
This can't be !
Q : What cliched lines !
Where are those snappy remarks and witty rejoinders I so love ?
Come now , I brought you two here for color commentary and I 'm going to get it !
[ Steve and Brian look at each other nervously and launch into the commentary we 've already heard . ]
Steve : So ... Q , who do you think will win ?
Q : Oh , I do n't know , that 's so difficult .
On one hand , Microbrain 's diminished capacity and horrid table manners is , I suppose , made up for by a bit of physical strength .
On the other hand , he put up with ... ( snicker ) Luxwanna Troi .
Not to mention the fact that he can't hit a Ferengi five feet away from him .
He could n't outshoot a BARTENDER , for pity 's sake !
And soon , he 'll be shuttled off to a space station , where he 'll be ordered around by living Jell - O. Pitiful , do n't you think ?
[ Worf , enraged by Q's insults and Brian calling him a " sycophant " , gets ... upset .
Riker sees this . ]
Riker : Worf !
( grabs Troi and gives her a deep passionate kiss )
Worf : ( enraged sounds that are vaguely recognizable as Klingon swear words that would make Kahless faint .
He has the RAGE ( tm ) .
In spades . )
[ Worf immediately runs forward , grabs a surprised Chewie 's head in his hands , and crushes it to a pulp . ]
Q : Ah , well , he really did n't DO much anyway , did he ?
No big loss .
[ snaps fingers , and Steve , Brian , and the Enterprise crew all vanish .
Q looks down at Chewie 's body . ]
Q : I suppose I should revive you .
( snaps fingers , and Chewie is as good as new .
Snaps again , and he and Han vanish . )
Ah , well , back to business .
( snaps fingers , and he becomes the spitting image of Yoda . )
So much fun this is .
Love gullible students , I do .
Wonder do I when I should stop little joke .
Ohhh ...
Not for long time .
[ Q vanishes , but for several minutes afterwards the chamber still echoes with his laughter ... ]
- Rei " Leaper " Nakazawa ( With Special Guest Star Corbin Bernsen as Q2 / Obi-Wan Kenobi ... :) )
Everyone knows all good fights involve some amount of namecalling , alluding to sexual preferences , and so on .
A well - made insult can be just a damaging as a crescent kick to the face .
( I 'm pretty sure Lex Luthor was making fun of Khan 's chest implants all through that game of Stratego , for example . )
Now , consider both combatants abilities in this area .
Worf , aside from having a large vocabulary of Klingon profanity , has got a lot to work with here .
The number of jokes you could tell about Chewie 's mom and dogs alone is startling .
Chewie , though , despite what I 'm sure is a tremendous wit , can't relay his biting insults , because he can only speak Wookie , which Worf would n't know ( since the Klingons do n't watch Scooby - Doo ) .
Of course , as luck would have it , Federation Standard Language and the Official Non-Disgusting Aliens Language of Star Wars are both exactly the same , and Chewie understands it well enough ( Han : Get down here !
She 's hurt !
Chewie : Rgh Ruuuuh !
Han : Wait ! Chewie : Rrorhkay ! ) .
More points for Worf , because while Chewie is just growling to him , he 's letting some real snappy zingers fly .
Now , in this case , Chewie 's lack of restraint is gonna hurt him .
The Wookie is so easily - pissed _anything_ will anger him .
This means that not only will Worf have the verbal advantage , he 'll barely have to _use it_ .
( Worf : I heard you had an idea , but it died of lonliness !
Chewie : Rrrrrrggggghhh !
Worf :
Oh , nice comeback !
Chewie : Waaaaahhh ! )
Taking all of this into account , I 'd say Worf will have Chewie a gibbering mass in about thirty minutes .
Of course , I still do n't know why Jabba decided the " strongest on the Enterprise " is _ Worf_ , unless R2 - D2 kicked Data 's ass the week before ...

Cut to the prison cell where the rest of the Trek crew are sitting .
Suddenly , Deanna Troi ( Counselor Cleavage ) is startled by a very strong , very strange empathic presence , unlike any she has felt before .
She calls out empathically to this strange being ( Luke ) .
The silent conversation goes something like this :
Troi :
Who 's that ?
Luke : I am Luke Skywalker , Jedi Knight .
Troi :
My , what a big brain you must have .
Luke :
You know it , babe .
What 's going on here ?
Troi :
The crew of the starship I arrived on is trapped here , and our chief of security is being forced to fight a big hairy thing for our lives .
Luke :
Do n't worry babe , I 've got everything under control .
I 'll save everyone , and then maybe you and I can get together ...
Troi : I thought you 'd never ask .
Luke walks into the main hall , uses the force to whup Jabba 's butt , and saves everyone .
Troi is overcome with desire for Luke , and they end up spending a bunch of time together on the holodeck , if you know what I mean .
Chewbacca and Worf play a game of Holochess , which is still going on today .

We 've had people write in saying that aliens told them the result of the Grudge Match .

But surely , this is the most insane person we 've ever had respond .
-B
Plus , I fall back to this old adage .
How many of us have a Worf toy ?
A few .
How many of us have a Chewbacca toy ?
All of us .
Also , Chewbacca has a cooler voice .
Let me illustrate : WOOOORRWEER !
( TRANSLATION :I'm kicking Worf 's ass as we speak , thank you very much , kind sir . )
He hangs out with Han ... the MAN .
Worf hands out with Jean - Luc .
Ahem .
( I need not say that Han would kick Jean - Luc 's ass .
I mean , Han is twice the man of even Kirk !
Now would n't that be a grudge match ?
They could battle for the right to deflower some blue girl with nine arms ! )
- Marcadv
Chewie is also a lot smarter than Worf , whose main battle strategy seems to be to run towards the danger .
Chewie put C - 3PO together with his BARE HANDS .
That implies a lot of dexterity as well as intelligence .
Worf can barely manage the buttons on his console , and his martial arts consist of that silly elbow chop thing .
He 's at a disadvantage in experience , reach , strength , and fear .
Chewie will no doubt toy with Worf before disemboweling him like a Tauntuan on a snowy night .

Oh yeah , I think I saw him fight a real - life enemy [ TM ] once or twice .
He got beaten like a red - headed stepchild .
That 's right , he 's gotten thrown around by pretty - boy android Data several times .
On any occasion where the writers have stopped making Geordi spew big made - up words and let the scene degenerate into hand - to - hand combat , he almost always is the first one down .
In fact , I seem to recall him being devolved into a super - savage proto -Klingon once and still getting pummeled by AARP spokesman and French weenie Jean - Luc Picard .
In fact , every time we see klingons on the show they 're getting their collective racial butt whooped by everyone from sacrificial security officers to Julian Bashir , prototypical arch - wimp .
Now , Chewbacca on the other hand .
He 's the one who drives the burnt - out , obsolete space hulk that still singlehandedly outmanuevered the entire Imperial fleet .
He 's been known to rip apart Storm Troopers by the score .
As I recall , the only person in the three movies who singlehandedly took on a Wookie and won was Boba Fett ( he wears several scalps of 'em as a bold fashion statement ) .
Folks , if you need Boba Fett , the coolest being in the known universe , to take out one of these specimens , then the race of extraterrestrial red-shirted ensigns that are the Klingons do n't stand a snowball 's chance in hell .
Looks like Mr. Worf will be relegated to doing Romulan camioes with good ol ' Lt. Yar .

1 ) Chewie and Worf charge each other , a 'la a pair of sumo wrestlers , each one howling a battle cry in their native tounge ; the resulting cacophny of grunts and growls can be heard as far as Mos Eisly .
2 ) They collide with a klang !
They try to back away from each other , but find their nifty metal sashes have linked together ( much like metal braces in the mouths of two lovers ) .
3 ) Worf , the shorter of the two , panics and begins to pummel at Chewie 's sides .
Chewie , on the other hand , reaches down nonchalantly , digs in his claws , and pops Worf 's head from its shoulders .
The battle is over in less than a minute , and the victor ( Chewie ) is dropped into the Rancor pit .
- Brian
Anyway , Worf is now performing Du-Kanafra , in order to prevent eternal disgrace for his family 's name .
This involves bashing his head on the wall , or in this case , sharp , jagged stone ( this is a dungeon ) .
His head gets all bloody from the first hit to his head , and he faints .
Chewy , who has had quite a good laugh from all of this , simply walks up to an unconscious Worf and tears his head off .
Han Solo is released , and Jabba has Picard stew that evening .
It 's very good .
- L. Wilkes
to put it simply , if chewbacca does n't do it , i will .
- eugene
Wookies are known for pulling arms out of sockets after all , and despite the infamous strength of the Klingon race , Worf has been considerably softened by the easy life .
Even if weapons were allowed ( I assume they 're not ) Chewbacca would still win .
What good is a phaser set on a most - likely wimpy setting ( going for the humane angle like a good Starfleet officer ) against a Wookie who has done greater deeds , and is taller , and wields a crossbow ?!
Not to mention that Han is at stake , and we know that Chewie is indebted to Han for life ( however long that is ) .

Aside from the aforementioned Troi and Crusher dance antics , the rest of the crew will have already been assigned tasks by the Hutt .
Riker , he 's sliding that old trombone of his with Max Rebo and the band , while Data 's serving drinks on the sail barge with a restraining bolt stuck on his forehead .
Geordi's dead already - he made some comment about the metallurgy of Boba Fett 's helmet and got shot through the visor .
Captain Picard , cool headed and rational ; realizes he'd make an excellent snobbish Imperial officer and is allowed to leave .
Who doth remain to back the Klingon ?
Nobody .
Maybe Data 's cat spot- that 's about it .
So we now have Worf , all alone save for the cat , moaning and wailing , preparing himself for ritual suicide or some other clever warrior - esque convention .
Chewbacca , all 60 pounds of him ( the rest is fur ) will wax the floor of the Rancor pit with Worf 's bony head .
By the time Worf snaps out of his malaise ( in noticing to the shapely fit of Troi 's costume ) , a plurality of his limbs will be lying around the room .
Picture , if you will , this huge walking carpet laughing it up whilst checking out his new sash in the mirror .
Chewie , from the start , knew he had this one locked up .
It 's not wise to upset a Wookie , regardless of how deep your voice is .
( Oh yeah - you do n't think that cat got away , do you ?
Jabba has a thing for post - fight snacks : -)

The reason why is obscenely simple ; KLINGONS HAVE THE BETTER NAME .
Yes , the " Klingon " warriors , with cool Star - Trekkie weapons like the " Bat'leth " and stuff , will trounce the " Wookie . "
My god , Wookie ... it rhymes with " cookie . " Jeez .
- Michael Farahbakhshian
- Mangler
While the feirce hand to hand battle rages , Worf using his superior skill to offset the greater reach and physical strenth of the Wookie , a stalemate is reached for a time .
What will be the deciding factor ?
The onlookers , of course , the Humour factor is the key , the thing you have both overlooked is that the Star Wars movies were made with a greater sense of humour than the annoyingly pretentious Star Trek series .
At the Crucial moment , when a tired Chewbacca has stumbled and the heartless Klingon is poised to strike the killing blow , hovering over the battered and bloodied Wookie , Princess leia will quickly open her shirt , revealing herself to Worf , who as a humaniod will be temporarily distracted , Chewbacca will then rip of his arm and beat him to death with it , messily ending Worfs ' illustrious career .

" You mean I get to hit him ...
But we did n't send a probe ... I can really hit him ...
Troy does n't get to do the pseudo mind reading gig ... I can actually hit him ...
What about the Prime Directive and all those starfleet regulations ...
Your serious , we are going to settle this through violence , I get to hit him ... "
At which point it is too late as it is settled through violence , namely Chewie knocking Worf 's head off with one blow .

So let 's look at it from this perspective : Chewbacca and Worf are both major players in their respective sci- fi franchises .
Neither franchise has experienced a particularly high mortality rate among their stars :
STAR WARS Obi-Wan Kenobi : Killed by Vader , but did n't really die in spirit , as demonstrated by visits in later films .
Anakin Skywalker and Yoda : Same as above .
Biggs : Blown out of the Sky by Vader in Star Wars .
That 's all I can think of , so basically one dead , and he was only kind of a major player .
STAR TREK Tasha Yar : Killed by a big black blob .
Spock : Killed in Star Trek II , but brought back to life in III , so he does n't really count .
Kirk : Killed in VII by Soran .
So going by this information , we have to ask , which franchise is more willing to give up one of their big stars ?
A pretty obvious solution - Star Trek is willing to wax One HUGE star ( Kirk ) and one minor star ( Yar ) while Star Wars hesitantly surrenders only one very minor star ( Biggs ) .
Using this data , I would have to go with Chewbacca , scoring a late tenth - round TKO .
- Jeff W .
We , the Wookie high council , are very angered at your flippant alteration of our race 's name .
We are a proud and noble people , and refering to any Wookie as " the wookster " is exceedingly insulting .
Clan Chewbac has insisted that you be tortured to death in accordance with our laws .
We will offer you a choice : fight Chewbacca in a Duel To The Pain to restore his wounded honor , or turn yourself over for execution .
Expect a visit from our honor guard very soon .
- The Wookie High Council
My sincerest apologies to insulting you and all other Wooksters .
In my attempt to relay that Wook - a - ramas were far superior to Klingons , I inadvertently called them such things as Wookereenies .
BTW , is the phrase Wook - a - lam - a - ding - dong acceptable ?
( If I 'm going out , I 'm going out in style ) -B
P.S. You misspelled " Wookiee " just like we did .
- Eds .
1 ) An opponent literally covered with hair .
Yes , it looks cool as all get out , but if there 's one thing I know about hand to hand combat it's that lots of hair spells doom .
Grab it , it hurts .
Muss it up , you can't see to fight .
Run around with no clothes because you think your hair provides adequate coverage , your opponent has a clear shot at the Family Jewels .
Of course Chewie might be prepared for these problems , but Worf does n't have to deal with them _at all_ .
2) Biological redundancy .
As pointed out in the TNG episode where Worf gets his back broken and surgically replced , Klingons have several " back - up " organs in case others fail to work .
This means that if you give
Worf a kidney punch , he 'll be relatively all right .
The same goes for several other organs including the brain .
Translation : Worf can take more punishment .
3 ) Foreign objects .
Yeah , it 's dishonorable , but for the sake of his crewmates and when push comes to shove , Worf may start brandishing one of them nifty Klingon knives .
Heck , maybe Chewbacca'll draw one from his sash first ... if he has one there .
See , Klingons conceal as many weapons as possible on their persons , and while Worf has a tighter uniform than the standrd Klingon fare , he 's bound to have knives anywhere he can fit one .
Now maybe there 's a similar custom for Wookies but hey -- _he 's not wearing any clothes_ .
Well , there 's the sash , but Worf 's got one of his own .
Sorry , Han , but in this case pockets are gonna make the difference .
- Mike Smith - figures Star Wars fans can take satisfaction in knowing the Far Far Away Galaxy has better weaponry than the Milky Way of 2371 .
Now if John Candy 's Mawg from the Mel Brook 's movie " Spaceballs " were participating in the fight , we'd know he would win , but only after injecting some sophomoric humor into the entire battle .
Something like " Chewie , your shoe is untied ... " and of course , Chewie , not even wearing shoes , would bend over to tie his shoe ... and BLAM , right over the head with some heavy item , probably a serving tray from one of Jabba 's appetizers , Daphne Zuniga 's hair dryer , or C3POs leg .

End Result - Evil Smugglers / Bounty Hunters dead / fled , 2 security officers dead ( hey , the Bounty Hunters are n't Stormtroopers - they hit occasionally ) .
Also , Jabba 's little pet and Wesley Crusher end up strangling each other to death ( I 'm assuming this is how the Star Trek guys ended up in the Star Wars universe in the first place - Wes " Son of Sam " Crusher is taking a break from Traveler school and decided to twist time n' reality when drunk . )
After hearing of Wesley 's death , cast and crew of ST and SW teams meet in the Mos Eisley cantina to get stinking party drunk on the finest booze available on Tatoonie .

1 ) Worf trains all the red shirts .
Red shirts always die .
Worf must not be training them well .
Worf must not be a good fighter , or they would be better trained .
2 ) Worf 's uniform has a much higher wedgie potential than Chewie 's stylish silver bandolier .
This weakness may prove to be the downfall of Worf , especially if Chewie is trained in the dreaded Wookie ' butt clamp ' manouever .
3 ) Second knock against Worf 's uniform - its snug fit will restrict his ability to perform Fighter Hayabusa 's fearsome Back Brain Kick , while Chewbacca is under no such restraint .
This was the coolest move in Nintendo's Championship Wrestling , and will be equally useful in this melee .
4) The unknown ' x - factor ' which may play an unforseen role in this fight is the funky ridge thingy on Worf 's forehead .
It is an enigma that bears further investigation that is far beyond my own capabilities .
Barring any bizarre emissions of cosmic radiation from Worf 's skull ridge formation , Chewbacca wins .
- Michael D. Mearls , Dartmouth College
Oh sure , he 's got the brawn , and maybe even the desire to win , but this is the being who could n't figure out the old " let 's pretend Chewie 's our prisoner " routine , and who actually went for the bait left out by Ewoks .
EWOKS .
Worf , on the other hand , has proved be pretty darned cunning in the past , and has shown a remarkably proficiency in hand to hand fighting , whereas Chewbacca has never actually been seen killing anyone ( he just seems to kind of push them over ) .
Han 's threat that Wookies " tend to pull people 's arms out of their sockets " was likely just a bluff ( the guy 's a pirate and a smuggler ... he gets to lie every so often ; it 's in his union handbook ) .
Plus Worf has all those swell redundant systems built in ( plus a shiny new spine ) .
No , I 'm afraid that while Chewbacca was puzzling over which end of the stick was the Good End and which was the Bad End , Worf , resplendant in his Ewok - fur slippers , would glide up silently behind him and snap his neck like a twig .
Then he'd show the Jedi a few new tricks they could do with a sword .

Worf , vastly overrated as a warrior ( the schmuck never killed anything ) once again proves himself to be a kinder gentler Klingon and puts his arm around Chewy and tells him that it 'll all be allright and they 'll find a way out of this where everybody wins , and the Prime Directive is preserved , just like every Star [ TM ] Trek [ TM ] ending .
Chewbacca , already forgetting Han , the stupid Wookie , puts his head on Worf 's shoulder and has a good cry .
Picard smiles with satisfaction , Troi weeps and says she senses " Great feelings of Love ! "
Data is unable to say anything as he has been scrapped for parts by Jawas [ TM ] and sold for the next WWWF [ TM ] Gudge Match , Data v. R2 - D2 . Jabba , sick of this crap , orders the Rancor [ TM ] released .
The great beast from Episode VI stomps in and masticates the pair , who have since started trading memories about their childhoods , with a gut - wrenching ** CRUNCH [ TM ] **
Allmighty Jabba chortles evilly and orders the crew of the Enterprise cast into the Sarlacc pit and Carbonite frozen Solo broken up into individual cubes for the cocktails .
As princess Leia dances in front of him , Jabba reliezes that STAR WARS [ TM ] will always lord over Star Trek [ TM ] and has a good laugh .

A brief check of the WWWF history shows that the Enterprise has been destroyed by the Death Star .
This should forevermore banish anyone from the Star Trek ( version 0 ) crew from ever doing battle on pages of the WWWF .
As a side note , I mention that the red shirted ensigns were kicked around by the storm troopers just for good measure .
The fact that the Enterprise was destroyed implies that the red shirted weenies can never again rear their pointy heads in the WWWF .
This gets us quickly to the crux of the issue .
If Worf is defeated , Jabba will make a meal of the Star Trek ( version 1 ) crew .
This would be the end of Star Trek on the pages of the WWWF .
We would only be left with the Star Wars cast of characters , modulo Darth Vader .
This can not be !
We can't confine our imagination to the Empire vs the Rebel Alliance scenarios .
Besides , we all know a good internet site must beat the dead Star Trek horse with a vengeance .
All who voted for Chewbacca are belatedly regretting the choice .
- Dr. Joe
This is when Worf decides that it 's time to forget all the Federation rules , and take out this PetaQ jay ' ( I could translate , but this is a PG - rated site ) like a Klingon .
He reaches for one of the 14 concealed weapons on his person* , a small blade worn like a brass knuckle , and waits for the Wookie to make his move .
Now we have a more even match .
Worf is at full readiness , and will use his superior training to satisfy his lust for real blood that has been so repressed all this time .
Chewie still has the edge in sheer size and power , however , and gives his opponent a thourough workout .
There are 2 ways the match can turn out from here :
1 ) the training works , and Worf , battered and bloodied , disembowels Chewbacca , who becomes Jabbas new shag rug .
2 ) Worf seems to be losing when Data , deciding that leaving the Enterprise in orbit without a command crew ( and thus ripe for capture ) would be a worse violation of the Prime Directive than killing some overgrown furball , busts his way out of his cell ( which is just down the hall from the Rancor Pit and within easy earshot of the fight ) to help Worf .
Chewbacca dies within a minute , but Worf , who is really ticked off because he had his honor compromised by Datas intervention , proceeds to rip the androids head off while Data has his back turned .
Either way , Worf wins .
- Brian Blovett
* If you do n't think that Worf would have 14 concealed weapons on him , I remember reading a TNG novel ( I think it was " Strike Zone " , but I 'm really not sure ) in which some Klingons come aboard , and their leader tells Picard that each of his men have at least 11 concealed weapons on them .
Picard then immediately asks Worf , " Leiutenant , do you have 11 concealed weapons on you ? "
Worf replies " Most certainly not , sir. " , and Picard is relieved for a moment before he asks , " Umm ...
How many concealed weapons do you have on you ? " , to which Worf replies " Fourteen . "
- Chris Foster / Sherry Womack
the end ..... or is it ???
- Conrad Campbell

On the other hand almost everytime Chewie has picked up a blaster , or beer bottle or balled a fist or even snarled something mean , someone has died .
Unless , if Pansy - boy starts feeling sorry for his poor freind Worf for getting him beat up that one time ... maybe he could figure out how to remodulate the main deflector shield of the Enterprise to produce the ' Wookie - Be - Gone ' tone that the Stormtroopers were tourturing Chewie with after Lando turned them over to Darth ....
Hmmmm .... I might have to re-cast my vote .
( Is that a new record for run-on sentences ? )
- Lee Allison
Where should I begin .?..
OK , lets recall any instance where Chewbacca was engaged in hand to hand combat with anything .
Example 1 . The Trash Monster : A worthy opponent such as the Trash Monster , Chewbacca starts crying at the door .
What would Worf do about the Trash Monster ?
He would likely eat it live because of its similarity to the Klingon delicacy " Gahh " .
Example 2 . The Ewoks : Chewbacca was actually captured by a bunch of snuggle ( tm ) bears .
If Worf were on the forest moon of Endor , he would immediatly domesticate the Ewoks to be used as a food source for the Klingon Home world .
Ewoks would be bred and slaughtered ...
Example 3 . Lando : Chewbacca applied his best death grip on Lando for a full 20 seconds before the Princess pryed him away , yet Lando is alive to play a significant role in the following movie .
If Worf attacks Lando , he 's history .
[ Plus , ] if Han has not kept Chewbacca properly groomed , then he will be completely useless in the fight .
In fact , I suspect due to his captivity by Jabba , he has not been curry combed for quite some time .
Chewbacca will be as blind as a sheep dog .
The only thing that might save Chewie , is that there is no honor in killing a giant teddy bear , especially one that is crying at the door .
However , if Worf decides that Troi would fancy a warm fur coat , Chewie is history ...

Worf had to go on _Deep Space Nine_ because he could n't get another job .
Chewbacca is probably living in the lap of furry luxury in a palatial mansion somewhere , surrounded by hairy chicks in bikinis , and has Alf as a butler or something .
Chewie did n't learn galactic .
The reasonable man adapts to the world around him .
the unreasonable man expects the world to adapt to him . " *
Whereas
Worf always tries to conform to Starfleet regulations , and generally be a sissy .
Chewbacca is more of the Kirk " Fuck the Prime Directive " School of Philosophy .
Chewie 's like Shaft , except bigger and hairier .
And better teeth .
Chewie do n't care about his family honor .
He cares about cracking skulls .
Worf always tries to be a good father - figure to his son Alexander .
I 'm sure Chewie 's got kids on lots of planets , and he 'd deny everyone one .
Worf is like a whiney accountant .
Chewie is an intergalactic pimp .
Anyways .

Had this contest been Chewbacca vs. Christian Slater ** , I 'd at least have to think twice about it .
** - Did I mention both Worf and Christian SLater were in Star Trek 6 ?
Coincidence ?
Furthermore , when a hole in space - time grows , * MORE * realities gain access to it .
( Remember that episode of TNG where there were , like , a million Enterprises ?
My point exactly . )
So , the fight will be complicated by these factors .
It goes like this :
As Chewbacca slams
Worf upside the head , the Klingon goes flying into a very - surprised looking Lieutenant Apollo , having just entered the bar after the BattleStar Galactica entered orbit around Tatooine .
Apollo , obviously confused , shoots wildly , and is stunned by Data .
( Troi manages to get out " I 'm sensing ... hostility . " )
Daggit , being the cheap special effect that he is , communicates this info back to the Galactica .
The Galactica opens fire on the Enterprise .
( Naturally , this being the Star Trek ship , some of the consoles explode .
Maybe the Enterprise - E wo n't be built with those consoles that have the ship 's store of dynamite just below , huh ? )
Meanwhile , Worf , now enraged , pulls out his curvy - Klingon - battle - thingy and slashes madly at Chewie , who leaps aside only to knock into Maximillian , fresh out of that crappy Black Hole movie .
Chewie picks up Maximillian and tosses him at Worf .
Worf ducks ( barely ) , and Maximillian plows into some confused - looking cadets from The Last Starfighter .
One manages to stay conscious , and radios to his home base where * ALL * the Starfighters are stored ( in a fit of bad planning , I might add ) .
The Starfighters zoom into the fight between the Galactica and the Enterprise , appearing behind the Galactica ( which is taking quite the pounding , being so cheesy ) .
The Enterprise , being commanded by Riker ( who just * loves * a fight ) shoots at one and blows it up , figuring that they just launched out of the Galactica .
The Starfighters then attack the Enterprise .
Of course , the three Star Destroyers stationed just outside the Tatooine system are now just arriving , and they shoot at * everything * .
However , one of the Star Destroyers is hamstrung , for Madmartigan , fresh from " Willow " , has appeared on board the ship , at the same time that Conan appears in the other end .
They start killing everyone in sight , because , after all , the toughest guys on those ships are Stormtroopers , goddamit .
Down in the bar , Chewie and Worf are laying mighty blows on one another when Picard gets the signal from Riker .
The captain , realizing that he 's missing a * bigger * chance to wimp out of a fight , beams up to the ship , along with everyone but Worf , too busy strangling Chewie .
Meanwhile , another three Star Destroyers have arrived , but they too have trouble : the Colonial Marines from " Aliens " beamed in one , and this time , their pulse - rifles were loaded .
Of course , they wipe out the bad guys even * faster * ( hey , they have guns , not swords ) .
Chewie kicks mightily between Worf 's legs .
Fortunately ,
Worf is wearing a cup , so it does n't really hurt .
Unfortunately , Chewie knows that a ponytail is easy to grab .
He does so , and flips Worh , using only his ponytail .
Of course , by this time all hell has broken loose up in the stars .
Nine Star Destroyers are actively attacking everything and everybody .
( Another one is n't doing anything , as Madmartigan and Conan are involved in a duel to the death .
The last one switched sides when the Marines figured out how the guns worked . )
Swarms of TIE fighters are attacking as well .
On the other side , we have the Enterprise - D , the Galactica ( now having patched up their relations , kinda , although they * do* take the occasional potshot at one another ) , some StarFighters , lots of Babylon 5 ships ( looking as stupid as always ) , some of those cruisers from Space : Above And Beyond , and that sucky escape pod that carried Superman to Earth .
( It 's not fighting .
However , as Tatooine has * two * yellow suns , Superbaby is in * no* trouble even if the thing * does * blow up . )
By now , Worf and Chewie are breathing heavily .
Both have taken it to the limit .
Finally ,
Worf swings mightily with his fist .
Chewie jumps back , raises his arm , and .... BOOOM !
Worf gets knocked back into the wall , where his shoulders slump , unconscious .
( Oh , and the crazed interstellar conflict was resolved when they realized that Wesley Crusher was the one responsible .
So they killed him , and everything went back to normal . )
- Christopher Bird
Ahhh the Rancor ( TM ) now there is a scenario .... Chewbacca and Worf are battling it out in hand - to - hand combat and the battle moved in front of Jabba ( TM ) .
Jabba getting so sick and bored of the fight that he just pushes the switch to sends Chewbacca and Worf sliding down to meet their doom .
Worf looked around for someway to escape , but found the place sqeaky clean ( the cage had n't been cleaned for years and Jabba ( TM ) was getting annoyed by the foul odor and the rotten corpse ) .
Suddenly ,
Worf felt a warm , smelly air on his back , but before he could turn around CHOMP !!
One quick head move by the Rancor ( TM ) and chopped Worf 's whole body in half .
Next , the Rancor ( TM ) turned to Chewbacca and deja vu al over .
So in conclusion Chewbacca wins in less than a minute .

So , the love stricken Wook - meister sees the Klingon turncoat , and he decides to bestow on him some WOOKIE - LOVE ( tm ) .
He sprays in some WOMP - RAT NO MORE ( tm ) breath spray and puts the moves on Worf .
Before the Worf - man knows what is going on , Chewie has taken him to a hotel , checked in under the false name of Bob Palpantine , and put on some mood - music .
And , because this is a family web site , I will not elaborate on what happens next .
All I know is that Chewie needed a few drinks in Worf before , but in the end , we all know how the story finishes .
I say the Wookie in one night .

Picard : Number one , any plans ?
Riker : What ?
Oh , sorry .
I was watching the dancers .
Data : Captain , I can bend the bars of this cage , jump down the 5 meters , and steal the weapon held by that bounty hunter , and kill everything in the room except us in 10 microseconds .
Extra : I could jump down , break my leg , and take the blaster shot meant for Data , and die in 2 microseconds .
Barclay : ( In a residual moment of brilliance ) Captain , I can throw my communicator at a 1.25 degree angle in this direction , have it bounce off the bounty hunter 's blaster , off the dancer 's top , off that annoying thing living on the tub of lard , and lodge it in Jabba 's brain , thus disabling the blaster , dropping the top , knocking the little thing out , and kiling Jabba instantly .
Meanwhile , in the other cage ,
Solo : Anybody got a plan ?
I still can't see anything .
C3P0 : Mr. Solo , I can translate all the foul comments everone out there is saying into any of six million forms of communication .
Oh dear .
R2D2 : bleep blurp deeeep chirp blop .
C3P0 : He said he can shoot out electric sparks , cut through the bars in five minutes , get hit by a blaster shot and short out .
Lando : I know , we could sell Jabba out to the empire !
Leia : I 'm not a committee !
Solo :
Go chewie !
As you can see , Worf will have all kinds of help , while Chewie will be fighting on his own , waiting for Luke to rescue them , but Luke is stuck on Dagobah , since his crash landing has critically injured an annoying little green alien .

Enough speculation .
Here are the facts : I cannot recall Worf ever , in any of the Worfisodes or other TNG episodes , ever personally just plain wreck house .
I could have in fact missed some episode where he really engaged in grade - A kickass , but all I can recall is him shooting a couple of Borg once and mostly just complaining that as a child all the other Klingons got to do Klingon stuff while he had to stay in the Federation and learn to play violin or something .
Now , he always was around to say what a real Klingon might do in a given sutation , or scare visitors and aliens with his forehead , or advise the Captain to fire photon torpedoes ( as a wise friend once said " You 've got them damn photon torpedoes , fire them damn photon torpedoes ! " ) .
But one of my first memories of TNG is of Worf getting roughed up by a Ferengi .
Ok , so Quark can take Worf .
I recall Lor smacking Worf across the Enterprise 's Wonkavator and knocking him out cold .
Indeed , most recently
Worf almost got killed by the coat - check boy on some Klingon ship before his brother saved the day .
And as for the Holo - fighting , the I believe Riker did n't have too much trouble with Worf 's little Holo - program .
In fact , Riker could probably give Chewie a little trouble with his tricky Aiki - bo - jitsu moves , and he's got that one punch that never fails to knock out whatever security guard he 's having trouble with at the time ( and I believe he used it successfully on both Klingons and Ferengi ) .
So I think we can safely conclude that Worf , though we all admire him for who he is , is at best unproven as a fighter .
Now Chewie , we know he's got the skills - head crackin ' , arm tearin ' , bowcaster firin ' skills .
And he 's got the rage - serious rage .
Whenever he is captured , or even in a socially unfcomfortable situation , his hosts tend to prefer putting like fifteen guards on him and super strong handcuffs .
Now , he is a bit of a softy , and would n't neccessarily want to fight Worf unless Worf was like endangering his friends or something .
But for the sake of argument let 's say he 's ready to rumble .
All I can say is : look out .
Chewie , 30 seconds .
- Dave C
Realising that neither one of them usually gets the girls or the glory , and tired of playing second fiddle to their respective leaders , they join Sy , steal the Millenium Falcon , and take off for a life of babes and wealth , all thanks to Mr. Sperling 's intervention .
As they make the jump to light - speed Chewbacca slaps
Worf on the back knocking him into the bulkhead and out cold , thus settling the question of who would have actually won the fight had it happened .
Meanwhile back on Tatooine ...
Jaba , furious over loss of his contestants ( and the complaints from his Pay - Per - View customers ) decides to throw the ST : Next Gen crew into the Great Pit of Carkoon , while using Han Solo ( frozen in Carbonite ) as a back - scratcher .
The first crew member to be thrown from the skiff is Wesley Crusher , who promptly gives the creature indigestion , creating for the first time in known history " The Great Acid Geyser of Carkoon " .
Durring the commotion , Riker manages to overpower the gaurd on the skiff as Data uses some of his own circuits and Geordie 's VISOR to build a homming beacon , thus allowing the Enterprise - D to beam them aboard .
With Wesley finally gone , and without the Federation watching his every move , Picard makes Jaba an offer he can't refuse and finally puts the moves on Doctor Crusher , thus cutting himself and the Enterprise - D in on the smugling trade and relieving those nervous twitches he always seems to have .
Setting a course for Corescant , he decides to show the Emperor what a Galaxy Class starship can do to a planet and incidently places a bounty on the heads of Chewbacca and Worf .
- M.Pastreich
Reason 1 ) Worf ?
A trained fighting machine ?
The guy who misses phaser shots at backwater planet terrorists on THE BRIDGE from 12 FEET AWAY ?
The guy who routinely gets his fur boned butt kicked by men , women , child mutants , and all other manner of alien creatures on a weekly basis .
SH*T !!!
He can even beat Whoopie Goldberg at a game of Virtua Cop ( TM ) .
He apparently can execute fast recon against Napoleonic infantry only to practically DIVE into a spear wielded by some other kinda furball with the reflexes of a frozen Walt Disney ( TM ? ) .
And ANYTIME someone gets possessed by some spirit or alien life force , the first thing they do is go out and kick Worf 's ASS !
He can't even beat up Riker who smokes cigars and often walks like a girl .
Routinely he get knocked out when his fellow crewmembers are depending on him .
And what about those " lightning reflexes " when a slow moving plastic barrel filled with packing peanuts crushes his spine in a cargo bay ?
In fact the only fights worf EVER wins are those against holodeck dudes ( which he simply programs to lose but " make it look good " and other Klingons , who as we see all the time , may look quite fearsome and smelly but suck at actual combat .
Which by the way , brings me to an interesting point .
How the hell do Klingons actually build ships .
You figure the scientists and engineers , not to mention the blue collar assembly types , would be drinkin ' brews an fightin ' each other all the time in pitiful tests of klingonhood .
The only way Woof would even have a chance is if the loser did not in fact die , but was force to " satisfy " the needs of Lursa and Bator afterwards .
A fate much worse than even beings kissed by your sister , with tongue .
Reason 2 ) I do n't know where Chewbacca hails from but its gotta sound cooler than some dorky planet with a name like " Kling . "
Reason 3 ) The Baccameister 's got the cool theme song ( see above ) .
Reason 4 ) Worf sounds like a guy that just sat down on a corn cobb the " hard way " but is trying to stay cool .
OTOH , Chewys klingon - blood curdling scream is an amalagam of several hundred of the most ferocious beasts on the planet and sounds a lot like the sound a TIE Fighter makes just before it blasts some rookie into the memorial section of the Rebel Yearbook .
Reason 5 ) Chewy has the crossbow that shoots laser blasts .
Gorp has an incredibly oversized shoe horn with pointy ends .
Reason 6 ) Woofie 's in love with some 24th century granola peace and love chick with large you know whats and makes her living as a therapist !
He will spend all his time wrestling with his anxiety , thinking about how pissed she 'll be at catching him " fighting " again , and his mind will inevitable wander south to muse about what he ain't gonna be getting for a while .
This will trigger memories the humiliation he has suffered from all the barbs and off color jokes made by fellow crewmen with internet access who downloaded nekkid pictures of his girlfriend .
The short : he will be too distracted to see the killing blow coming until it is too late , and by that time , he will welcome death .
Chewtobacco , on the other paw , has chosen to forgo relationships in order to cultivate the James Dean / Ghengis Khan image that more suits his rebellious lifestyle .
( He does however , have a cute French Poodle in every spaceport . )
Reason 7 ) While not himself a Jedi , Chewy has experienced the Force enough times to at least possess some unconscious control to be used in a pinch .
At the start of the battle , Woof will feel an uncontrollable urge to pee , and that split second when he locks his knees , WHAMMO ( tm ? ) , a crossbow where the sun do n't shine .
Reason 8 ) Klingons just do n't care a whole damned lot about dying .
Hell , they seem to like it .
In fact , their lack of actual fighting ability could be seen as some sort of evolutionary " suicide mechanism . "
LAST BUT NOT LEAST -
As bad as an actor Worf is , he has a much better chance at getting another job than the voiceless , faceless chump stuffed into the Chewy suit .
He loses this gig and his acting days are over .
NO more Hollywood parties , no more cocaine , no more Heidi Fleiss hookers , and no more free runs at Drew Barrymore .
Pretty serious motivations not to lose .
But the real losers , as usual , will be the fans .
More specifically , the fans noses .
Worf , Chewy , and Jabba in the same room .
Ugggh .
The Janitor will not have a good day .
- Ghostwheel
Second , Worf is indestructable .
He has all those redundant organs and bones ( two livers , two hearts , a skull way thicker than it needs to be ) .
Without a phaser , or an axe , Chewbacca wo n't even be able to dent him .
Finally , there is the biggest issue : motivation .
If Chewy wins , what does he get ?
A sloppy hug from Han .
Great , that 's certainly worth fighting for .
If Worf wins he gets to sleep with Deanna .
Who do you think wants to win more ?
Hell , for a night with Deanna , Chekov from TOS ( TM ) would have a reasonable chance to beat Chewbacca .
It 'll be a good fight , but Worf will defeat Chewbacca in about 8 minutes .

Oak Grove update by tristan
Thursday Aug 30th , 2007 10:11 PM
Resistance to the fence around the Oak Grove continues in court and " on the ground . "
On Wednesday , August 29 the police stormed the area of a nine month tree - sit to save an oak grove from extermination .
They did not affect the tree sitters but constructed an eight - foot fence around the areas with tree sits .
The University owns the land and plans to cut the trees and build a parking facility and training gym for the football team .
Many people and groups oppose the cutting including the City of Berkeley .
The struggle goes on .
People gathered and at 5:00 there were over 200 people .
many students were present as well as Berkeley residents .
People shook the fence and called for it to be torn down .
The main concern was that the tree sitters would run out of food and water and would be forced down .
The University said that this was not their plan and in an email sent to over 40,000 UC students and staff they claimed that the reason was the safety of the tree sitters during football games .
The first football game of the season is on Saturday .
Five more will follow in the next three months .
To get food to the tree sitters people first threw small items but most missed and fell to the ground inside the fence .
later a tree sitter moved to a tree close to the fence and lowered a line to haul food and water up .
One officer cut lines with a pole saw while other officers pushed the crowd back outside the fence .
There were two arrests in a scuffle at this point .
Some people then sat down and blocked Piedmont way .
Eventually the police relented when faced with a large crowd of people linking arms around others who filled bags and sent them up into the trees on lines .
Dozens of bags were sent up and the tree sitters are now set for many days .
There are now eight tree sits and they are all connected with ropes so that the sitters can move from one to another .
Today , August 30 , there was a court hearing .
There is a big court case and the outcome is to be decided on Sept. 19 .
On that day people should be prepared to defend the grove with energy .
Until then the UC is prohibited from moving forward with the project .
Our lawyers said that this was moving forward but the judge decided that the fence can stay for now .
Friday , August 31 , there is a TREE DE_FENCE party .
Everyone should come .
Please do .
Also a rally and march on both Friday and Saturday at 11:30 am .
Saturday at 2:00 there is a pic-nic and leafletting to all of the football fans to say : " Go Bears - Save Oaks . "
A tree sitter hauls up a bag of food during Wednesday 's rally .
Tree sitters wait for more food and water to be passed to them .
Tree sitter wait for police to move to try for more food .
The crowd pulls on the fence .
Police keep the crowd from the fence .
Tree sitters hand bags of food across .
A student digs away at one of the poles supporting the fence .

The next day , August 30 , all day vigil at the fence .
Come support on any day .
March and Rally on Friday and Satuday .
September first at 2:00 pm there is a community pic-nic and football fan outreach .
Save the Oaks - Free the Land

Visit Lobelog.com for the latest news analysis and commentary from Inter Press News Service ’s Washington bureau chief Jim Lobe .
Does former UN Amb. John Bolton â€ “ now with the neoconservative American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) â€ ” still speak for Dick Cheney ?
The new British government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown must be scratching its collective head over that question given the truly unbelievably arrogant and threatening op - ed Bolton , a Cheney protege , published in Wednesdayâ€™s Financial Times .
The columnâ€™s title , â€ œBritain Cannot Have Two Best Friends , â€ refers to what Bolton calls â€œa clear decision pointâ€ for Britain â€ ” to choose between the United States and the European Union or , as he refers to it , the â€ œEuropean porridgeâ€ of which he so clearly disapproves .
For Bolton , it is a zero- sum game , and , in his view , it is now up to Brown to make the choice .
â€ œ [ W ] hether the â€˜special relationshipâ€™ grows stronger or weaker lies entirely in British hands , â€ he states .
The catalyst for Boltonâ€™s outburst appears to have been Brownâ€™s statement during his visit with Bush last week that Britainâ €™s â€œsingle most important bilateral relationshipâ€ is with the U.S.
The only U.S. ambassador to the UN never to have been confirmed by the U.S. Senate â€ “ despite repeated attempts â€ “ calls that characterization a â€œclever but meaningless dodge .
â€ œDrop the word â€˜bilateralâ€™ .
What is Britainâ€™s most important â€˜relationshipâ€™ ?
Does Mr. Brown regard the EU as a â€˜state under constructionâ€™ , as some EU supporters proclaim , or not ?
The answers to these questions are what Washington really needs to know .
What London needs to know is that its answer will have consequences .
â€ [ Emphasis added ]
For example , Bolton goes on , Britainâ €™s absorption into the European porridge raises questions about whether it ( as well as Sarkozyâ€™s France ) should still be entitled to a permanent seat in the UN Security Council .
â€ œOf course the Security Council permanent seat is not the real issue â€ “ it is the question of whether Britain still has sovereignty over its foreign policy or whether it has simply taken its assigned place in the EU food chain.â€ 
â€ œConsider also the US - UK intelligence relationship .
Fundamental to that relationship is that pooled intelligence is not shared with others without mutual consent .
Tension immediately arises in EU circles , however , when Britain advocates policies based on intelligence [ such as Saddamâ€™s uranium purchases from Niger , for example ? ] that other EU members do not have .
How tempting it must already be to British diplomats to â€˜very privatelyâ€™ reveal what they know to European colleagues .
How does Mr. Brown feel about sharing US intelligence with other Europeans ?â€ 
â€ œFinally there is Iranâ€™s nuclear weapons programme , which will prove in the long run more important for both countries than the current turmoil in Iraq .
Here the US has followed the EU lead in a failed diplomatic effort to dissuade Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons .
If Mr. Bush decides that the only way to stop Iran is to use military force , where will Mr Brown come down ?
Supporting the US or allowing Iran to goose - step towards nuclear weapons ?
â€ [ Emphasis added ]
Boltonâ€™s coda displays the kind of diplomacy for which he became widely despised throughout the UN during his ruinous tenure there .
â€ œI will wait for answers to these and other questions before I draw conclusions about â€ ˜the special relationshipâ€™ under Mr. Brown , â€ he harrumphs .
â€ œBut not forever.â€ 
At least , he didnâ€™t use the royal â€ œWe.â€ 
Still , one must positively wonder at the tone , content , and not least the intent of Boltonâ€ ™s utterly offensive bloviation .
Is he trying to provoke Brown into proving his independence from Washington ?
Is he trying to drive the new prime minister closer to his former UN nemesis , Mark Malloch Brown , as part of some bizarre masochistic compulsion ?
Is he trying to create even more anti-American feeling in Britain and â€ œEurabia , â€ as some of his Anglo - chauvinist friends refer to Western Europe these days ?
Is he trying to split the West ?
Does he actually work for bin Laden ?
( Is AEI an al - Qaeda sleeper cell ? )
And does Bolton still speak for Cheney ?
This post has been removed .
Originally , it was a critique of Does Functional Programming Really Matter ?.
However , since I wrote the original post , the authors have added a disclaimer — this is not a real attempt at a scientific paper — it 's just a class project .
Speaking for myself , I did n't believe the conclusions of this paper even when I wrote it , and doubly so now — to their document .
Under the circumstances , there is nothing left to dispute and I have removed my words .
I ’ve been asked why I did n’t leave the critique on line so that people can “ see what the fuss was all about . ”
Here ’s the thing : now that the document has that disclaimer front and centre , the most interesting things to talk about have to do with Universities and grades and intellectual rigor and a bunch of other things that are not about programming .
Since this is a programming blog ... this was an easy decision .
If the original document was not written in earnest , it ’s no longer of interest to me .
Java is Turing Complete .
Therefore , all of the ideas in FP can be reproduced in Java .
We show this by Greenspunning the important ideas in WhyFP .
In essence , we show how to write a poorly specified , buggy implementation , of half of Haskell in Java .
We discover that Java is a cumbersome language for implementing functional programming .
Instead of stopping right there , we show our bias by saying that writing programs in an object - oriented language is superior to a purely functional approach , but excuse our problems by saying that Java is at fault , not the premise of embedding FP in OOP .
We do not give examples of embedding FP in other OOP languages that might have radically different models , such as Ruby , SmallTalk , Self , Dylan , Ocaml , or CLOS , leaving the reader to perform their own experimentation .
But we claim that a mixed approach is obviously superior to a pure FP approach .
Update I : Update II : All right , all right , I give .
Here ’s what I originally wrote , more or less .
Remember , when I wrote this there was no disclaimer on the original article , so I was under the impression that the authors actually believed what they were saying ( imagine that ) , and that the authors were writing a paper to academic standards .
It turns out that ’s not the case , so now I ’m the one making disclaimers .
The following represented my view given the information available at the time .
Now that I have new information , my belief is that the paper is a NOOP : It says , in effect , “ the following is not true : X , Y , Z . ” Such a statement is neither supportable nor refutable .
Anyhoo , here ’s what I still have of the original post :
Here ’s a paper worth reading : “ Does Functional Programming Really Matter ?
Two Approaches to Comparing Functional and Object - Oriented Programming .
” The authors show how the important ideas in Why Functional Programming Matters can be reproduced in Java programs .
Let me summarize the paper : Despite the fact that the document is formulated in a pseudo - academic style , I personally conclude this is junk science .
I do n’t argue with the authors ’ conclusions : I enjoy writing mixed programs in Ruby , and on this very blog I showed how to emulate lazy evaluation using objects I do think it ’s valuable to show techniques like this .
I think it reaches out to the Blub community and shows them that you can expand your horizons without having to throw away everything you ’ve learned about your current programming language .
If it gets even one person to read WhyFP for themselves , it ’s a net win to share these thoughts with the world .
But conducting research with a bias , performing an experiment that disproves your conjecture , then hand waving the experiment ’s results away is not science .
It ’s just an opinion , nothing more , no different than the stuff I write here in raganwald
The value of the authors ’ academic experience ought to be toWhere is the study conducted on carefully balanced groups , some who complete a task in pure idiomatic Java , some who complete the same task in Haskell , and some who mix techniques ?
Where are the tables showing comparative program lengths , running times , average number of bugs needing correction , or other hard metrics comparing programs to each other ?
This “ paper ” should not be confused with science .
Brain scanning technology has been the stuff of science fiction for decades , yet has been a long time coming in practical application .
Though we 're pretty sure the military may have some pretty advanced stuff in secret labs ( or does it ? ) , the consumer products we 've seen so far have been rather basic , generally focusing upon the detection of mere concentration .
Gaming tie-ins have generally extended no further than tying detected mental focus to the gas in racing simulations , which is n't really a great application .
We 've demoed a number of existing technologies that went this route , and generally found that focusing upon a single mental image ( it 's actually better if you do n't think about the driving , take a guess at what we focused on ) detracts from otherwise immersive experiences .
As such we were waiting to be impressed when we were invited to a closed door demonstration of a new neural interface device created by previously unknown Emotiv Systems .
The company has been in stealth mode for the past three years , quietly developing neural interface technology that aims to revolutionize the manner in which humans interface with computers .
Our hopes rose in our initial discussions with Nam Do , a co-founder and now CEO of Emotive .
The company , he told us , was founded by a scientific elite including Allan Snyder , the highly lauded developer of the theory behind optical fiber , and Neil Weste , a pioneer in chip design .
The executive side of the company is highlighted by Randy Breene as chief product officer , formerly the producer of the Road Rash series from Electronic Arts and later VP and head of development at LucasArts .
We should have known what to expect when we discovered a LucasArts alum at the helm of a neural interface company , and as Randy Breene explained , though the applications for Emotive 's technology are broad in the commercial and medical space , the company chose to focus initially upon the entertainment sector .
As such , Emotive made its world premier at the Game Developer 's Conference to show games makers the true potential of its technology .
Emotive 's technology is based upon a new manner of interpreting the electrical activity in the human brain via EEG that looks below the individually unique ( and thus difficult to accurately analyze ) outer cortex to deeper regions of the brain .
Users wear an electrode studded headset that wirelessly interfaces with a receiver already no larger than a USB ram drive .
In our closed door demo , Emotive displayed three aspects of how the technology will bring humans and technology much closer together .
The first aspect demonstrated was facial recognition .
Without a camera of any sort , Emotiv 's headset is able to detect a variety of facial expression .
Smiles , frowns , open and closed mouth are detected in real time , as is the direction the wearer 's eyes are looking .
It even detects blinks and winks .
Emotive representatives speculated upon a variety of uses for this aspect of the technology in entertainment , from instant messaging programs that allow users to see each other 's expressions ( no more fake lol 's ) to the ability of a game to know if a user is frustrated and angry or laughing and smiling .
The second aspect we saw was the headset 's ability to judge states of excitement or calm .
Running graphs on short and long term scales traced the status of an engineer present for the demo .
Immediately upon being introduced the slightly self conscious engineer 's graphs jerked upwards , and the following laugh from the audience in attendance jerked them up more .
He calmed down shortly afterwards , until an audience member slyly launched a foam stress ball at his head .
The surprise sent the graphs rocketing skyward , where they remained for a time .
Emotiv 's reps suggested a variety of gameplay elements that could be based upon this recognition , from mood - adaptive soundtracks to unlocking berserker modes in first person shooters on the basis of the player getting amp'ed up on real adrenaline .
Survival horror games could know exactly how scared a player is and judge when to trigger surprises to engage a bored player or key the arrival of a boss when a player is already terrified .
The final aspect of the Emotive technology was even more impressive .
By focusing upon physical movements , users are able to translate their thoughts into movement in a 3D virtual environment .
Push , pull , slide , rotate , lift , drop , and six other motions can currently be detected by the Emotive tech .
An engineer with some practice demonstrated the various motions by lifting stone columns from below the ground and manipulating them with pushes , rotations and lifts to build a Stonehenge replica .
Visions of Yoda lifting Luke 's X - Wing from the swamps of Dagobah filled our heads as the engineer focused his mind and raised an outstretched arm while moving the stones
The gameplay elements to this feature are obvious and extensive .
Emotive 's public demonstrations focused upon games with basic movements already patched in .
In a playable demo of the new Harry Potter game , an Emotive user controlled the party with a normal game pad , but used Emotiv mind power to cast spells like the telekinesis power .
Another game pit two players against each other while each tried to lift and push the other off of virtual columns .
The obvious tie in with Star Wars simulations of the force was all we could think of while we watched the demo progress and finally understood why a LucasArts exec had jumped ship to join the Emotiv team .
Emotiv 's executives and engineers were quick to point out that they are not aiming to replace the gamepad .
A degree of lag results from the process of the user focusing upon a mental image of motion and that movement being detected by the Emotiv technology , so general movement and rapid action are best left to a pad .
Innovation is the key for Emotive and , if properly implemented , the technology could usher in an entirely new paradigm of immersive gameplay .
Emotive premiered at GDC to establish contact with game developers and begin providing a development SDK to interested studios .
A consumer launch is planned for 2008 , and though pricing has not been announced , CEO Nam Do promised us that it will cost " Less than a PS3 .
" Stay tuned for a video feature of the Gear at GDC , including the Emotive headset , later in the week .
Toughness is the watchword in immigration policy these days .
When you combine the new toughness with same - old bureaucratic indolence and ineptitude , you get a situation like that described by Nina Bernstein in The Times yesterday .
She wrote about how the boom in immigration detention  the nation ’s fastest - growing form of incarceration  ensnares people for dubious reasons , denies them access to medicine and lawyers and sometimes holds them until they die .
Sandra M. Kenley , a legal permanent resident who had high blood pressure and a bleeding uterus , died in a rural Virginia jail after not receiving her medication .
Returning home from a trip to Barbados she was locked up because of two old misdemeanor drug convictions .
Abdoulai Sall , an auto mechanic , had no criminal record , but was still seized during an immigration interview .
He had a severe kidney ailment and he , too , complained about not getting his medicine .
He got sicker and died in another Virginia jail last December .
Sixty - two immigrants have died since 2004 while being held in a secretive detention system , a patchwork of federal centers , private prisons and local jails .
Advocacy groups and lawyers say that the system not only denies detainees the most basic rights but also lacks the oversight and regulations that apply to federal prisons .
Instead of fixing this broken system , the Senate bill that is lumbering toward final passage  after surviving a crucial procedural vote yesterday  is overloaded with provisions that will make it even harsher and more unfair .
One of the worst amendments comes from Senator Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina .
It would impose mandatory detention of all people who overstay their visas .
It ’s a huge overreach that threatens to swamp the detention system , filling already - strapped prisons at great expense and inevitably leading to more abuses and deaths .
And because it takes away the power of officials to decide who poses a genuine threat and who does n’t , it would undermine efforts to catch and deport the truly dangerous .

よく知らないプロジェクトのソースコードは、プログラムの構造や、そのプロジェクト独特の関数、クラス、ユニットの意味を知らないまま見ていくことになる。 タグ を使ってそれぞれの定義を参照できるものの、すべての定義をひとつひとつ検分していくだけで全体像を把握するのは難しい。こうした馴染みのないソースコードの解析に役立つのが、CscopeとSilentBobという2つのツールだ。
両ツールは、シンボル定義の検索、特定の関数が使われている箇所や関数間の呼び出し関係の確認、コードベース全体からの文字列やパターンの検索に活用できる。また、ソースファイル群に対して手作業でgrepをかけるよりも、目的とする検索を迅速に行えるため、時間の節約にもなる。
Cscopeを使用する
Cscopeはよく知られたユーティリティで、最近のディストリビューションにはたいてい含まれている。もともとCscopeはC言語のコードで使うことしか想定されていなかったが、実際にはC++やJavaのような言語でも十分に使える。CscopeはncursesベースのGUIを備えているが、EmacsやVimといった主要なエディタなど、フロントエンドとして使える他のアプリケーションと連携するためのコマンドラインインタフェースもサポートしている。
Cscopeを起動すると、カレントディレクトリ内にあるソースファイルのスキャンが行われ、収集された情報がCscopeの内部データベースに格納される。
-R オプションを指定することで、サブディレクトリを再帰的にスキャンすることもできる。このデータベースに対するクエリをCscopeのGUIを使わずに別のアプリケーション（以降の記述を参照）から発行する場合には、 -b オプションを指定する。大規模なプロジェクトやシステム関連のプロジェクトでCscopeを使う場合は、こちらのガイドを参照し、Cscopeを最適化して大量のファイルを高速処理するための詳しい手順を確認すること。
デフォルトでは、データベースの生成が終わると（生成済みデータベースを利用する際は、
-d オプションで指定）、自動的にCscopeのGUIフロントエンドが起動される。このGUIフロントエンドのインタフェースは、2つのパネルからなる。下側のパネルに検索クエリを入力すると、検索結果が上側のパネルに表示される。Tabキーを押すとパネルが切り換わり、Ctrl-Dキーでプログラムが終了する。
下部パネルでは、カーソルキーを使って検索フィールド間の移動を行う。以下に、下部パネルで可能な操作を示す。
指定したシンボルの検索
グローバル定義の検索（ヒット時には直ちにエディタが起動される）
指定した関数から呼び出される関数の検索
指定した関数を呼び出す関数の検索
全ソースファイルを対象としたテキスト文字列の検索
文字列の置 換
egrepパターンの検索
エディタによる指定ファイルのオープン
指定ファイルをインクルード（#include）しているファイルの検索
検索を実行するたびに、その結果が検索番号、ファイル名、関数名（該当する場合のみ）、行番号、該当するコード行とともに表示される。検索結果の1つを、カーソルキーとEnterキー、または検索番号に対応する数字キーを使って選択すると、システムのデフォルトエディタ（EDITOR環境変数で指定されているもの）が起動し、該当する検索結果の行にカーソルが置かれた状態でそのファイルが開かれる（サポート対象外のエディタではこのとおりに動作しないことがあるが、EmacsやVimであれば問題ない）。
フロントエンドとして（X）Emacsを使用する
CscopeをEmacsと連携させて使うのは難しくない。 cscope- で始まるコマンドやCscopeメニューがまだEmacsで使えるようになっていない場合は、xcscope.elをインストールすることでEmacsをCscopeと連携させることができる。xcscope.elは、Cscopeのソースtarballのcontrib/xscopeサブディレクトリに入っている。まず、cscope-indexerというスクリプトを$PATHに指定された適当なディレクトリに、またxcscopeファイルをEmacsから参照できるディレクトリ（Emacsで
C-h v load - path と入力してload - path変数を確認するとよい）にそれぞれコピーする。次に、 ( require ' xcscope ) という行を~/.emacsまたは~/.emacs.d/init.elに追加する。
xcscope.elファイルの冒頭にあるコメントが、マニュアル代わりになっている。
このパッケージにより、Cscopeの検索コマンドがすべてEmacsのCscopeサブメニューに追加され、ソースファイル編集中にEmacs風のキーバインドによって使えるようになる。例えば、シンボルを検索する場合は、メニューから「 Cscope 」 →「 Symbol」を選択するか、
M-x cscope - find - this - symbol と入力するか、 C-c s s とキー入力するかのいずれかを行ってからシンボル名を入力する（シンボル名の入力がない場合はカーソルの置かれている単語が検索語になる）。
検索結果は、ファイルごとにグループ化されて<関数名>[<行番号>]
<行>という形で*cscope*バッファに表示される。ヒットした検索結果の1つにカーソルを移動させてSpaceキーを押すと、検索にヒットした行にカーソルが置かれた状態で該当ファイルが別のバッファで開かれる。このときSpaceキーの代わりにEnterキーを押すと（あるいは関連する検索結果をクリックしてもよい）、*cscope*バッファがこのバッファに切り換わる。また、
n キーを押すと次の検索結果に、 p キーを押すと1つ前の検索結果に移動する（*cscope*バッファがアクティブでない場合は、それぞれ
C-c s n と C-c s p がこれらに対応）。同様に 、 N キーで次のファイルが 、 P キーで前のファイルが選択される（それぞれ C - C s N 、 C-c s P でも可） 。
Vimか らCscopeを使う
EmacsよりVimが好みだという人にもCscopeは対応している。まず何よりも現在使っているVimが --enable-cscope オプションを有効にしてコンパイルされている必要があるが、Linuxのバイナリディストリビューションの大半ではそのようになっている。ただし、Gentooユーザの場合は、 cscope USEフラグを有効にしておく必要がある。以降では、Vimの6.xまたは7.xが使われていると仮定して話を進める。Vimのリファレンスマニュアルには、Cscopeインタフェースの利用法に関する項目が含まれている。これにあたる/usr/share/vim/vim&version/doc/if_cscop.txtというファイルが見つかるはずだ。また、CscopeをVimで使うための簡単なチュートリアルも存在する。
Vimでは、 : cscope find search type search string という形式 でCscopeの検索コマンドを実行する（ cscope find の部分は : cs f で代用可） 。search type（検索タイプ）には、以下のものがある 。
symbol or s — すべてのシンボル参照を検 索
or — すべてのシンボル参照を検索 global or g — グローバル定義を検 索
or — グローバル定義を検索 calls or c — 指定した関数の呼び出し箇所を検 索
or — 指定した関数の呼び出し箇所を検索 called or d — 指定した関数が呼び出す関数を検 索
or — 指定した関数が呼び出す関数を検索 text or t — テキスト検索を実 行
or — テキスト検索を実行 file or f — ファイルを開 く
or — ファイルを開く include or i — 指定ファイルをインクルードしているファイルを検索
検索結果は 、Vimウィンドウの一番下にメニュー形式で表示される。検索結果の番号を入力してEnterキーを押すと、該当する検索結果の部分にジャンプできる。また、 : cscope の部分を :scscope （または :scs ）にしてコマンドを実行すると、Vimウィンドウが上下に2分割され、新しいウィンドウに検索結果が表示される。
Vimでは 、Cscopeクエリによる検索結果へのジャンプが、任意のタグへのジャンプによく似ている。つまり、
Ctrl - T キーを使って検索実行前の表示画面に戻り、 : tnext や :tprevious を使って検索結果の画面を切り換えることができるのだ。
カーソルの置かれている語を検索したい場合は、cscope_maps.vimプラグインをインストールする必要がある（同ファイルを$HOME/.vim/pluginディレクトリに追加するだけ）。詳しい説明は、同ファイルにコメントとして記述されている。このcscope_mapsプラグインを利用するには、 : cscope と入力する代わりに Ctrl - \ キーを、 : scscope の代わりに Ctrl - Space キーを押す。すると、カーソルの置かれている語が検索される（例：「initialize」という語にカーソルを置いた状態で
Ctrl - \ s とすると「 initialize」へのシンボル参照の検索が実行される）。
SilentBob
ソースコード解析用のもう1つの新しいツールが、SilentBobである。現状ではC/C++、Perl、Pythonに対応しているが、プラグイン・フレームワークの採用により、新たな言語やほかの機能にも容易に対応できる。
ソースのtarballとdebパッケージは、SilentBobのWebサイトにあるダウンロード・セクションから入手できる。インストール終了後、ソースコードのあるディレクトリで以下のようにSilentBobの実行を3回行う。
bob -- make - ctags bob -- cfiles bob - L cfiles -- call- tags
すると、普通のタグテーブル tags 、 C / C++のファイルリスト cfiles 、呼び出しタグテーブル call_tags という3つのファイルができる。呼び出しタグテーブルには、関数呼び出しのタグが含まれている。これは、ある関数のすべての呼び出しを探し出す場合に、呼び出しタグテーブルの利用（
: set tags=./ call_tags ）をVimに指示して、タグ検索と同じコマンド群（ : tag function - name 、検索結果の切り換えには : tnext および : tprevious ）が使えるようにするためである。これらのインデックスファイルは、SilentBobが呼び出し木や逆向き呼び出し木（backward call tree）を構築する際に使われる。
ただし 、PerlやPythonの場合は、タグテーブルとファイルリストだけがサポートされている。
bob <-- perl | -- python > -- make-ctags bob <-- perl | -- python > -- files
2番目のコマンドでは、 perl_files または python_files というリストファイルが作成される 。
タグテーブルができると、次のコマンドによって呼び出し木の表示ができるようになる。
bob [ - - depth N ] function
-- depth オプションを指定すると、表示する呼び出し木の深さを制限できる。functionから直接呼び出される関数だけを知りたい場合は、 -- depth 0 とすればよい。それ以外の場合は、functionから、指定した深さ以下の個数の関数を経由して呼び出される関数群が表示される。
なお、このオプションは 、PythonやPerlのファイルに対してSilentBobが生成したタグテーブルにも使うことができる。ただし、Exuberant Ctagsによって生成されたテーブルには対応していない。
呼び出しタグテーブルは、次のような逆向き呼び出し木の生成に使われる。
bob [ - - depth N ] -u function
このコマンドにより、functionを、指定した深さに応じた個数の関数を経由して呼び出す関数群が表示される。この場合、 -- depth 1 とすると、functionを直接呼び出す関数だけを確認できる。
SilentBobでは、生成されたファイルcfilesを使ってC/C++コード内のテキストを検索することもできる。ただし、チェックの対象となるのは演算子であり、文字列やコメントは無視される。
bob list of files -- cgrep pieces of text（カンマ区切り ）
生成されたファイルリストを使用するには、 - L ./cfiles を指定する。また、上記のカンマ区切りテキスト群（pieces of text）は、演算子ごとに指定する必要がある。そのため、変数Tのテスト箇所を探し出す場合には、次のように指定する。
bob - L ./ cfiles -- cgrep if ,
T
SilentBobには tags ユーティリティも用意されており、C/C++ファイルのタグ定義をコンソール内で確認することができる。ソースコードから関心のあるコード断片
― 関数定義、グローバル変数宣言など ― を抽出したい場合は、 tags tag1 tag2 ... tagN の実行により、必要なコード断片が取得できるようになっている。
タグ生成 にSilentBobを使う理由 SilentBobは構文解析を利用してソースファイルを解析する。そのため、正規表現を利用してマッチする行をファイルから探し出すExuberant
Ctagsのようなユーティリティよりも高速な解析が行える。試しにLinuxカーネル（バージョン2.6.19）を解析させたところ、Exuberant
Ctagsではタグテーブルの生成に90秒かかったが、SilentBobでは10秒しかかからなかった（いずれも2.6MHzのCerelonマシンで実行）。また、SilentBobは、マルチスレッド処理による最適化にも対応している。
もう1つの違いは、タグテーブルの形式である。Exuberant Ctagsで作成されたテーブルでは、正規表現を用いてファイル内の該当行の位置を特定する。そのため、ファイルの編集によって定義の位置が変わってもタグテーブルを再構築する必要がない。このように、頻繁にタグテーブルを生成しなおす必要がないというのがExuberant Ctagsの利点である。その反面、巨大なファイルの閲覧時には、行番号を利用してタグ定義にジャンプする方式よりもずっと時間がかかる。そのため、SilentBobでは、タグテーブルに行番号が使われている。ただし、大幅な編集を加えるたびにタグテーブルの更新が必要になるのは上述の通りである。

Once upon a time in a far off land there was an underpaid pale skinny guy working in an impoverished start up who wanted to build products with fixed point DSP chips in them .
The problem was he had just about killed himself doing the same thing many times in the past .
In particular , he seemed to spend a zillion hours debugging intricate fixed point DSP assembler to get products working .
All while some project manager who had n’t written a line of code for 10 years was hovering behind him asking questions like “ is it ready ” and mumbling something about milestone dates that were ridiculous when proposed , and soon became hilarious after the project started .
So , our hero wondered , “ is there a better way ” .
How to Build a DSP Based Product
Many DSP products are developed like this :
The academics “ brains trust ” guys work out a clever new algorithm .
Now these guys are way - smart , but tend to express themselves in algebra with lots of Greek letters .
They usually have PhDs , and cost a lot , and there are n’t many of them .
They might test their brain - child in a simulation algorithm like Matlab :
x = [ 1.1 2.0 3.0 ] ;
y = [ 2.5 3.0 4.0 ] ;
dot = x * y’;
Now this lets them test the algorithm quickly ( dot = 20.75 ) , but you ca n’t run code like this on a real world product due to ( a ) it runs 10 million times slower than real time and ( b ) Matlab licences cost $ 5,000 each and only run on $ 3000 PCs .
Which is a shame when u are building a $ 99 product .
So some poor engineer then has to make the DSP algorithm work in real time ( i.e. fast ) on the “ target ” hardware , a $ 10 DSP chip .
Actually , in general , these guys actually like the detail work this involves .
The first step they might do is convert to floating point C :
float x = { 1.1,2.0,3.0} ;
float y = { 2.5,3.0,4.0} ;
float dot( float x [ ] , float y[ ] , int n ) {
float d = 0.0 ;
int i ;
for ( i=0 ; i< n ; i )
d = x [ i ] * y[ i ] ;
return d ;
}
But the guys & gals in Marketing ( they are a breed closely related to Managers , but tend to be more attractive and use airports more ) have decided that this must be a low cost product , so a $ 10 fixed point DSP is chosen .
Now a fixed point DSP is a chip that can perform multiplies and adds quickly , as long as you only use integers .
They do n’t do floats .
So the engineer converts the algorithm to fixed point :
short x = { 11,20,30} ; /* x*10 */
short y = { 25,30,40} ; /* x*10 */
int dot ( short x [ ] , short y[ ] , int n ) {
int d = 0 ; int i ;
for ( i=0 ; i< n ; i ) d = x [ i ] * y[ i ] ;
return d ; /* returns dot*100 */
}
Now look what has happened to the x [ ] and y[ ] arrays .
We have multiplied each number by 10 so we can use an integer to hold the value .
If we did n’t scale each number then we would lose information ( for example converting the 1.1 to 1 ) which on certain algorithms would cause problems .
However because each input value is multiplied by 10 , that means the result is multiplied by 100 ( 10 x * 10y = 100xy ) .
So we need to take this output scaling into account in any other stages of the algorithm .
One more piece of information we need carry around with us as we code .
One more source of bugs .
This is a very simple scaling example .
In practice it gets much scarier and means you need to hold a lot more information in your head when you program in fixed point ( see complex sample below ) .
There is also the potential of overflow problems .
As the output is scaled up by 100 , it is easy to overflow the 32 bit range of the integer output , for example if we used x [ ] and y[ ] arrays with larger numbers .
I Feel the Need for Speed
The product requires that this routine must run as fast as possible on the DSP chips .
So we need to code an optimised version of this routine in assembler :
int dot ( short * x , short *y , int len )
{
int d ;
__asm__
(
" I0 = %3 ;
\t "
" I1 = % 4 ;
\t "
" A1 = A0 = 0 ;
\t "
" R0 = [ I0 ] || R1 = [ I1 ] ;
\t "
" LOOP dot % = LC0 = % 5 >>
1 ;
\t "
" LOOP_BEGIN dot%= ;
\t "
" A1 = R0. H * R1.H , A0 = R0.L * R1.L
|| R0 = [ I0 ]
|| R1 = [ I1 ] ;
\t "
" LOOP_END dot %= ;
\t "
" R0 = ( A0 = A1 ) ;
\t "
" %0 = R0 >> 1 ;
\t "
: " =&d " ( d ) , " =&d " ( before ) , " =&d " ( after )
: " a " ( x ) , " a " ( y ) , " a " ( len )
: " I0 " , " I1 " , " A1 " , " A0 " , " R0 " , " R1 "
) ;
return d ;
}
This is assembler for the Blackfin DSP , the actual code will of course vary for different DSP chips .
The important bit is this :
A1 = R0.H * R1.H , A0 = R0.L * R1.L
|| R0 = [ I0 ]
|| R1 = [ I1 ]
In a single clock cycle , our intrepid DSP performs two parallel 16 - bit multiplies , two 16 - bit adds , and fetches 2 32 bit words from memory , post incrementing the pointers after each fetch .
It does all this 500 million times a second , and sometimes it even gives you the right answer .
But not often .
First you need to spend a lot of time getting it all to work right .
The assembler is much harder to grok than the previous versions of the algorithm , and you use up a lot of brain power on a myriad of fine details .
Get any one of the details wrong and the product is a dud .
The target development environment is also tough .
In many cases the feedback you use to debug might be an analogue signal flowing into or out of the product ( that is processed internally by the DSP ) .
Or a blinking LED .
Sometimes you do n’t even know when its really working , bugs can simply slip through .
You ca n’t always stop the code and single step using a debugger as parts of the algorithm depend on real - time activity .
It ’s a development / testing / maintenance nightmare .
Bit Exact Assembler
There is a way to ease the pain a little .
Lets say there is a bug in the assembler version .
The problem is that to debug the algorithm you may need to understand both the assembler and the DSP algorithm , I mean to debug something you need to know how it works , right ?
This is OK for a simple algorithm , but what if it is even moderately complex ?
Then you are dealing with ( i ) a very complex algorithm and ( ii ) very complex assembler all at the same time .
This is usually too much for mere mortals ( and even minor deities ) .
The result is long , painful development , failed projects , late nights , angry spouses , and lots of pizza ( well its not all bad I guess ) .
The trick is to divide and conquer .
Make sure we are only hitting one tough problem at any given time .
One approach I have found very useful is bit exact porting to assembler .
There are two important steps :
1 . At the fixed point C stage , you test very very carefully .
Run batteries of tests and simulations .
These can be performed on a regular PC in non real time , using powerful debuggers .
The idea is to verify that ( i ) the algorithm is OK and ( ii ) the fixed point port works OK .
In particular ( ii ) is very tough , so its nice to handle this in a relatively benign environment like a PC or workstation .
2 . Port each function to real time assembler one by one .
Test each function against the fixed point C reference .
Make sure the functions give IDENTICAL output – right down to the last bit .
This takes a lot of discipline – near enough is NOT good enough .
The benefits of bit exact coding are :
1 . When coding assembler , you do n’t have to worry or even understand the algorithm .
You just have to make sure that the C version matches the assembler version .
When they do , you know that the overall system will perform as expected .
This lightens the load on your brain , leading to less bugs .
2 . As you integrate modules of code together , problems are easy to spot , just look for where the output does n’t match the fixed point C simulation .
This is much simpler that performing batteries of tests in a real time environment .
3 . A less senior engineer can be used to perform the assembly coding , as they do n’t need algorithm knowledge .
This makes it easier to find people for the project , lowering costs .
Adding people to the project is less of an issue , as they can get up to speed and be productive quickly .
4 . Any bugs are exposed early ( while unit testing ) , rather than late ( after integration ) .
You get an honest measure of progress , rather than nasty surprises late in the project .
Where it fails :
1 . It takes a lot of discipline to perform ( 1 ) CAREFULLY .
There is a lot of pressure from managers ( and engineers ) to jump onto the sexy real time / hardware integration stage .
If you are part way through ( 1 ) , and there is a milestone due , it is very tempting to “ declare victory ” and move onto the next stage , WAY before you are ready .
The results are predictable …
2 . It takes discipline to make the assembler bit exact .
I mean , look , it ’s nearly the same , just a few bits are different ?
The problem is these little errors may lead to much bigger flaws in performance later on .
Try changing a single bit in your operating system binary image and see how well it runs .
In some ( most ) cases bit -exactness matters !
3 . It is honest .
It gives you a black and white go / no - go indication at various stages of the project .
For example the fixed point C stage is not complete until it has shown perfect performance against the spec .
This reduces the “ room to move ” managers have , you ca n’t declare a phase “ complete ” just to suit a milestone date .
It really has to work .
This sort of honesty does n’t sit well with some managers , for example they may have to admit problems to a customer early on in a project .
Case Study – Non Bit Exact
Now here is what typically happens .
Our hero is under pressure from his manager to progress , so he short circuits the fixed point C simulation stage and codes straight into assembler .
The C simulation and bit exact assembler have results that are “ close ” but not really the same .
No effort is made to synchronise the results , there is n’t enough time !
Time is also short so he ca n’t “ waste time ” on unit testing , there is a milestone with a big fat cash payment attached .
The assembly code is loaded into flash on some brand - new , untested hardware , power is applied , and some basic tests performed .
Damn .
It does n’t work .
So our hero and his team start trying to debug the real time assembler code .
However debugging in real time is very time consuming .
The best brains in the company spend months tracking down bugs that end up being simple one line fixes .
Bugs constantly interact with each other , leading the team off in false directions .
He does n’t go back to the C simulation as it now gives different results to the assembler and “ we do n’t have enough time ” to make them match .
As the project falls behind , there is no one who can be added , as only people who understand both the algorithms and the assembler can be used .
The team is debugging leading edge algorithms in assembler .
A year passes .
Senior management is fuming .
They keep getting told “ real soon now ” .
However no - one really knows how long it will be , because no one really knows just how many bugs there are .
Frustration and stress is very high all around .
Eventually the company runs out of funds and the project is cancelled .
There are mass departures of some of the best and most capable people from the company .
Our hero leaves to join another start up where he repeats the same process .
Case Study – Bit Exact
Our hero and some members of the brains trust spend many months carefully porting the algorithm to fixed point and testing the entire product in a robust simulation .
This apparent lack of progress is tough for the managers to handle , but they understand the benefits and bravely support the team .
Lots of complex bugs are thrown up , and the team works through them one by one .
They do n’t take too long to fix because these tough problems are at least occurring in a PC environment , where it easy to track them down .
In parallel , the fixed point C modules are passed to a team to perform the assembler coding .
This team is made of up many junior engineers , who are instructed to make sure each module is bit exact with the reference C simulation .
A few of them do n’t like this , but the more senior members keep them on track .
The junior members do a good job , as all they need to focus on is the assembler , not the algorithm details .
A few bugs slip through unit testing to integration .
A senior member who is a veteran of previous “ death march ” DSP projects is assigned to fix the bug .
She discovers that the the problem was due to an exceptional case not covered in the unit test and sure enough the assembler module was n’t bit - exact under that case .
She had previously been a critic of the extra effort required for bit exactness but the speed in which this bug was found and fixed impresses her .
Early in the project some unforeseen problems are discovered during the work on the fixed point C simulation .
Some parts are running slower than expected which means more assembler may be required in the final product .
This throws up an early indication that the project is at risk of falling behind .
This critical management information is flagged early , while there was time to do something about it .
It is decided to add some extra engineers to the assembler side .
As soon as they learn the DSP instruction set they quickly come up to speed .
They do n’t need to know or understand the algorithm details .
The schedule still slips by a few weeks , but all the stakeholders understand that this is a better outcome than delivering a lemon on time .
No further slips occur , and the project manager earns a great deal of trust and respect by delivering “ bad news early ” rather than trying to hit arbitrary milestone dates and risking the entire project .
When the real - time DSP software is integrated with the hardware there are still a few bugs to find .
However by this stage the real time software is at a very high quality level so the bug count is low .
Integration actually proceeds on schedule , amazing everybody , especially veterans of past projects .
The product is a success , the start up has a great IPO , and the pale skinny guy retires at 28 years old .
Complex Example
Here is a rather more complex example of fixed point C code from the Speex project :
static inline spx_word32_t cheb_poly_eva(
spx_word16_t * coef ,
spx_word16_t x ,
int m ,
char * stack
)
{
int i ;
spx_word16_t b0 , b1 ;
spx_word32_t sum ;
/*Prevents overflows */
if ( x> 16383 )
x = 16383 ;
if ( x <-16383 )
x = - 16383 ;
/* Initialise values */
b1=16384 ;
b0=x ;
/* Evaluate Chebyshev series formulation
using an iterative approach */
sum = ADD32 ( EXTEND32 ( coef [m ] ) ,
EXTEND32 ( MULT16_16_P14 ( coef [m - 1 ] , x ) ) ) ;
for( i=2 ;i< =m;i )
{
spx_word16_t tmp=b0 ;
b0 = SUB16 ( MULT16_16_Q13(x,b0 ) , b1 ) ;
b1 = tmp ;
sum = ADD32 ( sum ,
EXTEND32 (
MULT16_16_P14(coef[m-i ] , b0 ) ) ) ;
}
return sum ;
}
In English ( sort of ) , this function works the value of a polynomial at various points around a circle .
Do n’t ask me why .
DSP engineers just like doing things like that .
For more information / punishment see the file lsp.c from the Speex project .
Macros like ADD32 ( ) simulate the instruction set of the DSP chip in the simulation code , which makes porting this function actual DSP assembler a simpler step .
However they also make the code much harder to read .

To the casual observer , there was nothing unusual about Sophie Perren 's birthday party last weekend .
Surrounded by her relations and 12 of her friends , the eight - year - old celebrated the occasion at a local family pub with face painting , dancing and party fare .
But for her mother Nancy , 42 , the pleasure of the party was marred by the knowledge that letting Sophie mix with other children could put her life at risk .
Scroll down for more ...
Sophie suffers from the rare immune system disorder , cyclical neutropenia , which means that not only is she more prone to infections generally , but every two to three weeks she is at serious risk of catching an infection she will be unable to fight .
She has already suffered two bouts of pneumonia , four of septicaemia , numerous throat , ear and chest infections as well as a respiratory virus similar to Sars .
She has been hospitalised more than 100 times , resuscitated at least 30 times and been given countless courses of antibiotics .
When Sophie was a baby , her mother assiduously followed doctors ' instructions to keep her daughter in a totally sterile environment at home .
Anyone who came to the house had to scrub their hands with disinfectant , and every eating utensil , toy and surface Sophie was likely to touch was likewise sterilised .
Sophie was unable to go to nursery school or play with other children .
It is every parent 's instinct to want to protect their child 's life , but Nancy has now taken the difficult decision to remove her daughter from this cocooned world .
' Sophie had to have some quality of life , ' says Nancy .
' I adore her and have fought for her almost her entire life .
But I know that I have to swallow my fears and let her live a little - even if it makes her ill . '
When Sophie was born , she was an easy baby , says her mother .
' She was beautiful , with lovely long lashes and gorgeous big blue eyes .
Her older brothers , Danny , now 24 , Jason , 22 , and sister Kirsty , 16 , adored her .
' For a few short weeks we were blissfully happy .
Then one day , when she was about eight weeks ' old , she became slightly constipated .
The next morning I woke up to hear her making grunting noises . '
Nancy adds : ' When I picked her up from her cot next to me , she was listless and I could see from her expression she was very uncomfortable .
' I made an appointment with the GP for that afternoon but by 11 am she was screaming in pain and felt very hot .
Then her skin became a mottled texture with purple ridges .
That was enough for me .'
Nancy went straight to the surgery and begged to see her GP immediately .
The receptionist took one look at Sophie and ran to get the doctor .
Sophie was rushed to the local hospital , North Tees General , where a team of doctors were waiting .
' By now Sophie 's hands and feet were freezing cold and her lips and eyelids purple , ' says Nancy .
The fear was meningitis , but a lumbar puncture and blood tests - which left Sophie screaming - proved negative .
Instead , she was diagnosed with a bacterial virus .
She bounced back and five days later was discharged from hospital .
Two days later , Sophie was asleep when some sixth sense made Nancy come in from the garden to check on her .
' As I walked towards the crib , I could see something was terribly wrong , ' says Nancy .
' Sophie was purple and limp and she 'd stopped breathing . '
Her screams brought Sophie 's father Simon and brother Danny , then 17 , running .
All three were too inexperienced to attempt resuscitation .
But within five minutes an ambulance crew arrived and got Sophie breathing again and took her to hospital .
But less than five minutes away , Sophie stopped breathing again .
As the blue lights flashed and the sirens wailed , the paramedics kept her alive with mouth - to - mouth resuscitation .
It took doctors 45 minutes to get Sophie breathing for herself .
Sophie was diagnosed with septicaemia and given huge quantities of antibiotics .
Doctors also ordered scans to check if she had suffered any brain damage .
Every test came back clear and the doctors - and Nancy - put the two episodes down to bad luck .
Sophie was discharged .
Three weeks later , Nancy heard her grunting and saw that her eyelids were going blue .
Recognising the signs , Nancy rushed her to hospital .
Sophie was diagnosed with an acute ear infection and once the symptoms had gone , was discharged five days later .
' Again we simply thought it was bad luck , ' says Nancy .
But as a precaution the family , including Kirsty , then eight , were taught resuscitation techniques .
Just four weeks later , they needed them .
Nancy , who had taken to cat napping beside her daughter 's cot , was woken by soft grunting sounds .
She could see that , once again , Sophie was no longer breathing .
' I picked her up and ran with her out on to the landing , laid her on the floor and started mouth - to - mouth , ' she said .
' In between , I was dialling 999 on my mobile and Kirsty came out of her room and started screaming with terror . '
Back in hospital , the diagnosis was a throat infection but by now the doctors were searching for other underlying conditions .
When Sophie was about eight months ' old , the doctors were agreed that she had some sort of immunity problem , although it was n't clear what exactly , because her white blood cell count remained normal in - between her illnesses .
Two months later , a consultant explained to Nancy that she thought Sophie had cyclical neutropenia .
' When I asked her whether it was fatal she looked away and said " possibly " .
I felt like passing out , ' recalls Nancy .
Cyclical neutropenia is one of the rarest forms of neutropenia .
Here the bone marrow stops producing neutrophils approximately every 21 days and during that time the child is unable to fight any infection .
It is incredibly difficult to diagnose because most of the time the child 's neurtrophil reading would be normal .
' The consultant explained that the only way of diagnosing the disease was by doing blood tests twice a week for six weeks , ' says Nancy .
' This would monitor the white blood count over two possible neutropenic cycles and we would then know for certain . '
The tests confirmed it .
Neutropenic children are always at risk of infection , some more than others .
But Sophie 's case is quite severe and what would be a safe level of risk for other children could kill her .
' If she had an open wound or even a scratch , and she was touched by someone with bacteria on their hands she could be overwhelmed by that bacteria within hours , ' says Nancy .
In the course of her research , Nancy came across the story of a girl who'd managed to live with the condition for 21 years , but who'd then drunk from a dirty cup - and within hours was dead .
It was a terrifying and overwhelming prospect .
' I was reading medical information on my bed one day and became so overcome with grief I slid off the bed and lay on the floor crying , ' says Nancy .
Sophie was put on a constant dose of the antibiotic Septrin to protect her as much as possible .
Nancy was also told that she had to live , as much as possible , in a sterile environment .
Her siblings had to wash their hands constantly as did anyone who came to the house .
' I went to the chemists ' and bought bottles of sterilising fluid and went home to scrub every room in the house , ' says Nancy .
' We got into a routine of cleanliness which soon become second nature .
Sometimes it felt as if I had my hands permanently in hot water . '
Sophie could n't go to nursery and if she went to the park it was when there were no other children about .
' We filled her time with drawings and music , pottering in the garden , playing with her toys and watching videos .
' But it was hard for Sophie and for my other children .
Jason was supposed to be taking his GCSEs , but he was determined to spend as much time as possible with us at the hospital and in the end he left school at 16 without taking any .
I still feel guilty about that .
' Kirsty was getting to the age where she wanted to have friends round for girly sleepovers , but because of Sophie 's condition it just was n't possible . '
' I think for a good couple of years we were all living under a dark cloud .
The bottom line was that we were terrified of losing Sophie .
Simon and I had already split up before Sophie 's illness was diagnosed , so I was the main carer . '
The antibiotics and the sterile environment seemed to work .
Although Sophie continued to contract infections , they were not nearly so rapid or severe , although she was always hospitalised .
But as she grew from babyhood and reached the age of two and half , Sophie started to ask why she could n't play with other children .
' We explained to her that she could catch bugs from other children which might kill her .
She was quite accepting and I used to hear her talking to her brothers and sister about it .
' But I could see that as she grew older the situation would become more difficult .
I felt too , that she was getting stronger and the attacks were less severe and so , when she was two and half , I made a difficult decision .
' I weighed up the risk of her contracting infections against the poor quality of life she was living and after much agonising , decided that we had to let her spread her wings .
So I enrolled her in a kindergarten .
' Her doctors were n't too happy but Sophie just loved being with other children .
Of course , it was difficult especially for the staff who had to keep Sophie as hygienic as possible , but we managed . '
Then , when she was three , disaster struck .
Within a few short hours she went from normal to comatose and by the time Nancy got her to hospital it was clear this was something more serious than usual .
Her oxygen levels were low and the doctors were unable to get her to breathe unaided .
' An X - ray showed she had pneumonia in her left lung , ' says Nancy .
' She was unconscious for 12 hours , but then she woke up and demanded gravy and mashed potato . '
However , this time there were more serious repercussions .
The damage caused to her lungs and airways by the bacterial infection left Sophie with severe asthma , which plagues her to this day .
It also meant that any more bouts of pneumonia would be even more dangerous .
Then last March Nancy went to pick Sophie up from school and found her pale , rocking on her heels , hardly able to stand .
Her teachers had been frantically trying to call Nancy but , for once , had been unable to contact her .
She was rushed to hospital .
Within a few minutes of arrival she was drifting in and out of consciousness and oxygen levels were plummeting .
As the doctors took blood , called for X - rays and hooked Sophie up to drips and wires , Nancy lay her cheek against her daughter 's face .
' I whispered : " Do n't leave me Sophie " , ' remembers Nancy , fighting to hold back the tears .
' Sophie asked : " Am I going to die , Mummy ? " and I said " Not if I have anything to do with it " . '
Sophie managed a little smile and an ' I love you ' before her eyes closed again .
Sophie had acute double pneumonia , one lung had collapsed completely .
' After years of fighting infections , countless resuscitations and miraculous recoveries , it felt like the final goodbye and I was n't sure I could bear it . '
Five and half ' long ' days later doctors removed her ventilator in the hope that she would breathe by herself .
' I could n't bear to watch so I stood on the other side of the curtain , ' says Nancy .
' Suddenly , I heard a cross little voice calling " Mummy " and I ran round and pushed the doctors out of my way in my eagerness to hold her .
' The next thing she said was " Where 's Danny ? " and my oldest son came in with tears flooding down his cheeks .
' Many people think we have been unlucky , but Sophie can walk , talk , dance , go to school and have fun , ' says Nancy .
' Lots of parents would settle for just one of those things . '
Sophie 's doctors do have one more card up their sleeves : she could be considered for G - CSF , a treatment to stimulate the production of white blood cells .
However , there are side effects and it is not a cure , but simply eases the condition .
It is seen as a last resort .
' The past seven years have been incredibly tough , ' says Nancy .
' And I would be fooling myself if we did n't think there will be hard times ahead .
' But I consider every day I have had with my lovely daughter to be a gift .
She has made us happy .'
Police in Derry , Pennsylvania are baffled by a June ATM robbery in which an unidentified man wearing flip flops and shorts strolled into Mastrorocco 's Market and reprogrammed the cash machine to think it was dispensing dollar bills instead of twenties .
Along with a female accomplice , the crook netted $ 1,540 in two visits on June 19 and 20 , according to store owner Vince Mastrorocco .
" They came in , they hit me the first day – a man and a woman – and they cleaned me out , " Mastrorocco told THREAT LEVEL .
" Then they came back the next day and cleaned me out again . "
A sergeant with the Derry Borough Police Department they 're still investigating the crime , and no arrests have been made .
Of course , THREAT LEVEL readers know exactly what happened .
The machine was a Triton 9100 , and like competitor Tranax , Triton printed its default administrative passcodes in its ATM service manuals , which have been widely available online .
We reported on this last September after a Virginia Beach gas station ATM ( a Tranax ) got hit with the same hack .
The ATM in the Derry heist was owned by the store , but operated by a company called Cardtronics .
COO
Mike Clinard says in a statement that it was Mastrorocco 's responsibility to change the passcode from its default , which is ( I kid you not ) 123456 .
The ATM in question is owned and maintained by the merchant who is responsible for loading cash and performing basic maintenance functions .
The service menu on this particular ATM model can be accessed using an administrative password that is set by the owner of the ATM , in this case Mastrorocco 's Market .
As with all password - accessible computer systems , it is necessary for the password - holders to secure any and all passwords to ensure the integrity of the system .
...
No consumer monies or personal information were lost , or can be lost , in this type of attack , which is rare and easily thwarted through the use of robust passwords kept secure by the ATM owner . "
But Mastrorocco says he could n't be expected to know the ins and outs of the ATM .
" I 'm not a technical person , " he says . " I cut meat and I sell groceries .
That 's my job .
I do n't know anything about an ATM .
I put money into it , people take it out , and I get a reading at the end of the day . "
The Triton ATMs have two levels of password : an administrative passcode for routine daily operations , and a " master passcode " that also lets you change the cash machine 's basic configuration .
Mastrorocco says he changed the administrative code when he got the machine three years ago , but Cardtronics never told him to change the master passcode , which he did n't normally use .
But he acknowledges that he knew the simple passcode was in there .
A year - and - a - half ago , Mastrorocco wanted to change the transaction surcharge on the ATM , and found his administrative code did n't give him the required access .
A Cardtronics support tech gave him the default master passcode over the phone , but neglected to urge him to change it to something else while he was at it , he says .
" They never told me anything about changing my password .
They would tell me to use 123456 . "

" Oh yeah .
I 've change it twice since then .
I 'm paranoid now .
I 'll probably do it again tonight . "

ATM Crime Spree Imminent ?
God alone knows it 's going to be difficult , but we promise we will keep an absolutely straight face as we report that Dutch escort agency Society Service has set up a special service for geek virgins looking for that elusive first sexual encounter .
Sociology student Zoe Vialet set up the agency last year , Ananova reports , and admits she 's had " a lot of demand from virgins " - most of them from the IT sector .
She explained to De Telegraaf : " They are very sweet but are afraid of seeking contact with other people .
They mean it very well but are very scared . "
Zoe has a crack team of five girls " specially trained " to pop geeks ' cherries .
However , those readers tempted to avail themselves of their charms are warned it 's not just a case of stump up the cash , insert your floppy in the drive , eject and then off for a pizza .
Au contraire , you 'll be expected to hone your skills over a extended period , as Vialet insisted : " Every booking lasts three hours minimum .
Longer is possible , shorter not .
We take the time to take a bath together , do a massage and explore each others body .
When the date is over , you will have had a fantastic experience , and you will be able to pleasure a woman . "
And just in case you thought you might just try and get a real squeeze for a bit of mutual body - exploration , think again .
Vialet warned : " You better practise before having a girlfriend .
Woman expect men older than 30 having had some experience .
Some men need a little bit of help .
But it makes them happy and they are glowing .
There is nothing more terrible than dying as a virgin . " ®
Bootnote
No , not this time - we promised to report this one straight and that 's the way it 's going to be .
Well here 's something to buoy dyspeptic workers .
According to Jing Zhou – a professor of management at Rice University in Houston and co-author of a new research paper on job dissatisfaction – grumpy employees can be forces of good within an organization .
That perpetually peppy co-worker of yours ?
Vastly over - rated .
Let 's begin with the long - held assumption that a high level of job satisfaction contributes positively to organizational effectiveness .
You call that an " intuitively appealing link . "
Has there been no empirical research to support this assumption ?
People in our field , when you see things like this , you do something called a meta analysis ...
Taken as a whole , 100 - something studies .
What do they tell us ?
What 's the general conclusion ?
That 's why we say when we look at a meta analysis result ... the relation between job satisfaction and effectiveness is not there .
Yet the image of the happy , smiling employee persists as the standard for good employee behaviour does it not ?
A lot of those things are our perceptions and are not supported by the data .
Lots of times when people are really happy , co-operative , things like that , I think they would be very beneficial for a company if the company wants people to do exactly what they are told .
You know , the routine kind of tasks ...
But tasks are complex in today 's competitive environment , so they need to be able to think .
You sampled 149 employees and found something quite surprising : those with high job dissatisfaction exhibited the highest creativity .
How do you explain that ?
This is so unconventional , it was scary to begin with because you know we thought we are kind of arguing against the majority .
But if you look at the whole thing it makes sense , because these are the employees whose job was not research and development .
So they go to work not thinking " I 'm going to be creative today . "
They only become creative when they 're dissatisfied with something and try to find a solution to it .
So the bad - mood employee can work as a change agent , in a positive way , within a corporation .
Exactly , because they see problems , whereas those who are very happy and content , the people who are always , you ask them , " Are you satisfied with your job ? " " Yes . "
" Are you satisfied with your work environment ? " " Yes .
I 'm happy with everything .
I do n't see problems . "
Therefore they do n't try to find new ideas to solve problems .
So it is the miserable employee who may have come up with new and better ways of doing things .
We want to be a bit careful with the " miserable . "
I know it 's exciting to use those extreme words .
When we say " bad mood , " this is within the typical normal range of peoples ' negative emotion .
We 're not suggesting that those are clinically depressed people ...
We 're suggesting the source , the source that triggers the bad mood , is probably that people were not happy with how things are run in the workplace .
So if companies are sensitive to that and capture that negative energy early they probably can channel that into ... an effort to find a good idea , a new idea to solve problems .
I 'm sensing management resistance to this idea .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Sure .
Absolutely ...
A lot of managers who are leaders act on conventional wisdom , not on what is right .
You are not , in fact , suggesting that bad moods necessarily lead to creativity in the workplace .
No that 's not what we 're suggesting .
Under which conditions can job dissatisfaction lead to positive outcomes ?
If you have a culture that supports innovation , if you have a supervisor or co-worker who provides developmental feedback , to focus the person who 's in a bad mood , focus the person 's attention to discovering problems , improving things .
That would help .
From the person 's perspective ... lots of people when they 're not happy they just get up and leave .
The person would need to feel somehow that it 's hard to leave .
We call that continuous commitment .
Somehow it 's hard to leave and you 're almost forced to try to make things better .
I was particularly struck by this sentence in your paper : " When employees respond to job dissatisfaction with loyalty , they are , in essence , burying their heads in the sand and carrying on as if everything were fine despite their discontentment . "
Can you expand on that ?
Loading ...

If they are loyal blindly ...
If they already see a problem but for whatever reason they feel to be loyal is to pretend there 's nothing wrong .
That would be horrible for the organization ...
Managers who do n't want to hear different opinions will reward yes men and yes women in the workplace .
So some employees have learned not to rock the boat , not to say anything that the leaders do n't want to hear , even when they see problems .
In that kind of culture and environment , they wo n't be creative .
They 'll just pretend nothing is happening .
So an active response to the unhappiness is needed on the part of the employee as opposed to passivity , or quitting .
You encourage the " expression of voice . "
What do you mean by that ?
By voice we mean ... they need to be able to speak up .
Something is not right here .
The way we 're doing things is no longer effective .
Let 's find a new and better way of doing it .
What can organizations do to encourage this untapped creativity ?
First of all they need to have a new mindset .
This is what we 're trying to do in this stream of research .
To realize that creativity is not just a job for R and D people .
It 's a job for everyone ...
Once the top management has this mindset , then they can do things we 're suggesting in our research , such as encouraging people to provide feedback , provide a culture that will support innovation and provide the climate where people ... try to make a change for the better .
Companies have a knack for placing non-risk - taking , non-creative types in management positions .
Exactly .
What then must be done ?
Well , either they do something now or be forced to do something by the external environment .
You know what I mean .
If they cannot make a change on their own terms , the competition will force them to ...
So they need to either go through training or somehow change the way leaders are developed and promoted to find and promote and select leaders who do have this healthy dose of risk - taking mindset .
I feel it 's time to tell my manager to embrace my sour moods .
Is there a particular strategy you would recommend ?
First of all , this research is about changing the conventional wisdom .
So they need to be aware this is based on scientific research .
They need to know this data comes from very vigorous research .
Second , I think today 's managers are so busy , running the processes of meetings and stuff like that , they lose the personal touch .
I say , how about an informal conversation ?
How about taking someone to lunch ?
Why ca n't a manager engage in those personal touches ?
Perhaps I could simply pass along a copy of your research paper .
Sure , that would help .
I guarantee it .
The Black Sheep of Hardesty The Smalkowski family claims persecution by their town for being atheists .
May 11 , 2007  --
Three years ago the Smalkowski family moved to an 80 - acre ranch in Oklahoma , and Nicole Smalkowski , who was 13 years old at the time , was excited about it .
" We have a whole bunch of land that 's ours , you can walk on it , you can camp on your own land . "
Nicole said .
She looked forward to playing sports at her new high school .
Nicole is a remarkable athlete , and when school started she became the only girl to play on the boys ' football team .
The boys accepted her , she said , because she kept up with them .
Then came basketball season , and at the first game , everything changed -- because after the game the girls gathered to recite the Lord 's Prayer .
From the Church to the Basketball Court
Nicole said , " I did n't think they had religion in sports .
But when it came to basketball they would pray before and after practices .
They would pray during games .
And you know , praying was a tradition for them and that is what they said . "
Even the opposing basketball team joined in -- from the stands , school officials bowed their heads .
" You could see that all of the teachers that work at the school , the administration had their heads bowed and were saying the Lord 's Prayer with the kids .
Coach has his head bowed .
It 's a thing that everyone does , " Nicole said .
This was a very uncomfortable situation for Nicole , who has been an atheist all her life .
" I would n't do it because it 's disrespectful to me .
I think it 's disrespectful to them .
Why would they want an atheist in their circle saying the Lord 's Prayer ?
I mean , if I was a Jew or Muslim or Hindu , I would have a problem with that prayer . "
The Birth of an Atheist
Nicole said she was born an atheist .
Her father , Chuck Smalkowski , long ago rejected the idea of a divine power , and religion was never mentioned in their home when she was growing up .
" My proof there is no God is you can't bring him forth , " she said .
Such atheism is unusual in the small town of Hardesty , Okla .
Faith is a big part of most people 's lives here .
The United States is an overwhelmingly faith - based nation -- a March 2007 Newsweek poll showed that 91 percent of the country believes in God .
Nicole said that once she told peers at school that she was an atheist , her relationship with the other kids changed .
" You know they would call me devil worshipper .
I 'd walk down the halls , people would laugh at me .
They would look at me really weird and stare me down . "
Then , according to Nicole , the teachers also began harassing her , one going as far as to say , " This is a Christian country , and if you do n't like it , get out . "
Diane Summerford is a substitute teacher at the high school Nicole attends and is married to one of the town 's religious leaders , Pastor Truman Summerford .
She said there was no discrimination against Nicole .
" I have never seen anything in the school where the kids treated Nicole badly .
We have good kids that care , and they are good Christian kids . "
And as for the game - end tradition , Pastor Summerford said , " It is still a free country we are living in today .
And our young people are standing up for their faith as they do this . "
The Beliefs of an Atheist
The evolutionary scientist Richard Dawkins , arguably the highest - profile atheist in the world and the author of the current best seller " The God Delusion , " is as passionate in his nonbelief as many are in their faith .
Rather than having no beliefs , as some people assume , Dawkins argued atheists are moral people .
" They believe in life , they believe in science and art and poetry and love and marriage and family -- they believe in all those things .
They just do n't believe in supernatural magic . "
Despite saying similar things on a recent book tour in the United States , Dawkins said he received far more encouragement for his beliefs than hostility .
Instead of being met with anger , he was surprised to find that " people thank me over and over again for saying what they themselves would like to say , but somehow feel they better not . "
Margaret Downey , president of Atheists Alliance International , an organization of religion - free groups and people around the world , has been gathering information on discrimination against atheists .
" We get hundreds of narratives throughout the year , and they range from everything from murder to knifings and beatings and rapes , to just community shunning , people losing jobs , people losing family members , all for the sake of staying principled and nonhypocritical when it comes to their philosophy in life . "
' A Free Ride From All Criticism '
Dawkins said it is time for atheists to speak up .
" We 've all been brought up to think that religion deserves a kind of free ride , free from all criticism . "
Nicole 's father is suing Hardesty High School , saying the school violated the Constitution by endorsing school prayer and Christian beliefs .
" The school was conspiring basically to run the atheist out of town .
Or at least out of school . "
School administrators said Nicole was bad for team morale and that she 'd stolen another student 's sneakers , so their reasons for kicking her off were fair .
Nicole claims the charges they made were unfounded .
A year later , Nicole was allowed back on the team .
This time , when the prayer started , she stayed outside the circle .
" I just stood outside of it and said the Pledge of Allegiance … Without the ' under God . ' "
The next school day , Nicole was suspended -- this time , she was accused of threatening to kill a team member .
But according to Nicole , she never said that .
Her father , troubled by what Nicole was going through , said , " These are people that are supposed to teach our young .
They 're wicked .
I 'm telling you , they 're wicked . "
Taking it to the Court
Fearing for their daughter 's safety at school , Nicole 's parents decided to home - school all three of their children .
Meanwhile , American Atheist International helped them file the civil lawsuit against the town and school , claiming they violated separation of church and state .
The school district strongly denied this , saying , " There was no schoolwide sponsored religious practices going on at Hardesty , " and Nicole " was removed from the basketball team for legitimate , nondiscriminatory reasons that had nothing to do with her religious views . "
Being out of school hurts Nicole 's chances of fulfilling her dream of going to college on an athletic scholarship .
" I miss school , but I do n't wanna go back to that school .
I tried going back to that school for two days , and I could n't handle it .
And there was a new kid there and he 's like , ' Oh , I heard about you .
You 're that dirty little troublemaking atheist . ' "
So for now , Nicole 's dreams are on hold .
A Nation in Denial ( October 2004 )
I continue to be dismayed by the disconnect between the enormity of the problems facing our nation and the apparently willful ignorance of the populace and governing class .
This is a nation in a pathological state of denial about the real world and its impending impact on the United States .
Here is a partial list of long - term difficulties which will not go away unless serious , sustained , painful changes are implemented soon .
Appallingly , the nation seems largely unaware that these problems will soon negatively influence daily life in fundamental ways :
1 . The runaway Federal deficit .
No nation running endless deficits of 3 - 4 % of GDP can finance the Medicare and Social Security costs of the 76 million Baby Boomers who start retiring in 2008 .
2 . The vast current account imbalance .
This nation has a trade imbalance of 5 % with the rest of the world .
In simple terms , we buy $ 500 billion more than we sell .
Historically .
no nation has sustained a 5 % current account deficit very long .
The only way the market has to fix this is a radical devaluation of the dollar , which will wreak its own pernicious forms of mayhem on our economy .
3 . The permanent shortage of oil .
The peak of world oil production is one or two years away .
From then on , production will decline , no matter what technologies are employed or how many new wells drilled .
Please read Hubbert 's Peak : The Impending World Oil Shortage by geophysicist Kenneth S. Deffeyes .
It will change your view of energy and our future .
4 . The precarious state of world finances .
The world is awash in cheap money and highly leveraged derivatives , setting the stage for one or more unpleasant scenarios : the return of stagflation ( rising costs in a flaccid economy ) , an unexpected global financial crisis ( think Asia 1997 or Long - Term Capital Mgt. 1998 ) which cannot be contained , or a simple devaluation of the dollar by 30 % , disrupting currency , tourism and world oil markets , which are priced in dollars .
5 . The worldwide bubble in real estate valuations .
The era of cheap and abundant money has fueled a bubble in real estate around the globe , and all bubbles end in the same way : a collapse .
The problem is that a drop of 20 % - 30 % in property values has a deeper and longer lasting effect on household finances than a similar drop in the stock market .
6 . The dangers of terrorism and the poor state of Homeland Defense .
Contrary to the party line coming from the White House , we are not safe from terrorist attack .
Non-partisan studies have found numerous inadequacies in infrastructure as ubiquitous as shipping and agriculture .
Many Homeland Security programs are underfunded .
Our nation continues to provide numerous tempting targets to terrorists , and while some " hardening " has occured , the illusion of safety is far more dangerous than a realistic appraisal of our existing vulnerabilities .
This is only a partial list of the most glaring problems facing the nation -- the list could easily be extended .
For instance , on a trip through Las Vegas last week I observed how rare it is to see a normal - sized human being in the city .
Although official statistics claim 40 % of Americans are overweight or obese , I would put the number at 75 % .
It seems we 've forgotten what a normal - sized human looks like -- and I 'm not referring to a skinny model or buffed - out athlete , I 'm just talking about a normal human body phenotype , be it thin or stocky or in between .
It is beyond debate that we as a nation are literally eating ourselves to death , yet what policies are in place to stem the tide of weight - related diseases ?
We walked into a well - known fast - food restaurant one morning for a quick breakfast and after scanning the menu of trans - fat loaded " meals " ( choice of high - fat croissant or high - fat biscuit covered with high - fat sausage and cheese , with a high - cholesterol egg in there somewhere ) , we had to walk away .
There was literally nothing even remotely healthy on the entire menu .
I am not a health nut by any means , but eating a diet of high - salt , high - fat ( 50 % or more of total calories ) fiber - less , vitamin - deficient " food " is simply a slow form of suicide .
It 's not what we 're designed to eat .
While it is possible to find an occasional alternative ( a garden burger or some chicken sandwich which is n't deep - fried ) , you have to get lucky to find an outlet which serves such an alternative .
It 's frightening how poor the food is in this " fast food nation , " and how unhealthy its citizens have become .

The giant isopod scientific name is Bathynomus giganteus .
It is the largest member of the Isopod family .
It is related to the little pillbugs you might find in your back yard .
The giant isopod is a carnivorous crustacean that hunts and scavenges on the deep ocean floor .
They are all over the world ’s oceans at 550 - 7020 ft ( 170 - 2140 m ) .
Food is very rare in the ocean depths , so the giant isopod will eat whatever it can find .
Giant isopods can grow to be 18 inches ( 45 cm ) .
If the giant isopod is attacked or scared , it will roll up in a ball .
Giant isopods have complex mouths .

I do expect the draft of the GPL v3 today .
Naturally , I 'll let you know the second I know .
[ Update :
The third discussion draft of GPLv3 has been published by the Free Software Foundation .
The new draft and its accompanying rationale document [ PDF ] are available at http://gplv3.fsf.org/ and there are other GPL resources on Groklaw 's GPL page .
So the discussion begins .
There is also a press release , highlighting the changes , and I 'll put it at the end of this article .
Note that this is a draft , which will be discussed for 60 days and then there will be a final draft after that . ]
Meanwhile , for those who think GPL v2 is silent about patents , here 's an article by two attorneys at Fenwick & West on the tantalizing topic , " Potential Defenses of Implied Patent License Under the GPL " [ PDF ] .
GPL v2 restricts patents ??
Yup .
The attorneys , Adam Pugh and Laura A. Majerus , thought it was useful , indeed necessary , to try to figure out what GPL - protected folks could do if accused of patent infringement .
So they wrote an article about the hypothetical situation where an entity releases software under the GPL and then tries to sue a recipient for patent infringement .
There indeed * is * an implied patent license in GPLv2 , which will be make explicit in GPLv3 , and that is why the article addresses the issue :
The previous issue of this Bulletin ... included an introductory article , which discussed whether open source and patent rights can coexist .
In general , patent rights may be substantially limited due to an implied license when the target infringing activity is cover by the GPL .
They wrote that about GPLv2 .
So if you think no one should use a software license to address patents , the GPL already does , my friends .
So please do n't waste my time placing that thought in a comment on the draft .
Read this article instead .
That 's why the Novell - Microsoft patent deal sticks in the community 's craw , and why I personally doubt it is harmonious with GPLv2 .
I think that Eben Moglen just found an easier way to block it than through litigation .
If you 've followed the SCO Magical Mystery Tour , where after four years , we still do n't know what it 's actually about , you may be able to figure out why it could be easier and cheaper to just fix the license to make things crystal clear .
The article discusses four doctrines of implied license , legal estoppel , equitable estoppel , conduct and acquiescence .
Regarding the first , legal estoppel , which just means you can't grant a legal right and then snatch it away , the article says :
In the hypothetical case above , the accused infringer has an argument that the elements of legal estoppel are met .
Through the GPL , the patentee has granted the accused infringer the right to make and distribute the invention .
While usage rights may not be explicitly granted under the GPL , it can be argued they are necessary to effectively practice the rights that have been granted .
Both the right to practice the invention ( through the GPL ) and an attempt to derogate that right ( by claiming the licensee has no right to use the licensed invention ) are present .
Satisfying the legal estoppel theory also requires showing that the licensor received valuable consideration for the license .
One possible item of consideration received under the GPL is the reciprocity agreement -- the promise by the licensee to license any further distribution of the program and any works based on it under the terms of the GPL .
In Wang , the proliferation of the plaintiff 's technology and adoption of it as an industry standard were enough to form consideration under legal estoppel .
The licensee may be able to argue that the benefits any licensor receives from agreeing to comploy with the licensee form sufficient valuable consideration to imply a license by legal estoppel .
Let 's imagine , for a moment , that Novell , instead of being a GPL bumbler , turned out to be a Ninja .
Then the fact that Microsoft was persuaded to distribute vouchers for SUSE , which is distributed under the GPL , might be a way to tie their hands .
It could be argued , as I understand the article to be indicating , that you could argue that Microsoft can't help distribute SUSE and then sue over folks using it .
N'est - ce pas ?
And that would be entirely separate from any patent peace nonsense .
And Novell helping Microsoft make Open XML a standard might , in Ninja land , be a way to force it to lose its patent rights .
However , you 'll note the article repeatedly says that these are possible defenses , that it * might * work to plead so and so .
GPLv2 is only an implied license .
GPLv3 will be explicit .
I found all this in a wonderful new resource , Litilaw , which publishes free legal articles on a broad range of topics .
I found this particular article on the list on their Intellectual Property page .
If you are a lawyer , you can add your article to their collection , by the way , of " hundreds of recently published articles of interest to litigators and related legal professionals .
All articles are full - text , written by lawyers and have been published as part of continuing legal education ( CLE ) seminars , in legal journals , or are of similar quality . "
Enjoy !
And , yes , I was only kidding about what you can say .
You can express your thoughts about GPL v3 here , by all means .
But I do want you to know the reality , which is that there is indeed an implied patent license in GPLv2 .
Update : Novell 's position .
Update :
Here 's the FSF press release , which explains the draft process going forward and highlights changes in this draft : ********************************
BOSTON , Massachusetts , USA --- Wednesday , March 28 , 2007 --- The Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) today released the third discussion draft for version 3 of the most widely used free software license , the GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL ) .
Today 's draft incorporates the feedback received from the general public , official discussion committees , and two international conferences held in India and Japan .
Many significant changes have been made since the previous draft , released in July 2006 .
In recognition of this fact , the FSF now plans to publish one additional draft before the final text of GPL version 3 .
Changes in this draft include : * First - time violators can have their license automatically restored if they remedy the problem within thirty days .
* License compatibility terms have been simplified , with the goal of making them easier to understand and administer .
* Manufacturers who include the software in consumer products must also provide installation information for the software along with the source .
This change provides more narrow focus for requirements that were proposed in previous drafts .
*
New patent requirements have been added to prevent distributors from colluding with patent holders to provide discriminatory protection from patents .
Richard Stallman , president of the FSF and principal author of the GNU GPL , said , " The GPL was designed to ensure that all users of a program receive the four essential freedoms which define free software .
These freedoms allow you to run the program as you see fit , study and adapt it for your own purposes , redistribute copies to help your neighbor , and release your improvements to the public .
The recent patent agreement between Microsoft and Novell aims to undermine these freedoms .
In this draft we have worked hard to prevent such deals from making a mockery of free software . "
Today 's draft will be open for discussion for sixty days .
The FSF will solicit input in a wide array of public venues and make changes as needed in response .
After this period , it will release a " last call " draft , followed by another thirty days for discussion before the FSF 's board of directors approves the final text of GPL version 3 .
More information about this draft is available at http://gplv3.fsf.org, including the full text , detailed explanations of the latest changes , and new plans for finalizing the license .
As with the previous drafts , the FSF encourages community members to provide feedback on the new draft at this site .
About the GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL )
The GNU GPL is the most widely used free software license worldwide : almost three quarters of all free software packages are distributed under this license .
It is not , however , the only free software license .
Richard Stallman wrote the version 1 and 2 of the GNU GPL with legal advice from Perkins , Smith & Cohen .
Version 1 was released in 1989 , and version 2 in 1991 .
Since 1991 , free software use has increased tremendously , and computing practices have changed , introducing new opportunities and new threats .
In 2005 , Stallman began revising the GPL for version 3 .
In January 2006 , the FSF began a systematic process of public review and feedback , with legal advice and organizational support from the Software Freedom Law Center .
About the GNU Operating System and Linux Richard Stallman announced in September 1983 the plan to develop a free software Unix - like operating system called GNU .
GNU is the only operating system developed specifically for the sake of users ' freedom .
See http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html.
In 1992 , the essential components of GNU were complete , except for one , the kernel .
When in 1992 the kernel Linux was re-released under the GNU GPL , making it free software , the combination of GNU and Linux formed a complete free operating system , which made it possible for the first time to run a PC without non-free software .
This combination is the GNU / Linux system .
For more explanation , see http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html.
The GNU components in the GNU system will be released under GPL version 3 , once it is finalized .
The licensing of Linux will be decided by the developers of Linux .
If they decide to stay with GPL version 2 , then the GNU / Linux system will contain GNU packages using GNU GPL version 3 , alongside Linux under GNU GPL version 2 .
Many other packages with various licenses make up the full GNU / Linux system .
About Free Software and Open Source
The free software movement 's goal is freedom for computer users .
Some , especially corporations , advocate a different viewpoint , known as " open source " , which cites only practical goals such as making software powerful and reliable , focuses on development models , and avoids discussion of ethics and freedom .
These two viewpoints are different at the deepest level .
For more explanation , see http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
The GNU GPL is used by developers with various views , but it was written to serve the ethical goals of the free software movement .
Says Stallman , " The GNU GPL makes sense in terms of its purpose : freedom and social solidarity .
Trying to understand it in terms of the goals and values of open source is like trying understand a CD drive 's retractable drawer as a cupholder .
You can use it for that , but that is not what it was designed for . "
About The Free Software Foundation The Free Software Foundation , founded in 1985 , is dedicated to promoting computer users ' right to use , study , copy , modify , and redistribute computer programs .
The FSF promotes the development and use of free ( as in freedom ) software --- particularly the GNU operating system and its GNU / Linux variants --- and free documentation for free software .
The FSF also helps to spread awareness of the ethical and political issues of freedom in the use of software .
Its Web site , located at www.fsf.org, is an important source of information about GNU / Linux .

If President Bush is serious about getting tough on U.S. employers who hire illegal aliens , he can start with his own administration , which employs thousands of unauthorized workers , says the top Republican on the House immigration subcommittee .
A 2006 audit showed federal , state and local governments are among the biggest employers of the half - million persons in the U.S. illegally using “ non-work ” Social Security numbers — numbers issued legally , but with specific instructions that the holders are not authorized to work in the U.S .
“ Let ’s clean up our own house , let ’s especially clean up the federal employment of all those working for the federal government , ” said Rep. Steve King , Iowa Republican and ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee ’s immigration subcommittee .
The Social Security Administration used to , but no longer does , issue non-work numbers to legal aliens who were not authorized to work but needed a number to obtain a federal or state benefit or service .
Still , hundreds of thousands of those immigrants used the numbers to get a job .
According to the 2006 audit by the Social Security inspector general , 17 of the 100 worst employers using employees with non-work numbers were government agencies : seven federal agencies , seven state agencies and three local governments .
That means the government knows who those employees are , but usually does not go after them .
Earlier this month , Homeland Security and Commerce departments announced a new crackdown on illegal entry that includes stricter enforcement against employers .
The departments said they will encourage businesses to use E - Verify to check employees ’ Social Security numbers , and said the federal government will write new rules requiring all private contractors and vendors that do business with it to use E - Verify .
Under current law , neither business nor federal agencies are required to use E - Verify , formerly known as the Basic Pilot Program .
Mr. King said the administration should n’t wait for new rules to begin checking federal employees against the non-work list .
“ There ’s a lot more they can do , but the federal government ’s at least got to run their non-work Social Security numbers against their own employee database , and then they ’ve got to require states to do that , and local governments to do that , ” he said .
The problem is broader than just federal hiring .
The latest figures from the Social Security Administration , reported in March , found 521,426 non-work Social Security numbers had earnings credited to them for work done in 2005 and credited during calendar year 2006 .
Social Security provides a list of those numbers to Homeland Security every year , but the department has been reluctant to use them for enforcement , arguing to Congress in testimony last year it would take a significant amount of resources and could distract from national security priorities .
Homeland Security also says a high percentage of the non-work numbers turn out to be clerical errors or workers who later obtained authorization .
The inspector general says those cases do occur , but more often than not — about 60 percent of the time — the employees are in fact not authorized to work in the U.S .
The audit said for government agencies , the percentage is slightly lower : 44 percent of the government workers identified in their sample were unauthorized for employment in the U.S .
The inspector general did not name the 100 worst employers on its list .
The inspector general said as long as workers are using invalid numbers , homeland security is threatened , and said telling employers directly about employees using invalid numbers could help stem the flow of illegal workers .
In a sample of 275 individuals using non-work numbers , the inspector general found two were found to have warrants for deportation already lodged against them .
The inspector general said it forwarded that information to Homeland Security for action .
Meanwhile , Rep. Duncan Hunter , California Republican and presidential hopeful , says Mr. Bush is falling behind on construction of the U.S. - Mexico border fence that he signed into law last year .
In a letter to the president , Mr. Hunter said just 17.9 miles of the new double - tier fencing has been constructed as of Aug. 10 — putting the administration off the pace he said it needs to build 392 miles by May 30 .
All told , he said the fence is supposed to reach 854 miles which , because of the region ’s geography , will seal off about 700 miles of the U.S. - Mexico border .
The Washington Times reported earlier this month the U.S. Border Patrol sent out a memo calling for agents to volunteer to help build fencing because they are going to fall short of their goal .
Scott Stanzel , a spokesman for the White House , said they are trying to secure the border by adding Border Patrol agents and vehicle barriers .
He said there are 100 miles of fencing on the border , and they want a total of 145 miles by September , though those figures include single - tier fencing and fencing that was built in prior years .

US turns U - 2 spy planes on itself , raising specter of broader surveillance John Byrne
Published : Thursday August 9 , 2007

In a striking but unnoticed extension of domestic surveillance , the little - known National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency deployed a U - 2 spy plane on the region affected by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to track hazards to public health .
In an article Thursday , Salon 's Tim Shorrock explores the emergence of the NGA , born in 1996 from a partnership between the CIA , the Pentagon and the agency that maintains America 's spy satellites .
The single - seat high - altitude plane , originally designed for CIA spy missions -- remembered perhaps for a 1960 mission where a plane was shot down over the Soveit Union -- is a key element of the US arsenal in collecting intelligence overseas .
Its high - resolution imagery is critical for examining nuclear and other weapons sites .
In a way , Shorrock suggests the visible mission of the U - 2 over New Orleans is akin to the visible mission of the U - 2 over the Soviet Union -- a tip of the iceberg in a much larger program that most of America knows nothing about .
He notes that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ' recent testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first time confirmed the existence of various other domestic surveillance programs beyond those first disclosed by the New York Times , similarly intimating the domestic flyovers are more subversive than simply being used for weather catastrophes .
" In 2003 , the NGA was formally inaugurated as a combat support agency of the Pentagon , " he reveals .
" It is responsible for supplying overhead imagery and mapping tools to the military , the CIA and other intelligence agencies -- including the National Security Agency , whose wide - reaching , extrajudicial spying inside the United States under the Bush administration has been a heated political issue since first coming to light in the media nearly two years ago . "
" The NGA 's role in Hurricane Katrina has received little attention outside of a few military and space industry publications , " he adds .
" But the agency 's close working relationship with the NSA -- whose powers to spy domestically were just expanded with new legislation from Congress -- raises the distinct possibility that the U.S. government could be doing far more than secretly listening in on phone calls as it targets and tracks individuals inside the United States .
With the additional capabilities of the NGA and the use of other cutting - edge technologies , the government could also conceivably be following the movements of those individuals minute by minute , watching a person depart from a mosque in , say , Lodi , Calif . , or drive a car from Chicago to Detroit . "
In 2004 , the National Security Agency ( which has overseen Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program ) announced they 'd signed an agreement with the NGA to share resources and staff , including their sources , information infrastructure and " exploitation techniques . "
The document itself is classified , though according to Salon an NGA press release explained " the pact allows ' horizontal integration ' between the two agencies , defined as " working together from start to finish , using NGA 's ' eyes ' and NSA 'ears . ' "
This collaboration was perhaps most visible when the US bombed a safe house of Abu Musab al - Zarqawi in Iraq .
" Eventually , it all comes down to physical location , " NGA director Robert Murrett told reporters at the time .
When the NSA and NGA pooled resources , he added , " the multiplier effect is dramatic . "
Still , the U - 2 is n't designed for tracking individuals , even if the Bush Administration wanted to .
Director of GlobalSecurity.org John Pike told Salon , " NGA imagery is not what you would use to track people . "
But NGA imagery could be combined with that of other surveillance networks .
London , for instance , has installed a fleet of spy cameras on city streets , and similar cameras have been deployed in Washington , D.C. and New York , though DC police say they have n't helped fight crime .
" U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies now have at their disposal facial recognition software that can identify one person among thousands in a large crowd , " Shorrock notes .
" Combine that with the awesome eavesdropping power of the NSA and the ability of the NGA to capture live imagery from satellites and UAVs , and the result could be an ability to track any individual , in real time , as he or she moves around . "

I am a Southern Redneck .
I am a River Rat who learned to swim in the Catawba River and I am descended from Revolutionary soldiers who turned the tide of the American Revolution .
I am descended from Rednecks , River Rats , and Revolutionaries .
It is my birthright , my heritage and my upbringing .
I am North Carolina bred ; a child born in what was once known as the Great Back Country .
How lucky can you be ?
It is enough to make you rush to the kitchen , grab grandmaâ€™s fruitcake and wash it down with a quart of buttermilk .
I arrived at this prideful stand while performing my duties as the unofficial Shuffletown ambassador to the Peopleâ€™s Republic of California .
In the past four years , I have come face - to - face with prejudice .
This prejudice has become a sport enjoyed by those born outside the South ; those who have accepted as truth that all Southern rednecks are dumb as cabbage , rowdy , beer guzzling , white bigots who speak with a speech impediment and marry their cousins .
I take particular offense to the last assumption .
It is a sport practiced with smugness and arrogance .
And I am tired of it .
At dinner parties I have been treated like a quaint human specimen who has a hoop skirt hanging in my closet .
A native of Brooklyn once looked at me and said , “ I just donâ€™t understand “ youse ” guys who say , “ yâ€™all . ”
Because Southerners are good - natured and appreciate a good joke or tale , we have been too long in denial .
These are bad tidings , but it is time we spoke of it openly .
It is time for us to stand together .
It is time for us to set aside our tolerance — time , to educate the less fortunate .
We , the fortunate , have assumed that the days of prejudice are behind us .
We have been lulled into this condition by the mass Northern migrations overtaking the South .
Due to our natural hospitality , we have tolerated the jokes and assumptions because they are now our neighbors and friends .
And , it is very likely , they will never return to their former lives .
As they settle among us , great amounts of understanding will be required .
Especially with those seeking refuge from the crazed , over - stressed , smog laden cities of Boston , Los Angeles , and the Mecca of induced insanity , New York City .
The South is Americaâ€™s pacifier .
In American family rooms throughout our nation , media propaganda about the South is fed to us like candy .
Many come to think that no matter how bad things are , “ well , at least , we were not born in the South . ”
It is time to right the world before it is too late ; before we are absorbed into the mainstream like copper pennies , good sense , and grandmaâ€™s bloomers — we become extinct .
Take them to lunch , listen to their tales of woe ; pour them sweet tea , feed them cornbread , deviled eggs , potato salad and buttered grits .
Our first rule of etiquette is to overlook how they speak and how they think .
Recently , I watched Kim Basinger , the ex-wife of Alec Baldwin , in the starring role of the movie , “ Runway . ”
For two hours she spoke in an imitation of a Southern accent .
It sounded as if , she had either a plug of tobacco , a half eaten peach pit , or a wet cotton ball caught in her throat .
Her portrayal of a dumb Southern Belle out of her element was a national joke and , today , an acceptable prejudice .
Imagine , nails dragging across a blackboard .
It was downright embarrassing .
There she was , in a movie shown around the world , trying to act like she didnâ€™t have the IQ of asparagus .
She was the beautiful , vacant - headed , Southern Belle of untold fantasies .
They must have made her talk like that ; because I think she was born in the South and should know better .
The movie took place in Paris , France , during fashion week , where the sophisticated members of the French Fashion Industry unveil clothing no self - respecting person would wear in public — except at costume balls .
Of course , pious American clothing designers were among the elite , worldly international , members of the “ illusion - driven ” fashion world .
Their designs are unveiled on sacred runways worn by models whose bodies resemble coat racks .
Bless their hearts , these women have bodies like andirons and their eyeballs stare back at the world from sunken sockets heavily lined in black mascara .
I guess they are women ; they say they are ; but , Lord have mercy , they are so pitiful and emaciated , who would know ?
Oh , yeah , we Southerners want to look like that .
It is enough to make you rush to the kitchen , grab grandmaâ€™s fruitcake and wash it down with a quart of buttermilk .
And poor Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin , they cannot help it that they seem to be lacking in good breeding ; but who among us Southerners would air our dirty laundry in the public media ?
God bless them both .
I tell you , we have got to pitch in and help out .
The world is off its rocker .
But I digress .
Letâ€™s talk about the current television series , “ The Closer ” .
It is well - written , but each time I watch the starâ€™s big red lips smacking up and down as she speaks in a “ Southern ” accent that can only be attributed to one who was born with hair on her tongue — well , it makes me want to cry .
I guess the objective of the show is to prove that anyone can rise above a speech impediment and it proves that blondes can memorize .
Due to my good breeding and because I do not want to embarrass my mother , I have tolerated these folks .
However , it was at dinner in Washington , DC , with Southern friends when I realized the depth of this problem .
We were sitting on the second floor patio beneath a linden tree at a restaurant in Georgetown .
The sun was slipping beneath the horizon , when I heard the retired surgeon say , “ My son is graduating from high school this year and I need to change his mind about the South .
He thinks Southerners are all prejudiced rednecks and I want to change his mind . ”
It turned out that our friend had been married to a girl from up north ; after their divorce , she had raised their son among the disillusioned citizens of Maine .
We advised him to take his son south for a long stay , as quickly as possible .
I just hope the boy is smart enough to gain entrance into a Southern university .
Then at a dinner , just last week , to welcome my favorite Los Angeles girlfriend , Sandy , the problem became crystal clear .
Sandy was born in rural Florida , one mile from the Alabama line ; she is a successful corporate executive , a former cheerleader , beauty queen , and raconteur .
Sandy is perfectly Southern .
As we scraped the last remnants of red-velvet cakes from our plates and sipped coffee , Sandy said , “ It sure is good to be here with folks who donâ€™t think my intelligence is stunted because I am Southern . ”
Jeannie dropped her fork , “ I lived in Long Beach , just outside of L.A. , for more than a decade ; I got so tired of people assuming that I was prejudiced .
“ Some of those folks were well - educated and they were the worst of the lot . ”
“ When I first arrived in California , they acted like my grandfathers had all worn sheets after dark , ” Sandy continued .
“ And the fact that I am a natural blonde didnâ€™t help things at all .
At first , I was astounded at the constant barrage of prejudicial comments ; but , the truth is , itâ€™s been going on for decades .
One man asked me , “ Did you trade your little pick - up truck for a Mercedes . ”
I told him , I still had my pick - up truck . ”
“ They treated me like I was the red - headed step - child of the family , ” Jeannie said .
“ Well , you know , I just consider the source , ” Sandy continued , “ I just overlook them .
If these comments had been made about anyone else — then you could imagine the outcry ?
However , it seems that slandering Southerners is the countryâ€™s only politically correct , perfectly acceptable , prejudice . ”
It is enough to make you want to throw grits .

That is an amazing amount of firepower .
That is in reality about 300 planes and 1700 Tomahawk and Asroc missiles .
To put that in perspective , during the first Gulf War the US used a total of 286 Tomahawks in that engagement .
If joined by a fourth Carrier force those totals will jump to 400 planes and around 2200 Tomahawk and Asroc missiles .
For those of you who may not quite understand just how much power that is , that battle group is capable of causing more destruction than was caused in every war in the last century .
Not just American wars , but all of the worlds wars in the last century .
So why would the U.S. put so much Naval power in the region ?
I am not sure what our intentions are .
You might say with Iran thumbing their nose at the U.S. and the U.N. there is the possibility of a naval blockade of Iran .
There is a distinct possibility of a blockade .
However , the two carrier groups in the region could do so with out a problem .
Could it just be saber rattling to intimidate Iran ?
I believe anyone who knows the military potential of two carrier groups would know that two is intimidating enough , but three and , according to promises made by Dick Cheney and reported to the FreeMarket News , a fourth still to come .
That is not only overkill and a waist of taxpayer money and might but I say that is extremely dangerous .
Putting the Enterprise and three Nimitz class carriers in one place when there are only 10 Nimitz class carriers in the U.S Navy is illogical unless .....
You plan to use them .
Let ’s say that the U.S. is all of the worlds oceans , this would be like putting four of eleven carriers in Rhodes Island .
It would not make any sense unless you plan to invade Connecticut .
Also for those who do n’t know that much about the Navy , The USS Enterprise and it ’s predecessors have a long history of being where the action is and the Navy has a habit of using this type of hype for publicity reasons .
Which in my opinion only goes to reinforce my belief that " The Big E " and her strike group are there for a reason .
Now let ’s keep in mind the amount of power , the danger of that much of our naval power in one area and the Enterprise and the role that she and her namesakes have had in history and lets look at what else is going on in the U.S. / Iran arena .
Most recently on 6/26 the US 's former Ambassador to the UN , Neo-Conservative John Bolton , told The Jerusalem Post :
" Sanctions and diplomacy have failed and it may be too late for internal opposition to oust the Islamist regime ... the Bush administration does not recognize the urgency of the hour and that the options are now limited to only the possibility of regime change from within or ( from ) a last - resort military intervention . "
So , what he in the past called " Simple air strikes " is no longer enough we must take action to change the regime .
So that brings us back to nation building and we all know how well that has gone in the past .
Although you do not have a significant Sunni population in Iran , like you do in Iraq , you will have steadfast resistance to any government that the US tries to prop up .
The second problem I have with Bolton ’s comments , is that " sanctions and diplomacy have failed " .
What diplomacy ?
There was no diplomacy until pressure mounted by StopIranWar.com and Generals Wes Clark , Paul Eaton and John Batiste became so overwhelming that the administration had to act .
Even then the diplomacy was only a token gesture .
There was no real attempt by the administration to exit from this road to war that we currently travel .
Now I want to talk about # 1 Neo - Con Dick Cheney .
I want to look at several of his statements over the past few months and discuss them .
First while on the USS Stennis on May 11 , he said :
" The United States is prepared to use its naval power to keep Tehran from disrupting oil routes or gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region . "
Okay is n’t that really it , to keep Iran from blocking oil routes and dominating the region .
It always comes back to the oil .
The Neo-Cons which have proven on too many occasions that they are only interested in big business and these days the biggest business in the world is the oil business .
As to the dominating the region , Cheney obviously feels that it is his job to dominate the middle east because , it is the home of the majority of the worlds oil supply .
With Cheney seemingly obsessed with a war with Iran , CBS and Political Animal reported the following on 6/1 :
Political Animal ) CHENEY AND IRAN .... Remember that report from Steve Clemons last week about how Dick Cheney is hoping to get Israel to attack Iran in order to provoke a shooting war that will suck in the United States ?
Today in the New York Times , Helene Cooper confirms it :
In interviews , people who have spoken with Mr. Cheney 's staff have confirmed the broad outlines of the report , and said that some of the hawkish statements to outsiders were made by David Wurmser , a former Pentagon official who is now the principal deputy assistant to Mr. Cheney for national security affairs .
Good 'ol David Wurmser .
A neocon 's neocon .
Co-author in 1996 of " A Clean Break , " the infamous document that proposed giving up on peace in the Middle East in favor of armed attacks on Syria , Iran , Lebanon , and , while we 're at it , Iraq too .
A man who proposed attacking South America in retaliation for 9/11 .
The guy who keeps Cheney bucked up when things look bad .
Unsurprisingly , this news did n't go over well with non-crazy people During an interview with BBC Radio that was broadcast today , Mohamed ElBaradei , the director - general of the International Atomic Energy Agency , said he did not want to see another war like the one still raging in Iraq five years after the American - led invasion there .
" You do not want to give additional argument to new crazies who say , ' let 's go and bomb Iran , ' " Mr. ElBaradei said , in his strongest warning yet against the use of force in Iran .
.... Several Western European officials also echoed his concern , and said privately that they are worried that Mr. Cheney 's " red lines " — the point at which he believes that Iran is on the brink of acquiring a nuclear weapon and a military strike is necessary — may be coming up soon .
" We fully believe that Foggy Bottom is committed to the diplomatic track , " one European official said Wednesday .
" But there 's some concern about the Vice President 's office . "
And the White House 's response ?
An unnamed senior official did n't Political Animal ) CHENEY AND IRAN ....
Remember that report from Steve Clemons last week about how Dick Cheney is hoping to get Israel to attack Iran in order to provoke a shooting war that will suck in the United States ?
Today in the New York Times , Helene Cooper confirms it :
Seeing this report along with the Bolton interview in The Jerusalem Post , it appears that John Bolton is being a good little Neo -Con and helping his leader ( Cheney ) with his plan of goading Israel into attacking Iran .
That of course would allow them to come to the aid of their ally and enter the Israeli / Iranian conflict .
Everything these and other Neo -Cons seem to be interested in is starting yet another unnecessary war .
It seems if they cannot accomplish it one way , they will simply employ an end run and find another way .
That is why it is so important that we , as Americans , take every possible step in preventing the Neo - Con / Big Business machine from starting a war that is only going to benefit them and not the common man in America .
So right now take the time to visit StopIranWar.com and sign the petition to the president but do n’t stop there , go ahead and sign the petition to Congress .
Do what ever you can do from printing the petitions and hitting the streets to getting signatures , or picking up the phone and calling your Congressman .
We need as much support as possible so make sure to get your spouse , parents , adult children and friends to join you and visit StopIranWar.com and sign the petitions .
This is " Our America " make sure that it is clear to them which course we want it to take .
That our interests should be their main concern , not the concerns of
big business .

Behind the walled farmhouses , where fields of cotton and fennel bask in bright sunshine , the desert begins .
Pale ochre sand dunes loom over rows of carefully tended crops that represent a lifetime of labor for the 21 families who live here .
As the desert closes in , this community has been told to leave , so that their fields can be replanted with native grass .
Local authorities say this will revive the parched land and halt the sand dunes , and have promised new land and housing to villagers .
The forced move is an admission that China 's grandiose plans to turn its arid land into farms have run dry .
In recent years , China has met some success in slowing the sands by imposing curbs on grazing in Inner Mongolia and other measures .
But with China 's average annual land loss of about950 square miles to desertification , according to researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences , in addition to vast swaths of land turned over to industry and housing , the amount of farmland available to feed a large population is being pinched .
In all , more than 10,500 residents of Minqin County in northwest Gansu Province , along the ancient Silk Road , are due to be relocated over the next three years .
It 's a tactical retreat after decades of cropping that exhausted scarce water resources .
What matters now , say experts , is preventing this and other marginal land from turning into vast dust bowls where nothing grows .
" Minqin is an example of what 's happening all over China .
If we lose villages here , we can expect to lose villages in other places , " says Sun Qingwei , a researcher on desertification at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Lanzhou , the provincial capital .
For decades , China has been trying to hold back the deserts that cover one - third of the country and produce seasonal sandstorms that scour Beijing and other northern cities .
Experts say deforestation and overfarming are to blame for desertification , though global warming may become a greater factor in the future , as the Tibetan glaciers that feed China 's waterways are melting .
China has more than 20 percent of the world 's population and only 7 percent of its arable land .
China announced Monday that rising food prices pushed the inflation rate in July to 5.6 percent , a 10 - year high .
Adding to the pressure on farmland is rampant environmental degradation that has poisoned waterways and soil .
Attempting to stop the sandy tide
To combat the encroaching Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts , China has planted billions of trees – to replace felled forests and as barriers against the sand .
This is n't a panacea , though , say experts , as thirsty trees can exacerbate the problem by sucking up groundwater .
" Planting trees is one way , but it 's not that simple .
It does n't tackle the fundamental issue " of water resources , says Wu Bo , a professor at the Chinese Academy of Forestry in Beijing .
" We need to calculate how much water the trees will absorb , or else it could have a negative impact . "
Villagers in Zhengxin have taken on this challenge , with limited success .
When the irrigation channels began to run dry , Lu Xianglin switched from wheat to cotton and fennel on his 12 acres .
He also planted trees to protect his fields from sandstorms .
He says he still gets good yields using flood irrigation and earns a decent income for his family of six , who live in a walled courtyard house .
Other farmers have n't stuck it out :
About 1 in 3 have left Zhengxin in the past 10 years after their wheat crops wilted .
Young people who can find jobs in the towns rarely return .
Last week , Mr. Lu joined the other men in his village on a government - arranged trip to see the land that has been set aside for their relocation , nearly 40 miles to the south .
The next day , he was back pruning his cotton fields , shaking his head at the plan .
The prospect of uprooting his family troubles him , as does the idea of abandoning the land that fed his forefathers .
He prefers to stay and keep up the fight .
" With enough water , this problem can be solved , " Lu says .
" We can plant trees and grass , and they will grow bigger .
That will stop the desert . "
Experts say that farmers in Zhengxin could switch to drip irrigation to lessen their water intake for growing crops , but warn that it may be too late to reverse the soil erosion .
Elsewhere in the region , farmers have erected brick greenhouses this year as part of a plan to grow vegetables using less water .
Roadside signs above the windswept plains urge farmers to " Save Water , Protect the Environment . "
A legacy of flawed past policies
Elderly residents remember when there was plenty to go around .
Hongyashan reservoir , which was built in the 1950s under Mao Zedong 's ill - fated " Great Leap Forward " campaign , fed the frontier fields of Minqin , spurring dreams of bumper grain harvests .
It was a testament to Mao 's dogged belief that man must " use natural science to understand , conquer , and change nature . "
But decades of unchecked development , including new upstream cropland , depleted the reservoir , so farmers began sinking wells that sapped the water table and left the soil contaminated with salt .
Recent wells go nearly 1,000 feet deep in arid areas .
Today , the reservoir is an expanse of shallow water that occasionally runs dry .
A neon sign carries a message from President Hu Jintao , a hydrologist who began his career in Gansu , proclaiming that Minqin must not be lost to the desert .
Heroic posters of Mao still adorn some walls here , but his vow to conquer the desert rings hollow .
In Hoanghui , the first village due to move out at the end of August , residents gripe at the government compensation of RMB 3,000 ( US$ 395 ) per person being offered .
To force them out , authorities have turned off wells and stopped farmers from planting their spring crops .
" I have no option , " says Zhao Yongfu , a wiry farmer in a baggy blue shirt .
" The government tells me to move and wo n't listen to us . "
After being a part of the developer hiring process for a while now , I have begun to see what distinguishes an exceptional web developer ( the ones that get hired faster than we can even make an offer ) and everybody else .
Things have changed since 1995 – web development requires actual knowledge of programming !
The problem is that people think web development is somehow easier than other types of development .
Nothing is inherently easier about developing an application in PHP than in C ++.
While I could accuse people who say this as being naive , the truth is that web developers themselves seem to hold this as the truth .
In order to excel at being a web developer , one must understand how to develop an application .
In other words , there are very different skills required in programming something like Facebook or Digg than for updating Mom ’s store website .
First , you must actually understand object oriented programming ( OOP ) .
Everybody these days says they “ know ” OOP .
I do n’t mean “ you read about it in a book ” or that you can use a class when necessary ; I mean being able to write extensible , modular libraries .
This takes time and practice .
When people first begin writing classes , they mistake the process for “ grouping up functions under one class name in one file . ”
This is dead wrong and actually counter productive in some cases .
Classes are about automation and simplification .
The classic analogy for OOP is a car because it has many parts that make it a whole .
But just like the driver has no idea what a crank shaft , piston , or fuel injector does , people using your class should have no idea ( nor need to learn why ) about the inner workings of your class .
All they need to know is that calling one of the few public methods ( turn_ignition ( ) , step_on_pedal ( ) , steer ( ) ) does a whole lot of cool stuff behind the scenes that makes their life easier .
And just like how you would n’t want the entire car engine welded together ( instead of using bolts and screws ) , you should n’t write humongous class methods that do 1000 things — break it up into digestible parts so that other people can enhance just the pieces they want ( see “ overloading ” below ) .
When you design a class , you start by listing out things that the class will be used for .
Then , you figure out the lowest common denominators between these actions to remove “ special , one time cases . ”
You now have a list of your primary public functions .
Everything else in your class should pretty much remain protected or private ( discretion is learned with experience ) .
The entire point is that classes are not a group of similar functions , but rather a single conceptual unit .
And when you ’re all done with understanding why object oriented programming exists , you must then learn to use Inheritance , and Overloading ( some languages ) and Interfaces .
Second , you must understand and demonstrate competency with design patterns .
At the very least , you should be aware of the Singleton and Factory patterns , which are very commonly used , and for ( arguably ) good reasons .
Knowledge of basic design patterns goes a long way because a time will come when you may need to borrow from one of these concepts when developing your web application .
It also means you have a wider exposure to the different types of architectures available to someone writing a library or application .
Last , you must understand scaling issues in growing web applications and how to resolve them .
This is probably the rarest trait , but if you have it , you will shine like a rock star .
It is important to realize that certain operations are much more costly than others .
In today ’s world , the CPU is rarely the bottleneck , but there are still bottlenecks .
A common instance of this problem is when Word Press blogs go offline because it is slammed by a spike in traffic .
That said , the most common type of bottleneck involves the database and often manifests in one of three ways :
Each query sent to the database involves some small amount of lag between the web server and the database server .
Hundreds of queries on a page will slow down your page loads .
On high traffic pages , one less query means thousands of queries a second .
Make sure you learn how to do JOIN statements .
Each query must use an index in the database .
Without this index , a query looking at a large table will bottleneck the hard drive ( because it has to search large portions of the disk ) .
Learn how to use the MySQL command : explain .
Database tables using MyISAM ( instead of InnoDB ) risk facing table locking issues .
When you run a big or complex update on MyISAM , no other updates can occur on that table until the first one is done .
If that table is very large , this may mean someone ’s page sits there and loads for a long time ( or times out ) .
Typically , one should use a transactional database such as InnoDB .
Other types of common scaling issues are :
Session management on the database instead of letting PHP handle it .
This is an issue because any large web application has more than one web server which means when a person hits a new page they might be loading from a different web server each time .
Managing files generated on the server – such as when a user uploads a file .
The issue here is that if a file is created on one server ( in a cluster of 100 ) , how do the other servers know it exists ?
Obviously the solution is to somehow centralize this with a synchronization process or store all of the files somewhere else .
How queries can start acting different ( much slower ) when your tables reach 1 M + rows without proper precautions .
Larger tables change things because indexes sometimes stop getting used or slowness that was n’t apparent before is now very noticeable .
( A book could be written here … )
Merely reading and understanding these issues has put you ahead of a bunch of people out there . 🙂
In conclusion , you must re-think the “ web developer ” as an application developer that happens to work in a browser .
I often hear the excuse that these types of advanced concepts ca n’t be readily applied in small - time applications ( such as a simple store - front ) , but I believe this is simply not true .
Virtually every site requires a database connection or a template system ( for easy inclusion of header / footer files ) .
Database abstraction and template systems are probably the single best place to use OOP concepts .
It simply makes no sense that one would use the raw mysql_query ( ) function in any website , even if it ’s just Mom ’s baby pictures .
Putting these ideas in classes reduces security vulnerabilities and makes development much faster .
If the notion of abstracting templates or databases is totally foreign to you , I suggest you start by looking at Smarty or EzSQL .
Happy studying . 🙂
President Bush promises ' justice ' for Iranians interfering in Iraq in Fox interview Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday August 8 , 2007
Print This Email This In a Fox News interview Tuesday afternoon , President George W. Bush promised ' justice ' for Iranians who are caught interfering in in the Iraq War .
" There will be a consequence when your people are caught going into Iraq , " Bush said when asked if the US should really be talking to Iran about Iraq 's stability in spite of allegations that they are supplying some Iraqis with weapons .
When Neil Cavuto , host of Fox News ' Your World asked if the President included a military attack on Iran among the ' consequences , ' Bush gave a cryptic answer .
" They will be brought to justice , " he said .
Bush takes an indirect shot at GOP candidate Tancredo During the interview , President Bush also took a shot at Rep. Tom Tancredo ( R - CO ) , the Republican presidential candidate who has most built his campaign around a drive to stop illegal immigration .
Asked by Cavuto if he sensed that 2008 candidates were ' piling on , ' Bush said , " I did n't see any pile on . "
He then added , " There may be some candidates who probably wo n't be the nominee of the party , for instance , using the immigration issue . "
When Cavuto went on to ask if he was concerned with the tone taken by Democratic candidates for President in 2008 , Bush was not surprised .
" I 'm an easy target , " he said .
But he warned the Democrats that their bashing of his presidency would not help them win the election .
" You can't win an election if you say you 're against somebody , " the President argued .
" The candidate who will be the nominee will have articulated a plan to keep America safe and keep America prosperous . "
He added that he was not concerned with name - calling .
" I 've been around long enough in order to understand how it works , " he said .
" Nobody likes to be called names , but we 've got a bigger enemy than name callers , and that 's Al Qaida , or people losing jobs . "
Cavuto later claimed that he had invited Democratic presidential candidates and other party leaders to rebut the President 's statements , but none agreed to appear on his show .
Bush opposes bailout for ' sub - prime mortgage ' lenders Cavuto engaged the President in a lengthy exchange on so - called sub - prime mortgages and the growing rate of default among American homeowners .
The President said he opposed further federal intervention .
" Let me put it more bluntly : No , I 'm not for a federal bail out , " he told Cavuto .
He had initially remarked that he was in favor of , " letting the market work . "
" My biggest concern when it comes to mortgage industry is the lendee , not the lender .... we ought to crack down on predatory lending , " the President said , calling for improving the enforcement of existing laws .
But when Cavuto pressed him on whether he agreed with Senator Hillary Clinton on the need to provide a bail out for homeowners , as opposed to the banks that gave them risky loans , the President gave a more measured answer .
" There is a place for people to refinance , and that 's at the [ Federal Housing Authority ] , " he said .
But the President also acknowledged that the FHA needed to be reformed .
Fox host challenges Bush on Barry Bonds and steroids Cavuto then turned the interview to Barry Bonds and his 756th home run .
" He is a great hitter , he broke the record of another great hitter , Hank Aaron , " the President said , noting that he had just got off the phone with the San Francisco Giants ' slugger .
But Bush offered a no opinion on whether an ' asterisk ' should be attached to his record due to allegations of steroid use by Bonds .
" My only advice for people is , just let history be the judge , let 's find out the facts , and then everybody 's opinion one way or the other will be verified or not verified , " the President said , echoing a line Bush 's defenders have often used about his administration .
" In the meantime , it 's appropriate to recognize this man can hit the baseball . "
He went on to generally condemn the use of steroids .
" I love the sport , and I 'm dead set against steroids being used in baseball , " he said .
" I was the one who put it in the State of the Union address .... how we behave as adults will influence how children behave . "
The following video clip is taken from Cavuto 's interview with Bush . #
In the Arab neighbourhoods of Ramla everyone knew Hamda 's days were numbered .
Her name was on a blacklist of women whose behaviour upset the gangs in Jawarish , one of the poorest parts of this ill - famed suburb of Tel Aviv .
Since 2000 , seven women belonging to the Abu Ghanem clan had already been murdered for reasons as trifling as their refusal to accept an arranged marriage , or for a smile exchanged with a man in the street .
Hamda Abu Ghanem , 19 , was the eighth victim .
In January the police found her body riddled with bullets at her parents ' home .
She was reportedly punished for talking on the phone to her cousin .
Much as Naifa , Suzan , Zinat , Sabrin , Amira , Reem and Shirihan before her , Hamda was the victim of an " honour " killing , to wash away the supposed affront to her family 's reputation .
About 10 Arab Israeli women die every year , falling foul of a tradition that also persists in the Occupied Territories .
" Such crimes used to be justified by accusations of extramarital sex , " says Aida Touma - Suliman of Women Against Violence , an NGO based in Nazareth .
" But with women living in an increasingly open environment , thanks in particular to longer studies , some men feel more threatened .
Taking a harmless liberty may be seen as a major challenge to their authority . "
In a survey of Israel 's Arab community in 2005 a third of those polled said they could " understand " honour killings .
But Hamda 's death marks a turning point , finally breaching the conspiracy of silence in Ramla .
The veil of fear and tacit consent that once covered such acts has been torn apart .
" Usually when we get to the scene of a crime it looks as if nothing has happened , " says Yifrach Duchovny , the local police commander .
" There is no sign of any blood .
Everything has been cleaned up and the father can walk past the body of his daughter without displaying the slightest emotion .
And by some odd coincidence none of the victim 's relatives have seen or heard anything . "
With no witnesses , charges were brought for only one of the seven previous murders .
But after the latest killing about 20 women agreed to help the police .
Hamda 's brother has been arrested for her murder .
" Things have gone too far , " says Samah Aghbariya , who runs a women 's social centre in Ramla .
" This crime was so wrong .
Everyone knew Hamda was innocent .
The women were very upset and decided there had been enough killing . "
" The Israelis like to think they have established a more enlightened government here , " says Touma - Suliman .
" Unlike the criminal law in force in the Occupied Territories [ which punishes honour killings with a very short prison sentence ]
Israeli law takes murder seriously .
The welfare network , albeit inadequate , provides better coverage too .
But at the same time the dispossession and poverty we have endured since Israel was established encourages our leaders to hang on to their last scrap of authority , governing the family .
With no influence over the larger political arena , they are reduced to defending social and cultural values , holding up the change in standards we sorely need .
" It is too easy to lay all the blame for this crime on a conspiracy of silence .
At the end of the 1990s we gave the Ramla police station a list of women at risk .
No one paid any attention and five of them have been killed . "
Touma - Suliman maintains that the Israeli police and legal system , even the media , have a blinkered attitude to honour killing .
" They are convinced that the murder of a Jewish woman is a criminal act , whereas when Arabs kill their womenfolk it is just part of their culture .
But the truth of the matter in Jawarish is much more complex .
The killers are delinquents , often with a long criminal record .
Eliminating the women is one way of keeping control over their territory .
If the police had made any serious attempt to stop drug trafficking , for example , some of these crimes could have been avoided . "
A case in point is the murder of Reem Abu Ghanem in March 2006 .
She had run away from her parents ' home with her lover to escape an arranged marriage .
Subsequently she agreed to go home after her brothers signed an undertaking not to do her any harm .
Only a few days later she was drugged , strangled and dumped in a well .
" It was bound to happen , " says Touma - Suliman with a sigh .
" Why did the police send her home ? "
Aghbariya emphasises the shortage of social workers in the Arab quarters .
" There are only four of us , serving a population of 18,000 , " she says .
" This problem is obviously not a priority for the authorities .
But anyway it is only a part of the solution .
We need to establish closer links between our community and government bodies .
Above all we need to do a lot more to improve education and public awareness . "
In March , Aghbariya organised a meeting for police , teachers , social workers and even the sheikh from the mosque .
There is no time to lose .
Everyone agrees that the killers are determined to silence the women who spoke out .
The main prosecution witness disappeared a few weeks ago .
The people of Jawarish fear that she may already be the Abu Ghanem clan 's ninth victim .

Former Reagan aide : ' Brownshirt '
Bush among top ' mass murderers of all time '

President Bush 's apparent plans for a preemptive nuclear strike on Iran will only add to the civilian death toll as a result of US intervention that has placed the president " high on the list of mass murders of all time , " a former aide in President Ronald Reagan 's administration known for strident anti-Bush rhetoric said Friday .
" Bush is too self - righteous to see the dark humor in his denunciations of Iran for threatening ' the security of nations everywhere ' and of the Iraqi resistance for 'a vision that rejects tolerance , crushes all dissent , and justifies the murder of innocent men , women , and children in the pursuit of political power , ' " writes Paul Craig Roberts , a former assistant secretary of the Treasury .
" Those are precisely the words that most of the world applies to Bush and his Brownshirt administration . "
Roberts , who has emerged as a fierce critic of Bush 's war policies , accused the president of ignoring habeas corpus and the Geneva Conventions , justifying torture and demonizing critics as anti-American .
" Bush ... is responsible , according to Information Clearing House , for over one million deaths of Iraqi civilians , which puts Bush high on the list of mass murderers of all time , " Roberts writes in a column published Friday on antiwar.com .
" The vast majority of ' kills ' by the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan are civilians . "
A report last month found that US and NATO troops killed more Afghan civilians in the first half of this year than the Taliban .
Roberts said the media is too concerned with stories like Sen. Larry Craig 's ( R - ID ) arrest for allegedly soliciting sex , and Miss Teen South Carolina 's inability to answer a question .
" The war criminal is in the living room , and no official notice is taken of the fact , " Roberts writes .
" Lacking US troops with which to invade Iran , the Bush administration has decided to bomb Iran ' back into the stone age . ' "
Roberts cites a recent RAW STORY report that the US is preparing a " massive " military strike against Iran to support his assertions .
" Encouraged by the indifference of both the American media and Christian churches to the massive casualties inflicted on Iraqi civilians , the Bush administration will not be deterred by the prospect of its air attacks inflicting massive casualties on Iranian civilians .
...
Clearly , turning the Muslim Middle East into a wasteland is the Bush policy , " Roberts writes .
" For Bush , civilian casualties are a non-issue .
Hegemony uber alles . "
Low - slung trousers are fashionable among some young people
Delcambre town council unanimously passed the ordinance earlier this week making it a crime to wear trousers that show underwear .
" If you expose your private parts , you 'll get a fine " of US$ 500 ( £ 254 ) Mayor Carol Broussard said .
Offenders will also risk up to six months in jail .
Fashionable
Speaking of people who wear saggy trousers , Mr Broussard told the Associated Press news agency : " They 're better off taking the pants off and just wearing a dress . "
White people wear sagging pants , too
Mayor Carol Broussard
Town attorney Ted Ayo said the ordinance expands on the existing state indecent exposure law by adding underwear to the list of forbidden exposures .
" This is a new ordinance that deals specifically with sagging pants , " Mr Ayo said .
" It 's about showing off your underwear in public . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
I can't think of any fashion fad as staggeringly unattractive as this one

Some residents say the ordinance targets blacks , as low - slung trousers are fashionable among hip hop fans .
Mr Broussard denied it was racially motivated .
" White people wear sagging pants , too , " he said .

My friend was watching a mutual friend 's cat while he was on vacation .
Before he left , he warned that the cat was old ( 21 years old ) , and not doing so hot .
He suspected that he was ready to die .
Sure enough , the cat died on the last day of vacation .
My friend asked me how he should tell him .
I gave him these options to break the news .
1 ) " i've got good news and i've got bad news .
bad news is , your cat 's dead .
the good news is that i saved a lot on my car insurance .
" 2 ) " hey , you 're out of milk , the chips are stale , your cats dead , and the light bulb in the bathroom needs to be changed .
" 3 ) ( when they walk into the apartment ) * sniff * * sniff * " you smell dead cat ??
" 4 ) Leave a suicide note next to the cat with a finished bag of catnip mentioning how boring the sitter was .
5 ) " Are you still interested in those taxidermy classes ?
" 6 )
Get rid of the cat , draw a chalk out line , put up police tape all over the place , and act stupid .
7 ) " Will everyone with a live cat please step forward ..... not so fast buddy .
" 8 ) " you have a couple messages : your mom called , she wants you to call her back ; your landlord said the rent is late ; your cat said ' bye ' .
" 9 ) ( when he picks him up from the airport ) sitter :
Let 's play a game .... Dead or human ?
owner : huh ?
ok .sitter : you ?owner : humansitter : me ? owner : humansitter : your cat ? owner : huh ?!?!? 10 ) owner : thanks for watching the place .
where are my keys ?
sitter : oh , they 're under your dead cat .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush said on Saturday he was troubled by a U.S. intelligence report that al Qaeda has become entrenched in a safe haven in Pakistan ’s tribal region near Afghanistan .
In this file picture , U.S. President George W. Bush makes a statement after meeting with members of Military Support Organizations at the White House in Washington , July 20 , 2007 .

But Bush offered support for Pakistan ’s embattled president , saying he believes Pervez Musharraf is committed to fighting al Qaeda and Taliban militants .
Part of the National Intelligence Estimate made public this week found a “ persistent and evolving ” threat to the United States from Islamic militant groups , especially Osama bin Laden ’s al Qaeda .
Bush , in his taped weekly radio address , said the report ’s assessment that al Qaeda was gaining strengthen in the tribal region of Pakistan was “ one of the most troubling . ”
The United States , after being hit by al Qaeda ’s attacks on September 11 , 2001 , led an invasion of Afghanistan later that year to oust the Taliban religious movement that had seized power and to root out bin Laden and his followers .
Musharraf , an army general , has been an important ally to Washington but must contend with a violent campaign by Islamic militants and porous mountain borders that make it hard to halt the flow of fighters , weapons , opium and other drugs .
The White House has acknowledged that a truce Musharraf reached in September with tribal leaders had not worked .
Bush , now more than four years into a war in Iraq that has stretched the U.S. military , said Pakistan ’s tribal leaders had proven unwilling or unable to police the area themselves .
“ President Musharraf recognizes the agreement has not been successful or well - enforced and is taking active steps to correct , ” Bush said .
“ We will work with our partners to deny safe haven to the Taliban and al Qaeda in Pakistan -- or anywhere else in the world . ”
Sen .
John Kerry , a Massachusetts Democrat who lost to Bush in the 2004 presidential election , said U.S. intelligence agencies have warned that the Iraq war was diverting attention from al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
“ Our troops and our country need a new policy from this president , not the same old rhetoric , ” he said in a statement .
BLOWS TO MUSHARRAF
Musharraf faces a political crisis amid waves of violence that erupted after government forces stormed a mosque in Islamabad this month to end a siege by militants .
Further weakening Musharraf , Pakistan ’s Supreme Court this week reinstated the chief justice after the president sought to remove him .
Pro-democracy activists had criticized Musharraf for suspending the top judge in March .
Pakistan ’s North Waziristan area near the Afghan border is believed to be a hotbed of al Qaeda and Taliban activity , with U.S. officials saying bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders are hiding there .
Washington has been pressing Pakistan to do more against al Qaeda in the border area and has not ruled out U.S. strikes .
Pakistan ’s Foreign Ministry has said that only its troops can conduct counter - terrorism operations on its soil .
U.S. forces in Afghanistan have carried out strikes in Pakistan , often with missile - carrying Predator drone aircraft , without confirming them so as not to embarrass Musharraf .
In the aftermath of September 11 , Bush has sought make the fight against terrorism a defining issue of his presidency .
“ As time goes by , it can be tempting to think that the threat of another attack on our homeland is behind us , ” Bush said , adding the intelligence report made public this week “ makes clear that the threat is not behind us . ”
The single gene mutations and targeted antioxidant methodologies for increased longevity are rolling in of late .
I expect that the optimization of mouse metabolism will accelerate as the biotechnology revolution continues to pick up speed - that , sadly , is still the goal most research groups are aiming for , rather than identification and repair of age - related damage .
Still , at this rate , the existing Mprize champions will be dethroned by the end of 2012 .
Here 's the most recent example , coming out of focused research into one small part of the grand complexity of mammalian biochemistry :
Loss of pregnancy - associated plasma protein A extends lifespan in mice :
Genetic deletion in mice of pregnancy - associated plasma protein A ( PAPP - A ) , a recently identified metalloproteinase in the insulin - like growth factor system , extends by 30 - 40 % both mean and maximum lifespan with no reduction in food intake or secondary endocrine abnormalities .
Furthermore , these mice have markedly reduced incidence of spontaneous tumors .
The findings implicate PAPP - A as a critical regulator of lifespan and age - related diseases , and suggest PAPP - A as a possible target to promote longevity .
More life , less cancer , no obvious downside - for mice , in any case .
It is interesting to note that these divergent genetic engineering and other methodologies for tweaking metabolic processes seem to top out at around 30 - 40 % increased longevity in mice , just like calorie restriction .
That does tend to suggest a commonality of mechanisms at the base of it all .

Game theory is the study of the ways in which interacting choices of economic agents produce outcomes with respect to the preferences ( or utilities ) of those agents , where the outcomes in question might have been intended by none of the agents .
The meaning of this statement will not be clear to the non-expert until each of the italicized words and phrases has been explained and featured in some examples .
Doing this will be the main business of this article .
First , however , we provide some historical and philosophical context in order to motivate the reader for the technical work ahead .
Game theory in the form known to economists , social scientists , and biologists , was given its first general mathematical formulation by John von Neuman and Oskar Morgenstern ( 1944 ) .
For reasons to be discussed later , limitations in their formal framework initially made the theory applicable only under special and limited conditions .
This situation has dramatically changed , in ways we will examine as we go along , over the past seven decades , as the framework has been deepened and generalized .
Refinements are still being made , and we will review a few outstanding problems that lie along the advancing front edge of these developments towards the end of the article .
However , since at least the late 1970s it has been possible to say with confidence that game theory is the most important and useful tool in the analyst ’s kit whenever she confronts situations in which what counts as one agent ’s best action ( for her ) depends on expectations about what one or more other agents will do , and what counts as their best actions ( for them ) similarly depend on expectations about her .
Despite the fact that game theory has been rendered mathematically and logically systematic only since 1944 , game - theoretic insights can be found among commentators going back to ancient times .
For example , in two of Plato ’s texts , the Laches and the Symposium , Socrates recalls an episode from the Battle of Delium that some commentators have interpreted ( probably anachronistically ) as involving the following situation .
Consider a soldier at the front , waiting with his comrades to repulse an enemy attack .
It may occur to him that if the defense is likely to be successful , then it is n’t very probable that his own personal contribution will be essential .
But if he stays , he runs the risk of being killed or wounded — apparently for no point .
On the other hand , if the enemy is going to win the battle , then his chances of death or injury are higher still , and now quite clearly to no point , since the line will be overwhelmed anyway .
Based on this reasoning , it would appear that the soldier is better off running away regardless of who is going to win the battle .
Of course , if all of the soldiers reason this way — as they all apparently should , since they ’re all in identical situations — then this will certainly bring about the outcome in which the battle is lost .
Of course , this point , since it has occurred to us as analysts , can occur to the soldiers too .
Does this give them a reason for staying at their posts ?
Just the contrary : the greater the soldiers ’ fear that the battle will be lost , the greater their incentive to get themselves out of harm ’s way .
And the greater the soldiers ’ belief that the battle will be won , without the need of any particular individual ’s contributions , the less reason they have to stay and fight .
If each soldier anticipates this sort of reasoning on the part of the others , all will quickly reason themselves into a panic , and their horrified commander will have a rout on his hands before the enemy has even engaged .
Long before game theory had come along to show analysts how to think about this sort of problem systematically , it had occurred to some actual military leaders and influenced their strategies .
Thus the Spanish conqueror Cortez , when landing in Mexico with a small force who had good reason to fear their capacity to repel attack from the far more numerous Aztecs , removed the risk that his troops might think their way into a retreat by burning the ships on which they had landed .
With retreat having thus been rendered physically impossible , the Spanish soldiers had no better course of action than to stand and fight — and , furthermore , to fight with as much determination as they could muster .
Better still , from Cortez ’s point of view , his action had a discouraging effect on the motivation of the Aztecs .
He took care to burn his ships very visibly , so that the Aztecs would be sure to see what he had done .
They then reasoned as follows :
Any commander who could be so confident as to willfully destroy his own option to be prudent if the battle went badly for him must have good reasons for such extreme optimism .
It can not be wise to attack an opponent who has a good reason ( whatever , exactly , it might be ) for being sure that he ca n’t lose .
The Aztecs therefore retreated into the surrounding hills , and Cortez had the easiest possible victory .
These two situations , at Delium and as manipulated by Cortez , have a common and interesting underlying logic .
Notice that the soldiers are not motivated to retreat just , or even mainly , by their rational assessment of the dangers of battle and by their self - interest .
Rather , they discover a sound reason to run away by realizing that what it makes sense for them to do depends on what it will make sense for others to do , and that all of the others can notice this too .
Even a quite brave soldier may prefer to run rather than heroically , but pointlessly , die trying to stem the oncoming tide all by himself .
Thus we could imagine , without contradiction , a circumstance in which an army , all of whose members are brave , flees at top speed before the enemy makes a move .
If the soldiers really are brave , then this surely is n’t the outcome any of them wanted ; each would have preferred that all stand and fight .
What we have here , then , is a case in which the interaction of many individually rational decision - making processes — one process per soldier — produces an outcome intended by no one .
( Most armies try to avoid this problem just as Cortez did .
Since they ca n’t usually make retreat physically impossible , they make it economically impossible : they shoot deserters .
Then standing and fighting is each soldier ’s individually rational course of action after all , because the cost of running is sure to be at least as high as the cost of staying . )
Another classic source that invites this sequence of reasoning is found in Shakespeare ’s Henry V. During the Battle of Agincourt Henry decided to slaughter his French prisoners , in full view of the enemy and to the surprise of his subordinates , who describe the action as being out of moral character .
The reasons Henry gives allude to non-strategic considerations : he is afraid that the prisoners may free themselves and threaten his position .
However , a game theorist might have furnished him with supplementary strategic ( and similarly prudential , though perhaps not moral ) justification .
His own troops observe that the prisoners have been killed , and observe that the enemy has observed this .
Therefore , they know what fate will await them at the enemy ’s hand if they do n’t win .
Metaphorically , but very effectively , their boats have been burnt .
The slaughter of the prisoners plausibly sent a signal to the soldiers of both sides , thereby changing their incentives in ways that favoured English prospects for victory .
These examples might seem to be relevant only for those who find themselves in sordid situations of cut - throat competition .
Perhaps , one might think , it is important for generals , politicians , mafiosi , sports coaches and others whose jobs involve strategic manipulation of others , but the philosopher should only deplore its amorality .
Such a conclusion would be highly premature , however .
The study of the logic that governs the interrelationships amongst incentives , strategic interactions and outcomes has been fundamental in modern political philosophy , since centuries before anyone had an explicit name for this sort of logic .
Philosophers share with social scientists the need to be able to represent and systematically model not only what they think people normatively ought to do , but what they often actually do in interactive situations .
Hobbes ’s Leviathan is often regarded as the founding work in modern political philosophy , the text that began the continuing round of analyses of the function and justification of the state and its restrictions on individual liberties .
The core of Hobbes ’s reasoning can be given straightforwardly as follows .
The best situation for all people is one in which each is free to do as she pleases .
( One may or may not agree with this as a matter of psychology or ideology , but it is Hobbes ’s assumption . )
Often , such free people will wish to cooperate with one another in order to carry out projects that would be impossible for an individual acting alone .
But if there are any immoral or amoral agents around , they will notice that their interests might at least sometimes be best served by getting the benefits from cooperation and not returning them .
Suppose , for example , that you agree to help me build my house in return for my promise to help you build yours .
After my house is finished , I can make your labour free to me simply by reneging on my promise .
I then realize , however , that if this leaves you with no house , you will have an incentive to take mine .
This will put me in constant fear of you , and force me to spend valuable time and resources guarding myself against you .
I can best minimize these costs by striking first and killing you at the first opportunity .
Of course , you can anticipate all of this reasoning by me , and so have good reason to try to beat me to the punch .
Since I can anticipate this reasoning by you , my original fear of you was not paranoid ; nor was yours of me .
In fact , neither of us actually needs to be immoral to get this chain of mutual reasoning going ; we need only think that there is some possibility that the other might try to cheat on bargains .
Once a small wedge of doubt enters any one mind , the incentive induced by fear of the consequences of being preempted — hit before hitting first — quickly becomes overwhelming on both sides .
If either of us has any resources of our own that the other might want , this murderous logic can take hold long before we are so silly as to imagine that we could ever actually get as far as making deals to help one another build houses in the first place .
Left to their own devices , agents who are at least sometimes narrowly self - interested can repeatedly fail to derive the benefits of cooperation , and instead be trapped in a state of ‘ war of all against all ’ , in Hobbes ’s words .
In these circumstances , human life , as he vividly and famously put it , will be “ solitary , poor , nasty , brutish and short . ”
Hobbes ’s proposed solution to this problem was tyranny .
The people can hire an agent — a government — whose job is to punish anyone who breaks any promise .
So long as the threatened punishment is sufficiently dire then the cost of reneging on promises will exceed the cost of keeping them .
The logic here is identical to that used by an army when it threatens to shoot deserters .
If all people know that these incentives hold for most others , then cooperation will not only be possible , but can be the expected norm , so that the war of all against all becomes a general peace .
Hobbes pushes the logic of this argument to a very strong conclusion , arguing that it implies not only a government with the right and the power to enforce cooperation , but an ‘ undivided ’ government in which the arbitrary will of a single ruler must impose absolute obligation on all .
Few contemporary political theorists think that the particular steps by which Hobbes reasons his way to this conclusion are both sound and valid .
Working through these issues here , however , would carry us away from our topic into details of contractarian political philosophy .
What is important in the present context is that these details , as they are in fact pursued in contemporary debates , involve sophisticated interpretation of the issues using the resources of modern game theory .
Furthermore , Hobbes ’s most basic point , that the fundamental justification for the coercive authority and practices of governments is peoples ’ own need to protect themselves from what game theorists call ‘ social dilemmas ’ , is accepted by many , if not most , political theorists .
Notice that Hobbes has not argued that tyranny is a desirable thing in itself .
The structure of his argument is that the logic of strategic interaction leaves only two general political outcomes possible : tyranny and anarchy .
Sensible agents then choose tyranny as the lesser of two evils .
The reasoning of the Athenian soldiers , of Cortez , and of Hobbes ’s political agents has a common logic , one derived from their situations .
In each case , the aspect of the environment that is most important to the agents ’ achievement of their preferred outcomes is the set of expectations and possible reactions to their strategies by other agents .
The distinction between acting parametrically on a passive world and acting non-parametrically on a world that tries to act in anticipation of these actions is fundamental .
If you wish to kick a rock down a hill , you need only concern yourself with the rock ’s mass relative to the force of your blow , the extent to which it is bonded with its supporting surface , the slope of the ground on the other side of the rock , and the expected impact of the collision on your foot .
The values of all of these variables are independent of your plans and intentions , since the rock has no interests of its own and takes no actions to attempt to assist or thwart you .
By contrast , if you wish to kick a person down the hill , then unless that person is unconscious , bound or otherwise incapacitated , you will likely not succeed unless you can disguise your plans until it ’s too late for him to take either evasive or forestalling action .
Furthermore , his probable responses should be expected to visit costs upon you , which you would be wise to consider .
Finally , the relative probabilities of his responses will depend on his expectations about your probable responses to his responses .
( Consider the difference it will make to both of your reasoning if one or both of you are armed , or one of you is bigger than the other , or one of you is the other ’s boss . )
The logical issues associated with the second sort of situation ( kicking the person as opposed to the rock ) are typically much more complicated , as a simple hypothetical example will illustrate .
Suppose first that you wish to cross a river that is spanned by three bridges .
( Assume that swimming , wading or boating across are impossible . )
The first bridge is known to be safe and free of obstacles ; if you try to cross there , you will succeed .
The second bridge lies beneath a cliff from which large rocks sometimes fall .
The third is inhabited by deadly cobras .
Now suppose you wish to rank - order the three bridges with respect to their preferability as crossing - points .
Unless you get positive enjoyment from risking your life — which , as a human being , you might , a complication we ’ll take up later in this article — then your decision problem here is straightforward .
The first bridge is obviously best , since it is safest .
To rank - order the other two bridges , you require information about their relative levels of danger .
If you can study the frequency of rock - falls and the movements of the cobras for awhile , you might be able to calculate that the probability of your being crushed by a rock at the second bridge is 10 % and of being struck by a cobra at the third bridge is 20 % .
Your reasoning here is strictly parametric because neither the rocks nor the cobras are trying to influence your actions , by , for example , concealing their typical patterns of behaviour because they know you are studying them .
It is obvious what you should do here : cross at the safe bridge .
Now let us complicate the situation a bit .
Suppose that the bridge with the rocks was immediately before you , while the safe bridge was a day ’s difficult hike upstream .
Your decision - making situation here is slightly more complicated , but it is still strictly parametric .
You would have to decide whether the cost of the long hike was worth exchanging for the penalty of a 10 % chance of being hit by a rock .
However , this is all you must decide , and your probability of a successful crossing is entirely up to you ; the environment is not interested in your plans .
However , if we now complicate the situation by adding a non-parametric element , it becomes more challenging .
Suppose that you are a fugitive of some sort , and waiting on the other side of the river with a gun is your pursuer .
She will catch and shoot you , let us suppose , only if she waits at the bridge you try to cross ; otherwise , you will escape .
As you reason through your choice of bridge , it occurs to you that she is over there trying to anticipate your reasoning .
It will seem that , surely , choosing the safe bridge straight away would be a mistake , since that is just where she will expect you , and your chances of death rise to certainty .
So perhaps you should risk the rocks , since these odds are much better .
But wait … if you can reach this conclusion , your pursuer , who is just as rational and well - informed as you are , can anticipate that you will reach it , and will be waiting for you if you evade the rocks .
So perhaps you must take your chances with the cobras ; that is what she must least expect .
But , then , no … if she expects that you will expect that she will least expect this , then she will most expect it .
This dilemma , you realize with dread , is general : you must do what your pursuer least expects ; but whatever you most expect her to least expect is automatically what she will most expect .
You appear to be trapped in indecision .
All that might console you a bit here is that , on the other side of the river , your pursuer is trapped in exactly the same quandary , unable to decide which bridge to wait at because as soon as she imagines committing to one , she will notice that if she can find a best reason to pick a bridge , you can anticipate that same reason and then avoid her .
We know from experience that , in situations such as this , people do not usually stand and dither in circles forever .
As we ’ll see later , there is a unique best solution available to each player .
However , until the 1940s neither philosophers nor economists knew how to find it mathematically .
As a result , economists were forced to treat non-parametric influences as if they were complications on parametric ones .
This is likely to strike the reader as odd , since , as our example of the bridge - crossing problem was meant to show , non-parametric features are often fundamental features of decision - making problems .
Part of the explanation for game theory ’s relatively late entry into the field lies in the problems with which economists had historically been concerned .
Classical economists , such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo , were mainly interested in the question of how agents in very large markets — whole nations — could interact so as to bring about maximum monetary wealth for themselves .
Smith ’s basic insight , that efficiency is best maximized by agents first differentiating their potential contributions and then freely seeking mutually advantageous bargains , was mathematically verified in the twentieth century .
However , the demonstration of this fact applies only in conditions of ‘ perfect competition , ’ that is , when individuals or firms face no costs of entry or exit into markets , when there are no economies of scale , and when no agents ’ actions have unintended side - effects on other agents ’ well - being .
Economists always recognized that this set of assumptions is purely an idealization for purposes of analysis , not a possible state of affairs anyone could try ( or should want to try ) to institutionally establish .
But until the mathematics of game theory matured near the end of the 1970s , economists had to hope that the more closely a market approximates perfect competition , the more efficient it will be .
No such hope , however , can be mathematically or logically justified in general ; indeed , as a strict generalization the assumption was shown to be false as far back as the 1950s .
This article is not about the foundations of economics , but it is important for understanding the origins and scope of game theory to know that perfectly competitive markets have built into them a feature that renders them susceptible to parametric analysis .
Because agents face no entry costs to markets , they will open shop in any given market until competition drives all profits to zero .
This implies that if production costs are fixed and demand is exogenous , then agents have no options about how much to produce if they are trying to maximize the differences between their costs and their revenues .
These production levels can be determined separately for each agent , so none need pay attention to what the others are doing ; each agent treats her counterparts as passive features of the environment .
The other kind of situation to which classical economic analysis can be applied without recourse to game theory is that of a monopoly facing many customers .
Here , as long as no customer has a share of demand large enough to exert strategic leverage , non-parametric considerations drop out and the firm ’s task is only to identify the combination of price and production quantity at which it maximizes profit .
However , both perfect and monopolistic competition are very special and unusual market arrangements .
Prior to the advent of game theory , therefore , economists were severely limited in the class of circumstances to which they could straightforwardly apply their models .
Philosophers share with economists a professional interest in the conditions and techniques for the maximization of welfare .
In addition , philosophers have a special concern with the logical justification of actions , and often actions must be justified by reference to their expected outcomes .
( One tradition in moral philosophy , utilitarianism , is based on the idea that all justifiable actions must be justified in this way . )
Without game theory , both of these problems resist analysis wherever non-parametric aspects are relevant .
We will demonstrate this shortly by reference to the most famous ( though not the most typical ) game , the so - called Prisoner ’s Dilemma , and to other , more typical , games .
In doing this , we will need to introduce , define and illustrate the basic elements and techniques of game theory .
An economic agent is , by definition , an entity with preferences .
Game theorists , like economists and philosophers studying rational decision - making , describe these by means of an abstract concept called utility .
This refers to some ranking , on some specified scale , of the subjective welfare or change in subjective welfare that an agent derives from an object or an event .
By ‘ welfare ’ we refer to some normative index of relative alignment between states of the world and agents ’ valuations of the states in question , justified by reference to some background framework .
For example , we might evaluate the relative welfare of countries ( which we might model as agents for some purposes ) by reference to their per capita incomes , and we might evaluate the relative welfare of an animal , in the context of predicting and explaining its behavioral dispositions , by reference to its expected evolutionary fitness .
In the case of people , it is most typical in economics and applications of game theory to evaluate their relative welfare by reference to their own implicit or explicit judgments of it .
This is why we referred above to subjective welfare .
Consider a person who adores the taste of pickles but dislikes onions .
She might be said to associate higher utility with states of the world in which , all else being equal , she consumes more pickles and fewer onions than with states in which she consumes more onions and fewer pickles .
Examples of this kind suggest that ‘ utility ’ denotes a measure of subjective psychological fulfillment , and this is indeed how the concept was originally interpreted by economists and philosophers influenced by the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham .
However , economists in the early 20th century recognized increasingly clearly that their main interest was in the market property of decreasing marginal demand , regardless of whether that was produced by satiated individual consumers or by some other factors .
In the 1930s this motivation of economists fit comfortably with the dominance of behaviourism and radical empiricism in psychology and in the philosophy of science respectively .
Behaviourists and radical empiricists objected to the theoretical use of such unobservable entities as ‘ psychological fulfillment quotients . ’
The intellectual climate was thus receptive to the efforts of the economist Paul Samuelson ( 1938 ) to redefine utility in such a way that it becomes a purely technical concept rather than one rooted in speculative psychology .
Since Samuelson ’s redefinition became standard in the 1950s , when we say that an agent acts so as to maximize her utility , we mean by ‘ utility ’ simply whatever it is that the agent ’s behavior suggests her to consistently act so as to make more probable .
If this looks circular to you , it should : theorists who follow Samuelson intend the statement ‘ agents act so as to maximize their utility ’ as a tautology , where an ‘ ( economic ) agent ’ is any entity that can be accurately described as acting to maximize a utility function , an ‘ action ’ is any utility - maximizing selection from a set of possible alternatives , and a‘utility function ’ is what an economic agent maximizes .
Like other tautologies occurring in the foundations of scientific theories , this interlocking ( recursive ) system of definitions is useful not in itself , but because it helps to fix our contexts of inquiry .
Though the behaviourism of the 1930s has since been displaced by widespread interest in cognitive processes , many theorists continue to follow Samuelson ’s way of understanding utility because they think it important that game theory apply to any kind of agent — a person , a bear , a bee , a firm or a country — and not just to agents with human minds .
When such theorists say that agents act so as to maximize their utility , they want this to be part of the definition of what it is to be an agent , not an empirical claim about possible inner states and motivations .
Samuelson ’s conception of utility , defined by way of Revealed Preference Theory ( RPT ) introduced in his classic paper ( Samuelson ( 1938 ) ) satisfies this demand .
Economists and others who interpret game theory in terms of RPT should not think of game theory as in any way an empirical account of the motivations of some flesh - and - blood actors ( such as actual people ) .
Rather , they should regard game theory as part of the body of mathematics that is used to model those entities ( which might or might not literally exist ) who consistently select elements from mutually exclusive action sets , resulting in patterns of choices , which , allowing for some stochasticity and noise , can be statistically modeled as maximization of utility functions .
On this interpretation , game theory could not be refuted by any empirical observations , since it is not an empirical theory in the first place .
Of course , observation and experience could lead someone favoring this interpretation to conclude that game theory is of little help in describing actual human behavior .
Some other theorists understand the point of game theory differently .
They view game theory as providing an explanatory account of actual human strategic reasoning processes .
For this idea to be applicable , we must suppose that agents at least sometimes do what they do in non-parametric settings because game - theoretic logic recommends certain actions as the ‘ rational ’ ones .
Such an understanding of game theory incorporates a normative aspect , since ‘ rationality ’ is taken to denote a property that an agent should at least generally want to have .
These two very general ways of thinking about the possible uses of game theory are compatible with the tautological interpretation of utility maximization .
The philosophical difference is not idle from the perspective of the working game theorist , however .
As we will see in a later section , those who hope to use game theory to explain strategic reasoning , as opposed to merely strategic behavior , face some special philosophical and practical problems .
Since game theory is a technology for formal modeling , we must have a device for thinking of utility maximization in mathematical terms .
Such a device is called a utility function .
We will introduce the general idea of a utility function through the special case of an ordinal utility function .
( Later , we will encounter utility functions that incorporate more information . )
The utility - map for an agent is called a ‘ function ’ because it maps ordered preferences onto the real numbers .
Suppose that agent x prefers bundle a to bundle b and bundle b to bundle c .
We then map these onto a list of numbers , where the function maps the highest - ranked bundle onto the largest number in the list , the second - highest - ranked bundle onto the next - largest number in the list , and so on , thus :
bundle a ≫ 3 bundle b ≫ 2 bundle c ≫ 1
The only property mapped by this function is order .
The magnitudes of the numbers are irrelevant ; that is , it must not be inferred that x gets 3 times as much utility from bundle a as she gets from bundle c .
Thus we could represent exactly the same utility function as that above by
bundle a ≫ 7,326 bundle b ≫ 12.6 bundle c ≫ − 1,000,000
The numbers featuring in an ordinal utility function are thus not measuring any quantity of anything .
A utility - function in which magnitudes do matter is called ‘ cardinal ’ .
Whenever someone refers to a utility function without specifying which kind is meant , you should assume that it ’s ordinal .
These are the sorts we ’ll need for the first set of games we ’ll examine .
Later , when we come to seeing how to solve games that involve ( ex ante ) uncertainty — our river - crossing game from Part 1 above , for example — we ’ll need to build cardinal utility functions .
The technique for doing this was given by von Neumann & Morgenstern ( 1944 ) , and was an essential aspect of their invention of game theory .
For the moment , however , we will need only ordinal functions .
All situations in which at least one agent can only act to maximize his utility through anticipating ( either consciously , or just implicitly in his behavior ) the responses to his actions by one or more other agents is called a game .
Agents involved in games are referred to as players .
If all agents have optimal actions regardless of what the others do , as in purely parametric situations or conditions of monopoly or perfect competition ( see Section 1 above ) we can model this without appeal to game theory ; otherwise , we need it .
Game theorists assume that players have sets of capacities that are typically referred to in the literature of economics as comprising ‘ rationality ’ .
Usually this is formulated by simple statements such as ‘ it is assumed that players are rational ’ .
In literature critical of economics in general , or of the importation of game theory into humanistic disciplines , this kind of rhetoric has increasingly become a magnet for attack .
There is a dense and intricate web of connections associated with ‘ rationality ’ in the Western cultural tradition , and the word has often been used to normatively marginalize characteristics as normal and important as emotion , femininity and empathy .
Game theorists ’ use of the concept need not , and generally does not , implicate such ideology .
For present purposes we will use ‘ economic rationality ’ as a strictly technical , not normative , term to refer to a narrow and specific set of restrictions on preferences that are shared by von Neumann and Morgenstern ’s original version of game theory , and RPT .
Economists use a second , equally important ( to them ) concept of rationality when they are modeling markets , which they call ‘ rational expectations ’ .
In this phrase , ‘ rationality ’ refers not to restrictions on preferences but to non-restrictions on information processing : rational expectations are idealized beliefs that reflect statistically accurately weighted use of all information available to an agent .
The reader should note that these two uses of one word within the same discipline are technically unconnected .
Furthermore , original RPT has been specified over the years by several different sets of axioms for different modeling purposes .
Once we decide to treat rationality as a technical concept , each time we adjust the axioms we effectively modify the concept .
Consequently , in any discussion involving economists and philosophers together , we can find ourselves in a situation where different participants use the same word to refer to something different .
For readers new to economics , game theory , decision theory and the philosophy of action , this situation naturally presents a challenge .
In this article , ‘ economic rationality ’ will be used in the technical sense shared within game theory , microeconomics and formal decision theory , as follows .
An economically rational player is one who can ( i ) assess outcomes , in the sense of rank - ordering them with respect to their contributions to her welfare ; ( ii ) calculate paths to outcomes , in the sense of recognizing which sequences of actions are probabilistically associated with which outcomes ; and ( iii ) select actions from sets of alternatives ( which we ’ll describe as ‘ choosing ’ actions ) that yield her most - preferred outcomes , given the actions of the other players .
We might summarize the intuition behind all this as follows : an entity is usefully modeled as an economically rational agent to the extent that it has alternatives , and chooses from amongst these in a way that is motivated , at least more often than not , by what seems best for its purposes .
( For readers who are antecedently familiar with the work of the philosopher Daniel Dennett , we could equate the idea of an economically rational agent with the kind of entity Dennett characterizes as intentional , and then say that we can usefully predict an economically rational agent ’s behavior from ‘ the intentional stance ’ . )
Economic rationality might in some cases be satisfied by internal computations performed by an agent , and she might or might not be aware of computing or having computed its conditions and implications .
In other cases , economic rationality might simply be embodied in behavioral dispositions built by natural , cultural or market selection .
In particular , in calling an action ‘ chosen ’ we imply no necessary deliberation , conscious or otherwise .
We mean merely that the action was taken when an alternative action was available , in some sense of ‘ available ’ normally established by the context of the particular analysis .
( ‘ Available ’ , as used by game theorists and economists , should never be read as if it meant merely ‘ metaphysically ’ or ‘ logically ’ available ; it is almost always pragmatic , contextual and endlessly revisable by more refined modeling . )
Each player in a game faces a choice among two or more possible strategies .
A strategy is a predetermined ‘ programme of play ’ that tells her what actions to take in response to every possible strategy other players might use .
The significance of the italicized phrase here will become clear when we take up some sample games below .
A crucial aspect of the specification of a game involves the information that players have when they choose strategies .
The simplest games ( from the perspective of logical structure ) are those in which agents have perfect information , meaning that at every point where each agent ’s strategy tells her to take an action , she knows everything that has happened in the game up to that point .
A board - game of sequential moves in which both players watch all the action ( and know the rules in common ) , such as chess , is an instance of such a game .
By contrast , the example of the bridge - crossing game from Section 1 above illustrates a game of imperfect information , since the fugitive must choose a bridge to cross without knowing the bridge at which the pursuer has chosen to wait , and the pursuer similarly makes her decision in ignorance of the choices of her quarry .
Since game theory is about economically rational action given the strategically significant actions of others , it should not surprise you to be told that what agents in games believe , or fail to believe , about each others ’ actions makes a considerable difference to the logic of our analyses , as we will see .
The difference between games of perfect and of imperfect information is related to ( though certainly not identical with ! ) a distinction between ways of representing games that is based on order of play .
Let us begin by distinguishing between sequential - move and simultaneous - move games in terms of information .
It is natural , as a first approximation , to think of sequential - move games as being ones in which players choose their strategies one after the other , and of simultaneous - move games as ones in which players choose their strategies at the same time .
This is n’t quite right , however , because what is of strategic importance is not the temporal order of events per se , but whether and when players know about other players ’ actions relative to having to choose their own .
For example , if two competing businesses are both planning marketing campaigns , one might commit to its strategy months before the other does ; but if neither knows what the other has committed to or will commit to when they make their decisions , this is a simultaneous - move game .
Chess , by contrast , is normally played as a sequential - move game : you see what your opponent has done before choosing your own next action .
( Chess can be turned into a simultaneous - move game if the players each call moves on a common board while isolated from one another ; but this is a very different game from conventional chess . )
It was said above that the distinction between sequential - move and simultaneous - move games is not identical to the distinction between perfect - information and imperfect - information games .
Explaining why this is so is a good way of establishing full understanding of both sets of concepts .
As simultaneous - move games were characterized in the previous paragraph , it must be true that all simultaneous - move games are games of imperfect information .
However , some games may contain mixes of sequential and simultaneous moves .
For example , two firms might commit to their marketing strategies independently and in secrecy from one another , but thereafter engage in pricing competition in full view of one another .
If the optimal marketing strategies were partially or wholly dependent on what was expected to happen in the subsequent pricing game , then the two stages would need to be analyzed as a single game , in which a stage of sequential play followed a stage of simultaneous play .
Whole games that involve mixed stages of this sort are games of imperfect information , however temporally staged they might be .
Games of perfect information ( as the name implies ) denote cases where no moves are simultaneous ( and where no player ever forgets what has gone before ) .
As previously noted , games of perfect information are the ( logically ) simplest sorts of games .
This is so because in such games ( as long as the games are finite , that is , terminate after a known number of actions ) players and analysts can use a straightforward procedure for predicting outcomes .
A player in such a game chooses her first action by considering each series of responses and counter - responses that will result from each action open to her .
She then asks herself which of the available final outcomes brings her the highest utility , and chooses the action that starts the chain leading to this outcome .
This process is called backward induction ( because the reasoning works backwards from eventual outcomes to present choice problems ) .
There will be much more to be said about backward induction and its properties in a later section ( when we come to discuss equilibrium and equilibrium selection ) .
For now , it has been described just so we can use it to introduce one of the two types of mathematical objects used to represent games : game trees .
A game tree is an example of what mathematicians call a directed graph .
That is , it is a set of connected nodes in which the overall graph has a direction .
We can draw trees from the top of the page to the bottom , or from left to right .
In the first case , nodes at the top of the page are interpreted as coming earlier in the sequence of actions .
In the case of a tree drawn from left to right , leftward nodes are prior in the sequence to rightward ones .
An unlabelled tree has a structure of the following sort :
Figure 1
The point of representing games using trees can best be grasped by visualizing the use of them in supporting backward - induction reasoning .
Just imagine the player ( or analyst ) beginning at the end of the tree , where outcomes are displayed , and then working backwards from these , looking for sets of strategies that describe paths leading to them .
Since a player ’s utility function indicates which outcomes she prefers to which , we also know which paths she will prefer .
Of course , not all paths will be possible because the other player has a role in selecting paths too , and wo n’t take actions that lead to less preferred outcomes for him .
We will present some examples of this interactive path selection , and detailed techniques for reasoning through these examples , after we have described a situation we can use a tree to model .
Trees are used to represent sequential games , because they show the order in which actions are taken by the players .
However , games are sometimes represented on matrices rather than trees .
This is the second type of mathematical object used to represent games .
Matrices , unlike trees , simply show the outcomes , represented in terms of the players ’ utility functions , for every possible combination of strategies the players might use .
For example , it makes sense to display the river - crossing game from Section 1 on a matrix , since in that game both the fugitive and the hunter have just one move each , and each chooses their move in ignorance of what the other has decided to do .
Here , then , is part of the matrix :
Figure 2
The fugitive ’s three possible strategies — cross at the safe bridge , risk the rocks , or risk the cobras — form the rows of the matrix .
Similarly , the hunter ’s three possible strategies — waiting at the safe bridge , waiting at the rocky bridge and waiting at the cobra bridge — form the columns of the matrix .
Each cell of the matrix shows — or , rather would show if our matrix was complete — an outcome defined in terms of the players ’ payoffs .
A player ’s payoff is simply the number assigned by her ordinal utility function to the state of affairs corresponding to the outcome in question .
For each outcome , Row ’s payoff is always listed first , followed by Column’s .
Thus , for example , the upper left - hand corner above shows that when the fugitive crosses at the safe bridge and the hunter is waiting there , the fugitive gets a payoff of 0 and the hunter gets a payoff of 1 .
We interpret these by reference to the two players ’ utility functions , which in this game are very simple .
If the fugitive gets safely across the river he receives a payoff of 1 ; if he does n’t he gets 0 .
If the fugitive does n’t make it , either because he ’s shot by the hunter or hit by a rock or bitten by a cobra , then the hunter gets a payoff of 1 and the fugitive gets a payoff of 0 .
We ’ll briefly explain the parts of the matrix that have been filled in , and then say why we ca n’t yet complete the rest .
Whenever the hunter waits at the bridge chosen by the fugitive , the fugitive is shot .
These outcomes all deliver the payoff vector ( 0 , 1 ) .
You can find them descending diagonally across the matrix above from the upper left - hand corner .
Whenever the fugitive chooses the safe bridge but the hunter waits at another , the fugitive gets safely across , yielding the payoff vector ( 1 , 0 ) .
These two outcomes are shown in the second two cells of the top row .
All of the other cells are marked , for now , with question marks .
Why ?
The problem here is that if the fugitive crosses at either the rocky bridge or the cobra bridge , he introduces parametric factors into the game .
In these cases , he takes on some risk of getting killed , and so producing the payoff vector ( 0 , 1 ) , that is independent of anything the hunter does .
We do n’t yet have enough concepts introduced to be able to show how to represent these outcomes in terms of utility functions — but by the time we ’re finished we will , and this will provide the key to solving our puzzle from Section 1 .
Matrix games are referred to as ‘ normal - form ’ or ‘ strategic - form ’ games , and games as trees are referred to as ‘ extensive - form ’ games .
The two sorts of games are not equivalent , because extensive - form games contain information — about sequences of play and players ’ levels of information about the game structure — that strategic - form games do not .
In general , a strategic - form game could represent any one of several extensive - form games , so a strategic - form game is best thought of as being a set of extensive - form games .
When order of play is irrelevant to a game ’s outcome , then you should study its strategic form , since it ’s the whole set you want to know about .
Where order of play is relevant , the extensive form must be specified or your conclusions will be unreliable .
The distinctions described above are difficult to fully grasp if all one has to go on are abstract descriptions .
They ’re best illustrated by means of an example .
For this purpose , we ’ll use the most famous of all games : the Prisoner ’s Dilemma .
It in fact gives the logic of the problem faced by Cortez ’s and Henry V’s soldiers ( see Section 1 above ) , and by Hobbes ’s agents before they empower the tyrant .
However , for reasons which will become clear a bit later , you should not take the PD as a typical game ; it is n’t .
We use it as an extended example here only because it ’s particularly helpful for illustrating the relationship between strategic - form and extensive - form games ( and later , for illustrating the relationships between one - shot and repeated games ; see Section 4 below ) .
The name of the Prisoner ’s Dilemma game is derived from the following situation typically used to exemplify it .
Suppose that the police have arrested two people whom they know have committed an armed robbery together .
Unfortunately , they lack enough admissible evidence to get a jury to convict .
They do , however , have enough evidence to send each prisoner away for two years for theft of the getaway car .
The chief inspector now makes the following offer to each prisoner :
If you will confess to the robbery , implicating your partner , and she does not also confess , then you ’ll go free and she ’ll get ten years .
If you both confess , you ’ll each get 5 years .
If neither of you confess , then you ’ll each get two years for the auto theft .
Our first step in modeling the two prisoners ’ situation as a game is to represent it in terms of utility functions .
Following the usual convention , let us name the prisoners ‘ Player I ’ and ‘ Player II ’ .
Both Player I ’s and Player II ’s ordinal utility functions are identical :
Go free ≫ 4 2 years ≫ 3 5 years ≫ 2 10 years ≫ 0
The numbers in the function above are now used to express each player ’s payoffs in the various outcomes possible in the situation .
We can represent the problem faced by both of them on a single matrix that captures the way in which their separate choices interact ; this is the strategic form of their game :
Figure 3
Each cell of the matrix gives the payoffs to both players for each combination of actions .
Player I ’s payoff appears as the first number of each pair , Player II ’s as the second .
So , if both players confess then they each get a payoff of 2 ( 5 years in prison each ) .
This appears in the upper - left cell .
If neither of them confess , they each get a payoff of 3 ( 2 years in prison each ) .
This appears as the lower - right cell .
If Player I confesses and Player II does n’t then Player I gets a payoff of 4 ( going free ) and Player II gets a payoff of 0 ( ten years in prison ) .
This appears in the upper - right cell .
The reverse situation , in which Player II confesses and Player I refuses , appears in the lower - left cell .
Each player evaluates his or her two possible actions here by comparing their personal payoffs in each column , since this shows you which of their actions is preferable , just to themselves , for each possible action by their partner .
So , observe : If Player II confesses then Player I gets a payoff of 2 by confessing and a payoff of 0 by refusing .
If Player II refuses , then Player I gets a payoff of 4 by confessing and a payoff of 3 by refusing .
Therefore , Player I is better off confessing regardless of what Player II does .
Player II , meanwhile , evaluates her actions by comparing her payoffs down each row , and she comes to exactly the same conclusion that Player I does .
Wherever one action for a player is superior to her other actions for each possible action by the opponent , we say that the first action strictly dominates the second one .
In the PD , then , confessing strictly dominates refusing for both players .
Both players know this about each other , thus entirely eliminating any temptation to depart from the strictly dominated path .
Thus both players will confess , and both will go to prison for 5 years .
The players , and analysts , can predict this outcome using a mechanical procedure , known as iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies .
Player 1 can see by examining the matrix that his payoffs in each cell of the top row are higher than his payoffs in each corresponding cell of the bottom row .
Therefore , it can never be utility - maximizing for him to play his bottom - row strategy , viz. , refusing to confess , regardless of what Player II does .
Since Player
I ’s bottom - row strategy will never be played , we can simply delete the bottom row from the matrix .
Now it is obvious that Player II will not refuse to confess , since her payoff from confessing in the two cells that remain is higher than her payoff from refusing .
So , once again , we can delete the one - cell column on the right from the game .
We now have only one cell remaining , that corresponding to the outcome brought about by mutual confession .
Since the reasoning that led us to delete all other possible outcomes depended at each step only on the premise that both players are economically rational — that is , will choose strategies that lead to higher payoffs over strategies that lead to lower ones — there are strong grounds for viewing joint confession as the solution to the game , the outcome on which its play must converge to the extent that economic rationality correctly models the behavior of the players .
You should note that the order in which strictly dominated rows and columns are deleted does n’t matter .
Had we begun by deleting the right - hand column and then deleted the bottom row , we would have arrived at the same solution .
It ’s been said a couple of times that the PD is not a typical game in many respects .
One of these respects is that all its rows and columns are either strictly dominated or strictly dominant .
In any strategic - form game where this is true , iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies is guaranteed to yield a unique solution .
Later , however , we will see that for many games this condition does not apply , and then our analytic task is less straightforward .
The reader will probably have noticed something disturbing about the outcome of the PD .
Had both players refused to confess , they ’d have arrived at the lower - right outcome in which they each go to prison for only 2 years , thereby both earning higher utility than either receives when both confess .
This is the most important fact about the PD , and its significance for game theory is quite general .
We ’ll therefore return to it below when we discuss equilibrium concepts in game theory .
For now , however , let us stay with our use of this particular game to illustrate the difference between strategic and extensive forms .
When people introduce the PD into popular discussions , one will often hear them say that the police inspector must lock his prisoners into separate rooms so that they ca n’t communicate with one another .
The reasoning behind this idea seems obvious : if the players could communicate , they ’d surely see that they ’re each better off if both refuse , and could make an agreement to do so , no ?
This , one presumes , would remove each player ’s conviction that he or she must confess because they ’ll otherwise be sold up the river by their partner .
In fact , however , this intuition is misleading and its conclusion is false .
When we represent the PD as a strategic - form game , we implicitly assume that the prisoners ca n’t attempt collusive agreement since they choose their actions simultaneously .
In this case , agreement before the fact ca n’t help .
If Player I is convinced that his partner will stick to the bargain then he can seize the opportunity to go scot - free by confessing .
Of course , he realizes that the same temptation will occur to Player II ; but in that case he again wants to make sure he confesses , as this is his only means of avoiding his worst outcome .
The prisoners ’ agreement comes to naught because they have no way of enforcing it ; their promises to each other constitute what game theorists call ‘ cheap talk ’ .
But now suppose that the prisoners do not move simultaneously .
That is , suppose that Player II can choose after observing Player I ’s action .
This is the sort of situation that people who think non-communication important must have in mind .
Now Player II will be able to see that Player I has remained steadfast when it comes to her choice , and she need not be concerned about being suckered .
However , this does n’t change anything , a point that is best made by re-representing the game in extensive form .
This gives us our opportunity to introduce game - trees and the method of analysis appropriate to them .
First , however , here are definitions of some concepts that will be helpful in analyzing game - trees :
Node : a point at which a player chooses an action .
Initial node : the point at which the first action in the game occurs .
Terminal node : any node which , if reached , ends the game .
Each terminal node corresponds to an outcome .
Subgame : any connected set of nodes and branches descending uniquely from one node .
Payoff : an ordinal utility number assigned to a player at an outcome .
Outcome : an assignment of a set of payoffs , one to each player in the game .
Strategy : a program instructing a player which action to take at every node in the tree where she could possibly be called on to make a choice .
These quick definitions may not mean very much to you until you follow them being put to use in our analyses of trees below .
It will probably be best if you scroll back and forth between them and the examples as we work through them .
By the time you understand each example , you ’ll find the concepts and their definitions natural and intuitive .
To make this exercise maximally instructive , let ’s suppose that Players I and II have studied the matrix above and , seeing that they ’re both better off in the outcome represented by the lower - right cell , have formed an agreement to cooperate .
Player I is to commit to refusal first , after which Player II will reciprocate when the police ask for her choice .
We will refer to a strategy of keeping the agreement as ‘ cooperation ’ , and will denote it in the tree below with ‘ C ’ .
We will refer to a strategy of breaking the agreement as ‘ defection ’ , and will denote it on the tree below with ‘ D ’. Each node is numbered 1 , 2 , 3 , … , from top to bottom , for ease of reference in discussion .
Here , then , is the tree :
Figure 4
Look first at each of the terminal nodes ( those along the bottom ) .
These represent possible outcomes .
Each is identified with an assignment of payoffs , just as in the strategic - form game , with Player I ’s payoff appearing first in each set and Player II ’s appearing second .
Each of the structures descending from the nodes 1 , 2 and 3 respectively is a subgame .
We begin our backward - induction analysis— using a technique called Zermelo ’s algorithm — with the sub - games that arise last in the sequence of play .
If the subgame descending from node 3 is played , then Player II will face a choice between a payoff of 4 and a payoff of 3 .
( Consult the second number , representing her payoff , in each set at a terminal node descending from node 3 . )
II earns her higher payoff by playing D . We may therefore replace the entire subgame with an assignment of the payoff ( 0,4 ) directly to node 3 , since this is the outcome that will be realized if the game reaches that node .
Now consider the subgame descending from node 2 .
Here , II faces a choice between a payoff of 2 and one of 0 .
She obtains her higher payoff , 2 , by playing D . We may therefore assign the payoff ( 2,2 ) directly to node 2 .
Now we move to the subgame descending from node 1 .
( This subgame is , of course , identical to the whole game ; all games are subgames of themselves . )
Player I now faces a choice between outcomes ( 2,2 ) and ( 0,4 ) .
Consulting the first numbers in each of these sets , he sees that he gets his higher payoff — 2 — by playing D. D is , of course , the option of confessing .
So Player I confesses , and then Player II also confesses , yielding the same outcome as in the strategic - form representation .
What has happened here intuitively is that Player I realizes that if he plays C ( refuse to confess ) at node 1 , then Player II will be able to maximize her utility by suckering him and playing D. ( On the tree , this happens at node 3 . )
This leaves Player I with a payoff of 0 ( ten years in prison ) , which he can avoid only by playing D to begin with .
He therefore defects from the agreement .
We have thus seen that in the case of the Prisoner ’s Dilemma , the simultaneous and sequential versions yield the same outcome .
This will often not be true of other games , however .
Furthermore , only finite extensive - form ( sequential ) games of perfect information can be solved using Zermelo ’s algorithm .
As noted earlier in this section , sometimes we must represent simultaneous moves within games that are otherwise sequential .
( In all such cases the game as a whole will be one of imperfect information , so we wo n’t be able to solve it using Zermelo ’s algorithm . )
We represent such games using the device of information sets .
Consider the following tree :
Figure 5
The oval drawn around nodes b and c indicates that they lie within a common information set .
This means that at these nodes players cannot infer back up the path from whence they came ; Player II does not know , in choosing her strategy , whether she is at b or c .
( For this reason , what properly bear numbers in extensive - form games are information sets , conceived as ‘ action points ’ , rather than nodes themselves ; this is why the nodes inside the oval are labelled with letters rather than numbers . )
Put another way , Player II , when choosing , does not know what Player I has done at node a .
But you will recall from earlier in this section that this is just what defines two moves as simultaneous .
We can thus see that the method of representing games as trees is entirely general .
If no node after the initial node is alone in an information set on its tree , so that the game has only one subgame ( itself ) , then the whole game is one of simultaneous play .
If at least one node shares its information set with another , while others are alone , the game involves both simultaneous and sequential play , and so is still a game of imperfect information .
Only if all information sets are inhabited by just one node do we have a game of perfect information .
In the Prisoner ’s Dilemma , the outcome we ’ve represented as ( 2,2 ) , indicating mutual defection , was said to be the ‘ solution ’ to the game .
Following the general practice in economics , game theorists refer to the solutions of games as equilibria .
Philosophically minded readers will want to pose a conceptual question right here :
What is ‘ equilibrated ’ about some game outcomes such that we are motivated to call them ‘ solutions ’ ?
When we say that a physical system is in equilibrium , we mean that it is in a stable state , one in which all the causal forces internal to the system balance each other out and so leave it ‘ at rest ’ until and unless it is perturbed by the intervention of some exogenous ( that is , ‘ external ’ ) force .
This is what economists have traditionally meant in talking about ‘ equilibria ’ ; they read economic systems as being networks of mutually constraining ( often causal ) relations , just like physical systems , and the equilibria of such systems are then their endogenously stable states .
( Note that , in both physical and economic systems , endogenously stable states might never be directly observed because the systems in question are never isolated from exogenous influences that move and destabilize them .
In both classical mechanics and in economics , equilibrium concepts are tools for analysis , not predictions of what we expect to observe . )
As we will see in later sections , it is possible to maintain this understanding of equilibria in the case of game theory .
However , as we noted in Section 2.1 , some people interpret game theory as being an explanatory theory of strategic reasoning .
For them , a solution to a game must be an outcome that a rational agent would predict using the mechanisms of rational computation alone .
Such theorists face some puzzles about solution concepts that are less important to the theorist who is n’t trying to use game theory to under - write a general analysis of rationality .
The interest of philosophers in game theory is more often motivated by this ambition than is that of the economist or other scientist .
It ’s useful to start the discussion here from the case of the Prisoner ’s Dilemma because it ’s unusually simple from the perspective of the puzzles about solution concepts .
What we referred to as its ‘ solution ’ is the unique Nash equilibrium of the game .
( The ‘ Nash ’ here refers to John Nash , the Nobel Laureate mathematician who in Nash ( 1950 ) did most to extend and generalize von Neumann & Morgenstern ’s pioneering work . )
Nash equilibrium ( henceforth ‘ NE ’ ) applies ( or fails to apply , as the case may be ) to whole sets of strategies , one for each player in a game .
A set of strategies is a NE just in case no player could improve her payoff , given the strategies of all other players in the game , by changing her strategy .
Notice how closely this idea is related to the idea of strict dominance : no strategy could be a NE strategy if it is strictly dominated .
Therefore , if iterative elimination of strictly dominated strategies takes us to a unique outcome , we know that the vector of strategies that leads to it is the game ’s unique NE .
Now , almost all theorists agree that avoidance of strictly dominated strategies is a minimum requirement of economic rationality .
A player who knowingly chooses a strictly dominated strategy directly violates clause ( iii ) of the definition of economic agency as given in Section 2.2 .
This implies that if a game has an outcome that is a unique NE , as in the case of joint confession in the PD , that must be its unique solution .
This is one of the most important respects in which the PD is an ‘ easy ’ ( and atypical ) game .
We can specify one class of games in which NE is always not only necessary but sufficient as a solution concept .
These are finite perfect - information games that are also zero-sum .
A zero -sum game ( in the case of a game involving just two players ) is one in which one player can only be made better off by making the other player worse off .
( Tic - tac - toe is a simple example of such a game : any move that brings one player closer to winning brings her opponent closer to losing , and vice - versa . )
We can determine whether a game is zero - sum by examining players ’ utility functions : in zero -sum games these will be mirror - images of each other , with one player ’s highly ranked outcomes being low - ranked for the other and vice - versa .
In such a game , if I am playing a strategy such that , given your strategy , I ca n’t do any better , and if you are also playing such a strategy , then , since any change of strategy by me would have to make you worse off and vice - versa , it follows that our game can have no solution compatible with our mutual economic rationality other than its unique NE .
We can put this another way : in a zero - sum game , my playing a strategy that maximizes my minimum payoff if you play the best you can , and your simultaneously doing the same thing , is just equivalent to our both playing our best strategies , so this pair of so - called ‘ maximin ’ procedures is guaranteed to find the unique solution to the game , which is its unique NE .
( In tic - tac - toe , this is a draw .
You ca n’t do any better than drawing , and neither can I , if both of us are trying to win and trying not to lose . )
However , most games do not have this property .
It wo n’t be possible , in this one article , to enumerate all of the ways in which games can be problematic from the perspective of their possible solutions .
( For one thing , it is highly unlikely that theorists have yet discovered all of the possible problems . )
However , we can try to generalize the issues a bit .
First , there is the problem that in most non -zero - sum games , there is more than one NE , but not all NE look equally plausible as the solutions upon which strategically alert players would hit .
Consider the strategic - form game below ( taken from Kreps ( 1990 ) , p. 403 ) :
Figure 6
This game has two NE : s1 - t1 and s2 - t2 .
( Note that no rows or columns are strictly dominated here .
But if Player I is playing s1 then Player II can do no better than t1 , and vice - versa ; and similarly for the s2 - t2 pair . )
If NE is our only solution concept , then we shall be forced to say that either of these outcomes is equally persuasive as a solution .
However , if game theory is regarded as an explanatory and / or normative theory of strategic reasoning , this seems to be leaving something out : surely sensible players with perfect information would converge on s1 - t1 ?
( Note that this is not like the situation in the PD , where the socially superior situation is unachievable because it is not a NE .
In the case of the game above , both players have every reason to try to converge on the NE in which they are better off . )
This illustrates the fact that NE is a relatively ( logically ) weak solution concept , often failing to predict intuitively sensible solutions because , if applied alone , it refuses to allow players to use principles of equilibrium selection that , if not demanded by economic rationality — or a more ambitious philosopher ’s concept of rationality — at least seem both sensible and computationally accessible .
Consider another example from Kreps ( 1990 ) , p. 397 :
Figure 7
Here , no strategy strictly dominates another .
However , Player I ’s top row , s1 , weakly dominates s2 , since I does at least as well using s1 as s2 for any reply by Player II , and on one reply by II ( t2 ) , I does better .
So should not the players ( and the analyst ) delete the weakly dominated row s2 ?
When they do so , column t1 is then strictly dominated , and the NE s1 - t2 is selected as the unique solution .
However , as Kreps goes on to show using this example , the idea that weakly dominated strategies should be deleted just like strict ones has odd consequences .
Suppose we change the payoffs of the game just a bit , as follows :
Figure 8
s2 is still weakly dominated as before ; but of our two NE , s2 - t1 is now the most attractive for both players ; so why should the analyst eliminate its possibility ?
( Note that this game , again , does not replicate the logic of the PD .
There , it makes sense to eliminate the most attractive outcome , joint refusal to confess , because both players have incentives to unilaterally deviate from it , so it is not an NE .
This is not true of s2 - t1 in the present game .
You should be starting to clearly see why we called the PD game ‘ atypical ’ . )
The argument for eliminating weakly dominated strategies is that Player 1 may be nervous , fearing that Player II is not completely sure to be economically rational ( or that Player II fears that Player I is n’t completely reliably economically rational , or that Player II fears that Player I fears that Player II is n’t completely reliably economically rational , and so on ad infinitum ) and so might play t2 with some positive probability .
If the possibility of departures from reliable economic rationality is taken seriously , then we have an argument for eliminating weakly dominated strategies :
Player I thereby insures herself against her worst outcome , s2 - t2 .
Of course , she pays a cost for this insurance , reducing her expected payoff from 10 to 5 .
On the other hand , we might imagine that the players could communicate before playing the game and agree to play correlated strategies so as to coordinate on s2 - t1 , thereby removing some , most or all of the uncertainty that encourages elimination of the weakly dominated row s1 , and eliminating s1 - t2 as a viable solution instead !
Any proposed principle for solving games that may have the effect of eliminating one or more NE from consideration as solutions is referred to as a refinement of NE .
In the case just discussed , elimination of weakly dominated strategies is one possible refinement , since it refines away the NE s2 - t1 , and correlation is another , since it refines away the other NE , s1 - t2 , instead .
So which refinement is more appropriate as a solution concept ?
People who think of game theory as an explanatory and / or normative theory of strategic rationality have generated a substantial literature in which the merits and drawbacks of a large number of refinements are debated .
In principle , there seems to be no limit on the number of refinements that could be considered , since there may also be no limits on the set of philosophical intuitions about what principles a rational agent might or might not see fit to follow or to fear or hope that other players are following .
We now digress briefly to make a point about terminology .
Theorists who adopt the revealed preference interpretation of the utility functions in game theory are sometimes referred to in the philosophy of economics literature as ‘ behaviorists ’ .
This reflects the fact the revealed preference approaches equate choices with economically consistent actions , rather than being intended to refer to mental constructs .
Historically , there was a relationship of comfortable alignment , though not direct theoretical co-construction , between revealed preference in economics and the methodological and ontological behaviorism that dominated scientific psychology during the middle decades of the twentieth century .
However , this usage is increasingly likely to cause confusion due to the more recent rise of behavioral game theory ( Camerer 2003 ) .
This program of research aims to directly incorporate into game - theoretic models generalizations , derived mainly from experiments with people , about ways in which people differ from purer economic agents in the inferences they draw from information ( ‘ framing ’ ) .
Applications also typically incorporate special assumptions about utility functions , also derived from experiments .
For example , players may be taken to be willing to make trade - offs between the magnitudes of their own payoffs and inequalities in the distribution of payoffs among the players .
We will turn to some discussion of behavioral game theory in Section 8.1 , Section 8.2 and Section 8.3 .
For the moment , note that this use of game theory crucially rests on assumptions about psychological representations of value thought to be common among people .
Thus it would be misleading to refer to behavioral game theory as ‘ behaviorist ’ .
But then it just would invite confusion to continue referring to conventional economic game theory that relies on revealed preference as ‘ behaviorist ’ game theory .
We will therefore refer to it as ‘ non- psychological ’ game theory .
We mean by this the kind of game theory used by most economists who are not revisionist behavioral economists .
( We use the qualifier ‘ revisionist ’ to reflect the further complication that increasingly many economists who apply revealed preference concepts conduct experiments , and some of them call themselves ‘ behavioral economists ’!
For a proposed new set of conventions to reduce this labeling chaos , see Ross ( 2014 ) , pp. 200 –201 . )
These ‘ establishment ’ economists treat game theory as the abstract mathematics of strategic interaction , rather than as an attempt to directly characterize special psychological dispositions that might be typical in humans .
Non-psychological game theorists tend to take a dim view of much of the refinement program .
This is for the obvious reason that it relies on intuitions about which kinds of inferences people should find sensible .
Like most scientists , non-psychological game theorists are suspicious of the force and basis of philosophical assumptions as guides to empirical and mathematical modeling .
Behavioral game theory , by contrast , can be understood as a refinement of game theory , though not necessarily of its solution concepts , in a different sense .
It restricts the theory ’s underlying axioms for application to a special class of agents , individual , psychologically typical humans .
It motivates this restriction by reference to inferences , along with preferences , that people do find natural , regardless of whether these seem rational , which they frequently do not .
Non-psychological and behavioral game theory have in common that neither is intended to be normative — though both are often used to try to describe norms that prevail in groups of players , as well to explain why norms might persist in groups of players even when they appear to be less than fully rational to philosophical intuitions .
Both see the job of applied game theory as being to predict outcomes of empirical games given some distribution of strategic dispositions , and some distribution of expectations about the strategic dispositions of others , that are shaped by dynamics in players ’ environments , including institutional pressures and structures and evolutionary selection .
Let us therefore group non-psychological and behavioral game theorists together , just for purposes of contrast with normative game theorists , as descriptive game theorists .
Descriptive game theorists are often inclined to doubt that the goal of seeking a general theory of rationality makes sense as a project .
Institutions and evolutionary processes build many environments , and what counts as rational procedure in one environment may not be favoured in another .
On the other hand , an entity that does not at least stochastically ( i.e. , perhaps noisily but statistically more often than not ) satisfy the minimal restrictions of economic rationality cannot , except by accident , be accurately characterized as aiming to maximize a utility function .
To such entities game theory has no application in the first place .
This does not imply that non-psychological game theorists abjure all principled ways of restricting sets of NE to subsets based on their relative probabilities of arising .
In particular , non-psychological game theorists tend to be sympathetic to approaches that shift emphasis from rationality onto considerations of the informational dynamics of games .
We should perhaps not be surprised that NE analysis alone often fails to tell us much of applied , empirical interest about strategic - form games ( e.g. , Figure 6 above ) , in which informational structure is suppressed .
Equilibrium selection issues are often more fruitfully addressed in the context of extensive - form games .
In order to deepen our understanding of extensive - form games , we need an example with more interesting structure than the PD offers .
Consider the game described by this tree :
Figure 9
This game is not intended to fit any preconceived situation ; it is simply a mathematical object in search of an application .
( L and R here just denote ‘ left ’ and ‘ right ’ respectively . )
Now consider the strategic form of this game :
Figure 10
If you are confused by this , remember that a strategy must tell a player what to do at every information set where that player has an action .
Since each player chooses between two actions at each of two information sets here , each player has four strategies in total .
The first letter in each strategy designation tells each player what to do if he or she reaches their first information set , the second what to do if their second information set is reached .
I.e. , LR for Player II tells II to play L if information set 5 is reached and R if information set 6 is reached .
If you examine the matrix in Figure 10 , you will discover that ( LL , RL ) is among the NE .
This is a bit puzzling , since if Player I reaches her second information set ( 7 ) in the extensive - form game , she would hardly wish to play L there ; she earns a higher payoff by playing R at node 7 .
Mere NE analysis does n’t notice this because NE is insensitive to what happens off the path of play .
Player I , in choosing L at node 4 , ensures that node 7 will not be reached ; this is what is meant by saying that it is ‘ off the path of play ’ .
In analyzing extensive - form games , however , we should care what happens off the path of play , because consideration of this is crucial to what happens on the path .
For example , it is the fact that Player I would play R if node 7 were reached that would cause Player II to play L if node 6 were reached , and this is why Player I wo n’t choose R at node 4 .
We are throwing away information relevant to game solutions if we ignore off - path outcomes , as mere NE analysis does .
Notice that this reason for doubting that NE is a wholly satisfactory equilibrium concept in itself has nothing to do with intuitions about rationality , as in the case of the refinement concepts discussed in Section 2.5 .
Now apply Zermelo ’s algorithm to the extensive form of our current example .
Begin , again , with the last subgame , that descending from node 7 .
This is Player I ’s move , and she would choose R because she prefers her payoff of 5 to the payoff of 4 she gets by playing L.
Therefore , we assign the payoff ( 5 , − 1 ) to node 7 .
Thus at node 6 II faces a choice between ( −1 , 0 ) and ( 5 , − 1 ) .
He chooses L. At node 5 II chooses R. At node 4 I is thus choosing between ( 0 , 5 ) and ( −1 , 0 ) , and so plays L. Note that , as in the PD , an outcome appears at a terminal node — ( 4 , 5 ) from node 7 — that is Pareto superior to the NE .
Again , however , the dynamics of the game prevent it from being reached .
The fact that Zermelo ’s algorithm picks out the strategy vector ( LR , RL ) as the unique solution to the game shows that it ’s yielding something other than just an NE .
In fact , it is generating the game ’s subgame perfect equilibrium ( SPE ) .
It gives an outcome that yields a NE not just in the whole game but in every subgame as well .
This is a persuasive solution concept because , again unlike the refinements of Section 2.5 , it does not demand ‘ extra ’ rationality of agents in the sense of expecting them to have and use philosophical intuitions about ‘ what makes sense ’ .
It does , however , assume that players not only know everything strategically relevant to their situation but also use all of that information .
In arguments about the foundations of economics , this is often referred to as an aspect of rationality , as in the phrase ‘ rational expectations ’ .
But , as noted earlier , it is best to be careful not to confuse the general normative idea of rationality with computational power and the possession of budgets , in time and energy , to make the most of it .
An agent playing a subgame perfect strategy simply chooses , at every node she reaches , the path that brings her the highest payoff in the subgame emanating from that node .
SPE predicts a game ’s outcome just in case , in solving the game , the players foresee that they will all do that .
A main value of analyzing extensive - form games for SPE is that this can help us to locate structural barriers to social optimization .
In our current example , Player I would be better off , and Player II no worse off , at the left - hand node emanating from node 7 than at the SPE outcome .
But Player I ’s economic rationality , and Player II ’s awareness of this , blocks the socially efficient outcome .
If our players wish to bring about the more socially efficient outcome ( 4,5 ) here , they must do so by redesigning their institutions so as to change the structure of the game .
The enterprise of changing institutional and informational structures so as to make efficient outcomes more likely in the games that agents ( that is , people , corporations , governments , etc. ) actually play is known as mechanism design , and is one of the leading areas of application of game theory .
The main techniques are reviewed in Hurwicz and Reiter ( 2006 ) , the first author of which was awarded the Nobel Prize for his pioneering work in the area .
Many readers , but especially philosophers , might wonder why , in the case of the example taken up in the previous section , mechanism design should be necessary unless players are morbidly selfish sociopaths .
Surely , the players might be able to just see that outcome ( 4,5 ) is socially and morally superior ; and since the whole problem also takes for granted that they can also see the path of actions that leads to this efficient outcome , who is the game theorist to announce that , unless their game is changed , it ’s unattainable ?
This objection , which applies the distinctive idea of rationality urged by Immanuel Kant , indicates the leading way in which many philosophers mean more by ‘ rationality ’ than descriptive game theorists do .
This theme is explored with great liveliness and polemical force in Binmore ( 1994 , 1998 ) .
This weighty philosophical controversy about rationality is sometimes confused by misinterpretation of the meaning of ‘ utility ’ in non-psychological game theory .
To root out this mistake , consider the Prisoner ’s Dilemma again .
We have seen that in the unique NE of the PD , both players get less utility than they could have through mutual cooperation .
This may strike you , even if you are not a Kantian ( as it has struck many commentators ) as perverse .
Surely , you may think , it simply results from a combination of selfishness and paranoia on the part of the players .
To begin with they have no regard for the social good , and then they shoot themselves in the feet by being too untrustworthy to respect agreements .
This way of thinking is very common in popular discussions , and badly mixed up .
To dispel its influence , let us first introduce some terminology for talking about outcomes .
Welfare economists typically measure social good in terms of Pareto efficiency .
A distribution of utility β is said to be Pareto superior over another distribution δ just in case from state δ there is a possible redistribution of utility to β such that at least one player is better off in β than in δ and no player is worse off .
Failure to move from a Pareto - inferior to a Pareto - superior distribution is inefficient because the existence of β as a possibility , at least in principle , shows that in δ some utility is being wasted .
Now , the outcome ( 3,3 ) that represents mutual cooperation in our model of the PD is clearly Pareto superior to mutual defection ; at ( 3,3 ) both players are better off than at ( 2,2 ) .
So it is true that PDs lead to inefficient outcomes .
This was true of our example in Section 2.6 as well .
However , inefficiency should not be associated with immorality .
A utility function for a player is supposed to represent everything that player cares about , which may be anything at all .
As we have described the situation of our prisoners they do indeed care only about their own relative prison sentences , but there is nothing essential in this .
What makes a game an instance of the PD is strictly and only its payoff structure .
Thus we could have two Mother Theresa types here , both of whom care little for themselves and wish only to feed starving children .
But suppose the original Mother Theresa wishes to feed the children of Calcutta while Mother Juanita wishes to feed the children of Bogota .
And suppose that the international aid agency will maximize its donation if the two saints nominate the same city , will give the second - highest amount if they nominate each others ’ cities , and the lowest amount if they each nominate their own city .
Our saints are in a PD here , though hardly selfish or unconcerned with the social good .
To return to our prisoners , suppose that , contrary to our assumptions , they do value each other ’s well - being as well as their own .
In that case , this must be reflected in their utility functions , and hence in their payoffs .
If their payoff structures are changed so that , for example , they would feel so badly about contributing to inefficiency that they ’d rather spend extra years in prison than endure the shame , then they will no longer be in a PD .
But all this shows is that not every possible situation is a PD ; it does not show that selfishness is among the assumptions of game theory .
It is the logic of the prisoners ’ situation , not their psychology , that traps them in the inefficient outcome , and if that really is their situation then they are stuck in it ( barring further complications to be discussed below ) .
Agents who wish to avoid inefficient outcomes are best advised to prevent certain games from arising ; the defender of the possibility of Kantian rationality is really proposing that they try to dig themselves out of such games by turning themselves into different kinds of agents .
In general , then , a game is partly defined by the payoffs assigned to the players .
In any application , such assignments should be based on sound empirical evidence .
If a proposed solution involves tacitly changing these payoffs , then this ‘ solution ’ is in fact a disguised way of changing the subject and evading the implications of best modeling practice .
Our last point above opens the way to a philosophical puzzle , one of several that still preoccupy those concerned with the logical foundations of game theory .
It can be raised with respect to any number of examples , but we will borrow an elegant one from C. Bicchieri ( 1993 ) .
Consider the following game :
Figure 11
The NE outcome here is at the single leftmost node descending from node 8 .
To see this , backward induct again .
At node 10 , I would play L for a payoff of 3 , giving II a payoff of 1 .
II can do better than this by playing L at node 9 , giving I a payoff of 0 .
I can do better than this by playing L at node 8 ; so that is what I does , and the game terminates without II getting to move .
A puzzle is then raised by Bicchieri ( along with other authors , including Binmore ( 1987 ) and Pettit and Sugden ( 1989 ) ) by way of the following reasoning .
Player I plays L at node 8 because she knows that Player II is economically rational , and so would , at node 9 , play L because Player II knows that Player I is economically rational and so would , at node 10 , play L.
But now we have the following paradox : Player I must suppose that Player II , at node 9 , would predict Player I ’s economically rational play at node 10 despite having arrived at a node ( 9 ) that could only be reached if Player I is not economically rational !
If Player I is not economically rational then Player II is not justified in predicting that Player I will not play R at node 10 , in which case it is not clear that Player II should n’t play R at 9 ; and if Player II plays R at 9 , then Player I is guaranteed of a better payoff then she gets if she plays L at node 8 .
Both players use backward induction to solve the game ; backward induction requires that Player I know that Player II knows that Player I is economically rational ; but Player II can solve the game only by using a backward induction argument that takes as a premise the failure of Player I to behave in accordance with economic rationality .
This is the paradox of backward induction .
A standard way around this paradox in the literature is to invoke the so - called ‘ trembling hand ’ due to Selten ( 1975 ) .
The idea here is that a decision and its consequent act may ‘ come apart ’ with some nonzero probability , however small .
That is , a player might intend to take an action but then slip up in the execution and send the game down some other path instead .
If there is even a remote possibility that a player may make a mistake — that her ‘ hand may tremble ’ — then no contradiction is introduced by a player ’s using a backward induction argument that requires the hypothetical assumption that another player has taken a path that an economically rational player could not choose .
In our example , Player II could reason about what to do at node 9 conditional on the assumption that Player I chose L at node 8 but then slipped .
Gintis ( 2009a ) points out that the apparent paradox does not arise merely from our supposing that both players are economically rational .
It rests crucially on the additional premise that each player must know , and reasons on the basis of knowing , that the other player is economically rational .
This is the premise with which each player ’s conjectures about what would happen off the equilibrium path of play are inconsistent .
A player has reason to consider out - of - equilibrium possibilities if she either believes that her opponent is economically rational but his hand may tremble or she attaches some nonzero probability to the possibility that he is not economically rational or she attaches some doubt to her conjecture about his utility function .
As Gintis also stresses , this issue with solving extensive - form games games for SEP by Zermelo ’s algorithm generalizes : a player has no reason to play even a Nash equilibrium strategy unless she expects other players to also play Nash equilibrium strategies .
We will return to this issue in Section 7 below .
The paradox of backward induction , like the puzzles raised by equilibrium refinement , is mainly a problem for those who view game theory as contributing to a normative theory of rationality ( specifically , as contributing to that larger theory the theory of strategic rationality ) .
The non-psychological game theorist can give a different sort of account of apparently “ irrational ” play and the prudence it encourages .
This involves appeal to the empirical fact that actual agents , including people , must learn the equilibrium strategies of games they play , at least whenever the games are at all complicated .
Research shows that even a game as simple as the Prisoner ’s Dilemma requires learning by people ( Ledyard 1995 , Sally 1995 , Camerer 2003 , p. 265 ) .
What it means to say that people must learn equilibrium strategies is that we must be a bit more sophisticated than was indicated earlier in constructing utility functions from behavior in application of Revealed Preference Theory .
Instead of constructing utility functions on the basis of single episodes , we must do so on the basis of observed runs of behavior once it has stabilized , signifying maturity of learning for the subjects in question and the game in question .
Once again , the Prisoner ’s Dilemma makes a good example .
People encounter few one - shot Prisoner ’s Dilemmas in everyday life , but they encounter many repeated PD ’s with non-strangers .
As a result , when set into what is intended to be a one - shot PD in the experimental laboratory , people tend to initially play as if the game were a single round of a repeated PD .
The repeated PD has many Nash equilibria that involve cooperation rather than defection .
Thus experimental subjects tend to cooperate at first in these circumstances , but learn after some number of rounds to defect .
The experimenter cannot infer that she has successfully induced a one - shot PD with her experimental setup until she sees this behavior stabilize .
If players of games realize that other players may need to learn game structures and equilibria from experience , this gives them reason to take account of what happens off the equilibrium paths of extensive - form games .
Of course , if a player fears that other players have not learned equilibrium , this may well remove her incentive to play an equilibrium strategy herself .
This raises a set of deep problems about social learning ( Fudenberg and Levine 1998 .
How can ignorant players learn to play equilibria if sophisticated players do n’t show them , because the sophisticated are not incentivized to play equilibrium strategies until the ignorant have learned ?
The crucial answer in the case of applications of game theory to interactions among people is that young people are socialized by growing up in networks of institutions , including cultural norms .
Most complex games that people play are already in progress among people who were socialized before them — that is , have learned game structures and equilibria ( Ross 2008a ) .
Novices must then only copy those whose play appears to be expected and understood by others .
Institutions and norms are rich with reminders , including homilies and easily remembered rules of thumb , to help people remember what they are doing ( Clark 1997 ) .
As noted in Section 2.7 above , when observed behavior does not stabilize around equilibria in a game , and there is no evidence that learning is still in process , the analyst should infer that she has incorrectly modeled the situation she is studying .
Chances are that she has either mis-specified players ’ utility functions , the strategies available to the players , or the information that is available to them .
Given the complexity of many of the situations that social scientists study , we should not be surprised that mis-specification of models happens frequently .
Applied game theorists must do lots of learning , just like their subjects .
The paradox of backward induction is one of a family of paradoxes that arise if one builds possession and use of literally complete information into a concept of rationality .
( Consider , by analogy , the stock market paradox that arises if we suppose that economically rational investment incorporates literally rational expectations : assume that no individual investor can beat the market in the long run because the market always knows everything the investor knows ; then no one has incentive to gather knowledge about asset values ; then no one will ever gather any such information and so from the assumption that the market knows everything it follows that the market cannot know anything ! )
As we will see in detail in various discussions below , most applications of game theory explicitly incorporate uncertainty and prospects for learning by players .
The extensive - form games with SPE that we looked at above are really conceptual tools to help us prepare concepts for application to situations where complete and perfect information is unusual .
We cannot avoid the paradox if we think , as some philosophers and normative game theorists do , that one of the conceptual tools we want to use game theory to sharpen is a fully general idea of rationality itself .
But this is not a concern entertained by economists and other scientists who put game theory to use in empirical modeling .
In real cases , unless players have experienced play at equilibrium with one another in the past , even if they are all economically rational and all believe this about one another , we should predict that they will attach some positive probability to the conjecture that understanding of game structures among some players is imperfect .
This then explains why people , even if they are economically rational agents , may often , or even usually , play as if they believe in trembling hands .
Learning of equilibria may take various forms for different agents and for games of differing levels of complexity and risk .
Incorporating it into game - theoretic models of interactions thus introduces an extensive new set of technicalities .
For the most fully developed general theory , the reader is referred to Fudenberg and Levine ( 1998 ) ; the same authors provide a non-technical overview of the issues in Fudenberg and Levine ( 2016 ) ) .
A first important distinction is between learning specific parameters between rounds of a repeated game ( see Section 4 ) with common players , and learning about general strategic expectations across different games .
The latter can include learning about players if the learner is updating expectations based on her models of types of players she recurrently encounters .
Then we can distinguish between passive learning , in which a player merely updates her subjective priors based on her observation of moves and outcomes , and strategic choices she infers from these , and active learning , in which she probes — in technical language screens — for information about other players ’ strategies by choosing strategies that test her conjectures about what will occur off what she believes to be the game ’s equilibrium path .
A major difficulty for both players and modelers is that screening moves might be misinterpreted if players are also incentivized to make moves to signal information to one another ( see Section 4 ) .
In other words : trying to learn about strategies can under some circumstances interfere with players ’ abilities to learn equilibria .
Finally , the discussion so far has assumed that all possible learning in a game is about the structure of the game itself .
Wilcox ( 2008 ) shows that if players are learning new information about causal processes occurring outside a game while simultaneously trying to update expectations about other players ’ strategies , the modeler can find herself reaching beyond the current limits of technical knowledge .
It was said above that people might usually play as if they believe in trembling hands .
A very general reason for this is that when people interact , the world does not furnish them with cue - cards advising them about the structures of the games they ’re playing .
They must make and test conjectures about this from their social contexts .
Sometimes , contexts are fixed by institutional rules .
For example , when a person walks into a retail shop and sees a price tag on something she ’d like to have , she knows without needing to conjecture or learn anything that she ’s involved in a simple ‘ take it or leave it ’ game .
In other markets , she might know she is expect to haggle , and know the rules for that too .
Given the unresolved complex relationship between learning theory and game theory , the reasoning above might seem to imply that game theory can never be applied to situations involving human players that are novel for them .
Fortunately , however , we face no such impasse .
In a pair of influential papers in the mid -to - late 1990s , McKelvey and Palfrey ( 1995 , 1998 ) developed the solution concept of quantal response equilibrium ( QRE ) .
QRE is not a refinement of NE , in the sense of being a philosophically motivated effort to strengthen NE by reference to normative standards of rationality .
It is , rather , a method for calculating the equilibrium properties of choices made by players whose conjectures about possible errors in the choices of other players are uncertain .
QRE is

Exclusive -- Please credit THE OIL DRUM and Chuck Watson of KAC / UCF .
KAC / UCF and Chuck Watson are forecasting , based on their damage models , that the Qalhat ( Sur ) LNG terminal will be out for 20 - 30 days and the Mina al Fahal oil terminal will be down for 10 - 15 days -- all of this assuming they are built to US standards .
If you have any insights , please email the editors box with the word GONU in the subject .

Why might Gonu matter ?
Well , that answer begins with the fact that the world production of petroleum plateauing around 85 mbbl / day , any slight blip in supply or exporting could be quite noticeable on the world markets .
A sizeable portion of the world 's petroleum exports go through the Gulf of Oman .
Particularly , Oman matters in this because it produces 743,000 bbl / day ; Oman is also a net exporter , non-OPEC , whose production peaked earlier in the decade .
( Thanks to Mike from Green Car Congress for the link . ) .
Of course , this storm also has the potential to affect Iran , UAE , India , and / or Pakistan for that matter -- mainly because of shipping disruptions , but there could be some real effects on infrastructure and assets depending on track and landfall .
There are also refining and other production assets in Southern Iran , especially in Chah Bahar .
( One will note , as you explore the old comment thread that many of these possibilities are explored ... there 's a lot of material that we are still sorting through on Iran , shipping lanes , storm surge , etc . )
Resources put under the fold ( hit " There 's more " to load ) .
Let me make some predictions , starting with :
No it wo n't .
Vaccine development will take a flat minimum of 12 months .
Then another 1 - 3 months to ramp up ( on a Manhattan Project management basis ) and a to - some - extent - overlapping 1 - 3 months to roll out around the various nations that are involved .
( I predict the USA will merrily go its own way and faceplant , unless y'all elect a competent next POTUS .
Or VPOTUS , insofar as Biden appears to be past it and Pence is incompetent at anything but arse - licking . )
Meanwhile .
Lockdown can't be sustained more than 1 - 2 weeks after peak ICU occupancy passes , so it will be lifted in mid-May in the UK and possibly as early as May 1st in the USA .
( I know the Eastern Coalition are kicking back against Trump 's deranged demand for an early restart : I expect other states may also join in if their estimates of the long - term damage track reality . )
Trump is shooting for May 1st because he 's been told the economy will take 6 months to recover , minimum , and he 's shooting for the November election deadline .
This is laughably optimistic , even if the pandemic had burned out by May 1st : we 're in Greatest Depression territory already , the hospitality sector has crashed 75 % , airlines have crashed 90 % , etcetera .
It 's not going to be back to normal by November , even if the Fairy Godmother shows up and banishes the horrid virus with a wave of her wand .
Period .
So .
The immediate peak hospital occupancy will pass , lockdown will be lifted sector by sector ( or all at once ) and region by region ... and the 50 % of COVID19 cases who are asymptomatic will go back to work , mingling with the uninfected .
1 - 4 weeks later there will be a secondary surge in infections and it'll follow the same exponential growth as the first spike in Feb / March .
And lockdown will resume , probably in mid-June .
( It may be mitigated by summer heat , in which case things will look good for a month or two longer , but I 'm not holding my breath : even if heat prevents spread , the prevalence of air conditioning in public spaces in the US provides a transmission - friendly environment . )
If the howls of rage at the first lockdown are deafening , the second lockdown will be worse : think of toddlers being sent back to bed with no supper .
And that 's the lucky work - from - home class : the working poor — with no savings and jobs they need to be physically present for — are going to be increasingly angry and fractious at their exposure .
Expect civil disobedience and possibly summer riots unless central banks throw money at the grassroots -- and not $ 1200 for 10 weeks : more like $ 1200 per week .
Oh , and then there are the hospitals .
Hospital staff will begin to catch their breath in mid-May after two months of running at maximum speed ... then it 'll all crash again 4 weeks later .
They 're getting no respite .
About 25 % of medical staff are off sick with COVID19 themselves at present , far as I can tell : this cohort will be coming back to work by the second lockdown , but a bunch more will be down and sick .
You can't run doctors and nurses at full pandemic intensity for all that long without them burning out , as well as getting sick .
There will be horrifying staff attrition , and although this year 's graduate cohort got pressed into service early , next year 's cohort will be suspended because teaching ain't happening .
So we 're going to see repeated 4 - 6 week lockdown periods alternating with 2 - 4 week " business as usual " patches .
Somewhere during the second or third lockdown most of the pubs / bars / hotels / restaurants that hibernated during the first lockdown and came back from the dead will give up the ghost : by September - November the damage to about 10 - 30 % of the economy , disproportionately the service sector , will be permanent ( FSVO " permanent " that means not coming back until after the pandemic , growing afresh from zero rather than reviving from hibernation ) .
I do not know what the hell Trump will do when his " get America open again " agenda runs into pandemic spike # 2 , around the beginning of June .
Expect denial and heel - dragging and a much worse death toll , this time reaching the rural heartland ( where hospitals may not have any ICU beds at all : there 's going to be carnage ) .
By August he may well be in full - on meltdown .
I would n't even be surprised to see a second round of impeachment hearings as the Senate Republican Party tries to throw him under the bus so they can pivot to President Pence .
Assuming it 's not too late to save their campaign ...
By September there 's going to be social unrest just about everywhere that has n't nailed down a massive social spending / social security project on a scale that makes the New Deal look restrained and conservative .
And that 's going to be the picture until June or July 2022 .
Extra lulz in the UK : the Prime Minister is out of hospital but has n't been seen since Monday — my guess is he 's hors de combat for at least another two weeks .
A quarter of the senior ministers of state are rabid objectivists who actively hate the poor and want them to die , and a majority of the cabinet are still going full steam ahead for a no - deal Brexit transition on January 31st , at which point the UK economy shrinks another 8 % overnight .
Boris , in principle , has the credibility to pull them back from the brink ( and is a perfectly ideology - free vacuum of naked ambition , so he 's personally capable of pivoting ) but if they try for a maximalist brexit in the middle of a pandemic there will be pandemonium .
Wildcards : we might conceivably find a simple and effective medical treatment .
Or vaccine development is ridiculously easy .
Or the 50 % of asymptomatic carriers are a sign that the pandemic is more advanced than we realize , that immunity is long - lasting , and that we 're much closer to achieving " herd immunity " than anyone in the epidemiology community currently realizes .
But I want to emphasize that these are all straw - clutching exercises .
In all probability , they 're not going to eventuate .
Have I missed anything out ?
( Aside from the giant meteor , Cthulhu awakening , Krakatoa erupting , and a Dalek invasion .
NB : one of those things actually happened last month . )

WASHINGTON , July 11 — Undercover Congressional investigators set up a bogus company and obtained a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in March that would have allowed them to buy the radioactive materials needed for a so - called dirty bomb .
The investigators , from the Government Accountability Office , demonstrated once again that the security measures put in place since the 2001 terrorist attacks to prevent radioactive materials from getting into the wrong hands are insufficient , according to a G.A.O. report , which is scheduled to be released at a Senate hearing Thursday .
“ Given that terrorists have expressed an interest in obtaining nuclear material , the Congress and the American people expect licensing programs for these materials to be secure , ” said Gregory D. Kutz , an investigator at the accountability office , in testimony prepared for the hearing .
The bomb the investigators could have built would not have caused widespread damage or even high - level contamination .
But it still could have had serious consequences , particularly economic ones , in any city where it was set off .
The Starbucks outlet has been in the Forbidden City since 2000
An online campaign arguing that the shop was trampling on Chinese culture had drawn more than 500,000 signatures .
The Starbucks branch was told it could stay open if it sold other brands but has declined .
The Forbidden City was built in 1420 and was home to 24 emperors until the end of imperial rule in 1911 .
It attracted nearly nine million visitors last year , is China 's top tourist attraction and a Unesco World Heritage site .
Seattle - based Starbucks said the decision was " very congenial " and it respected the site 's motives .
Starbucks 's vice - president for Greater China Eden Woon said : " There were several choices , one of which was to continue , but it would not carry the Starbucks name any more .
" We decided at the end that it is not our custom worldwide to have stores that have any other name , so therefore we decided the choice would be to leave . "
' Solemnity undermined '
Starbucks , which has nearly 200 outlets in China , opened the Forbidden City shop seven years ago and removed its brand sign two years ago to address cultural sensitivities .
But the shop continued to draw protests .
China state TV personality Rui Chenggang led the online campaign , saying the shop 's presence " undermined the solemnity of the Forbidden City and trampled on Chinese culture " .
The palace is undergoing restoration that includes toning down the commercial aspect .
The number of shops has already more than halved .

When Claire Thomas saw the name " Dan " flash up on her mobile , she felt a flutter of excitement .
She 'd met the handsome 24 - year - old on a girls ' holiday to Crete only a few weeks earlier , and recalling the passionate fling they 'd enjoyed on her final night , she was convinced he was ringing to ask if they could continue their summer romance .
Not for a moment did she anticipate the bombshell that followed .
Dan , a dark - haired charmer who 'd declared he was " smitten " with Claire , casually announced that in fact he 'd always had a girlfriend .
Then , for good measure , he added that he also had the sexually transmitted infection chlamydia .
It was not the kind of holiday souvenir Claire had intended to bring home .
" I was furious , " says the 25 - year - old , who works in London as a marketing executive .
" He even had the cheek to blame me .
How dare he ?
" I 'd never had unprotected sex before , and had even walked away from men who'd refused to use condoms , so I knew I was n't responsible for it .
The only reason I 'd taken such a stupid risk in the first place was because we'd got so drunk together .
" Neither of us had any condoms , and so we ended up having unprotected sex several times .
It was a mistake , I was stupid , and the very next morning I 'd begun to wonder if I could have picked up an infection .
But as it was a one - off , I convinced myself that I 'd have to be pretty unlucky to catch something .
" I 've never been what I 'd call promiscuous , sleeping around for the sake of it , and I 've always been really strict about using condoms because I do worry about STIs .
Scroll down for more ...
Even though sex is n't the main reason my friends and I go away together , it definitely goes hand - in - hand with girls ' holidays .
Our inhibitions disappear when we 're abroad in the sunshine , surrounded by all those men .
" A big part in losing my inhibitions is the amount of alcohol that I - and everyone else - drink when we 're abroad .
After a night of endless cocktails , or rum and coke , the usual rules go out the window . "
Unfortunately for Claire , her luck had just run out .
Blood tests and a smear at a sexual health clinic confirmed that she had , indeed , contracted chlamydia - the most common sexually transmitted infection ( STI ) , and one which , although often without symptoms in women , can cause untold damage to fertility if left untreated because it can spread to the uterus and fallopian tubes .
For Claire , the diagnosis meant an emergency five - day course of antibiotics .
Two years on , she is still angry and regretful that she might have jeopardised her fertility with such an ill - advised and tawdry fling .
" At the time , I was n't worried about getting pregnant because I knew it was n't my most fertile time of the month , " says Claire , who lives with friends in Islington , North London .
" The doctors told me they do n't think my fertility has been affected in the long term , but they say I wo n't know for sure until I want to try for a family .
Of course , that is a shattering warning for a young woman , and I 'm now desperately anxious .
I would love to settle down and have children one day , but now I might not be able to .
" I was so upset at the time that I confided in my mother .
She was quite sympathetic because she knows I 'm normally responsible , but she gave me a stern lecture on safe sex and drinking too much on holiday .
I have to agree it was too high a price to pay for a sexual thrill , and I 'll never do it again . "
Such regret seems depressingly rare among a generation of young women who have come to regard foreign trips as an excuse to drink themselves senseless and sleep with as many men as possible .
They admit they take far more risks than they ever would at home - willing to shed inhibitions simply because they are on holiday .
And the disturbing reality is that these are middle - class women - the daughters of professional and wealthy families .
At a time of the year when tens of thousands of girls have gone away after A - levels , in their university vacations or on annual leave , these stories make sobering reading .
Take , for example , the admission by Penny Ashton , a 26 - year - old model from Kingston upon Thames , Surrey , who says that when she goes on holiday she draws up a chart to keep score on the number of men she sleeps with .
Her stated aim , she admits , is to have as sex with as many men as possible .
" Last time I went on holiday to Cyprus with my girlfriends , we drew up a chart with everyone 's names and how many times we'd had sex , " says Penny , whose father is a retired IT specialist .
" At the end of the week , the girl who'd had the most sex won a bottle of champagne .
" The girl who topped the chart had had sex with six men , whereas I 'd only had sex with two .
She seemed pretty pleased with herself , and there was plenty of banter from the other girls about how lucky she was to bed so many men .
" I 've no idea whether she had safe sex or not , but I hope she did : it would be a stupid risk to take if she did n't .
" The first man I slept with was a DJ I met only a couple of days into my trip .
We met in a club , where I 'd drunk about 15 vodkas . "
Forget any notion of romance : what passes for seduction in such circumstances is generally a slurred conversation conducted over thumping music , and a drunken acknowledgement that this person will do as your sexual partner for the evening .
" As we were going up to his room , he pulled out a camera , stopped a passer - by and asked him to take a photo of us , " recalls Penny .
" I assumed that he was really attracted to me , but when we got to his bedroom there were photos of all the girls he'd had sex with since arriving to work in Cyprus that summer .
There must have been over 30 of them on his wall . "
So surely she walked away in disgust ?
Well , not quite .
" I still went through with it , but I must have been mad .
He did n't have any condoms , so I got one from a packet in my bag and we had sex .
For someone with a huge sexual ego , he was very average in bed .
But I 'd just come out of a four - year relationship so I wanted some no -strings sex .
" It was just a one - night stand , and I moved on to another man later in the holiday .
I got talking to him in a bar and went back to his room for sex .
" On a girls ' holiday , you can be who you want to be and most people my age are looking for sex .
The passion is very intense , and all the usual rules about what you do and the risks you take do n't apply .
" I probably drink about 100 units of alcohol in a week 's holiday , which I 'll admit tends to help with holiday sex .
And although I get drunk every night on holiday , I always know what I 'm doing . "
Her parents , she says , were " horrified " when she told them about her exploits .
But that did not stop her from pursuing the DJ when he contacted her after she got back home .
" When the club DJ texted me to say he would like to see me again and that I should go back to Cyprus , I stupidly jumped on a plane to surprise him .
" And he was very surprised .
The look on his face told me that his message had been meaningless and that there was no way he wanted me back out there spoiling his fun .
" That 's when I realised how the game works .
When you sleep with men abroad , it 's a one - off .
They 're never interested in continuing the relationship .
I felt a bit silly for thinking he might . "
Personal safety seems low on the list of priorities for many young women abroad , too .
Take Shirley Robinson , 20 , a drama student from South - West London .
" My wildest holiday was in Kavos on Corfu last summer with nine friends , " she says .
" One afternoon , we hired quad bikes with a group of British men we'd met on the beach and one of them , - a 22 - year - old from London - rode pillion on my bike .
" It felt so sexy having a gorgeous man with his arms wrapped around my waist and we flirted outrageously .
" Halfway up a mountain , we let the rest of the group overtake us , then stopped and had sex there and then .
" Luckily I had a condom in my bag .
I would n't dream of doing that sort of thing at home , but on holiday I did n't care because it 's not like I 'm going to see anyone again .
" Although I really liked the guy and we spent the rest of the week together , we both knew that we would n't see each other again .
" We 'd been on these sorts of holidays before and knew that it never feels the same once you 're home and the sun and hedonism has gone .
It 's as if you live in an escapist bubble when you 're away from home , and all sense of responsibility goes out the window .
" I suppose it could have turned nasty up on the mountain and I could have been attacked , but I trusted him and liked him .
" I never thought for one minute that he'd do something horrible to me .
I know some girls are n't as lucky , but I think you 've got to go with your instinct . "
In the past year , high numbers of rapes of British women abroad have been reported , with 48 in Greece and 41 in Spain .
Of course , these are only the officially recorded crimes , and the real figures are thought to be much higher .
Shirley , who lives with her mother , a retail manager , in Hampshire , says she 's careful about her sexual health .
" I met one guy on a banana boat ride , " she giggles .
" We flirted and went on a Jet Ski , then headed to his room for sex .
We did use condoms .
I 'd never have unprotected sex because I 'd be terrified of getting pregnant or catching an STI .
My mum would be heartbroken : she trusts me to be careful .
" One day I 'd love to get married and have kids , probably in my 30s .
I think by partying now and enjoying a few holiday flings here and there , I 'll be much better placed to settle down when the time comes because I wo n't look back and wish I 'd made more of my single years . "
But how will she feel if she becomes a wife and mother to remember that she gave herself so cheaply to all those men who cared nothing for her ?
" You can let your inhibitions go when you 're abroad and forget the constraints of normal life , " she says .
" I go away to let my hair down , and if I end up having sex , then it 's a bonus . "
Medical records administrator Catherine Gibson , 22 , from North London , also sees holiday sex as something to boast about .
" Bikini , book , suncream and condoms - that 's my basic checklist for every girls ' holiday , " she says brazenly .
" I 've been going abroad with my friends for four years now , and at the start it was definitely about sun , sea , sand and sex .
" I always take condoms , but sex is n't my main focus now - it 's just great if it happens . "
So does she ever regret sleeping with virtual strangers ?
" No , I 've had quite a few drunken sexual encounters abroad , but I have n't actually had sex with a man and woken the next day regretting it .
" I do n't know why British girls get such bad press for having a bit of fun on holiday .
If they 're safe and no one gets hurt , then what 's the problem ?
I would n't do it if I was in a relationship . "
Catherine says she always insists on using a condom , but admits she 's experienced reticence from men who would rather go without .
" On my first girls ' holiday to Faliraki in Rhodes , I met a gorgeous 24 - year - old man and slept with him a couple of nights later .
He 'd been on lots of holidays with his friends , so he was a bit of a player and was n't keen on using a condom , but I would n't have had sex without one . "
Not surprisingly , Catherine 's middle - class parents - her father is an engineer and her mother a nurse - have drummed into her the need to take precautions if she decides to sleep with men on holiday .
One hardly dares think what they must make of her confessions .
" I'm on the Pill , so I 'm not worried about pregnancy , " she says , " but I do n't want to get a horrible disease . "
But whether they come home with an STI , or simply the hazy memory of a few more one - night stands , it 's hard to believe that women like these will not one day come to regret the years when drunkenness and meaningless sex seemed like so much fun .

A newly released inspector general report backs eyewitness accounts of suspicious behavior by 13 Middle Eastern men on a Northwest Airlines flight in 2004 and reveals several missteps by government officials , including failure to file an incident report until a month after the matter became public .
According to the Homeland Security report , the “ suspicious passengers , ” 12 Syrians and their Lebanese - born promoter , were traveling on Flight 327 from Detroit to Los Angeles on expired visas .
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services extended the visas one week after the June 29 , 2004 , incident .
The report also says that a background check in the FBI ’s National Crime Information Center database , which was performed June 18 as part of a visa - extension application , produced “ positive hits ” for past criminal records or suspicious behavior for eight of the 12 Syrians , who were traveling in the U.S. as a musical group .
In addition , the band ’s promoter was listed in a separate FBI database on case investigations for acting suspiciously aboard a flight months earlier .
He was detained a third time in September on a return trip to the U.S. from Istanbul , the details of which were redacted .
The inspector general criticized the Homeland Security officials for not reporting the incident to the Homeland Security Operations Center ( HSOC ) , which serves as the nation ’s nerve center for information sharing and domestic incident management .
The report comes three years after the incident , which was not officially acknowledged until a month later , after The Washington Times reported passenger and marshal complaints that the incident resembled a dry run for a terrorist attack .
After reviewing the report , air marshals say it confirms their earlier suspicions .
Official denial
An air marshal who told The Times that he has been involved personally in terror probes that were ignored by federal security managers , called such behavior typical .
“ Agency management was not only covering up numerous probes and dry - run encounters from Congress and other federal law - enforcement agencies , it was also hiding these incidents from their own flying air marshals , ” said P. Jeffrey Black , an air marshal stationed in Las Vegas .
Homeland Security officials initially denied the complaints and blamed passengers who reported the incident to the press as behaving hysterically .
However , the inspector general report shows that air marshals had the group of men under surveillance before they boarded the plane .
“ Prior to boarding , one of the air marshals noticed what he later characterized as ‘ unusual behavior ’ by about six Middle Eastern males , who arrived at the gate together , then separated , and acted as if they did not know each other , ” the report said .
“ According to the air marshals , these men were sweaty , appeared nervous and arrived after the boarding announcement .
The air marshals made eye contact with one another to ensure they were aware of this behavior , ” the report said .
The inspector general ’s two - year investigation was originally released in April 2006 but was then wholly redacted except for two sentences .
The re-release stems from a Freedom of Information request by The Times on April 25 , 2006 , which was answered Friday .
Portions of the report remain redacted .
However , current and former air marshals who reviewed a copy provided by The Times say the activities of the men details a dry run for a terrorist attack .
“ This report is evidence of Homeland Security executives attempting to downplay and cover up an unmistakable dry run that forced flight attendants to reveal the air marshals and compel the pilots to open the flight deck door , ” said Robert MacLean , a former air marshal who was fired last year for revealing that the service planned to cut back on protection for long - distance flights to save money .
Suspicious behavior
According to the report , Flight 327 was “ delayed for five minutes because one of the 13 suspicious passengers , who appeared not to understand English and walked with a limp , was seated in the emergency exit row .
The flight attendant determined he was unable to operate the emergency procedures and delayed the flight while having him exchange seats . ”
“ On the flight , 13 Middle Eastern men behaved in a suspicious manner that aroused the attention and concern of the flight attendants , passengers , air marshals and pilots , ” the report said .
The men “ walked in the aisle , appearing to count passengers , ” and “ several men spent excessive time in the lavatories . ”
“ One man rushed to the front of the plane appearing to head for the cockpit .
At the last moment , he veered into the first - class lavatory , remaining in it for about 20 minutes , ” according to the report .
One man carried a McDonald ’s bag into the lavatory , and “ another man , upon returning from the lavatory , reeked strongly of what smelled like toilet bowl chemicals . ”
“ Some men hand signaled each other .
The passenger who entered the lavatory with the McDonald ’s bag made a thumbs - up signal to another man upon returning from the lavatory .
Another man made a slashing motion across his throat , appearing to say ‘ No . ’ ”
As the flight descended into Los Angeles , the report said , “ four of the suspicious individuals stood up and made their way to the back of the plane , ” where “ the individuals used the rear lavatory , and one of the men was doing stretching exercises / knee bends by the exit door . ”
Warning signs
The men were briefly detained , but only two were questioned .
“ The Federal Air Marshal supervisor examined the visas , but did not notice the visas had expired on June 10 , 2004 , ” the report said .
One of the air marshals assigned to the flight noticed the expiration , but “ erroneously believed he was not legally entitled ” to run a background check .
According to the report , the marshal ’s “ primary concern , at that time , was not whether the visas expired , but to copy the visa pages so that Customs and Border Patrol could later run a database check on these individuals . ”
The FBI issued a warning in April 2004 , just two months before the flight , that terrorists may be trying to enter the country under cultural or sports visas , the same visas carried by the 12 Syrian men who claimed to be musicians .
Robert Jamison , deputy administrator for the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) , defended the agency ’s action in its official response to the IG audit , which is included in the report .
“ The reported suspicious activity was determined to be unfounded , and not a terrorist threat , and therefore did not merit an HSOC referral , ” he said .
The inspector general disagreed , and said TSA ’s actions once the matter became public proved that the agency thought otherwise .
The “ HSOC clearly signaled a referral was merited by logging the Flight 327 matter into its database on July 26 , 2004 , after a July 22 , 2004 , Washington Times article , and an inquiry from the White House Homeland Security Council . ”
Mr. Jamison said , “ Law - enforcement assessments made by the FAMS and FBI on June 29 , 2004 , were appropriate . ”
However , the inspector general said the FBI did not begin a full investigation until July 19 , and air marshal officials were assigned to assist the FBI between July 22 and Aug .
4 .
“ It ’s unfortunate that the suspects were released from custody , but it ’s not surprising , ” said Jeffrey Denning , a former air marshal who quit the agency last month .
“ The overt behavior of the 13 men on Flight 327 was indicative of a terrorist probe .
It appeared rehearsed , coordinated and planned .
It was menacing activity , ” Mr. Denning said .
Past behavior
A background check conducted weeks later in the FBI ’s Automated Case Support ( ACS ) system revealed that the promoter was involved in a similar probe on Jan. 28 , 2004 .
The unnamed promoter “ was one of eight passengers acting suspiciously aboard Frontier Airlines Flight 577 from Houston through Denver , to San Francisco , ” the report said .
“ Flight attendants reported all eight passengers kept trying to switch seats while boarding and during the flight , made repeated service requests in what the attendants described as an effort to keep the flight crew occupied .
One took a cell phone into the front lavatory , remained in the lavatory for over 15 minutes , but did not appear to have the phone when leaving the lavatory , ” the report said .
The incident followed a series of breaches of airline security in December and January , when the FBI issued a memo warning that suicide terrorists were plotting to hijack trans -Atlantic planes by smuggling “ ready - to - build ” bomb kits past airport security to be assembled in aircraft bathrooms .
“ Terrorist operatives are more confident that they can successfully smuggle [ bomb ] components , rather than fully assembled bombs past airport security , ” the memo said .
“ It is conceivable terrorists may plan to use this private area to construct [ bombs ] in order to facilitate access to the cockpit , or position themselves in front of the passengers . ”
Electronic devices , such as cell phones , can be used to detonate explosives .
‘ Defenseless ’ flights
“ What is disturbing to us as pilots is that there are now a number of incidents like this taking place across our industry and the vast majority of our flights are still defenseless , ” said Captain David Mackett , president of the Airline Pilots Security Alliance .
“ If I were a member of Congress , I ’d be asking some hard questions about why such a small percentage of flights have armed pilots or air marshals aboard , while the TSA whistles past the graveyard , asking us to believe none of this is related to terrorism , ” Mr. Mackett said .
The audit was initiated “ because of media reports concerning actions taken by departmental personnel in response to events on Flight 327 ” and “ to determine the various systems for recording and reporting suspicious passengers and activities . ”
The report sought to “ determine the specific circumstances relating to Flight 327 , including the department ’s handling of the suspicious passengers after the plane landed . ”
The inspector general made three recommendations , with part of one being redacted .
One recommended that the marshal service “ develop or acquire technology to permit effective and timely in - flight communication , ” a capability that air marshals say they still lack despite a $ 15 million congressional appropriation to develop the technology .
“ When handling suspicious passengers and activities aboard commercial aircraft , ” the department was directed to establish guidelines to clarify agency roles and responsibilities and share information .
The inspector general called the follow - up action “ inadequate . ”
The final recommendation was to develop and execute a memorandum of understanding with the FBI , which the Federal Air Marshal Service said was unneeded .

AUGUST 31 -- A crude ' ghetto handbook ' distributed to police patrolling Houston 's public schools has resulted in the suspension of one officer .
The eight - page booklet - - a copy of which you 'll find below - - was handed out in May by a officer with the city 's Independent School District , but did not come to the attention of school brass until recently , when a discrimination complaint was lodged .
The booklet , which was given to about 20 cops , is subtitled ' Wucha dun did now ? , ' and purports to help the reader ' learn to speak ebonics as if you just came out of the hood ... because you could find you self with a problem one day and ebonics could save your life . '
The booklet offers definitions for street slang like ' hoodrat ' ( ' scummy girl ' ) and ' foty ' ( a 40 - ounce bottle of beer ) and concludes with a ' poem ' incorporating these terms [ That poem , as many of our readers have noted , is actually the lyrics from ' Ebonics , ' a song by the rapper Big L ] .
It also includes a copyright notation that the booklet is a ' first edition , second soon to follow . '
That now appears to be the wishful thinking of a novice author .
The booklet was provided to TSG by school officials who removed the name of the suspended officer from the publication ( as well as the names of several other cops who have not been disciplined ) .

But Solstice clients are not ordinary people .
They are America 's super - rich and a brief glance at its operations reveal the vast and still widening gulf between them and the rest of America .
Solstice has only about 80 members .
Platinum membership costs them $ 875,000 to join and then a $ 42,000 annual fee .
In return they get access to 10 homes from London to California and a private yacht in the Caribbean , all fully staffed with cooks , cleaners and ' lifestyle managers ' ready to satisfy any whim from helicopter - skiing to audiences with local celebrities .
As the firm 's marketing manager , Cain knows what Solstice 's clientele want .
' We are trying to feed and manage this insatiable appetite for luxury , ' Cain said with pride .
America 's super - rich have returned to the days of the Roaring Twenties .
As the rest of the country struggles to get by , a huge bubble of multi-millionaires lives almost in a parallel world .
The rich now live in their own world of private education , private health care and gated mansions .
They have their own schools and their own banks .
They even travel apart - creating a booming industry of private jets and yachts .
Their world now has a name , thanks to a new book by Wall Street Journal reporter Robert Frank which has dubbed it ' Richistan ' .
There every dream can come true .
But for the American Dream itself - which promises everyone can join the elite - the emergence of Richistan is a mixed blessing .
' We in America are heading towards ' developing nation ' levels of inequality .
We would become like Brazil .
What does that say about us ?
What does that say about America ? '
Frank said .
In 1985 there were just 13 US billionaires .
Now there are more than 1,000 .
In 2005 the US saw 227,000 new millionaires being created .
One survey showed that the wealth of all US millionaires was $ 30 trillion , more than the GDPs of China , Japan , Brazil , Russia and the EU combined .
The rich have now created their own economy for their needs , at a time when the average worker 's wage rises will merely match inflation and where 36 million people live below the poverty line .
In Richistan sums of money are rendered almost meaningless because of their size .
It also has other names .
There is the ' Platinum Triangle ' used to describe the slice of Beverly Hills where many houses go for above $ 10 m .
Then there is the Jewel Coast , used to describe the strip of Madison Avenue in Manhattan where boutique jewellery stories have sprung up to cater for the new riches ' needs .
Or it exists in the MetCircle society , a Manhattan club open only to those whose net worth is at least $ 100m .
The reason behind the sudden wealth boom is , according to some experts , the convergence of a new technology - the internet and other computing advances - with fluid and speculative markets .
It was the same in the late 19th century when the original Gilded Age of conspicuous wealth and deep poverty was spawned by railways and the industrial age .
At the same time government has helped by doling out corporate tax breaks .
In the Fifties the proportion of federal income from company taxes was 33 per cent , by 2003 it was just 7.4 percent .
Some 82 of America 's largest companies paid no tax at all in at least one of the first three years of the administration of President George W Bush .
But who are the new rich ?
Some of the names are familiar , Microsoft tycoon Bill Gates and savvy stock investor Warren Buffett .
But most are unknown , often springing from the secretive world of financial hedge funds .
Men like James Simons , who took home compensation of $ 1.7 bn last year .
Last year the 25 top earning hedge fund bankers in the US earned an average of $ 570 m each .
The average US household income is $ 50,000 .
It is such men - and they are usually men - who feed the outlandish luxury goods economy of Richistan .
It is they who are responsible for the rebirth of the butler industry , which was all but dead in the Seventies and is now facing a shortage of trained staff .
So keen is the demand that many can expect to earn a six - figure salary when they graduate from booming butler schools .
Then there is the runaway feeder - industry of luxury consumer items .
The new ultra rich turn up their noses at Rolexes ; the sought - after brand is Franck Muller , which sells a high - end timepiece for $ 736,000 .
Or try a Mont Blanc pen , encrusted in jewels , for $ 700,000 .
Louis Vuitton 's most exclusive handbag sells for $ 42,000 .
Only 24 were ever made and none ever touched a shelf as all were pre-sold to Richistani clients .
In places such as Manhattan and Los Angeles , restaurants and bars outdo themselves in excess .
New York 's Algonquin Hotel has a $ 10,000 ' martini on a rock ' ( it comes with a diamond at the bottom of the glass ) .
City eateries sell burgers for more than $ 50 .
One offers a $ 1,000 omelette .
In Los Angeles there is a craze for Bling mineral water - at $ 90 a bottle .
Then there are the boats .
The private yacht industry in America has been caught in an arms race of size and luxuriousness .
So far , there has been a clear winner : Oracle - founder Larry Ellison 's 450ft water palace , the Rising Sun .
More than 80 rooms on five storeys and a landing craft that carries a Jeep , a basketball court doubling as a helipad and a fully - equipped cinema .
Now an Oregon - based company is taking things further : private submarines .
An estimated 100 or so private subs are now drifting around the world 's oceans .
Then there are the rockets - several notable billionaires are now leading the way in private exploration of space .
One of them is Robert Bigelow who has ploughed $ 500 m into trying to build an inflatable space hotel .
A miniature prototype model was successfully launched and tested last month .
In a scene that perhaps James Bond would find familiar , armed guards now patrol the fences of Bigelow Aerospace 's headquarters wearing badges decorated with an alien as their corporate logo .
But this is not just a world of riches gone mad that the rest of America can ignore .
The growth of such a large super - rich class , coupled with a deepening poverty in many communities , is starting to tear at the fabric of society .
Even some of the most wealthy - like Gates and Buffett - have spoken openly of the needs to address the massive ' inequality gap ' that they have come to exemplify .
In effect , some of the very richest Americans are calling for themselves to be taxed .
In a speech last month Buffett - the third richest man in the world - pointed out that his tax rate was 17.7 per cent of his income while his secretary was taxed at 30 per cent .
' Many of the new super - rich are looking long term at the world and they see a collapsing US education system and health - care system and the disappearance of the middle class and they realise : this is bad for everybody , ' said Frank .
Defenders of low tax for the very rich point to the theory of trickledown economics - the spending power of the rich benefiting the poor .
But while the super - rich have boomed , the earning power of the average and poor citizen has not nearly matched the performance of the elite .
In 2005 the top one per cent of earners in the US gained 14 per cent in income in real terms , while the rest of the country gained less than one per cent .
The situation is especially bad for the severely poor - those living at half the poverty level - whose numbers are at a 32 - year high .
The rich are getting richer but are not bringing everyone else with them .
' If you look at the impact of the last 20 years it seems pretty clear that trickledown just does not work , ' said Paul Buchheit , economics professor at Chicago 's Harold Washington College .
There are some signs of a change in attitude .
Recent huge Wall Street flotations such as the listing of private equity giants like Blackstone have created a push in Congress for taxes on the instant billionaires they have created .
Scandals of excess such as Enron and WorldCom and the trial of Conrad Black have been high - profile .
But few politicians , needing campaign cash from new millionaires , will get far preaching higher tax .
Calls for more equality tend to have come from men like Buffett and Gates whose fortunes are so enormous that a little extra tax would make no difference .
Bush has pushed to phase out taxes like the estate tax , which benefit only the rich .
' I do n't see it changing .
No matter what administration is in power , ' said Buchheit .
But many think it must change .
To a large degree , the debate over the booming lives of the super - rich is an argument about the American soul .
It is a country that has always worshipped wealth , where the creation of a fortune was seen as virtuous and a source of pride .
But now that huge wealth has started to squeeze the ' middle class ' out of existence , leaving the haves and have - nots in very separate worlds .
It is possible that political will may develop to address the problem or that the problem will correct itself .
The notorious end of the Gilded Age came in the panic of 1893 that sank America into depression .
Frank believes the signs of a coming storm are there .
' The trick is to spot when prosperity turns to excess , ' he said .
' When a large amount of people make a lot money very quickly it 's a sign you are near the top of the market . '
In a world of mega - yachts , private submarines and space hotels , that peak might be close at hand .
And it 's a long way down .
Billionaire 's row
· There are 7.5 million households in America worth up to $ 10 m .
A further two million are worth $ 10 m - $ 100 m and thousands are worth more than $ 100m .
· There is now a two - year waiting list for 200 ft yachts .
If put end to end , the boats on that list , which cost $ 50 m each , would be 15 miles long .
· Sebonack Golf Club in the Hamptons , Long Island , charges $ 650,000 for membership .
That does n't include the $ 12,000 annual dues , or tips for caddies .
· Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have a private Boeing 767 .
· John D. Rockefeller was America 's first billionaire .
Adjusted for inflation , he had $ 14bn - less than the net worth of each of Sam Walton 's five children today .
There were 13 US billionaires in 1985 .
Now there are more than 1,000 .
There are as many millionaires in North Carolina as in India .
· ' Affluent ' is Richistani for ' not really rich ' .
According to Frank , you need about $ 10 m to be considered entry - level rich .
Three Israeli computer engineers managed to hack Apple 's iPhone system , making it available for use through Cellcom and Orange , Ynet learnt Sunday .
The three were also able to lend the iPhone a Hebrew interface , thus breaking Apple 's restriction on using the the phone only through the AT&T company in United States .
Apple launched the iPhone in June , granting AT&T and a few European carriers an exclusive two - year distribution deal .
Ever since iPhone 's launch , many have tried to overcome Apple 's data protection .
Last Friday a group called iPhoneSIMfree.com said it had developed a piece of software that , when installed on an iPhone , allows the use of rival mobile services .
Dubbi , Ofir and Eli , the three Israeli hackers , bought their iPhones abroad , long before the thought of hacking its systems entered their minds .
" I knew the iPhone would be just a nice gadget and not an active phone and I did n't mind , " said Ofir .
Breaking into the system did n't cost anything , but did take a long time , until one night it just started working added Eli .
The three are not ready to share just how they got the iPhone to work , but did say practically anyone could do it .
Mordechai Vanunu , the man who revealed Israel 's nuclear secrets to the world , was yesterday jailed again by a Jerusalem court for talking to foreigners in breach of his parole conditions .
The sentence follows a conviction in April for breaching his conditions 14 times by making contact with foreigners and travelling to Bethlehem at Christmas .
Vanunu , a former technician at Israel 's Dimona nuclear plant , was first jailed in 1986 after he disclosed information about Israel 's nuclear programme to the Sunday Times .
He was kidnapped in Italy and flown to Israel by agents of the Mossad , Israel 's equivalent of MI6 , after being persuaded to travel from London to Rome in a " honey trap " .
He was jailed for 18 years and was released in 2004 but banned from leaving the country .
In his ruling yesterday , Judge Yoel Tzur wrote that it was " not easy " to sentence Vanunu to more prison time , " especially since the accused served a long prison sentence in the past , most of it in solitary confinement " .
But , Mr Tzur wrote , " it appears that the accused displayed total disdain " for the restrictions imposed on him .
Vanunu 's defence team said before the conviction that the terms of their client 's parole order were unreasonable and depended on the theory that Vanunu still retained top secret information from his work at Dimona more than 20 years ago .
Vanunu 's lawyer , Michael Sfard , said the prosecution had not suggested that anything that Vanunu had said in all of the conversations had in any way been damaging to the security of the state .
He said that Vanunu was being jailed for a purely formal breach of his release conditions .
Mr Sfard said that he had also told the court that sending Vanunu back to prison was unnecessarily harsh , considering the punishment he had already suffered .
" If they want to make him a martyr , then that is the way to do it , " he said .
Vanunu had found it very difficult to get work , said Mr Sfard , and felt very isolated .
Avigdor Feldman , another of Vanunu 's lawyers , told reporters after the hearing that the limitations placed on Vanunu " had no equal in any other democratic country " and called the sentence " unreasonable " .
After the verdict was announced , Vanunu said that his conviction proved that Israel was still ruled , in effect , by the British mandate , because the law under which he was convicted is from that era .
" Maybe I need to turn to the Queen or to Tony Blair in order to grant me justice , " he said .
Vanunu was given a six - month jail term and a six - month suspended sentence .

I am posting this admittedly long saga of my adventure with Homeland Security in the hope that you might find it interesting as background to our current American life .
I am a 62 year old retired police officer ( I retired 12 years ago as a Precinct Commander ) living with my wife in New York .
Last month , on the way to a family wedding in Toronto , we chose to cross the border just east of Buffalo and Niagara Falls .
There were extended lines of cars waiting to cross back into United States and I decided that on the return trip to use the Alexandria Bay route hoping for a shorter wait .
Returning to the United States on Monday , July 30 , at about 1:30 p.m. we approached the crossing and I was gratified to see only a few cars ahead of us .
After a couple of minutes we proceeded to the border guard in the booth and I gave him our Passports .
He asked us where we had been , what we had bought , and what we had done in Canada .
I told him we'd been to Toronto for a wedding and that I had purchased a hat while we were there .
At this point I was smiling and happy in anticipation of a nice lunch somewhere south of the border .
The border guard then told me that they ’d like to check the car and asked me to step out of the vehicle with the keys .
I of course complied .
As I exited my car I looked to the rear and was surprised to see four other border guards spread out in a semicircle and they did not seem in a particularly welcome home state of mind .
I was then told to back towards them , sidestep to the rear of the car , and place my hands behind me .
I was not particularly upset as I asked " Are you going to handcuff me ? "
They replied " Yes " and I now asked “ What is the problem ? "
One of the guards replied : " You have a common name " .
They then marched me handcuffed past the people in the other cars now waiting in line ( and also past my wife ) .
I informed them that I was retired after 29 years in the police department and had never been handcuffed before .
There was no response from the guards .
I again asked them what was the problem and again I got no response .
I have to say that at this stage my overwhelming emotion was not anger or embarrassment but curiosity .
This certainly was a new process for me and since I know I had n't done anything ( I lead a dull but honest life ) I knew that this process was going to end with us driving away .
Anyway , I was led into the building through an open office and placed in a holding cell .
Once again I informed them that I was a retired police officer and asked them what the problem was .
Again I was told that I have a common name .
After a couple of minutes one of the guards asked for my Social Security number .
About 10 minutes later the handcuffs were taken off and I was told to wait in an outer waiting room where my wife was sitting on a bench and various people ( mostly family groups ) were waiting or filling out forms at a counter staffed by other guards .
Knowing now that the exciting part of my adventure was over I reassured Judy and awaited further developments .
I asked politely if I can leave the room to go to the bathroom and I am informed politely that I may .
Again , my feeling was that a mistake had been made , I felt glad that it had been cleared up , and I was glad that these stalwart guards were ever vigilant .
I was not angry , merely curious as to what had happened .
A guard summoned me to the counter and told me that I was free to go .
I asked what the problem was .
He replied " I ca n’t tell you that " .
I now asked is this going to happen to me every time I cross the border .
He smilingly replied " I ca n’t tell you that " .
I then said " Do you mean to tell me that you just took me out of my car in handcuffs in front of my wife , placed me in a cell , and generally treated me as you would a criminal and you 're not going to give me an explanation for your actions ?.
He replies " No you 're not getting an explanation " .
He then , smilingly , asked me if I would like a comment card and I replied " No I do not want a comment card " .
At this point I am very upset but felt that getting argumentative was not going to be very productive and that fleeing these people as quickly and discreetly as possible was the best course of action .
Having been a police officer and police executive for 29 years I have handcuffed and observed other people being handcuffed numerous times .
On some occasions the subject is subsequently released from custody .
This usually occurred in a situation where the police had " probable cause " to arrest someone and when that probable cause proved unfounded the person was released .
One definition of probable cause is : " " a reasonable belief that a crime has been committed and that the person is linked to the crime with the same degree of certainty ” .
Another is : “ Probable cause is where known facts and circumstances , of a reasonably trustworthy nature , are sufficient to justify a man of reasonable caution or prudence in the belief that a crime has been or is being committed .
( Draper v. U.S. 1959 ) .
To my knowledge , in every instance the released person was given an explanation as to why he was detained in the first place and why he was being released .
It was tacitly understood that the released subject , in a free country , was entitled to an explanation as to why his liberty was temporarily removed by agents of his government .
Even though nobody likes being handcuffed , in most cases the police explanation was accepted and served to mollify the subject .
I repeat that nothing in this confrontation troubled me other than the arrogance shown by the border guards in not explaining their actions to me , a citizen of the United States .
With my experience in law enforcement I am fairly certain that my “ common name ” triggered an alarm ( I pity the poor guys named John Smith ) , which resulted in my detention .
No problem .
Computer errors happen every day .
All someone had to say was " Sorry , computer error " and I would 've been happy to fill out the comment card saying keep up the good work .
But the arrogance of deciding that I did not deserve even a perfunctory explanation galls me .
I have been trying to come up with an explanation of the incident and as a result what I now feel is not anger but fear for the safety of our country in the hands of Homeland Security .
Follow this hypothetical logic : I am either an honest , retired police officer Social Security recipient or I am a member of a terrorist cell ( attention any agent who is searching my e-mail without a warrant that this is hypothetical ! ) .
If I am the honest old guy then soothing me with an explanation is the right thing to do .
If however , I truly am that hypothetical terrorist person then Homeland Security has screwed up big - time .
I have seen blown criminal cases and trust me , taking me away from my car in handcuffs and detaining me totally blew any investigation into any terrorist activities that Homeland Security felt I was involved with .
Their actions insured that I was going to sound the alarm alerting all my nefarious co-conspirators that the game was up , the government is on to us , and to run for the hills .
As a matter of fact , even if they still suspected me of being a terrorist but did not have enough evidence to hold onto me the smart thing to do would have been to mollify me with the computer error explanation hoping for the slim chance that I was dumb enough not to sound the alarm to my fellow conspirators .
Another thought that has plagued me is why we are spending so much of our resources assuming that the terrorists were going to attempt to cross at legitimate pre-designated border checkpoints .
Between the border crossings in Buffalo , the crossing at the Thousand Islands , and the next closest eastern crossing there are hundreds of miles of virtually unguarded waterways and forestlands that offer ideal cover for crossing into the country illegally .
Since 9/11 they have literally been millions of illegal aliens crossing our borders .
Are many of them disguising themselves as Social Security recipients and using forged passports sneaking in through one of the few sites teeming with border guards ?
I guess I should be reassured that these elite guards are not blindly using any profiling on the people they select to handcuff .
This incident reinforced my belief that Homeland Security has had success mostly in the area where the terrorists were really dumb .
Such cases as the nitwit who tried to light his sneaker on fire on an airplane or the case where a couple of street stumble - bums were overheard making mumbling rants on how nice it would be to get training and funding from Al Qaeda .
Homeland Security drops a paid informant into the group who subsequently gets them organized enough to justify a conspiracy .
Their arrests are then publicized as another victory in the war against terrorism .
Many veteran police officers share the opinion that the most criminals that were arrested were either the stupid or the unlucky ones .
Why should a Homeland Security be any different ?
Several weeks after this incident a thought occurred to me that only reinforced my belief in the tenet " Never Attribute to Malice Something That Can Be More Easily Explained by Incompetence " .
Assuming that I am ( remember we 're " assuming " this only for the sake of argument ) a wanted terrorists , the reality is that I am not exactly hiding out in a cave in Afghanistan .
I receive a pension check from the state , a Social Security check from the US government , numerous credit card and utility bills , and tons of junk mail all sent to my legal address .
Not to mention the fact that the American Express ’s computer knows more about me than I care to think about .
I have to wonder that if Homeland Security wanted me badly enough to take me away in handcuffs why did n't they just come and get me ?
Is it possible that Homeland Security ’s state - of - the - art intelligence system is not interfaced with any of the many other government computers that contain up - to - date information on me ?
This all leaves me wondering more and more about my adventure at the Canadian border .
At the time my wife expressed the opinion that the only reason I was picked out was to prove that they were n't using any racial profiling .
Back then I thought that that reason was silly but now I wonder .
Another possibility is that every once in a while they run a training exercise using real subjects .
As you can , see since nobody explained to me what exactly happened I am just left to guess as to the possible causes of the incident .
The longer that I think about this the angrier I become .
I 'm also becoming more aware of how many rights we have given up to this Administration .
President Bush and his Department of Justice have argued that anyone , including a US citizen , can be arrested , placed in prison indefinitely , tortured and denied the right to know exactly with what he was being charged .
I wonder what stood between me and an all expense paid trip Abu Ghraib .
I know this sounds melodramatic but this is only because we have put blinders on regarding what this Bush administration is doing to this country under the guise of the war on terrorism .
Hundreds of thousands of our young people have died in previous wars to preserve the freedoms we have given away under the threat of terrorism .
Since the Department of Homeland Security has brought me into the game I will tell you what my personal fears are in regards to the next terrorist attack on the United States .
I believe the attack will again be against a major city , probably New York , and thanks to the current Administration ’s shortchanging urban areas in order to provide funds to safeguard petting zoos in the Midwest we will basically be as unprepared for the new attack as we were in 2001 .
My current leading paranoid nightmare scenario is that due to the Administrations ’ inability to safeguard out ports six years after 9/11 we are vulnerable to the possibility of an explosive laden ship sailing up the river to detonate near one or more of our urban centers .
After World War ll a 441 - foot - long Liberty ship laden with 9000 tons of ammonium nitrate exploded near Texas City destroying the port and killing hundreds .
Timothy McVeigh utilized a small truck loaded with the same commercially available fertilizer mixed with oil to wreak havoc in Oklahoma City .
Today there are thousands of much larger freighters , capable of carrying upwards of 30,000 tons of cargo , that are available for purchase or susceptible to hijacking by motivated groups .
We were unprepared in 2001 when terrorists launched suicide missions using groups of men to overwhelm airliner crews .
That was not brilliant planning on the part of the terrorists ; it was just a paradigm shift in that we were not prepared , at the practical , real world level , to deal with the threat of 4 or 5 men violently taking over a plane .
This scenario was not on the radar screens of most people at that time .
Today 's terrorists can still rely on the same source of funds ( mostly our friends in Saudi Arabia ) as they could prior to 9/11 .
This Administration has done little to stem the flow of monies to the terrorists .
Additionally , the Coast Guard is not anymore prepared now than they were six years ago to face a threat of a lightly armed freighter , loaded with explosives and manned by determined terrorists who are rude enough and inconsiderate enough not to check in at an authorized border crossing .
In response to the Bush administration 's misguided , mishandled and wrongheaded war on terrorism we 've given up precious freedoms that previous generations of American men and women died to protect .
The citing of real or concocted security threats have always been used by repressive regimes ( the Nazis used the Reichstag fire in the 30s and Stalin used just about every available excuse ) to eliminate basic citizen rights .
I doubt if anyone has used this method as effectively as the Bush team has in justification for secret arrests , detentions and torture .
I am awed by the enormity of this .
I could have been taken away from the Canadian border , flown in secret to an overseas location , and tortured without any recourse to a lawyer or judge .
No explanations needed .
The British in World War II lost 40,000 civilians to the German Blitz of London .
To my knowledge this did not cause the English to suspend all their personal freedoms or violate the Geneva Convention by torturing captured Luftwaffe pilots .
It is also worrying that there does n't seem to be a bigger hue and cry " from anyone in politics about these issues .
It seems that the Democratic Party would just as soon watch the Bush administration drag down Republican candidates in upcoming elections as they would take a stand for liberty .
Where are the patriots now that we really need them ?
Richard Rubin
What I 've set out to do in this post is to construct a World Import / Export Land Model ( extending the work of westexas and Khebab , the most recent of which can be found here ) followed by an investigation into one of the possible extreme situations above : the pre-peak rate of change in internal consumption of Export Land continues post - peak .
There are many people on either side of the Export Land Model issue : those who think the internal consumption of an exporter will continue to increase at the detriment of exports and those who think there will be enough pressure , be it economic or otherwise , to stifle internal consumption so that net exports do n't suffer .
I see no reason we wo n't see both of these situations occurring depending on the specific details of a given exporter .
The question , I think , is which effect will be dominant in the aggregate and to what degree ?
If , after the peak in world oil production , either effect is dominant in the extreme then " bad things " happen .
If internal consumption continues to grow , importers will have to drastically decrease consumption .
If exporters force their populace to decrease consumption for the sake of exports , my guess is this would initiate or fan unrest and increase instability in the exporting countries - possibly resulting in production loss ( i.e. Nigeria ) and hence a decline in net exports .
The Model :
This model is constructed using IEA all liquids data .
As Dave Cohen pointed out after I first posted this model , this excludes the international trade of finished petroleum products .
The best model would certainly include this trade , however , I have n't found the required data anywhere .
While I do n't have the numbers in front of me , what I think we would see is the international trade in finished products is much smaller than the international oil trade .
The addition of that trade in the model below would then result in a perturbation of the results without changing them drastically ( Hand - waving over ) .
Import Land is defined as the OECD countries minus Canada , Mexico , and Norway plus Asian countries .
Export Land is defined as the Non-OECD countries plus Canada , Mexico , and Norway minus Asian countries .
" Asian countries " is China plus the countries that are contained within the IEA 's " Other Asia " category .
The data for each country or group of countries is from the IEA all liquids data .

Only piece of data not in the IEA PDFs .
Data was taken from the most recent PDF ( of the four ) it was present in .
Net exports for Export Land is calculated as production minus consumption .
Net imports for Import Land is calculated as consumption minus production plus total change in stocks .
If the " total stock change " is not added to the net imports calculation , then net exports and net imports between the two lands do n't match as they should ( See Figures 2 and 3 ) .
The aggreement shown in Figure 2 justifies associating the entire IEA " Total Stock Change " category with Import Land .
Figure 1 shows the World Import / Export Model for 2002 through 2007 .

Figure 3 : IEA Total Stock Change and Misc. Source : IEA ( see above for specifics ) .
Observations :
Export Land and Import Land exhibit a substantial trade imbalance with regards to oil : Export Land produces nearly 3 x the amount of oil it consumes , while Import Land consumes nearly 4 x the amount it produces .
Furthermore , it appears Import Land has peaked and is exhibiting a gradual decline in production .
Export Land shows a production plateau over the last few years , but it is far from certain it 's peaking .
Both lands show increasing consumption .
So , what can be concluded from the data of the last six years ?
The Export Land plot in Figure 1 shows that although production has stagnated , internal consumption increased just as it has been .
The result is a decline in exports , consistent with the Westexas interpretation of the Export Land Model .
However , can we say anything as to why production has stagnated ?
If Figure 3 can be taken to be Import Land 's input into oil stocks ( and at least through 2006 it definitely looks that way from Figure 2 ) then it appears sometime around 2003 Import Land started building stocks and then Export land production began to level off .
This is consistent with Export Land voluntarily slowing production because Import Land was well supplied .
That said , the data from 2007 is showing a net draw from Import Land stocks - a condition that can't continue for long without a need for Export Land to increase production .
A few possible Import / Export Land Model scenarios :
The following does not represent an attempt to accurately predict oil production .
Rather , I 'm trying to explore the Export Land Model by extrapolating real data .
In all of the following plots it is assumed Export Land peaks in 2007 and then sees an exponential decline in its production .
The two cases assume a 2 % and 5 % decline rate for Export Land respectively .
In all cases , it is assumed Import Land sees a 2 % decline rate in production .
Given the real data showing a gradual decline , a rate more than 2 % seems unwarranted .
As a control , each decline rate scenario was projected both by assuming the internal consumption of Export Land continues to grow at the same rate it has been and also for constant internal consumption .
The extrapolated curves were calculated in the following way .
The internal consumption of Export Land was estimated with a linear fit to the data and then as a constant .
Export Land exports were calculated as production minus consumption and were taken to be equal to the imports of Import Land .
Import land 's consumption was then calculated as production plus imports .
The results are below in Figures 4 through 7 .
In all cases Import Land 's consumption shows a greater rate of decline than the rate exhibited by the production in Export Land as it is squeezed by Export Land 's declining production , constant to increasing internal consumption , and Import Land 's own decline in production .
Figure 4 : Import / Export Land All Liquids Oil Balance Scenario : 2 % decline , increasing internal consumption .
Source : IEA , EIA ( see above for specifics ) .
Figure 5 : Import / Export Land All Liquids Oil Balance Scenario : 2 % decline , constant internal consumption .
Source : IEA , EIA ( see above for specifics ) .
I think most people would agree the decline rates assumed in Figures 4 and 5 are the most realistic .
However , even with such decline rates Import Land 's consumption sees quite a hit .
With an overall decline rate of 2 % in production and with increasing internal consumption in Export Land , Import Land 's consumption declines at 5 % and by 2020 is half its 2007 value .
Figure 5 shows what happens if Export Land 's internal consumption maintains its present value : roughly a 3 % decline in Import Land 's consumption ensues with a 33 % decline by 2020 .
So , for internal consumption of Export Land ranging from flat to a maximum growth rate of that shown in the past six years and with an overall production decline rate of 2 % we see a decline in Import Land 's consumption ranging from 3 % to 5 % with a total decline in 2020 from 33 % to 50 % .
I have a hard time buying that exporters in the aggregate will get away with forcing their populations to actually decrease their overall consumption so that importers can continue something akin to business as usual .
I therefore view the above results as a reasonable range of outcomes we might see in a bit more than a decade post - peak .
Figure 6 : Import / Export Land All Liquids Oil Balance Scenario :
5 % decline in Export Land Production , 2 % decline in Import Land Production , increasing internal consumption .
Source : IEA , EIA ( see above for specifics ) .
Figure 7 : Import / Export Land All Liquids Oil Balance Scenario :
5 % decline in Export Land Production , 2 % decline in Import Land Production , constant internal consumption .
Source : IEA , EIA ( see above for specifics ) .
A 5 % decline rate seen in Export Land production with increasing internal consumption translates into about a 10 % decline rate in Import Land 's consumption .
Consumption would drop 75 % by 2020 .
Assuming a constant internal consumption translates into a 7 % decline rate for Import Land consumption which would be a drop of about 60 % by 2020 .
So , for internal consumption of Export Land ranging from flat to a maximum growth rate of that shown in the past six years with Export Land production declining at 5 % and Import Land production declining at 2 % we see a decline rate for Import Land 's consumption ranging from 7 % to 10 % with a total decline in 2020 from 60 % to 75 % .
I think it 's probable that we would see less than optimal events occurring should a 5 % decline rate be attained and the model presented would end up being wildly incorrect by 2020 .
US Politics Freedom Is About Authority By Ryan McGreal
Published May 11 , 2007
The normalization of fascism in the US continues apace .
The following quote is from a speech by Rudolph Giuliani , the leading nominee to be the Republican candidate for president in 2008 , on crime and law enforcement in cities :
Freedom is about authority .
Freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do .
Oh , by the way : Giuliani said these words on March 20 , 1994 , when he was still the Mayor of New York .
Before the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers in New York , Giuliani was widely reviled as a bully whose personal dealings were shady and whose policies caused at least as much harm as good .
After 9/11 , Giuliani was transformed into " America 's Mayor " , the Strong Leader who could protect you in a crisis .
He managed to adopt his 9/11 mantle despite his lousy track record even in the crisis he used to define his heroism .
Giuliani's decision to locate the NYC emergency command centre in the World Trade Centre against the recommendations of security advisors exacerbated the chaos when the WTC , already a known al - Qaeda target , was hit and the emergency response chain of command was knocked out .
Further , because he had refused to order compatible communications systems for the Police Department ( NYPD ) and Fire Department ( FDNY ) , the two groups could not communicate during the rescue efforts , and the fire fighters never heard the order to evacuate .
Giuliani insists against all evidence that the fire fighters heard the order but failed to comply .
343 fire fighters died when the buildings collapsed .
Giuliani earned further enmity from the fire fighters when he scaled back the search for bodies in the wreckage on November 2 , 2001 , opting instead for a cheaper " sccop- and - dump " process - once tens of millions of dollars in gold and other assets from the Bank of Nova Scotia had been recovered .
Quite frankly , Giuliani 's track record as both an authoritarian and a capricious , easily offended egomaniac should give Americans , and particularly Republicans , serious pause .
For a country founded on the principle of liberty , the US seems particularly willing to sacrifice freedom for the illusion of security , even to the extent that an overt authoritarian like Giuiliani is a serious contender for the nation 's highest public office .

Microsoft , based in Redmond , Wash. , said it would take a charge of $ 1.05 billion to $ 1.15 billion against earnings in the quarter ended June 30 .
Consumers know they have a problem if three red flashing lights appear on the console .
Gamers on online forums have been referring to the event as “ the Red Ring of Death ” because the machine then shuts down .
The company declined to explain the nature of the failure , but said that it was not caused by a single problem in the console , which it said contained 1,700 components and 500 million transistors .
The company also said there were no health or safety concerns involved .
The problem began to appear over the last three to four months , Mr. Bach said , after “ significant usage ” of the consoles .
He said the company has taken steps to correct the problem in new devices .
Microsoft said it would extend the warranty of the game console to three years to customers worldwide .
Previously , products sold in the United States were covered by a one - year warranty , while Xbox 360 units sold in Europe had a two - year warranty .
In addition , customers who have had their consoles repaired because of the “ three flashing lights ” problem will be reimbursed for the cost of the repairs .
Microsoft has succeeded in establishing the Xbox brand against the better known Sony PlayStation and other game machines .
The Xbox and its successor , the Xbox 360 , was the software maker ’s first major foray into hardware .
Although sales are small relative to the rest of Microsoft ’s revenue , the Xbox has been an important venture for the company and was viewed by many analysts as Microsoft ’s attempt to compete with the likes of Sony and Apple for control of electronics and entertainment within homes .
Brave new World
We 've recently taken the plunge and installed an alternative operating system onto my machine .
It 's not something to be carried out lightly , but I 've personally found the effort involved to be most enlightening .
Above all , it 's convinced me that some things are better left well alone .
My initial impressions were unfavorable .
I expected the installation to be tricky after realizing I 'd need to re-partition the hard drive to make room .
The new OS demands it 's own partition on which to reside - it 's unable to exist on any other than it 's own file system type .
Fortunately , here at Computer Solutions , we know what we 're doing .
The ordinary user would be likely to run into problems from the start .
If the distributor had included some sort of repartitioning tool with the startup code , this would be easily solved .
After the repartition we created a blank 500 Mb hole for the OS to go on the test 2.1 Gb hard drive .
We could n't get the installation CD to boot , despite being detected correctly by the BIOS , so had to use a boot floppy .
Thankfully , all went well after that .
We told the computer what size installation we wanted , our time zone , and a few other sundry tidbits of information .
Most our our hardware was detected automatically , even the network card , but the graphics card gave it a few problems , and we chose to default to standard SVGA while a patch was downloaded off the 'net .
A few reboots and the patch applied , and we were looking at a new Operating System .
In all , the installation had taken 45 minutes , which is good going for a complete system change .
We tested the system for a while , and it was only when we rebooted back into the real world that we hit one big problem .
The **** OS had wiped our existing boot manager , replacing it with it 's own boot code .
We swore , we kicked it , we reached for our emergency boot disk .
Saved by our own forethought and the previous OS , the newbie lost valuable points .
The boot manager was told about the new kid on the block , and another reboot brought back the smiles .
When inside , you are presented with an uncluttered interface .
This particular distribution of the OS automatically boots into a GUI , and requests a user name and password .
We 'd set these up early on , and ( apparently ) entered without hitch .
Except our network was nowhere to be seen .
We 'd given the system a name ( Medusae - all our computers are named after mythological creatures ) , we 'd given it an IP address and netmask , and set up IPX networking so we could access our Netware fileserver .
The network card was happy .
The system had thrown us another curve .
We changed things .
We switched the network card .
We altered the frame rate in IPX .
We bought fresh coffee .
To this day , we 're not sure what happened , but after numerous reboots , the network came to life .
Consistency is not this system 's strong point .
We 'd been told that one of the OS 's perceived strengths is the sheer volume of available for it .
This is good news , because we found our distribution to be pitifully lacking in the software department .
Apparently , image manipulation tools , databases , programming tools , games and even word processors can be obtained .
Much of it can been downloaded for no cost from the Internet - if you know where to look , that is - or available commercially on CDs .
We recommend the latter option .
If a company has taken time to produce a product , they deserve payment for it .
Most commercial products have free demonstration versions , which are an excellent way to test the water without parting with hard earned cash .
Most installations routines are identical , and several programs use a method of installation that makes uninstallation a relatively painless process .
We found most software we tested to be adequate for our needs , even good in parts .
If this is the shape of things to come , our existing OS had better watch out .
Soon this newbie may have software to equal it .
The distributor claims it 's the most stable version available , and that gives us cause for concern .
Prior to the installation , we lurked around a few newsgroups , soaking up tips and potential pitfalls , to good effect .
It certainly helped as we charted this ( to us ) uncharted territory .
We found many users happy with the system , but after 2 week 's intensive use , we 've grown to wonder what they do on it .
This system was tested heavily .
We ran a graphic editor , a word processor and Quake at the same time .
Crash .
We ran Quake and Quake II simultaneously .
Crash .
Netscape Communicator would go down on it's own .
The fact that it is n't just one program causing the problems leads me to suspect that it 's the underlying OS at fault .
Perhaps the kernel needs recompiling ?
Your thoughts on this would be most welcome .
During our brief test , we ran into problems with memory management , the network , the print queue , a disappearing CD - ROM drive , and even faults appearing on the hard drive .
We found security to be almost non-existent .
Possibly the problems were caused by our ignorance , possibly not .
In almost all of the cases , we had to trust out own knowledge or reach for the Internet .
Support from our particular distributor is known to be weak .
We recognize that some of the difficulties we had , namely lack of support and lack of initial software , could be solved by choosing a different distributor .
That , in itself , is a problem .
We can't find one .
Until these problems are ironed out , this Operating System is n't really appropriate for life in the real world .
Windows 95 is n't yet ready for the mainstream .
Until it is , stick to Linux .

Click to viewMost people know Launchy as a simple and lightning - fast application launcher for Windows , but it 's actually capable of much more than that .
Using Launchy , you can append text to files , schedule appointments , add to your to - do list , set reminders , and more — it just takes a little setting up .
Today I 'll detail how I use Launchy for more than just app launching .
Advertisement
The real brains behind most of what I describe below involves using Windows batch files in conjunction with cURL ( an open source command line tool for transferring data with URL syntax ) and Twitter .*
So if you do n't already have it , go download cURL ( find the Windows section ) , then extract the curl .
exe file to C: \WINDOWS .
Advertisement
Now download this zipped folder .
Inside you 'll see several batch files I 've prepared for you .
Basically , we 're going to use these batch files like plugins by running terminal commands with Launchy .
First , extract them to
C: \Program Files \Launchy \Utilities .
Then invoke Launchy , right - click the Launchy command window and select Directories .
You should already have the Utilities \ folder included in your list of Directories to scan , but you need to add the .bat filetype to the files you want Launchy to scan for in that folder , so under Directory Information ->
File Types , type in .bat and click Add ( see screenshot above ) .
Now we 'll walk through how to set up the Launchy batch tools one - by - one below .
Remember the Milk with Launchy

Open the rtm.bat file in your favorite text editor .
On the third line , replace username : password with your Twitter username and password and save the file .*
Now set up RTM to work with Twitter here
Advertisement
Any time you want to add an item to RTM on - the - fly , just invoke Launchy , type rtm , hit Tab , and then type the task you want to add .
See the command list here for how you can get specific with RTM syntax .
Post to Google Calendar with Launchy
Advertisement
We 're going to follow most of the same steps as we did with the rtm.bat file :
Open the gcal .
bat file in your favorite text editor .
On the third line , replace username : password with your Twitter username and password and save the file . *
Now set up Gcal to work with Twitter with Twittercal
Advertisement
You can add anything to Google Calendar using Launchy by typing gcal , hitting Tab , and typing in your event using the natural language of Gcal 's quick add ( e.g. , lunch 1 pm tomorrow at Sally's ) .
Set SMS reminders with Launchy

Again we 're using a batch file and Twitter .
This time it 's a handy Twitter app called timer that lets you set SMS reminders .
To set it up :
Get and set reminders via Twitter Twitter can now send you reminders at intervals you request .
Just direct message the timer user on Read more

Open the timer .
bat file in your favorite text editor .
On the third line , replace username : password with your Twitter username and password and save the file . *
Now just add timer as a friend on Twitter and you 're ready to go .
Any time you want to set up a timed SMS reminder for yourself , just invoke Launchy , type timer , hit Tab , and enter something like ' call mom in 45 . '
In 45 minutes you 'll get an SMS reminder on the phone you 've set up with Twitter .

Append text to files with Launchy
Advertisement
Being able to append text to a plain text file on - the - fly with Quicksilver gets me through my day , and now you can do the same with Launchy .
Appending text to a file does n't require Twitter ( ahh .... ) , but it does use another batch file .
This method comes from the Making the Ordinary weblog , and I 've included it in the download above .
To use it , you need to have a place you want to capture a list in text .
The default in the add.bat file is C:\todo\todo.txt .
If you want to keep your list elsewhere , just change the first ( and only ) line of the batch file to match the path to your file .
Whenever you want to add a line to your text file , type add , hit Tab , and type your to - do .
When you hit enter , the text will automagically be appended to your todo .
txt file .

Twit with Launchy
Finally , if you 're actually a Twitter user , the twit .
bat file should take care of you .
Just open it up and change the username and password to match your own like above .
Then you can update your Twitter status by invoking Launchy , typing twit , entering your status , and hitting Enter .

More uses for cURL and batch ?
There 's a lot of room for improvement for how these batch files work ( for example , your Twitter password is now being kept in an unencrypted batch file ) , but there 's also a lot of room for expanding on this idea with other web applications beyond Twitter that you could interact with using the command line and cURL via Launchy .
I 'd love to hear your ideas and suggestions in the comments .

* That 's right , many of these " plug- ins " use Twitter .
If you do n't already have a Twitter account , you 'll need to grab one now .
Twitter is a beloved social app to some and a hated time waster to others , but it 's neither here .
It 's merely a means to an end .
The benefit to setting up Launchy to work with Twitter in this way is that any of these Twitter apps are also accessible on - the - go from your cell phone , providing you with a universal access point for a local and mobile command line of sorts .

Over a year ago , I released a Rails 1.0 plugin that added support for content negotiation .
Conceptually it was simple – map the HTTP Accept header to template extensions .
For example , assume you have an article controller .
A client may wish to GET the articles in various formats , including HTML , XHTML , RSS or ATOM .
Thus your views would be :
article.rhtml
article.ratom
article.rjson
The extension is based on the mime type – not the template type .
So article.ratom may be an ERB template , a HAML template , a builder template , etc .
When the plugin compiles the template it is smart enough to tell what type of template it is , and acts accordingly .
We ’ve found this solution works extremely well for MapBuzz , so we ’re releasing it as a Rails 1.2 plugin to encourage discussion in the community and hopefully influence its direction .
And if you need to support XHTML with your Rails application you ’re in luck – the plugin has XHTML support baked in as explained below .
Rails Offers an Unsatisfying Solution
Now you might be thinking to yourself that Rails 1.1 solved this issue .
Rails 1.1 did indeed add support for content negotiation by honoring the HTTP Accept header , adding a new format parameter and implementing a new controller method respond_to .
However , I think the implementation leaves much to be desired .
Let ’s take a look at an example :
class ArticleController < ApplicationController def get @articles = Article . find ( : all ) respond_to do | wants | wants .
html wants .
xml { render : xml => @articles .
to_xml } end end end
The first problem is the implementation ’s verbosity .
You have to add the same boilerplate code for each method in each controller that supports multiple mime types ( for MapBuzz that is almost all of them ) .
For opinionated software , this seems like a strange oversight and I ’ve always found it jarring .
The second problem is that the implementation mixes view logic into a controller .
Why should a controller have knowledge , or care , about how its results are rendered ?
I ca n’t see any good reason for it .
On the bright side , it looks like Rails 2 will change this implementation a bit .
I ’ve recently noticed some blog posts that mention the preferred template naming convention has changed to include both a mime type and template type , thus something like this – article.html.erb .
Hopefully that means article.
atom.erb , article.rss.xml , etc. will also work but I have n’t checked .
Will these changes make our plugin obsolete ?
I certainly hope so , but I have n’t had the time to dig into Rails edge to see for sure .
Why Content Negotiation ?
Before diving into the plugin , you may wondering why bother – is n’t it generally accepted that content negotiation is a failure ?
In the “ old ” Web I ’d agree – and much of the blame has to fall on IE 6 for its use of this HTTP Accept header :
Accept : */*
Hmm , thanks Microsoft , very helpful .
But in the world of Ajax , things have changed .
XmlHttpRequest lets you set HTTP headers , so a client can specify exactly what type of response it wants .
Sometimes
Atom is the best choice , sometimes JSON is and other times good old HTML fits the bill .
Whichever you choose , when you create an Ajax - based website you control how the HTTP Accept will be set by the client , and therefore content negotiation all of a sudden becomes interesting again .
Using The Plugin
The plugin makes the simple case easy – rename your views based on their mime type :
article.rhtml
article.ratom
article.rjson
Partials also work the same way :
_article.rhtml
_article.ratom
_article.rjson
And if you are using a layout , then the same drill applies :
layout.rhtml
layout.ratom
layout.rjson
The plugin also supports mixing mime types .
For example , you may wish to return an XHTML document that includes embedded SVG .
To do that , in your enclosing .rhtmltemplate you would include this line :
< %= render ( : file => ' article/get.rsvg ' ) %>
By specifying the extension , .rsvg , you ’ve alerted the plugin that you want to change the current mime type to SVG .
Any templates or partials that get.rsvg in turn calls will be assumed to have an .rsvg extension unless you specifically override it again .
Once get.rsvg is finished rendering , the current mime type will revert back to XHTML .
The Plugins Inner Workings
Now let ’s look at how the plugin works – it uses this algorithm to render the first template in a given request :
Get a list of potential mime types :
If the request includes a format parameter use it .
Otherwise , create an array of mime types based on the HTTP accept header .
Then modify the
array by : Prefer XHTML over HTML ( see below ) .
If the client supports Atom , then make sure both the Atom Feed format and Atom Entry format are included in the list .
If the Accepts header includes */* ( or various derivatives seen out in the wild such as *.* , * , etc. ) , replace it with HTML , ATOM and JSON .
array by : Loop over the list of mime types and search for a template with the correct extension .
For example , if the list of mime types is HTML , ATOM and JSON , then the plugin will look for a template with an extension of .rhtml , .ratom or .rjson in that order .
If a template is found , save the current mime type onto a stack .
If a template is not found , raise an exception .
Once a mime type is chosen , the plugin will continue to use it for all other templates including partials and layouts .
Thus if current mime type is ATOM and the current template calls a partial called called author , the plugin will look for a template named _author.ratom .
If it ca n’t find it , it will raise an exception .
There are two special cases .
The first one was explained above , you can switch mime types in mid-stream if needed .
The second one is when an exception is raised while rendering a template .
In that case , the plugin will “ forget ” the current format and then look for an appropriate template ( thus going back to the long algorithm above ) .
XHTML Support
Another benefit of the plugin is that it adds full XHTML support to Rails .
I ’ve previously blogged about Rail ’s utter disregard for XHTML , but for MapBuzz its crucial because we have to embed SVG in XHTML files .
So if a browser says it supports XHTML via the Accept header ( pretty much any browser other than IE ) , then the plugin will automatically select XHTML over HTML and set the content type to application / xhtml+xml .
However , there are a couple of twists .
First , XTHML is mapped to templates with an extension of either .rxhtml or .rhtml extension .
The reason for reusing .rthml is to avoid duplicating them and violating the DRY principle .
So make sure that your .rhtml files are valid XHTML .
If they are not , you ’ll see parse errors in Firefox / Opera / Safari , since they will be applying XHTML ’s strict syntax rules .
Second , you have to make sure to specify the correct doctype .
The way we solve this is by having our layout . rhtml file call a partial called doctype .
There are two versions of this partial – _doctype.rhtml and _doctype.rxhtml .
_doctype.rhtml looks like this :
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD
HTML 4.01//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd " > < html >
While _doctype.rxhtml looks like this :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd " >
< html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xmlns:xhtml= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xml:lang= " en " >
The plugin will pick the correct one based on the current mime type .
Finally , the plugin overrides ActionView : : Helpers : : TagHelpers so that it correctly ends empty tags with /> , as required by XHTML / XML syntax rules , if the current content type is XHTML .
Wrapping Up
As the Rails core team is fond of saying , Rails is opinionated software .
In my opinion , mapping mime types to template extensions is a big win :
It eliminates boring , boilerplate code
It more cleanly separates controllers from views
It makes it easy to add a new format to a controller action ( just drop in a new template )
But of course the real test is how well does the plugin work in a production website ?
From our experience it works great – so give it a try and let us know what you think !

Dr. Ketchum and his team were looking , primarily , for non-lethal incapacitating agents , and he was central to many of the experiments with these compounds that took place during that time .
Now , Dr. Ketchum has released his fascinating self - published memoir , Chemical Warfare : Secrets Almost Forgotten , primarily detailing his times at Edgewood .
The book boasts charts , graphs and experimental reports — a veritable goldmine of information for those who are interested in psychedelics , deliriants , or chemical warfare .
It 's also a funny , observant , and reflective personal memoir , casting a light not only on Ketchum and his work , but on a decade that saw 60s counterculture and the military share an oddly intersecting obsession with mind - altering drugs .
Dr. Ketchum himself has remained intrigued by these chemicals , as reflected in his ongoing friendship with Dr. Alexander ( Sasha ) Shulgin , who wrote a foreword for this book .
I recently interviewed him for The RU Sirius Show .
Steve Robles joined me .
Tell us about the research you did at Edgewood Arsenal with various substances as weapons .
What was the political environment ?
It was during the Cold War and there was great concern about what the Soviet Union might be plotting .
It was known that they were investing a lot of money in chemical warfare research — about ten times as much as we were .
And at the same time , there was an interest in the U.S. in developing weapons that might be called more " humane " as opposed to " conventional " weapons .
In 1955 , Congress was entertained by Major General Creasy , who described what LSD could do .
At the time , that was the latest drug of interest .
And as he described it to Congress , they became very enthusiastic , and voted in favor of doing research into LSD as a possible incapacitating agent that would be life - sparing .
Congress passed a resolution with only one vote against it , which is perhaps indicative of the philosophy of the times .
So money was allocated to build a project at Edgewood Arsenal , the army chemical center .
And over the next few years the budgeting increased , supported by John F. Kennedy , among others .
I was given the opportunity to go there after my residency in psychiatry in 1961 , and I thought it would be interesting .
I ended up spending about ten years there .
When I arrived , the program was just in its nascency .
There had been some work done by others there with LSD , but they had never had a psychiatrist .
And they 'd run into a few problems that made them think they ought to have one .
So I was given pretty much a free hand over the next few years to develop a program that would be safe and also provide the information that was being sought , not only about LSD but about drugs like BZ , and others .
So you actually ended up having a long strange trip of your own .
You had some very interesting experiences with it .
I enjoyed it very much .
Unfortunately at the time , classification of that research was so great that very little of the information we found was leaked out to the public or allowed to be spread among the public .
And as is the custom in the army — or was the custom — classified papers usually remained classified for 12 years before they'd be downgraded and made available .
By that time , most people had gone separate ways .
The program itself had been pretty much terminated .
No one really wrote the history of that decade .
I thought , later , that was a serious omission .
And that 's what led me to write this book .
Did you find any evidence that the Soviets might have taken this tack in their own chemical warfare research ?
There was information indicating that , around 1960 , the Soviet Union was importing vast quantities of contaminated rye from the satellite countries .
This was interpreted as being indicative of their interest in producing LSD , since there 's not much use for contaminated rye except that it contains ergot , which is a form of contamination [ ed : ergot is used to prepare lysergic acid , the raw material for LSD ] .
That made us think maybe they were having a big LSD development program of their own .
So there was a different kind of space race going on at the same time .
That 's right .
Inner space .
The meat of this book , and the fun part , is descriptions of people undergoing the experiments .
I wonder if any moments in particular pop into your head showing the way that human beings behave under the influence .
I watched a number of people — actually , more than a hundred — going through the experience of having BZ , which is a long - acting atropine type compound .
It produces delirium if given in a sufficient dose .
Half - a- milligram is sufficient in the case of BZ , as compared with about 10 milligrams of atropine .
To describe the tripping in detail would take some time .
In the book , I 've documented an entire BZ trip over a hundred - hour period , including everything that was said and done .
You had a man watching an entire football game on his fingernail or something ?
It was a tiny baseball game on the padded floor .
The hallucinations were " real " hallucinations .
I 'd like to make a distinction between BZ hallucinations and LSD so - called hallucinations , which are really not hallucinations — they 're more illusions .
People generally know that they 're not real , but produced by the drug .
Whereas with BZ , the individual becomes delirious , and in that state is unable to distinguish fantasy from reality , and may see , for instance , strips of bacon along the edge of the floor .
Belladonna would probably be the most common deliriant among drug experimenters .
Right .
Loco weed .
Belladonna , in the form of Asmador , for example , was used for asthma and contains atropine .
People were getting high on this in the 60s .
My brother described one young man trying to crawl across a street in New York City and grabbing onto the pants leg of a police officer .
People do n't know what they 're doing when they 're under the influence .
They mistake people for objects and objects for people .
They 'll salute the water fountain or bump into a nurse and say , " Excuse me , sir , " and the like .
Were you guys doing a lot of chuckling while this was going on ?
You 're trying to maintain a certain degree of decorum , but ... Yes .
I would tell the technicians that it was n't nice to laugh at these things , even though the subject probably would n't remember it later .
It was sometimes hard to suppress it .
Like when one individual asked another , in the same padded room , if he could have a cigarette .
And then , when the other individual held out an empty hand that looked like it was holding a pack , he said , " Oh , I do n't want to take your last one . "
So it was fully " out there " on a fantastic scale .
I had a friend who took belladonna at a rock concert .
And about halfway into it , he thought he was back in his own room and that the music on the radio really sucked , and he was going to turn it off .
That basically involved twisting this girl 's kneecap until he got kicked out .
Fortunately , it was just the kneecap .
One young man tried to straighten out my arm , as if it were a pipe of some sort !
He tugged on it , and pulled it , and did n't seem at all aware that I might be discomforted by that .
So this book , which is about a very serious subject , is actually quite an amusing read .
Yeah , I tried to keep it from being too heavy , and included a number of anecdotes about people who were n't delirious that were equally funny .
Some of the inter - office activity was amusing too .
Describe what happens when soldiers try to deal with mock - up battle conditions under the influence of BZ .
Well of course , commanders wanted to know what would happen if this stuff were ever used in the field .
So at first we set up an indoor type of situation , a sort of simulated command post with four soldiers in it .
One of them was given a full dose of BZ while the others were given either small doses or none at all , in order to have some possibility of maintaining order .
So this one individual would continually go to the door and try to get out .
He 'd turn around and say , " I 'll see you later , " but it was locked , and he finally concluded that he was trapped .
When the cameras , which were behind these sliding plywood doors , were opened , he came over to one and looked into it as if it were the eye of a Martian .
And then he tried to climb out through the medicine cabinet .
Then he went over to the water bag and yelled , " Hey , this broad just committed suicide . "
It took quite a bit of help from his teammates to keep him from hurting himself .
But fortunately , nothing serious happened .
You write that nobody was really injured or permanently damaged by these experiments , and you make a distinction between the work that you did at the arsenal and work done by the Central Intelligence Agency .
I tried to dissect out the work done by the army from the work done by the CIA .
The CIA , of course , was the first to undertake studies of LSD .
They did it without any real scientific structure ; and they took liberties that they should n't have taken , giving it covertly to American citizens and the like .
This was the MK - ULTRA program .
Unfortunately , Edgewood Arsenal acquired a reputation for being somehow involved in the MK - ULTRA program — being somehow underwritten by the CIA .
And this was not true .
There were a couple of individuals who had a secret connection to the CIA , but the program itself was transparent , at least within the military , and there was none of the hijinx that the CIA carried out in San Francisco and other places .
[ ed : they gave LSD to customers in a house used for prostitution and watched them through a two - way mirror . ]
You recently gave testimony about the CIA program .
Tell us a little bit about that .
I testified on behalf of Wayne Ritchie , a deputy U.S. Marshall who had been an ideal officer — four years in the Marines , a year at Alcatraz as a guard .
He was regarded as perfectly stable — normal .
After a Christmas party , where people from the CIA office next door were present , he came back to his office and began to believe that everyone was against him .
And then he went out on the street and walked home for the first time without his car , and was convinced that his girlfriend was against him ; and the bartender was against him .
So he decided to hold up a bar and get enough money for his girlfriend to fly to New York , and then he'd be arrested and they would kick him out of the US Marshal Service and everyone would be happy .
So this is what he did , and this is what happened .
And when he came to and realized what he'd done , he felt terrible .
He wanted to commit suicide .
He asked for a bullet to save the state some money , and he submitted a letter of resignation .
From that point on , he was regarded as a pariah and he spent the rest of his life believing he had committed a serious crime for which he'd never be forgiven .
Then Sidney Gottleib — who was the head of the MK - ULTRA program — died .
And in his obituary , it mentioned that he was supervising the administration of LSD to unwitting American citizens .
[ ed :
The CIA also dosed unsuspecting attendants at office parties , as documented in Acid Dreams and elsewhere . ]
And so the light went on in his head at that point , and Wayne realized , or believed , that that 's probably what happened to him .
So a case was eventually brought to court , and I was asked to testify on behalf of Wayne .
I spent two - and - a - half days on the witness stand , mostly answering questions from CIA lawyers .
Ultimately the outcome was not favorable , unfortunately .
The judge did n't feel convinced , and neither did the Appeals court .
The judge said , in effect , " If you can explain this man 's criminal behavior with LSD , then I suppose you could blame anyone 's criminal behavior on LSD . "
And this really was n't very logical and did n't fit the facts , but that 's how it ended up .
It was a rather unhappy ending to an unhappy story .
A number of your volunteers in the LSD experiments expressed feelings of having had a profound experience .
More frequently than not , they expressed a sort of regret in coming down and having the experience end .
Yes .
We were primarily interested in measuring performance on a systematic basis .
But , of course , clinically it was pretty hard to ignore the differences in the responses to LSD that we observed .
Some individuals would become very frolicsome and laugh a great deal .
Some would become depressed and withdrawn ; some became paranoid .
Seeing the spectrum of responses in otherwise normal young men was quite interesting .
One individual in particular , I believe , actually had a therapeutic experience .
He was in a group of four , and we held a televised discussion after the test , and he admitted finally under pressure from his buddies that he had had some unacceptable erotic thoughts about the nurses that he was reluctant to reveal .
And they told him that was all right , there 's nothing wrong with that .
And when he went back to his unit , I heard indirectly that his personality was different .
He became more sociable and outgoing .
I have to give LSD some of the credit in that case .
Also a frequent response from some of the volunteers was to find the tests just silly and absurd and to just laugh at the things they were asked to do .
Yeah , under LSD , they perceived the absurdity of being asked to solve as many arithmetic problems as they could in three minutes .
Sometimes they refused to do it all together .
But in other cases they did their best , but could n't do as well as they did before the drug .
I took it once and I had precisely the same difficulty solving arithmetic problems , but I did n't have any of the wonderful visions and fantasies .
I guess because I was thinking of the psychopharmacology of the LSD going through my raphe nucleus and so forth .
You took 80 micrograms .
It 's a little bit shy of a trip .
Yeah .
But it was chemically pure , U.S. Army - grade , 99.9 percent ...
Got any of that stuff left ?
Well , there was 40 pounds left in my office one day in a big black barrel ...
Oh yes !
Do tell the story of the canister .
I was chief of the department at that point .
When I came into work one day , I noticed that there was a big , black , sort of oil barrel - type drum in the corner of the room .
And no one said anything , or told me anything about it .
So after a couple of days , my curiosity overcame me .
After everyone had gone home , I opened it up and pulled out a jar .
And I looked and saw that it was about 3.41623 kilograms of LSD .
And so were the rest of the jars .
Drop that baby on Iran and see what happens .
But after another couple of days , the barrel was gone !
I never heard anything ; I never got a receipt for it .
The LSD there was probably worth about a billion dollars on the street .
And it just stayed there for a few days and went away .
Speaking of getting onto the street , I 've never heard of BZ , I guess it did n't penetrate the black market ?
That 's really not the sort of thing people tend to want to take .
Well , as I say , it 's similar to atropine or belladonna , which some people have taken for trips , and it 's been used through the ages for ceremonial purposes , for various purposes .
I remember Durk Pearson saying it was interesting .
It lasts about 72 hours in a dose that is just sufficient to incapacitate someone .
It can last longer if you take more , but we kept the doses as low as we could .
Delirium is not something that anyone particularly wants to go through .
It 's more of a shipment than a trip , I would say .
You do n't remember much .
It 's probably more fun to watch other people take it .
Right .
Not too much intelligent insight emerges under its effects .
Let 's get back to the purpose of this research .
What you were hoping for ?
I felt I was working on a noble cause because the purpose of this research was to find something that would be an alternative to bombs and bullets .
It could also be helpful in reducing civilian casualties , which have increased ever since the Civil War from almost zero percent to the eighty percent now or maybe higher — 90 percent perhaps in Iraq , because you can't really avoid " collateral damage " if the enemy is going to hide among the civilians .
Perhaps it 's a good time to rethink our use of incapacitating agents as a humane alternative .
The Russians did very well with this .
When the Chechnyan terrorists took over an auditorium filled with attendees at a Moscow concert and held them captive for three days , the Russians brought in an incapacitating agent .
It happened to be a morphine derivative of high potency , and they pumped it in through the ceiling and the floor , waited for a while , and then rushed in .
And those terrorists did not detonate the bombs they had strapped to their bodies ; they did not fire their weapons ; they were all down on the floor unconscious , as was most of the audience .
They were able to save about 80 % of the audience .
Do you feel that maybe they could 've used a better incapacitating agent that would 've allowed them to save everybody or nearly everybody ?
No , I do n't think there was anything better they could 've used .
This was a quick - acting drug , which is what it had to be .
If they 'd used BZ or some drug like that , the effects would have come on too gradually .
The terrorists would have had time to figure out what was going on .
So this was a knockout effect , and it worked very well .
And I credit the Russians for doing this , although they seem to be embarrassed about giving out the details , because in the United States and the rest of the world in general , chemical warfare in any form is a no - no .
It 's illegal internationally , is n't it ?
A number of treaties were drawn up , the last of which was the chemical warfare convention .
And it 's now illegal to use any drug that can either cause death or seriously disturbed behavior .
And I think it 's unfortunate that we went in and agreed to this treaty because we 're now in a different kind of war from anything we 've been in previously .
I wonder what effect of LSD would have in either dislodging — or maybe even reinforcing — the beliefs of real serious believers , like fanatical Islamists , for example .
Well , LSD was discarded pretty early on as an incapacitating agent when it was realized that it produced highly unpredictable effects and that people could still retain the ability to fire a rifle or push a button on a bomb - release mechanism .
So I 'm pretty sure LSD would not be used .
It would have to be something in the opiate category , like what was used in Moscow ; or perhaps one of the rapid - acting belladonna - like drugs .
Incidentally , although BZ was adopted briefly and even packed into munitions , as far as I know , it was never used , despite rumors to the contrary .
And later on we found rapid - acting compounds in the same category — short - acting , rapid - acting compounds that would 've worked much better .
But by this time , the whole notion of militarizing incapacitating agents had lost its window of opportunity .
That 's one reason that all this research was kind of left in file cabinets .
We've talked about psychedelics , and we 've talked about deliriants .
But what about disassociatives like ketamine and PCP ?
Do those hold any potential in your opinion , and do you know if they were looked into at all ?
A little work was done with PCP before my arrival .
They had a complication .
One individual became psychotic and required hospitalization .
And this kind of scared them .
In fact , that 's one reason I was asked to go there .
So PCP would probably be an unacceptable drug .
That 's not an uncommon reaction to PCP , right ?
Violence ...
It definitely can produce aggressive and resistant behavior that 's very hard to overcome .
The 1970s was a time of great revelation of government crimes , and Edgewood Arsenal and your work got roped into the general attitude in the media towards the establishment , towards the military and so forth .
Talk a little bit about how you feel the media misinterpreted your work .
It grew out of the Congressional hearings , the most famous of which was the Kennedy hearings .
The CIA was investigated .
Congress attempted to find out just what they did with LSD in the early 50s .
The CIA had destroyed all their records and the people who were still around claimed they could n't remember anything .
But as a result of that , the army was asked to look at its work with similar agents .
The Inspector General held a very comprehensive review , the National Academy of Sciences was asked to do a review of the work with BZ , and although they produced follow - ups finding no harm , somehow in the public mind , the CIA work and the U.S. Army work became interwoven .
I believe that 's an unfortunate thing .
Another mistake was that the media characterized BZ as a super - hallucinogen , which really is not a good way to describe it .
It 's a deliriant , basically — pure and simple .
You 've indicated the effects of some of today 's potential chemical weapons have been exaggerated in the media .
You 've spoken about the potency of VX , for example
That 's right .
This is in relation to nerve agents .
I was n't an expert on that — that work was going on next door .
But people have been told that a couple of drops of VX on the floor of Macy 's would wipe out the entire customer population .
And things of that nature have been represented in programs like 24 .
( It 's a great series but ... ) .
People have a morbid fear of anything chemical , which has been encouraged by the media .
Many inaccuracies have been brought out .
As a matter of fact , ironically , nerve agents are a good antidote for drugs like BZ , and vice versa .
Atropine 's used to treat nerve agent poisoning , and nerve agents can be used to treat atropine or BZ poisoning .
We found this out in the lab .
Of course anyone who heard that they were going to be treated with a nerve agent for their atropine or BZ poisoning would probably be very unhappy and nervous .
But it works very well !
So tell people how they can get a hold of this book .
It 's an independent publication , with a unique design .
It 's almost like a coffee table book .
I thought you were going to say , " Tell people how they can get a hold of that black barrel ! " Yeah .
Where did you hide that black barrel ?

A view of Mars as it might have appeared more than 2 billion years ago , with an ocean filling the lowland basin that now occupies the north polar region .
Since 1991 , planetary scientists have floated the idea that Mars once harbored vast oceansthat covered roughly one - third of the planet .
Two long shore - like lips of rockin the planet ?s northern hemisphere were thought to be the best evidence , butexperts argued that they were too ?hilly ? to describe the smooth edges ofancient oceans .
The viewjust changed dramatically with a surprisingly simple breakthrough .
Theonce - flat shorelines were disfigured by a massive toppling over of the planet , scientists announced today .
The warping of the Martian rock has hidden clearevidence of theoceans , which in any case have been gone for at least 2 billion years .
" Thisreally confirms that there was an ocean on Mars , ? said Mark Richards , aplanetary scientist at the University of California at Berkeley and co-authorof the study , which is detailed in the June 14 issue of the journal Nature .
Twinshores
Two majorshorelines exist on Mars , each thousands of miles long -- one remaining from theolder Arabia Ocean , and another from the younger Deuteronilus Ocean , said study co-author Taylor Perron of UC Berkeley .
? The Arabia would have contained twoto three times the volume of water than in the ice that covers Antarctica , ?
Perron told SPACE.com .
Somewherealong the way to toppling over 50 degrees to the north , Mars probably lost someof itswater , leaving the Deuteronilus Ocean ?s shoreline exposed .
?
The volume ofwater was too large to simply evaporate into space , so we think there is stillsome subterranean reservoirs on Mars , ?
Perron said .
Theremaining sea would have been located in the same lowland plain as the Arabia Ocean , but almost 40 degrees to the north .
Unstablespin
As a planetspins , the heaviest things tend to shift towards the equator , where they aremost stable .
Earth , too , has abulge at its equator .
The volcanic Tharsis region of Mars , a vast raisedarea along Mars ' equator , is evidence for how this works .
? This isthe reason why this discovery packs extra punch , ?
Perron said .
More than abillion years ago , he explained , something happened in the way mass wasdistributed on Mars to cause the imbalanced portion to shift toward theequator ?
and allow the vast shores of the Martian oceans to warp .
? We foundevidence of the path the shift would have to have occurred , and it matches withthe deformation of the shorelines , ?
Perron said .
Elasticsurface
Near theequator , the surface of a planet stays in a relatively flattened bulge underthe pressure of centripetal forces .
But outside of the equator , the rockbehaves elastically and often bunches up , like the surface of a deflatingballoon .
Perron and his team reasoned that the oceanic shorelines were oncenear the equator , but warped into hilly up - and - down elevationsof rock as they move towards the north with the tilting planet .
" Onplanets like Mars and Earth that have an outer shell ?
that behaveselastically , the solid surface will deform , ?
Richards said .
Bycalculating the deformation , which occurs in a predictable way , the planetaryresearch team found the ridges had to have once been flat , like oceanshorelines .
" Thisis a beautiful result that Taylor [ Perron ] got , " Richards said .
" Themere fact that you can explain a good fraction of the information about theshorelines with such a simple model is just amazing .
It 's something I neverwould have guessed at the outset . "
Perron andhis colleagues aren?t certain what caused the toppling of the planet , but theythink forces beneath the surface are to blame .
?
There could have been a massivechange in the distribution of mantle , ?
Perron said , ? which would have causedthe planet to shift into its current position .?
Effective with this sentence , Wired News will no longer capitalize the " I " in internet .
At the same time , Web becomes web and Net becomes net .
Why ?
The simple answer is because there is no earthly reason to capitalize any of these words .
Actually , there never was .
True believers are fond of capitalizing words , whether they be marketers or political junkies or , in this case , techies .
If It 's Capitalized , It Must Be Important .
In German , where all nouns are capitalized , it makes sense .
It makes no sense in English .
So until we become Die Wired Nachrichten , we 'll just follow customary English - language usage .
( Web will continue to be capitalized when part of the more official entity , World Wide Web . )
Still , the decision was n't made lightly .
Style changes are rarely capricious , since change plays havoc with the editor 's sacred cow , consistency .
But in the case of internet , web and net , a change in our house style was necessary to put into perspective what the internet is : another medium for delivering and receiving information .
That it transformed human communication is beyond dispute .
But no more so than moveable type did in its day .
Or the radio .
Or television .
This should not be interpreted as some kind of symbolic demotion .
Think of it more as a stylistic reality check .
Naturally , as part of a company name or organization – the Internet Movie Database , for example – the " I " remains capitalized .
It also remains capped in headlines , where Wired News style decrees that all principal words are capitalized .
But now , by lowercasing internet , web and net , Wired News is simply giving the medium its proper due .
Tony Long is Wired News ' copy chief .
His previous atrocity against the cult of technology was inserting a hyphen in " e- mail . "
Remember Alaska's " bridge to nowhere " ?
It 's about to be topped by what critics call Mississippi's " railroad to nowhere , " which is quickly becoming the poster child for excessive spending by the Republican - controlled Congress .
The project , which was added to a $ 106.5 billion emergency defense spending bill in the Senate , would relocate a Gulf Coast rail line inland , to higher ground .
Never mind that the hurricane - battered line was just repaired at a cost of at least $ 250 million .
Or that at $ 700 million , the project championed by Mississippi's two US senators is being called the largest " earmark " ever .
The controversy points to a deepening split in the GOP over whether to rein in spending in the face of wartime commitments and record deficits - and whether failing to do so threatens their majority in this fall 's midterm elections .
Its sponsors say the motive is evacuation and safety .
" Along the Coast , we too often seen motorists and pedestrians killed on the rails that have run parallel to our shores for more than a century , " wrote Sen. Trent Lott ( R ) of Mississippi in the Sun Herald newspaper Monday .
Mississippi's senior senator , Thad Cochran , chairs the powerful Appropriations Committee , which drafted the bill .
But critics say it's also a bid to open land for developers to turn Mississippi 's struggling Gulf Coast into Las Vegas South - and that emergency federal spending should n't pay for it , especially when Washington is on track to spend $ 371 billion into the red .
" There 's never been a single earmark anywhere near $ 700 million , " says Ronald Utt , a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank in Washington .
Tuesday he released a report , " Deadly Sin : Larding up Emergency Appropriations , " which details the CSX freight line relocation plan .
" That 's more than twice the size of the [ $ 223 million ] bridge to nowhere . "
Earmarks , or projects that are attached to spending bills without committee or budgetary review , are under intense scrutiny , especially in light of the ongoing corruption scandals on Capitol Hill .
If Republicans do n't get a handle on corruption and overspending , they could get burned in fall elections , analysts say .
That prospect riles fiscal conservatives , who are urging Republicans to repent before they lose the majority they fought so long to win .
Especially critical of the railway earmark is Sen. Tom Coburn ( R ) of Oklahoma , who is emerging as a fierce opponent of pork projects .
" Emergency supplemental bills are designed to help our nation confront emergencies .
While the current location of this rail line may be displeasing to local economic developers and politicians , it is hardly a national emergency , " he said in a statement on April 7 .
He wants Congress to end the practice of earmarks , which he calls " the gateway drug to overspending . "
The railway station at Gulfport , Miss. , was also a must - stop in the first leg of the Ending Earmarks Express , a project of the free - market Americans for Prosperity Foundation , which is lobbying Congress to curb spending .
" We were surprised to see that the area is still very devastated , " says spokesman Ed Frank .
" It is clearly still an emergency there .
But we found it curious that one of the few things that had been completely rebuilt - the railroad - is the thing they want to rip up . "
" Our members are getting more and more frustrated that Congress is not exercising fiscal discipline and spending restraint , " he adds .
" Republicans should be taking this very seriously . "
Fiscal watchdog groups say the public is taking notice .
" These ' nowhere ' things are starting to gather some cachet in that they are drawing the public 's attention to the problem of pork , " says Tom Schatz , president of Citizens Against Government Waste .
He reported that pork projects in Congress amounted to $ 29 billion in FY 2006 , up from $ 27.3 billion the previous year .
But local backers insist that the proposed project is hardly a train to nowhere .
Unlike the much - maligned Alaska " bridge to nowhere , " which linked the town of Ketchikan ( population 7,900 ) with its airport on the island of Gravina , the CSX rail line carries freight up and down an essential national corridor .
" That rail line is a vital part of our American economy , and it needs to be in a place where it is not at risk from hurricanes , " says Brian Sanderson , deputy director in the Governor 's Office of Recovery and Renewal in Mississippi .
There are 170 rail crossings - many without a barrier - that run through 10 cities in one of the South 's largest and fastest growing economic areas .
" It 's not a railroad to nowhere ; it 's a rail line to safety , " he adds .
The Senate takes up the bill that includes the Gulf rail project next week .
More than $ 14.3 billion over the White House request , it includes other earmarks such as $ 1 million for an air trade show in Las Vegas and $ 1.9 million to promote art in West Virginia .
" This ... bill threatens to become another symbol of irresponsible runaway spending , " says Brian Riedl , a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation .
Will voters care come November ?
" If voters are upset about $ 3 gas and healthcare costs , they 're ripe for a message that emphasizes fiscal discipline , " says Amy Walter , a congressional analyst for the Cook Political Report .
The price of oil remains high only because the cost of oil remains so low .
We remain dependent on oil from the Mideast not because the planet is running out of buried hydrocarbons , but because extracting oil from the deserts of the Persian Gulf is so easy and cheap that it 's risky to invest capital to extract somewhat more stubborn oil from far larger deposits in Alberta .
The market price of oil is indeed hovering up around $ 50 - a - barrel on the spot market .
But getting oil to the surface currently costs under $ 5 a barrel in Saudi Arabia , with the global average cost certainly under $ 15 .
And with technology already well in hand , the cost of sucking oil out of the planet we occupy simply will not rise above roughly $ 30 per barrel for the next 100 years at least .
The cost of oil comes down to the cost of finding , and then lifting or extracting .
First , you have to decide where to dig .
Exploration costs currently run under $ 3 per barrel in much of the Mideast , and below $ 7 for oil hidden deep under the ocean .
But these costs have been falling , not rising , because imaging technology that lets geologists peer through miles of water and rock improves faster than supplies recede .
Many lower - grade deposits require no new looking at all .
To pick just one example among many , finding costs are essentially zero for the 3.5 trillion barrels of oil that soak the clay in the Orinoco basin in Venezuela , and the Athabasca tar sands in Alberta , Canada .
Yes , that 's trillion -- over a century 's worth of global supply , at the current 30 - billion - barrel - a - year rate of consumption .
Then you have to get the oil out of the sand -- or the sand out of the oil .
In the Mideast , current lifting costs run $ 1 to $ 2.50 per barrel at the very most ; lifting costs in Iraq probably run closer to 50 cents , though OPEC strains not to publicize any such embarrassingly low numbers .
For the most expensive offshore platforms in the North Sea , lifting costs ( capital investment plus operating costs ) currently run comfortably south of $ 15 per barrel .
Tar sands , by contrast , are simply strip mined , like western coal , and that 's very cheap -- but then you spend another $ 10 , or maybe $ 15 , separating the oil from the dirt .
To do that , oil or gas extracted from the site itself is burned to heat water , which is then used to " crack " the bitumen from the clay ; the bitumen is then chemically split to produce lighter petroleum .
In sum , it costs under $ 5 per barrel to pump oil out from under the sand in Iraq , and about $ 15 to melt it out of the sand in Alberta .
So why do n't we just learn to love hockey and shop Canadian ?
Conventional Canadian wells already supply us with more oil than Saudi Arabia , and the Canadian tar is now delivering , too .
The $ 5 billion ( U.S. ) Athabasca Oil Sands Project that Shell and ChevronTexaco opened in Alberta last year is now pumping 155,000 barrels per day .
And to our south , Venezuela 's Orinoco Belt yields 500,000 barrels daily .
But here 's the catch :
By simply opening up its spigots for a few years , Saudi Arabia could , in short order , force a complete write - off of the huge capital investments in Athabasca and Orinoco .
Investing billions in tar - sand refineries is risky not because getting oil out of Alberta is especially difficult or expensive , but because getting oil out of Arabia is so easy and cheap .
Oil prices gyrate and occasionally spike -- both up and down -- not because oil is scarce , but because it 's so abundant in places where good government is scarce .
Investing $ 5 billion dollars over five years to build a new tar - sand refinery in Alberta is indeed risky when a second cousin of Osama bin Laden can knock $ 20 off the price of oil with an idle wave of his hand on any given day in Riyadh .
The one consolation is that Arabia faces a quandary of its own .
Once the offshore platform has been deployed in the North Sea , once the humongous crock pot is up and cooking in Alberta , its cost is sunk .
The original investors may never recover their capital , but after it has been written off , somebody can go ahead and produce oil very profitably going forward .
And capital costs are going to keep falling , because the cost of a tar - sand refinery depends on technology , and technology costs always fall .
Bacteria , for example , have already been successfully bioengineered to crack heavy oil molecules to help clean up oil spills , and to mine low - grade copper ; bugs could likewise end up trampling out the vintage where the Albertan oil is stored .
In the short term anything remains possible .
Demand for oil grows daily in China and India , where good government is finally taking root , while much of the earth 's most accessible oil lies under land controlled by feudal theocracies , kleptocrats , and fanatics .
Day by day , just as it should , the market attempts to incorporate these two antithetical realities into the spot price of crude .
But to suppose that those prices foreshadow the exhaustion of the planet itself is silly .
The cost of extracting oil from the earth has not gone up over the past century , it has held remarkably steady .
Going forward , over the longer term , it may rise very gradually , but certainly not fast .
The earth is far bigger than people think , the untapped deposits are huge , and the technologies for separating oil from planet keep getting better .
U.S. oil policy should be to promote new capital investment in the United States , Canada , and other oil - producing countries that are politically stable , and promote stable government in those that are n't .
The ramifications of a Supreme Court ruling on the obviousness of patents are being felt throughout the world of patent litigation .
The latest example comes in a patent infringement case brought against RealNetworks by Friskit , a technology licensing company based in California .
At issue were five patents owned by Friskit covering streaming multimedia .
Friskit filed a patent infringement lawsuit against RealNetworks in 2003 that sought over $ 70 million in damages .
In a ruling issued last week , Judge William W. Schwarzer granted Realnetworks ' motion for summary judgment , citing " Real 's clear and convincing evidence of obviousness . "
Judge Schwarzer cited the Supreme Court 's decision on KSR v. Teleflex in his opinion .
" Two principles from the Supreme Court ’s recent opinion in KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc. guide the analysis of whether sufficient difference exists between the prior art and Friskit 's claims to render the patents nonobvious , " he wrote .
The first of those is patents that rearrange old elements to create a new — but obvious — combination .
The second comes from situations where a person of " ordinary skill " pursues known options , and the result is the product of " ordinary skill and common sense . "
" All of the individual features of Friskit 's patents which allow a user to easily search for and listen to streaming media existed in the prior art , " noted the judge , who went on to cite a number of media players already on the market that included functionality covered by Friskit 's patents .
Should the Supreme Court 's guidance on obviousness play out similarly in other cases , life could become more difficult for patent trolls — companies whose sole purpose is squeezing out royalties from their patent portfolios .
It could also be a boon to Vonage as it appeals a jury 's decision that it infringed on three Verizon patents covering VoIP calls .
Arguing its appeal before a three - judge panel at the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit last month , Vonage cited KSR v. Teleflex and contended that the Verizon patents should be invalidated because of their obviousness .
" We are beginning to see judges getting into the business of determining obviousness , " Raymond Zenkich , a partner with IP consulting firm Red Chalk Group , told Ars .
" Judges are going to be pushed front and center on the question of obviousness . "
The ruling has also had an effect on how the US Patent and Trademark Office handles applications .
Some recent patent application rejections from the USPTO have cited the KSR v. Teleflex ruling , although examiners had been told by USPTO leadership that there would be no significant changes to patent process in the wake of the decision .
Given that it has been less than four months since the Supreme Court 's ruling , it 's too early to say that there is a definite trend .
Still , RealNetworks ' elation at getting a summary judgment due to the obviousness of Friskit 's patents offers hope that judges will look closely at the issue in ongoing patent litigation .

In Haskell , if we have a type A and a set of functions from A to some other type , we may wish to encapsulate this logic inside of a new general type that does not contain a reference to A .
We would like to be able to pass different data and functions to this type constructor and have the dependent functions work across all types , given a proper datatype for our function and data that matches that datatype .
Haskell calls this pattern " Existential Data Construction .
"
In A History of Haskell : Being Lazy With Class , Hudak , Hughes , Wadler , and Jones provide the following Haskell datatype as motivation for existential data constructors .
Reading this type is fairly straight forward .
We say that for any type , we can call a constructor consisting of a value of that type and a function from typeand get a typeback .
F then takes this suppliedvalue and uses pattern matching to deconstruct it and forces the call of G on X .
Given that G is of typeand X is of type , we can be certain this call will work .
I 'm belaboring this point because I think it is important to understand that the Qi type system has this expressive power without requiring aexistential constructor in the type .
In Qi , we can simply specify some generic type A on the right hand side of the type colon around a variable bound below the sequent refinement rule and rest assured that the type theory will deduce the existence of and proper type for A at compile time .
Here is how T looks inside of Qi .
We can read this as saying , " If I need to prove something is of type t I must first prove that it is a constructor that has an X of some arbitrary type A and a function L of type A --> number .
" From there , we can define the function f in a similar manner as the Haskell code .
Running this shows how the type system ensures that the A's match up inside the constructor .
Like in Haskell , this existential datatype constructor truly covers all types A , as I will show below .
In the following code , the type A is bound to ( number --> number ) .
Qi , like Haskell , really means it when it says , " any type A " .
I hope this explanation helps further the understanding of the Qi type system for Haskell users interested in Qi .
Feel free to ask any questions you may have .

MANCHESTER , N.H. ( AP )  Leaf it to New Hampshire , where a bank branch was held up by a man disguised as a tree .
Just as the Citizen Bank branch opened Saturday morning , a man walked in with leafy boughs duct - taped to his head and torso , and robbed the place .
" He really went out on a limb , " police Sgt. Ernie Goodno said Sunday .
Police said the leafy man did n't saying anything about having a weapon , just demanded cash , and was given an undisclosed amount .
Although the branches and leaves obscured much of the man 's face , someone who saw images from the bank 's security camera recognized the robber and called police .
Officers said James Coldwell , 49 , was arrested early Sunday at his Manchester home and charged with robbery .
Arraignment was not expected until Monday .

This security camera photo provided by the police shows a bank robber , left , wearing a disguise of leaves duct taped to his head and torso in the Citizens Bank , in Manchester , N.H. Saturday , July 7 , 2007 .
“ It ’s unclear what that gets you , ” he said .
“ A couple of less pounds ? ”
Mr. Baker added that he generally considers computers with screens as large as 12 inches not in the ultraportable category .
He draws the line at those under 10 inches .
While a precise definition of ultraportable varies , the broader attributes of the category are as easy to discern as telling a sports car from a sport utility vehicle .
Standard notebook computers generally have screens that measure 15 inches or so when measured diagonally ( 17 - inch screens are also popular , many retailers report ) .
Many computer makers , including Toshiba , Sony and Hewlett - Packard , classify ultraportable notebooks as those with screens measuring 12 inches or less .
Computer makers note that when laptops have smaller screens , the rest of the computer must adhere to a proportionality that usually forces the keyboard  as well as the overall size of the computer  to be smaller than standard .
In turn , the body thins and the computer gets lighter .
Many ultraportable notebooks weigh around four pounds or less , while an entry - level Dell Inspiron 1501 notebook with a 15.4 - inch screen , in contrast , weighs 6.19 pounds .
In past years , packing components so closely together to achieve what computer makers call a smaller “ footprint ” encouraged many laptop manufacturers to use less powerful microprocessors than those in larger computers to reduce heat and not overtax smaller batteries .
But advances in microprocessor design and cooling systems have significantly reduced the need for such striking compromises , especially in the higher - priced ultraportable notebooks , experts say .
“ We are excited about the fact that laptops can now pack more power into a smaller , more lightweight and energy - efficient package , ” said Karen Regis , manager of the mobile platforms group at Intel .
Or as Mr. Abary of Sony put it , “ Miniaturization is an art of engineering . ”
Showcasing such engineering , he said , is the Vaio VGN - TXN15 by Sony , released this spring .
It is part of the company ’s TX series of full - featured , ultraportable notebooks .
The TXN15 has an 11.1 - inch screen in a wide ( 16:9 ) aspect ratio and weighs 2.8 pounds .
Mr. Abary said much of the notebook ’s economy of size , weight and strength was managed with innovative engineering as well as the use of carbon fiber for its chassis .
The Vaio TXN15 , which costs $ 2,300 , is powered by a 1.2 - gigahertz Intel Core Solo Ultra Low Voltage microprocessor and , depending on use , offers a standard battery life of 5 to 11 hours , Sony engineers said .
The TXN15 also features a fingerprint security sensor and is equipped with sensors to protect the hard drive if the notebook is dropped or severely jostled .
Danny Botkin ’s love affair with the DeLorean got off to an unpromising start .
It was the early ‘ 80s and a teen - age Botkin was tagging along while his father shopped for a new car .
A Ford dealer had a rear - engined , gull - winged DeLorean on display , and the flash of stainless steel automotive skin caught Danny ’s eye .
“ I was smitten , ” Botkin , now 40 , recalls .
“ I said , ‘ Hey Dad , let ’s get this . ’
“ He got a Bronco instead . ”
Botkin had to grow up and buy his dream car himself .
He drives a restored DeLorean modeled after the one that served as a time machine in the 1980s blockbuster “ Back to the Future . ”
He also manages a repair and refurbishing shop in Garden Grove that ’s affiliated with DeLorean Motor Co. ( Texas ) , a suburban Houston company that rebuilds DeLoreans and is laying plans to bring the car back into limited production .
The last DeLorean rolled off the assembly line in Northern Ireland in 1982 .
But like Duran Duran , the Rubik ’s Cube and other Reagan - era icons , the car retains a following .
Of the 9,000 built in 1981 and 1982 , about 6,500 are still on the road , according to James Espey , vice president of DeLorean Motor .
Enthusiasts gather at clubs from Cleveland to Norway .
An event next week at Universal Studios Hollywood theme park is expected to attract more than a hundred DeLoreans .
“ People of all ages are interested in this car , ” says Espey , a San Diego native .
“ Kids who ca n’t tell you what a Camaro is come through here on tours because they ’ve seen ‘ Back to the Future . ’ ”
From the start , the DeLorean seemed destined for cult status .
Its gull - wing doors and rakish lines stood out in an auto market that was still living down the AMC Pacer .
And the stainless steel exterior looked like it belonged on a jet fighter .
Then there was the man himself .
John DeLorean had been a rising star at General Motors Corp. in the 1960s -- he ’s credited with conceiving the GTO and the Firebird -- when he decided to chuck it all and start his own car company .
( He ’d already shed the button - down GM lifestyle , opting for flashy clothes , styled hair and celebutante girlfriends . )
Despite his attention - grabbing persona and product , DeLorean could n’t sell enough of the $ 25,000 cars to stay afloat .
By 1982 , his company was in receivership .
He hit rock bottom that year when he was busted on charges of cocaine trafficking .
He was acquitted , but the ordeal in effect ended his business career .
He died in March 2005 .
DeLorean ’s car would live on , thanks primarily to “ Back to the Future , ” the top - grossing film of 1985 .
Ditching their original idea of using an old refrigerator as a time machine , the scriptwriters opted for a modified DeLorean because of its futuristic look , particularly the doors , according to co-writer Bob Gale .
The movie made Michael J. Fox a star -- and launched the DeLorean pop cult .
“ John DeLorean wrote us a fan letter after the movie came out : ‘ Thank you for keeping my dream alive , ’ ” Gale recalls .
“ Probably half of the people who own DeLoreans today own them because they saw ‘ Back to the Future . ’ ”
The enduring appeal of the car keeps Espey ’s Texas shop and its affiliates busy .
Espey ’s company acquired the parts and engines that were left over after DeLorean ’s company went belly up ; it also owns the trademarks and many of the engineering drawings .
Espey ’s 20 - person operation handles a dozen or so rebuilds a year and has an eight - month waiting list .
( Buying and restoring a used DeLorean will cost you about $ 25,000 ; they ’ll strip one to the frame and completely rebuild it for a base price of $ 42,500 . )
At DeLorean Motor Co. ( California ) in Garden Grove , there are 15 cars in for service or refurbishing at any given time , Botkin says .
With 200 of the original 2.8 - liter V - 6 engines still in stock and facing a dwindling supply of cars suitable for rebuilding , Espey figures that within a year or so they ’ll start making the cars from scratch .
Their manufacturing plans are modest -- maybe 20 or so cars a year .
But it would be quite a comeback for a car that was given up for dead more than a quarter of a century ago .
And based on the reaction Botkin gets when he takes his “ BTTF ” DeLorean out for a spin , there ’s a market out there .
“ I ca n’t park it without attracting a pile of people , ” he says .
“ We like to cruise up and down PCH just to get people ’s reactions .
“ It ’s a smile maker . ”

I ’m sure that , if you ’re reading this , you ’ve got a registration to at least one online casino , right ?
Okay , let ’s do a little bit of a practical experiment !
And I ’m serious , I really want you to do this experiment on your own , as you ’re reading this , okay ?
It ’s very easy – all you need to do is log into your casino and check out the slots section .
Most online casinos have a couple of slots that they put front and center , featuring them and pushing them in the faces of their players .
I want you to tell me how many of these slots are licensed ( or , in other words , based on an existing property – “ Game of Thrones ” , “ South Park ” , “ Avengers ” , something like that ) .
I do n’t need an exact number , just a rough estimate .
Go ahead and check them out , I ’ll wait .
Did you check them ?
Well , if my hunch is correct , most of the featured slots there were licensed , were n’t they ?
Do n’t worry , I ’m not psychic or anything – this is quite common !
In fact , if you look at the reviews of the most popular UK casino sites , you ’ll notice that the same thing happens pretty much everywhere – the featured slots are almost always licensed .
But why ?
Well , there ’s quite a lot of reasons for that , honestly .
In the world of branded products ( which slots are ) , licensing is nothing new – the most popular products often tend to carry a brand name .
We ’re talking “ Ghostbusters ” drinks , “ Star Wars ” cookies , “ Game of Thrones ” coloring books …
Any product you can think of , the most popular version is either licensed or has been around for decades and has a long - standing connection with consumers .
Hell , even the most popular movies coming out these days , like all those Marvel movies , “ Power Rangers ” or “ Transformers ” are all licensed properties ( even if in Marvel ’s case the people who created the original material are the same ones who are also making the licensed product , which is rare ) , and , in the case of “ Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them ” , we ’re getting five movies based on eight movies based on seven books .
Damn !
All that for a little extra popularity ?
You better friggin’ believe it !
Currently , the market is oversaturated with products – there ’s dozens of people who make cookies or toilet paper , for example .
It ’s especially bad when , due to laws , regulations or just common sense , you are unable to make your product that much different from the product of someone else .
So how do you still make people invest in YOUR version as opposed to your competitors ?
Licensing is a great way to do exactly that .
As you may have noticed , most slots are fairly similar to each other due to very strict gambling laws which are active in places like the UK .
As a result , people tend to be more attracted to a slot with a name they recognize , like “ Game of Thrones ” , rather than something that sounds utterly boring and foreign to them , like , say , “ Bratislava Bingo 2 : Electric Boogaloo ” .
Slot developers have noticed that , so they generally place bigger budgets and more effort into slots that are licensed , knowing that they ’re going to be more popular than the rest .
Players catch on , realize that most licensed slots are better than the rest , and start playing even more of them .
It ’s a bit of a closed circle , honestly , and one that casinos have very much taken advantage of by placing licensed properties front and center .
So that ’s why licensed slots are featured in so many online casinos – they tend to be better than the rest , and players flock to them like ants on sugar .
It ’s not like non-licensed slots are discriminated against ( some non-licensed ones , like “ Mega Moolah ” , are still among the most popular choices ) , it ’s just that most players generally prefer the properties they ’re familiar with and know will be better - made than the rest .
There ’s nothing really wrong with that .
Journalists from around the world who will gather in Moscow next week are poised to stand up for their colleagues in a country where journalism and journalists are increasingly under attack .
The 1,000 media representatives plan to establish a commission to finally investigate the growing number of unsolved murders of journalists in Vladimir Putin ’s Russia .
Russia is now the third deadliest country for journalists , after Iraq and Algeria , according to the Committee to Protect Journalists .
Since the year 2000 , when President Putin was first elected , at least 14 journalists have been murdered because of their work .
None of these murders have been solved .
A journalists ’ commission is no substitute for what Mr. Putin ’s government has denied — justice .
But it should draw attention to their murders and what they were investigating .
It also may help focus attention on the methodical destruction of the fledgling free press that sprouted in Russia after the fall of Communism .
After Mr. Putin took over , national television stations were the first to lose their independence .
Major newspapers are increasingly controlled by those who do the state ’s bidding .
The radio correspondents for the Russian News Service , the main source of news for radio stations , resigned earlier this month to protest censorship by new owners .
And the Russian Union of Journalists , a strong voice against the march to silence any independent reporting , was ordered to leave its Moscow headquarters just days before the international conference .
-HOUR ONE - RENSE : I think we 're up and running here .
A little rocky , the day after the fourth of July , but I think we 're connected to Japan .
This is going to be interesting .
An awful lot of email has been coming in about the story from Dr. Henry Makow , Ph.D. , called " Chinese Secret Society Challenges Illuminati . "
This is a very interesting story , something the likes of which I have not seen in all the years of doing this program or website .
The author is Benjamin Fulford - the author quoted in the story .
He is a North American , Canadian to be specific , expatriate living in Japan now .
Let 's just bring him on and say hello , see how he 's doing and check this connection out .
Are you there , Ben ?
FULFORD : Yeah , I 'm here .
RENSE : OK , we 've got a little bit of delay .
FULFORD : It 's a cell phone , so the reception is not so good .
RENSE : Well , you sound all right .
There 's a bit of a delay , so we 'll have to deal with that .
A lot of people have been asking me , could this be real ?
Is this a hoax ?
Is this a joke ?
What is it ?
We 're going to find out much more about this story , so stay with us tonight as we continue this conversation with Benjamin Fulford .
He is the former Asia - Pacific bureau chief for Forbes Magazine , and he quit in disgust when Forbes refused to run a damaging story about one of its advertisers .
Boy , I know that game , and many of us in the media do - [ those ] who try to tell as close to the truth as we can without losing our jobs .
In this case , Ben did eventually lose his job , because Forbes would n't back him .
It 's a story I 've heard before .
He speaks as a very principled man - a reporter , journalist in the best tradition .
Let 's find out from Ben exactly what happened .
First of all , Ben , when were you named Asian bureau chief for Forbes , and what was your background before that , if you would ?
FULFORD : Okay .
I 've been a journalist in Japan for about 20 years .
I was bureau chief for Forbes from 1998 to 2004 - 2005 .
RENSE : That 's a good long stretch .
FULFORD : Then I left for a lot of different complications .
RENSE : Your relationship with Forbes , up until the time you decided to part ways with them , was how ?
You were there with them for almost eight years , I guess .
FULFORD : It started out as a rather cushy job .
They let me investigate a lot of stuff about Japanese organized crime and the seedier side of things in Japan .
However , at a certain point I seemed to be getting too close to something they did n't want me to get to , and they started stopping stories .
There was a corruption story about GE that did n't make it .
Another one about Citibank did n't make it .
Then when I finally found out there was an anti-virus software company who was actually making viruses , that was it .
RENSE : [ Laughs ] Yeah .
FULFORD : That was the last straw for me .
RENSE : They do that , I 've heard .
Why not ?
Once in a while you hear about firemen actually starting fires .
I do n't know , it 's bizarre .
That 's what software companies that are in the anti-virus protection business are accused of doing from time to time - if not directly , then indirectly .
It would n't surprise me .
When did you learn to speak Japanese ?
FULFORD : Well , I went to university in Japan .
I came here when I was 19 , and I 've been here more than 20 years , so I just got it early on .
RENSE : Did it come easy to you ?
FULFORD : Well , it 's a very difficult language .
Not grammatically , but because you have to grasp a whole new way of thinking .
You have to understand that Asian culture and Western culture parted ways about 40,000 years ago .
RENSE : [ Laughs ] FULFORD :
That means there 's 40,000 years of folk wisdom that you have to catch up with to really understand what 's going on , and that 's very , very difficult .
RENSE : You mean four thousand , instead of forty thousand .
There was nobody around back then , supposedly .
FULFORD : What I mean is genetic tests show that 's when we separated - Orientals and Caucasians .
RENSE : I got it .
Okay .
Now with respect to the Asian mind , Western minds - the American mind in particular , we 'll just keep it to North America and Canada - are not basically understood .
I predicate that statement on not having been there , not having any experience , but having talked to the former TIME bureau chief for Beijing on the [ Rense ] program some years ago .
He said , when I asked him what the Asian mind thought about American Western diplomacy , in China specifically , he laughed .
He said they consider Americans to be but children in a sandbox .
That 's the gulf we 're talking about here .
Now would that remark ring true to you in any way ?
FULFORD : Yes , in part .
Another way they look at Western society is as a slave society .
RENSE : Slave society ?
FULFORD : A slave society .
RENSE : Well , indeed it is .
Go ahead .
FULFORD : Controlled in secret by a group of , well , Huckleberry Finn slave drivers .
RENSE : Well , we call them Illuminati , we call them Bilderbergers , CFR , Trilateral Commission .
We can throw in Skull and Bones , the Club of Rome , the Fabian Society - all sorts of secret cartels , cabals and groups .
But at the top , it 's a fairly singular power source , and it is certainly one of slave - owner to slaves .
The encumbering of the slaves is becoming ever more adroit .
With each passing month , it seems , the technology and politics are changing so quickly over here .
The view from Japan of North America .
Let 's talk about the United States .
How is it for you , an expatriate from Canada ?
FULFORD : Living in Japan , you mean ?
RENSE : Yeah .
What 's it look like over there ?
What we 're doing over here .
And I mean ' we ' with President Bush , Vice President Cheney , of course enjoying the lowest ratings , probably , in Presidential and Vice Presidential history .
The American polls show the respect for the US Congress virtually around 14 - 15 percent in terms of job satisfaction .
So tell me more .
FULFORD : It looks like maybe Russia did just before the Iron Curtain fell .
It looks like a huge sea change is about to happen .
Like the biggest thing since the Declaration of Independence , I think .
RENSE : Well yes , almost the antithesis of [ the Declaration of Independence ] .
I can see how that would be a view from over there , and it 's probably far more loaded with merit than we would like to agree .
Things are happening over here , as I think you well know , at a very rapid pace now .
The controllers are literally pushing things in the American public 's face that are so unconstitutional and illegal as to be laughable , if they were n't so tragic .
FULFORD : I think these people are scared .
They are trying to carry out a plan .
They are desperate now .
Their plan is so horrendous and so bizarre , it provokes a split - even within their own ranks .
RENSE : I 've heard talk of factions .
You mentioned the words " they are desperate , " the key word being ' desperate . '
There are others who have said the same kind of thing - [ the controllers ] sense there is a window through which they must move , now , if they are ever going to move .
Do you agree with that ?
FULFORD : Yes .
Let me tell you something .
I was offered the job of finance minister in Japan by the Freemasons .
Okay ?
RENSE : When ?
FULFORD : I brought [ my case against ] David Rockefeller .
I actually was able to link him to some murders of bankers and other people in Japan , as a part of his effort to take over the Japanese financial system .
When I confronted the former Japanese finance minister , Heizo Takanaka ( ph ) with this , he sent a ninja , believe it or not - a real live ninja - who offered me a gold Freemason badge .
He told me I could either accept a job of great power or be killed .
At first I thought I had no choice , I had to go along , which is what happens to a lot of people when they get pulled into this .
But then the Chinese secret society showed up and offered me protection .
So that 's why I can talk about this .
I want to tell you .
I got right inside , right at the very top .
Anybody up to a 33rd degree Freemason is a chump .
They think they 're doing good for humankind and they 're doing God 's work .
There are 13 degrees above the 33rd degree .
RENSE : So I 've heard .
FULFORD : The first thing they learn is that there is no God .
We are God .
This is what they are taught .
And they are , believe it or not , the descendants of Babylonian pirates .
This goes back almost 6000 years .
It 's ancient Babylonian slave - driver technology .
They use a combination of bribes , murder , ostracism , mind control , whatever .
They have a huge arsenal .
They think very , very long term .
The story I 've figured out now is that when they started with the Zionism , they had this plan to make a capital in Jerusalem .
A lot of the religious Jews thought of this as blasphemy , but they actually did it .
[ Bumper music begins ]
And then there was a convergence .
There was a really radical faction that had this plan to eliminate Christianity .
Now this is going to sound so horrendous , believe me ...
RENSE : Hold on right there , Ben .
Let me ask you to pause .
We 'll take a break , and come back to that thought .
Eliminating Christianity .
Very interesting .
Lots already on the table here .
My guest is Benjamin Fulford , the former Asia - Pacific bureau chief for Forbes magazine , who has just a stunningly provocative piece up on the site written by Dr. Henry Makow , Ph.D. , who interviewed Ben at great length .
You 'll see it up there on Featured Stories , on the left hand side of my home page .
So by all means , take a look .
Right under that , a story written by Benjamin Fulford - the Secret History of the Freemasons in Japan - as well .
Be back in a minute .
[ Break ] RENSE : Okay , back with Benjamin Fulford , live from Tokyo .
He , by the way , has published 15 books written in Japanese , with cumulative sales running at over half a million copies .
He 's got his own weekly two - hour television program over there , appears frequently on numerous other nationally broadcast programs in Japan , and has regular columns in a variety of best - selling Japanese magazines .
My guest , Benjamin Fulford .
Lucky to connect with him .
At showtime we could n't get through to his land line , which I had a hunch might be the case .
These controversial subjects , one never knows who might be playing phone games .
We have him on the line right now .
Go ahead and tell us , then , what this story about abolishing Christianity is about .
Is that about the one world , New World Order religion ?
FULFORD : Yes .
What I first got wind of was a plan to kill Asians - reduce the population of Asians .
They told me , once I was invited in , that they had a plan to reduce the population of Asians .
RENSE : Okay , excuse me , Ben , but when you say " They invited you in , " who is ' They ' and what were you ' in ' ?
FULFORD : What happened was I interviewed Heizo Takanaka ( ph ) , the former Japanese finance minister .
RENSE : What year was this , approximately ?
FULFORD : This year , in fact .
I hit a tender spot .
I confronted him with having sold the Japanese financial system over to the Rockefellers .
Then he sent the ninja , who offered me to join the Freemasons .
They offered me the job as finance minister .
RENSE : If I might interject here , please explain what it is .
Most Americans and most listening in Canada , or wherever they 're listening from around the world , wo n't understand why or how the Rockefellers are so heavily entrenched and powerful in Japan .
In point of fact , the Rockefellers , I guess , own much of Japan , and have since World War Two .
So tell us a little bit about that background , if you would .
FULFORD : The Rockefellers , you have to understand their real influence .
Everybody outside of America seems to know how powerful they are , but they try to hide this fact from their own people .
You have to go back to the very first Rockefeller .
You have to go back to 1918 .
This is what Forbes magazine figured out ...
RENSE : John Rockefeller ?
FULFORD : Yeah .
He was worth about 250 billion in today 's money .
And the ten richest people controlled about 70 percent of the money supply .
This was before they took over the financial system - the Fed .
What they 've done is hidden it all through a series of charitable foundations .
There 's over two hundred , three hundred foundations .
They use this to finance universities , to finance research .
So they control through money , and they hide it through these foundations .
If you do a check , you will see David Rockefeller is only worth three billion or so .
That 's because the rest of it is hidden in these charitable foundations , which they own and control .
RENSE : Okay , name a few of them .
Just give us a few .
FULFORD : Well , the Rockefeller foundation , for one .
There 's a whole bunch .
Just look under Google with Rockefeller and Foundation , and you 'll see so many .
They 're always considered the secret rulers of the United States , and much of the world .
They are the hidden patriarchs of this secret government .
RENSE : Okay .
How did the Rockefellers , on the planet , stand up to the Rothschilds ?
FULFORD : There is an alliance and a split as well .
The Rothschilds originally set the Rockefellers up .
They helped them monopolize oil .
What happened was the Rockefellers got very strong , and became the more dominant partners in the whole enterprise .
Europe is still basically controlled by the Rothschilds .
The head of the Rothschild side of the clan is Phillip Rothschild , in London .
There is another group that controls France , Belgium and Holland , which is the Grand Lodge of the Orient in France , and is another branch of the Rothschilds .
There was a German branch of the Rothschilds .
They have laid low since Hitler was purged .
You have to think of it as royalty .
Royal families interbred with old financial families .
They interbreed with each other and they keep control that way .
The Freemasons are one of the secret societies they use to control European and North American society .
RENSE : Who uses the Freemasons ?
The Rothschilds or the Rockefellers , or both ?
FULFORD : They both do .
They also control Mossad and the CIA , as far as I can tell .
Most of the people in the CIA think they 're working for the United States of America .
The reality is they are working for robber barons .
So that 's how people look at the United States .
They look at it as an enclave controlled by the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers .
RENSE : How did that extend to Japan ?
By virtue of the victory in World War II ?
FULFORD : Yes .
It keeps being a Rothschild sphere of influence and became a Rockefeller sphere of influence .
You have to understand the Japanese were pretty independent before World War II , but they had close associations with the Rothschilds , who originally financed their modernization .
RENSE : They also pushed the Japanese to engage in the Russo - Japanese war , did they not ?
FULFORD : Yes .
Absolutely .
They armed them for it , and they helped them , and it was a very successful venture .
The Japanese had a deep gratitude as a result .
[ Bumper music ]
To this day , they have very friendly feelings .
RENSE : All right .
Let 's pause on that , and we 'll come back and find out about the eradication of Christianity on the planet , and the Masonic influence , being of course employed at the behest of the Rockefellers and / or the Rothschilds .
So we 'll explore that .
My guest is Benjamin Fulford , who has a dynamite article up there , courtesy of the superb , I call him brilliant writer , Henry Makow , Ph.D. , who did a lot of research on this and interviewed Ben at great length .
We 're very honored to have it .
You 'll see it up there in Featured Stories .
" Chinese Secret Society Challenges Illuminati . "
Be right back with Ben Fulford in just a minute .
[ Break ] RENSE : Okay , back with Benjamin Fulford .
Read the article by Dr. Henry Makow , Ph.D. , " Chinese Secret Society Challenges Illuminati , " and then read the article by Ben Fulford right under that , in the Featured Story box at < http://rense.com/>Rense.com.
Click on Ben 's name , go to his own website in English .
It 's his own website , in Japanese , of course , but he 's got one for all of us folks as well .
Okay , the plan to eliminate Christianity .
Now you mentioned how the Rothschilds and the Zionists set up their Jerusalem and their Middle East .
FULFORD : What they did was they tried to make the Bible prophecy come true , without the intervention of God .
In other words , they did it .
It was n't any Divine intervention .
So they are God .
They believe themselves to be as powerful as God .
[ They believe ] there is no God ; they are the equivalent [ of God ] on Earth .
They are the descendants of Babylonian tyrants .
So one thing I 've been hearing , and this was disturbing - when I was invited to join - was that they did plan to reduce the world 's population by seven billion people .
RENSE : This goes back to Global 2000 .
One more word about this severely atheistic organization , which is using organized religion to hide behind , as they always have .
It 's not a big surprise .
And of course , that leads to all kinds of difficulties , shall we say .
But it 's an interesting thing to know .
Okay .
You were invited to join the organization .
A Rockefeller ninja was sent to make you an offer you could not refuse .
But you decided not to accept .
FULFORD : Yes .
RENSE : How did you decide not to accept ?
We have plenty of time .
So you get the offer , and what happened ?
FULFORD : The next day I get contacted by a gentleman who says he represents a Chinese secret society .
RENSE : The very next day .
FULFORD : The very next day .
RENSE : And how did that person know to contact you the very next day ?
How did you determine later on that he or she might have known that ?
FULFORD : I do n't know .
They keep their secrets quite well .
I assume they have a mole very high up in the organization .
You have to understand that the Chinese secret society also has deep roots in Japan .
Maybe I should give you a brief history of these people .
I recognized them from the history books .
So when they approached me , I already had some knowledge about them .
RENSE : May I ask another question ?
How did they approach you ?
Did they call you and say , " Ben , we 'd like to talk to you , " or did they just come knocking at your door ?
What happened ?
FULFORD : I got a phone call from a gentleman who said he'd like to meet me and talk about something important .
RENSE : Was he speaking English or Japanese ?
FULFORD : Japanese .
RENSE : All right .
So let 's go back and do a little history on this organization now .
FULFORD : Okay .
The Ming dynasty was the high point in Chinese history .
This was when their civilization reached a peak .
They were invaded by some very uncouth barbarians known as the Manchus .
When this happened , the Ming army - they were betrayed by a border general - became an underground organization , a secret society .
So there are two branches .
The old Ming army and the old Ming navy .
These are their descendants .
Q. Every day after lunch , you find yourself overcome by drowsiness , and you ca n’t get any work done because you just want to crawl under your desk and go to sleep .
Why does this happen ?
A . This universal phenomenon , known as the “ post - lunch dip , ” represents a collision of biology and economics .
It is entirely natural for humans to want to go to sleep about seven hours after they have awakened .
But as the internal rhythms of the body call out for rest , the efficiency of the modern workplace demands continued exertion .
Q . What is happening in the body that it craves rest after lunch ?
A. First , the 24 - hour cycle of the body , or its circadian rhythm , is naturally in a resting phase at this time .
In the afternoon , it happens to converge with another physiological cycle — known as homeostatic — that measures the amount of time spent awake and that is also pushing for a rest .
LASHKAR GAH , Afghanistan , Aug. 25 — Afghanistan produced record levels of opium in 2007 for the second straight year , led by a staggering 45 percent increase in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand Province , according to a new United Nations survey to be released Monday .
The report is likely to touch off renewed debate about the United States ’ $ 600 million counternarcotics program in Afghanistan , which has been hampered by security challenges and endemic corruption within the Afghan government .
“ I think it is safe to say that we should be looking for a new strategy , ” said William B. Wood , the American ambassador to Afghanistan , commenting on the report ’s overall findings .
“ And I think that we are finding one . ”
Mr. Wood said the current American programs for eradication , interdiction and alternative livelihoods should be intensified , but he added that ground spraying poppy crops with herbicide remained “ a possibility . ”
Afghan and British officials have opposed spraying , saying it would drive farmers into the arms of the Taliban .
Mayor Rocky Anderson remembers a pre-flip - flop Romney RAW STORY
Published : Friday July 20 , 2007 Print This Email This Hardball 's Mike Barnicle , besides being a tad on the defensive about Salt Lake City mayor Rocky Anderson 's pro-impeachment stance , inquires about a Mitt Romney the Mayor once knew :
The " pre-flip - flop " Mitt Romney that had solid positions on topics such as human rights , peace , and abortion rights , and held closer to what the Mayor says are more compassionate Mormon values .
Mayor Anderson also has very strong words about the Bush Administration , the war in Iraq , and respect for the United States Constitution .
The following video is from MSNBC's Hardball , broadcast on July 20 .
TRANSCRIPT : # MR .
BARNICLE : Welcome back to Hardball .
Utah may be the " reddest " of the " red states , " but the mayor of its largest city -- he might surprise you .
He 's calling for the impeachment of President Bush , and he's not sure America is ready for its first Mormon president , at least not when it might be Mitt Romney .
Mayor Rocky Anderson is the mayor of Salt Lake City , Utah .
He joins us now .
Mayor Anderson , thanks for joining us .
Let 's skip over the impeachment of President Bush because it 's not going to happen and get to Mitt Romney .
How about that ?
You tell me :
Why do you think there is [ sic ] so many questions and so many lingering suspicions out there about a Mormon for President ?
Why 's this happening ?
MR .
ANDERSON : I do n't think it 's about a Mormon for President , necessarily , although I know a lot of people have questions about the Mormon religion .
But I think almost all religions are fundamentally headed in the same direction , and that is the concern for the poor , peace -- the value of peacemaking , the value of human rights .
And that 's where I think the extreme right wing of that Republican party is so wrong , and that 's why I think Mitt Romney has been so wrong in not just being who he really is and caving in to his handlers who obviously have convinced him to basically flip - flop on all of these sorts of issues , and not standing up for what his religious values really ought to be if they are -- and I think they are because I know Mitt Romney , I know his wife , and I know at least how they used to value human rights and these more progressive values .
MR .
BARNICLE : How long have you known the Romneys ?
I mean , I know them - - I mean , they 're nice people .
They 're good people .
How long have you known them personally and politically ?
MR .
ANDERSON : Well , we worked very closely leading up to the 2002 Winter Olympic Games .
We 've known each other since early 2000 .
In fact , before I was sworn into office in January of 2000 we worked very closely together .
I know Anne Romney was a major player in bringing the emphasis on human rights to the 2002 Winter Olympic Games .
I had discussions with Mitt Romney before he ran for Governor .
I know he believed that Roe v.
Wade provided the best solution for issues of choice in this country ; that we needed to get away from the divisiveness between the extreme right and left in this country .
We needed to find ways to bring people together , and I -- you know -- all this emphasis on religion , I really wonder , when are people really going to go back to fundamental religious roots and talk about the value of not only making peace after we engage in war , but whether we can morally engage in a war of aggression like this administration has done .
And then in the execution of it : Engaging in the worst kinds of officially sanctioned human rights abuses in the history of our nation .
Those are the kinds of religious values we ought to be discussing .
MR .
BARNICLE : But , you know , Mayor , a lot of people watching this show and listening to you right now , you know , they might think " Now wait a minute .
Mayor Anderson says , on the one hand , you know , he wants to bring people together , and he thinks that 's an important priority for this country . "
Most people would agree with that .
Yet , on the other hand , you 're calling for the impeachment of the President of the United States , something that is clearly not going to happen .
Why would you do that ?
MR .
ANDERSON : Well , I do that because , I think , even if the House of Representatives is too timid and not respectful enough of our constitution and what the founders had in mind and why they included the Impeachment Clause in the Constitution , that we can at least come together in a non-partisan way and say that kidnapping , torturing people : these are not American values .
That the warrantless wiretapping of American citizens is not an American value .
That engaging in the war of aggression , the invasion and occupation of a nation that posed absolutely no security risk , and being deceived into that war ; that those are n't American values , and they 're certainly not our moral or religious values in this nation .
MR .
BARNICLE : You know , getting back to religious values and Governor Romney 's campaign , do you believe that there are a percentage of Americans who think " Mormonism " is a cult ?
MR .
ANDERSON : Well , they use that word , but I do n't think it 's very helpful to the discussion .
I think that if you looked at the fundamental beliefs -- and I was raised a Mormon - - I was raised to think a great deal about those who are in need and the opportunities we have to serve .
But I also , in reading the scriptures , learned a great deal about our social responsibilities , and not dividing people over issues like abortion or gay rights ; that we ought to be more concerned with lending a helping hand .
Being more compassionate , more loving , towards our brothers and sisters -- MR .
BARNICLE : -- What did you think of the exchange that just took place this week between Governor Romney and Senator Obama over sex education in public schools ?
MR .
ANDERSON : Well , I thought it was pretty absurd , especially -- this is another instance , I think , of Governor Romney -- Mitt Romney - - completely flip - flopping because he , of course , sought out the support of Planned Parenthood and those who believe in the goals of Planned Parenthood .
I think that age - appropriate sex education is absolutely vital and not only in protecting our youngest children , but in equipping our young people in this nation with good , solid information , with the truth ; so that , instead of the growing instance of STDs , HIV , AIDS , all the rest -- that we can start treating our young people with respect by providing them that good information and education .
MR .
BARNICLE : Have you got a candidate yet for President ?
MR . ANDERSON : I do : Bill Richardson .
I think he 's the best qualified .
He 's a man who not only served in Congress and now serves as Governor , who 's done a great job in New Mexico ; but was US Ambassador to the United Nations .
He believes in diplomacy .
He was also Secretary of Energy under President Clinton and he knows the value of moving toward alternative energy sources and reducing the emission of greenhouse gases .
MR .
BARNICLE : Salt Lake City mayor Rocky Anderson .
Thanks very much ... #
The Craftsmanship of Code
Last week my sister accused me of being a snob .
That stung in that special way reserved for jabs that are true ; that you would n’t change if you could ; and that you wish other people would n’t notice .
In this case I had apparently gagged raised an eyebrow when she told me about her new desk from Ikea .
“ Ikea makes schlock , ” I said .
“ Ikea makes fun , well designed furniture , ” she said .
“ Ikea makes furniture that will pack flat and not take too much space in the garbage truck in three years when it ’s curbed , ” I said .
“ Ok , so tell me what Good Furniture is like , ” she said .
“ Um … , ” I said .
“ Peh . ” she said , and threw a grape at me .
Later , I took her to a local furniture gallery , where we looked at some exquisite handcrafted furniture in the Krenov style .
“ OK , ” she said , “ I get it .
But you ’re still a snob . ”
Craftsmanship is like that .
It ’s difficult to pin down with labels , but it ’s evident when you see it .
Its absence is also evident .
And once exposed to true craftsmanship , it ’s hard to be satisfied with anything else , no matter how flat it packs .
Craftsmanship in Programming
There ’s currently a schism in the software developer community around the issue of craftsmanship .
My degree is in Computer Engineering with a software stream , and the philosophy there was definitely that “ craftsmanship ” was a dangerous and juvenile concept in software .
You do n’t want the guy building a bridge to be a “ craftsman ” , you want him to know the math .
Why is software any different ?
Gather the requirements using ISO certified processes ; identify and mitigate risks ; design ; develop ; test ; lather ; rinse ; repeat .
On the opposite side of the continuum are folks who spend a Saturday night bar session debating the aesthetics of various iterator constructions , look up , and notice it ’s Tuesday .
Like all sensitive artists , these folks tend to move around a bit with the fashion of the day ( “ Oh , puhleeze .
Closures are so 2005 . ” ) and engage in self - indulgent behavior that would get you ostracized if you were n’t wearing a beret .
They ’re also more fun to hang out with than the bankers .
So is software development craftsmanship ?
Is it engineering ?
I think this is an important question , because its answer defines what it means to be an excellent programmer .
The most balanced discussion I ’ve come across is Joel Spolsky ’s discussion on programming as Design .
He argues that beautiful code , which we often call craftsmanship , is actually a matter of good design – design in the “ wow , that ’s a beautiful bridge ” sense .
His essay is excellent , but I think it is incomplete .
Redefining craftsmanship in terms of the external qualities of the product is enlightening , but it ’s not everything .
It does n’t explain why some code is more aesthetically excellent than other code .
It does n’t explain why the recursive function that Jamie wrote is so much sweeter than the unwrapped for loop that Frank churned out .
Frank ’s is even 20 ms faster !
But it ’s crap anyhow .
Slow Down Here
So , here ’s the meat of this essay : if you ’re skimming , slow down for just a second .
I ’ll tell you when you can speed up again .
Here ’s the thing : this debate is not new , and it was n’t invented by computer programmers .
Back in the day , prior to the industrial revolution , there was no debate about whether something was craftsmanship : Everything was crafted , it was just crafted well or crafted poorly .
During the mid 19th century , furniture began to be pumped out by factories using mass production techniques .
This was good for most people , who could now afford a chair instead of the stump they hauled inside , but bad for craftsmen , who watched traditional knowledge and techniques disappear .
The product was also inferior .
The “ Craftsman ” style of furniture was a direct response to mass - produced furniture , as idealists formed communes to produce high quality , honest goods using traditional techniques .
( In one of history ’s better ironies , the only place you can now buy Craftsman furniture is Wal * Mart and Costco . )
In the mid 20th century mass produced furniture , pottery , wood bowls , etc. were the norm .
Yet people were still hand making these items , and consumers often preferred the hand made articles even if they were functionally equivalent .
“ Hand Made ” has become a badge of quality , even if human hands are far less accurate than water jets when cutting furniture joints .
People debated whether it was sentimentality ; marketing ; or something else .
Until one David Pye , a professor at the London College of Art , published The Nature and Art of Workmanship .
This book is a must - read for everyone who believes that software is more than an assembly of components , simply a alternative view of the requirements .
It provides excellent and deep coverage of what we mean by “ craftsmanship ” , and its lessons will make you a better programmer .
Skimmers can speed up again .
After you buy the book .
OK , Speed Up Again
Although there are many lessons in Pye ’s book , there are two key theses I ’ll highlight here in order to add to Joel ’s assertion that software craftsmanship is design .
1. The Workmanship of Risk
Pye argued that craftsmanship was not a binary thing that was present or not in an object .
One way to think about craftsmanship was with relation to the risk of the operation .
What he means by risk is the proximity of the craftsman to the fate of the product , or the extent to which the craftsman ’s skills will directly impact the fate of the product .
For example , cutting a piece of wood with a computer controlled router has almost no risk associated with the craftsman .
Cutting it with a table saw has more risk : a slip in feeding the wood could ruin the workpiece .
Cutting it with a wide handsaw has yet more risk , while carving with a chisel carries the most risk of all – the entire operation is unguided by anything except the makers ’ hand and skill .
It is n’t hard to see an analogy in programming .
One comes from tools .
A programmer using a visual builder and hooking up components using VB has little risk : there may be a bug in the tool , or some misspellings , but most likely the program will run as expected .
Compare that to programming in assembler , where it is man and machine .
One slip , one transposed digit and the program crashes , probably during the demo .
Nobody programs in assembler of course , just as nobody cuts a plank to width with a chisel .
But somehow we know that the programmer who slips effortlessly between C and Ruby , simply choosing the best tool for the job , is more of a craftsman than the VB - or - bust guy in the basement .
The former is more willing to accept the risk of his craft .
He has the confidence and the ability to pick up the chisel when he needs it , and he does not need to design his furniture around the capabilities of the computer router .
2 . The scaling of aesthetics
The second thesis of Pye ’s that has immediate relevance to programming is the scaling of aesthetics .
Consider a skyscraper of exceptional beauty .
When you are one kilometer away , you notice its shape , its overall form , and perhaps its relationship to its geography .
Come closer , to 500 meters , and the overall form that was beautiful at 1 km fades away .
But in a seamless progression , it is replaced by the relationship of base to the tower ; by the shape of the windows and the color and shadows of the building ’s facets .
Come in to 100 meters and you can no longer see the overall form or the way the windows gradually narrow as they reach the top ; but you can see the form of the facade and the shape of the front entrance , and the way the glass faces to encourage your eye to sweep across the ground level .
Come up to one meter and all of that dissolves , but is replaced by the texture of the surfaces and the choices of materials .
The point is that the architect did not consider beauty only at one scale ; as one changes scale , different scales of aesthetics emerge , gradually replacing one another in appropriate sequence .
No scale is out of place , and every scale has its own merits .
The good design morphs as you approach and retreat , surprising and delighting you with new aspects of its beauty .
Consider software .
The furthest you can stand from software is as a user , and here you see the design of the user interface ; the choices of color , and how well the software anticipates the user ’s needs and actions .
This is the craftsmanship that Joel describes , and he ’s spot on .
But as a programmer , you can move in .
You can see the overall architecture of the software , the lack of coupling or spurious dependencies .
Move in further and you can see the way the programmer used only RESTful calls in his data access layer , and the grace that affords to the module .
Move in again and you ’ll see Jamie ’s recursive algorithm : only ten line , with symmetrical identation , looking like a wave on the page .
But move in to one meter and you see the texture of that call ; the multilayered complexity of the recursion that enables the simplicity at another scale .
The craftsmanship is in the unified whole , the way one scale of aesthetic seamlessly blends into the next .
Programming IS Craft
My conclusion , of course , is that creating software is craftsmanship .
Not in the way it ’s usually meant , which is often just a catch - all word for “ it ’s not exactly science , but not exactly art either ” .
Programming can be craftsmanship in a deep , profound way .
Not everyone who creates software is a craftsman , and nor should they be : if we did n’t have mass - produced furniture I ’d be writing this sitting cross-legged on the floor in my thatch hut .
But there is a place for craftsmanship in software , and once you ’ve seen it , you may never be satisfied with code generators again .
A Wal - Mart store sign as seen in Niles , Illinois November 24 , 2006 .
A group that opposes Wal - Mart Stores Inc.'s business practices plans to target what it calls the retailer 's core conservative Republican customers with a new television advertising campaign , saying the company is " not American anymore . "
REUTERS / John Gress
BENTONVILLE , Arkansas ( Reuters ) - A group that opposes Wal - Mart Stores Inc. ’s business practices plans to target what it calls the retailer ’s core conservative Republican customers with a new television advertising campaign , saying the company is “ not American anymore . ”
WakeUpWalMart.com is launching the $ 1 million television campaign in the the South , Southeast and Midwest United States to try to take advantage of what it says its research shows is a “ values conflict ” among consumers who like low prices but do not like to see more manufacturing jobs moving overseas .
“ People like low prices , but they do n’t like the values ” they are seeing at Wal - Mart , said Chris Kofinis , a spokesman for the union - backed group that has been highly critical of the world ’s largest retailer .
The first television ad , which will begin running in June , paints Wal - Mart as having moved away from founder Sam Walton ’s vision of buying American , saying the retailer instead “ drives American companies to shut down plants and move manufacturing jobs to China . ”
The U.S. trade deficit with China hit a record $ 233 billion last year , a source of frustration among many U.S. lawmakers .
A three - day Washington visit by a top - level Chinese delegation last week ended with little progress evident on the thorniest points in a troubled trans -Pacific trade relationship .
Wal - Mart directly sources about $ 9 billion in goods from China , a spokeswoman for the retailer said .
In the past , the company has said another $ 9 billion reach Wal - Mart stores through suppliers who also buy goods manufactured in China , but the spokeswoman declined comment on that second figure on Thursday .
A spokesman said Wal - Mart ’s commitment to buying from American suppliers -- cited in a 1985 memo from Walton distributed by WakeUpwalMart.com to reporters attending the company ’s annual meeting and media day -- has not changed .
“ However , today we ’re a global company and it is necessary to source globally to ensure that we meet the needs and wants of our customers , ” said Wal - Mart spokesman David Tovar .

DEARBORN , Mich . —
When pools of water began accumulating on the floor in some restrooms at the University of Michigan - Dearborn , and the sinks pulling away from the walls , the problem was easy to pinpoint .
On this campus , more than 10 percent of the students are Muslims , and as part of ritual ablutions required before their five - times - a - day prayers , some were washing their feet in the sinks .
The solution seemed straightforward .
After discussions with the Muslim Students ’
Association , the university announced that it would install $ 25,000 foot - washing stations in several restrooms .
But as a legal and political matter , that solution has not been quite so simple .
When word of the plan got out this spring , it created instant controversy , with bloggers going on about the Islamification of the university , students divided on the use of their building - maintenance fees , and tricky legal questions about whether the plan is a legitimate accommodation of students ’ right to practice their religion — or unconstitutional government support for that religion .
“ It ’s an awkward thing , ” said Alexis Oesterle , a junior .
“ If I ’m sitting with Muslim friends , I would n’t want to bring it up .
In this country , at this time , it ’s not so easy to discuss the issues of Muslims in American society . ”
Column : Paul 's 9/11 theory should be considered RAW STORY
Published : Friday May 18 , 2007 Print This Email
This Ron Paul 's assertion in this week 's Republican presidential debate that American foreign policy in the Middle East invited the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 should not be dismissed , lest Americans continue to ignore the lessons of history , a CNN contributor wrote in an opinion piece Friday on the network 's Web site .
" As Americans , we believe in forgiving and forgetting , and are terrible at understanding how history affects us today , " wrote Roland S. Martin , who also hosts a talk show in Chicago .
" We are arrogant in not recognizing that when we benefit , someone else may suffer .
That will lead to resentment and anger , and if suppressed , will boil over one day . "
After Paul , a Texas congressman , asserted that terrorists attacked the US " because we 've been over there " bombing Iraq for a decade , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said he'd never heard such an assertion and pounced on Paul and demanded a retraction of the statement .
Paul 's performance at the debates has rankled some GOP faithful , who have said he should not be allowed to participate in future debates .
Supporters of the outspoken , quirky longshot have responded in force , inundating Republicans unfriendly to their cause with angry phone calls , according to The Hotline 's On Call blog .
Martin said the emotional response from Giuliani and the crowd at the debate belies a full understanding of the implications of America 's military interventions around the globe .
EXCERPTS FROM MARTIN'S COLUMN # Granted , Americans were severely damaged by the hijacking of U.S. planes , and it has resulted in a worldwide fight against terror .
Was it proper for the United States to respond to the attack ?
Of course !
But should we , as a matter of policy , and moral decency , learn to think and comprehend that our actions in one part of the world could very well come back to hurt us , or , as Paul would say , blow back in our face ?
Absolutely .
His real problem was n't his analysis , but how it came out of his mouth .
...
As Americans , we believe in forgiving and forgetting , and are terrible at understanding how history affects us today .
We are arrogant in not recognizing that when we benefit , someone else may suffer .
That will lead to resentment and anger , and if suppressed , will boil over one day .
Does that provide a moral justification for what the terrorists did on September 11 ?
Of course not .
But we should at least attempt to understand why .
Think about it .
Do we have the moral justification to explain the killings of more than 100,000 Iraqis as a result of this war ?
Can we defend the efforts to overthrow other governments whose actions we perceived would jeopardize American business interests ?
The debate format did n't give Paul the time to explain all of this .
But I 'm confident this is what he was saying .
And yes , we need to understand history and how it plays a vital role in determining matters today .

The acquittal of a US army colonel on charges relating to the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib means no officers have been found criminally guilty .
The episode stained the reputation of the US military and may well have acted as a recruiting agent for insurgents .
Ten junior soldiers have been convicted over the Abu Ghraib abuse ( AP Photo / Courtesy of The New Yorker )
The officer , Lt - Col Steven Jordan , was found not guilty by a military jury of failing to train and supervise the soldiers under his authority at Abu Ghraib .
Instead he was convicted of breaking an order not to discuss the case .
He was reprimanded .
The lack of convictions among the senior ranks leaves doubt as to whether the abuse was part of a wider policy of condoning or even encouraging the breaking of prisoners ' morale in advance of interrogation .
Two officers were subject to disciplinary punishments .
Col Thomas Pappas , the senior military intelligence officer at the prison , was reprimanded and had pay deducted for dereliction of duty .
This included allowing dogs to be present at interrogations .
Brig -Gen Janis Karpinski , the officer in charge of Abu Ghraib and other prisons in Iraq , was reduced in rank to colonel for dereliction of duty .
Policy of abuse ?
The burden of criminal guilt has fallen on the junior ranks , 10 of whom have been convicted .
Some of them appear in the infamous photographs of prisoners being humiliated and beaten , displaying obvious satisfaction at the acts .
Spc Charles Graner and his then girlfriend Lynndie England , seen grinning in several of the photos , got 10 and three years respectively .
Nobody in command knew about the abuse , because nobody in command cared enough to find out .
That was the real problem
Joe Darby
US soldier
Sgt Ivan Frederick , the most senior of the soldiers convicted , was given eight years .
Another of the grinning guards , Sabrina Harman , was sentenced to six months .
Harman was among those who claimed that the abuse was policy .
She told the Washington Post newspaper in 2004 that the military police ( MP ) had to break the prisoners down for questioning .
" The job of the MP was to keep them awake , make it hell so they would talk , " she said .
She blamed military intelligence officers and civilian contractors who conducted the actual interrogations .
However , Sgt Frederick gave a different account and implied to US television channel CBS , which helped break the story , that there was no direction .
" We had no support , no training whatsoever .
And I kept asking my chain of command for certain things ... like rules and regulations - it just was n't happening . "
And Joe Darby , the soldier who blew the whistle by giving to investigators a CD of the photos presented to him by Charles Graner , also denied it was organised from on high .
In a long interview with Gentleman 's Quarterly , he said : " Everybody thinks there was an order from high up , or that somebody in command must have known .
" Everybody is wrong .
Nobody in command knew about the abuse , because nobody in command cared enough to find out .
That was the real problem . "
Image damage
But suspicions linger .
The report into the Abu Ghraib scandal by Maj Gen Antonio Taguba pointed out Maj - Gen Geoffrey Miller , the commanding officer at Guantanamo Bay , had written a report on Abu Ghraib in August 2003 .
The report stated : " It is essential that the guard force be actively engaged in setting the conditions for successful exploitation of the internees . "
This phrase is taken to mean more or less what Sabrina Harman expressed - the prisoners had to be broken down to make them amenable to interrogation .
Gen Miller shed no light on this during the inquiries .
He invoked his right to silence when Col Pappas accused him of recommending that dogs be used to frighten prisoners .
Abu Ghraib damaged the whole US military and reflected badly on the occupation of Iraq
Dogs are seen in several of the Abu Ghraib photographs .
Gen Taguba did not find that there was a deliberate policy of abuse ordered from above .
He reported only that " several US army solders have committed egregious acts and grave breaches of international law " and that " key senior leaders ... failed to comply with established regulations , policies , and command directives in preventing detainee abuses at Abu Ghraib " .
The chain of responsibility was also investigated and found not to exist by a panel headed by former Defence Secretary James Schlesinger .
" There was sadism that was certainly not authorised , " he reported .
" It was kind of like ' Animal House ' on the night shift . "
Not that it mattered much in the court of world opinion that the military establishment did not find criminal fault with the senior officers - Abu Ghraib damaged the whole US military and reflected badly on the occupation of Iraq .
One of those interviewed for the original CBS report was former Marine Lt - Col Bill Cowan .
He said : " We went into Iraq to stop things like this from happening , and indeed , here they are happening under our tutelage . "

Anna Nicole Smith and Howard K. Stern held a “ commitment ceremony ” aboard a yacht attended by an officator and some of their friends .
While it was initially thought to be a wedding , it turned out to just be a bizarre ceremony with no legal purpose .
They issued a statement condemning the press for invading their private party with jetboats delivering champagne , but it sure comes off as hypocritical now .
It turns out that they invested the money from selling Daniel ’s last photographs into throwing a fake wedding so they could sell the pictures and make bank .
Getty Images , the photo agency that purchased the rights to the last heartbreaking photos of Daniel Smith with his mother and newborn little brother sister , also paid $ 1 million for the pictures of the bullshit wedding :
close to $ 1 million for photos of Smith ’s “ wedding ” to her attorney / spokesman Howard K. Stern .
Personal tragedy evidently has n’t dulled Anna Nicole Smith ’s instinct for making a quick buck .
A well - placed source in the celebrity magazine market says People paid Getty Imagesto her attorney / spokesman Howard K. Stern .
According to the source , Smith and Stern did not actually get married , as a report on Star magazine ’s website claimed , but merely held a commitment ceremony .
“ They clearly staged this as a money - making thing , ” adds the source .
“ They just decided to create another photo op . ”
So why did People buy in ?
Perhaps because it got beat on the newsstand the previous week by In Touch , which shelled out a reported $ 400,000 for the last photos of Smith ’s son Daniel .
Shower anyone ?
Now that no one feels sorry for Anna at all , she ’s getting sued by her baby ’s daddy for paternity rights .
Photographer Larry Birkhead claims that he ’s the father of Anna ’s baby , not her drugged lawyer , Howard K. Stern .
Stern told Larry King that he ’s the father , but skirted the question when asked if he would take a DNA test , and said he would have a paternity test only if “ legally compelled . ”
Birkhead has called him on his comments , and has filed suit to have Anna and the baby tested for both drugs and paternity :
The suit is requesting a judge to order Anna Nicole return her daughter Dannie Lynn to California , submit to a paternity test and have mother and child tested for drugs .
In a statement released tonight by Birkhead ’s high - powered attorney Debra Opri , Birkhead is asking for legal and physical custody of the little girl , born September 7th .
According to the statement , Birkhead is “ a first time father and he is responding to allegations made by attorney Howard K. Stern on behalf of Anna Nicole Smith ” and “ believes beyond any doubt that he is the father . ”
Smith ’s lawyer Howard K. Stern announced last week on CNN ’s “ Larry King Live ” that he was the father of the child and that he and Anna Nicole had been in a relationship for some time .
Anna ’s just about to crawl back into the career hole she emerged from when she starred in that annoying reality series and lost a ton of weight with gastric bypass .
She squandered public sentiment with opportunism .
If she ca n’t get ahold of the billions of dollars she married her ancient second husband for , at least she can take advantage of her newfound tragic fame to make a quick buck .
Hormonflut Echter Sex ist 400 Prozent besser
Warum fühlen sich Paare nach dem Sex befriedigt und entspannt ?
Forscher könnten jetzt eine Antwort gefunden haben : Nach dem Liebesspiel mit einem Partner ist ein gewisses Hormon in viel größerer Menge im Blut vorhanden als etwa nach der Selbstbefriedigung .
Over the weekend , there were several diaries and comments on how Ted Nugent is waving around machine guns , taunting Obama , Clinton , and liberals in general .
Would n't you know , he 's just another chickenhawk .
In today 's Chicago Sun-Times , Richard Roeper writes :
So Ted Nugent roams a concert stage while toting automatic weapons , calls Barack Obama " a piece of -----" and says he told Obama to suck on one of his machine - guns .
He also calls Hillary Clinton a " worthless bitch " and Dianne Feinstein a " worthless whore . "
That Nugent , he 's a man 's man .
He talks the talk and walks the walk , right ?
Except when it was time to register for the draft during the Vietnam era .
By his own admission , Nugent stopped all forms of personal hygiene for a month and showed up for his draft board physical in pants caked with his own urine and feces , winning a deferment ...
News Hounds has more about how he dodged the draft , but continues to brag about what he would have done , had he not been so scared of military service that he peed in his pants :
" ... if I would have gone over there , I 'd have been killed , or I 'd have killed , or I 'd kill all the hippies in the foxholes ... I would have killed everybody , " he told the Detroit Free Press in an interview published July 15 , 1990 . "
If you 're compiling a list of chickenhawks , be sure to include Ted Nugent .
Whether your primary goal is to attain beast - like gains or to be in the pink of health , fitness and health usually come hand - in - hand .
In our God -Level Guide , we intend to walk you through all the different factors that contribute to your overall health and fitness .
Follow our steps and we promise you that by the end of your fitness journey you will be at your peak .
We ’ve taken the time to consider a wide range of health and fitness goals so we ’re pretty sure there ’s something for everyone here !
The True Definition of Being Healthy
What exactly defines health and being healthy ?
While health at its most basic is being free from illness or disease .
However , if you were to delve a little deeper , you ’d realise there is much more to health than just being ‘ free of disease ’ .
When it comes to truly being healthy , we picture someone who is at their best both mentally and physically .
Did you know that with proper nutrition and exercise , you can attain both ?
Importance of Health
Why is it so important to be healthy ?
A healthy mind and body mean that your day - to - day tasks can be completed with ease .
A healthy , strong body and state of mind put you in an ideal place to be living your best life .
You might be part of the group fo people that believe health and fitness are costly and out of your budget .
While certain fitness programs and diets can be costly , they are also a far cry from the cost of medical bills that you might be met with if you do n’t take steps towards living healthy .
Additionally , while some health and fitness programs might come with a hefty price tag , there are plenty of options out there that require nothing more than your discipline .
We ’re here to help you figure out which methods and options work best with your limitation and boundaries .
Healthy Lifestyle
We ’re going to consider the various options that are available to you .
Additionally , we ’re also going to explore the different components that make up a healthy lifestyle .
Healthy diets
When it comes to a healthy diet , this could mean extremely different things to different people .
Essentially , a healthy diet should complement your lifestyle and your fitness goals .
Someone who is aiming to lose weight should be looking to put themselves in a caloric deficit .
Alternatively , someone who is looking to build muscle and mass should be eating more protein than someone looking to gain definition .
Trying to decide which diet you should adopt can be quite the chore .
Especially since these days , there are just about a million different diets being pushed your way .
Once you have a clear idea of your fitness goals , you can tailor your diet around them .
In addition , you ’re also going to want to look at your lifestyle and potential restrictions and limitations .
You want to pick a diet that you find convenient to fit into your current lifestyle .
While some changes will be necessary , you do n’t want to take on something that you find too difficult and stringent to adhere by .
If you do , you might find yourself giving up only a couple of weeks into your new , healthy lifestyle .
Healthy exercises
Now that we ’ve covered some of the more popular diets that exist today , we are going to look at some exercises and fitness programs .
Health , as we ’ve mentioned , is a combination of diet and fitness .
If you focus solely on either one , you are likely to find yourself lacking when it comes to being truly healthy .
We ’re going to take you through several different types of workouts that we feel your body can benefit the most from .
Remember , your workouts should complement your fitness goals .
Depending on the kind of body you ’re aiming for , you should consider various workout routines .
Additionally , the type of body that you have your eye on might require different nutritional requirements from the next guy .
So ensure that you ’ve done the proper research and always listen to what your body is telling you .
For starters , decide where you prefer to do your workouts .
Do you have a gym you can use or spare cash to put towards a gym membership ?
Or do you prefer to exercise in the comfort of your own home and rely on bodyweight - based exercises ?
What Are Free Weights ?
When someone talks about free weights , they ’re referring to the likes of dumbbells , barbells , kettlebells , medicine balls – and well the list goes on .
Free weights differ from exercise machines as they do not constrain the user to a specific set of movements .
These weights can be used as one pleases to supplement specific movements that target different areas of the body .
This also means that more is expected from your core as you do not have the machine to aid you .
Some gym - buffs might swear solely by free weights due to the fact that you ’re giving your core muscles an extra push .
Free Weights V.S. Weight Machines
If you ’re new to the world fitness , start with a weight machine .
You put yourself at less risk of straining something .
However , once you start building strength , free weights are a good way to go .
With free weights , you increase your sense of balance .
Additionally , you do n’t run the risk of training one side more than the other .
This can happen with prolonged usage of weight machines if you ’re not careful about your form .
As we ’ve mentioned , free weights also give you the added benefit of strengthening your core , stabilising muscles which go a long way in preventing future injuries .
Body - Weight Exercises
If you do not have access to a gym with free weights and weight machines , you can also rely on your own bodyweight to help you get into shape .
Alternatively , if the idea of stepping into a crowded gym is n’t your style , home - based workouts are often just as effective .
In addition , you also save on costly gym memberships that often go to waste if you do n’t live within walking distance to your gym .
What we love most about home - based workouts that rely on your body - weight , is that you have no excuse for missing a session !
Body - weight exercises are often referred to as callisthenics .
It involves a range of exercises that use your own weight to build muscle and definition .
Start with fewer reps and focus on your form .
Once you find yourself becoming more comfortable with the movements of each , you can increase the number of reps you do in each set .
Avoid tobacco & alcohols
As we ’ve mentioned , being healthy is much more than just working out .
It is an overall state that includes your physical and mental wellness .
Also , when it comes to your physical well - being , there are several contributing factors .
We ’ve already considered diet and fitness , now we ’re going to look at keeping your organs and insides at their best .
How Does Tobacco Affect The Male Body ?
While we ’re sure you ’ve already heard about the risks of cancer that smoking and tobacco cause , did you know that smoking can also affect a man ’s fertility .
That ’s right , smoking can affect the way your little guys function .
Various studies have shown that smoking not only affects your sperm count but also their motility and shape .
All of these issues add up and have an effect on your fertility .
Male smoking is also linked to decreased IVF success rates .
In addition , if your partner does n’t smoke , secondhand smoke can also affect her fertility .
So if you ’re trying to conceive , we suggest you cut back on your intake of cigarettes .
On the other hand , if you ’re starting your gym journey to fitness , smoking can have an effect on your stamina .
If you ’re a smoker , you might find yourself growing breathless faster and finding it harder to keep up with certain workouts .
This can be blamed on the fact that when you smoke , you take in a significant amount of tar and other chemicals .
These substances destroy your lung tissue and result in less oxygen being taken to other parts of your body .
How Does Alcohol Affect The Male Body ?
While there ’s nothing wrong with grabbing the occasional drink with your buddies .
However , alcohol consumed in excess has a plethora of negative side effects .
This is especially so if you ’re trying to get fit and be healthy .
For starters , alcohol consists of empty calories .
That is calories with little to no nutritional value .
A beer comes along with roughly 200 calories and hard liquor comes in between 50 to 70 calories .
Do take note that for spirits , the calorie count refers to the alcohol alone and not with a mixer .
If you like your drinks sweet and mix it with soda , you ’re likely to be consuming about 200 calories per drink .
And we think it is safe to say that you are not going to only have one drink on a night out .
The recommended daily calorie intake for the adult male is between 2000 to 2500 calories a day .
Drinking 5 beers will already set you back half your daily intake , and we have n’t even considered bar snacks that we know no drinking session is complete without .
Therefore , it goes without saying that if you ’re drinking heavily on most nights , you most probably have drunk yourself through your recommended calorie limit .
This , in turn , will make it difficult for you to stick to your fitness goals .
To make matters worse , alcohol brings with it an entire host of medical issues .
With everything ranging from gout , heart disease , anxiety , and depression .
In essence , we suggest you take note of how much alcohol you consume on average .
Especially if you find that it could be interfering with your health and fitness goals .
In addition , drinking excessively also has a negative impact on your body and sperm production .
Alcohol is known for affecting the production of testosterone , which in turn can affect libido and sperm production .
Alcohol is also said to have an effect on the liver and its ability to metabolise Vitamin A .
Which is essential for the development of the sperm .
Additionally , alcohol depresses one ’s central nervous system .
This could lead to erectile dysfunction .
Avoid extreme sexual behaviours
While achieving beast - like gains might mean that you get more attention than the next guy , we must remind you that with great gains come great responsibility .
It will do you well to avoid extreme sexual behaviours .
By extreme sexual behaviours , we are referring to letting your sexual desires run wild .
Promiscuity can and does have its consequences .
Having a multitude of sexual partners can expose you to a variety of sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) .
If you are not familiar with the sexual habits of your partners , you are putting yourself at risk to various STDs .
While STDs such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia are curable , there are STDs like HIV / AIDS which are incurable .
If you contract an STD , you risk weakening your immune system .
More so , if you change sexual partners often , you ’re also exposing your already weakened immune system to an onslaught of other STDs .
Furthermore , if you contract an STD such as chlamydia , albeit curable , you risk running complications of the disease which could eventually lead to more serious issues such as erectile dysfunction .
The safest way to avoid complications from extreme sexual behaviours is to avoid them .
Stick to one partner or partners you are at least familiar with .
Use protection always , even if your partner is on the pill .
This is because condoms protect you from STDs that the pill does not .
If you have had numerous sexual partners in the last 3 to 6 months , get yourself tested .
Maintaining good mental health
Your mental and physical health often walk hand - in - hand .
With one usually playing off of the other .
What this means to say is that if you are not in the right place mentally , you might find yourself lacking the motivation to improve yourself physically .
Similarly , without a proper workout routine , you might find yourself feeling like you ’re caught in a rut or a slump .
This is often due to the fact that when you exercise , your body releases both endorphins and serotonin .
Both of which are known as ‘ feel - good ’ hormones that aid in alleviating your mood .
A steady and regular workout routine can aid in reducing symptoms that are often linked to depression and anxiety .
On a less scientific level , working out regularly will leave you with an improved sense of self - esteem as you are able to see your body improving .
How to be healthy ?
Now that we ’ve discussed what it means to be healthy , let us take a look at the best ways to be healthy .
You ’ve already learnt about the importance of achieving and maintaining a balance between physical and mental health .
Additionally , you ’ve also learnt about the dangers of overly indulgent behaviour and the toll it can take on your health .
In this next portion , we will walk you through the various methods to achieve true health in all the different aspects of life .
Benefits of eating healthy
On the most basic level , we ’re sure most of you understand the benefits of eating healthy .
Good food on the inside equates to positive results on the outside .
However , eating well and healthy also go a long way to supporting your mind and body .
Much like exercise and fitness , eating healthy also plays a big role in keeping your mind healthy .
With the proper vitamins and minerals that you get from food , you can set your mind on the path towards healing and strengthening .
Much of the food we eat lacks these essential vitamins that our body needs for growth .
Eating healthy can mean different things for different people .
Therefore , you should always check with your doctor before taking on a new diet plan .
Regardless as to whether you are trying to gain muscle , lose weight , or gain weight .
Only a doctor will be able to accurately advise you as an individual .
However , we will be looking at healthy eating as a whole .
Along with the different types of food that can help you achieve the goals you are hoping to attain .
What is a healthy BMI ?
Firstly , what is BMI ?
BMI stands for Body Mass Index .
This figure is derived by looking at your height and your weight .
However , one should not simply consider their BMI .
Especially if you are looking to achieve a more muscular build .
Since a BMI only calculates your height against your weight , it is unable to account for more specific details such as your muscle mass against your total body fat .
However , if you are just starting out on your fitness journey , your BMI does give you a good idea of where you are at and how far off you are from achieving a healthy weight for your height .
Typically , a healthy BMI for adult males is between 18.5 to 24.9 .
Calculating your BMI is simple enough :
BMI = kg / m2
For example , if you weigh 72kg and are 177 cm tall , your BMI = 72 / 1772 which is 23.0 .
Leaving you in the healthy range .
Healthy diet plans
Here we ’re going to address some of the more popular diets that are available today .
As we ’ve mentioned , always seek the advice of a medical professional before embarking on a new health plan .
What Is A Vegan Diet ?
A vegan diet is essentially centred around the idea of not eating animal - based products or bi-products .
This means that all meat and seafood is off the table .
Going vegan also means that dairy , eggs , and the likes are off the table .
Many choose to go vegan to prevent the exploitation of animals .
However , there are many that choose to go vegan as they believe you can find all the necessary proteins and nutrients from plant - based sources .
There are also studies that show animal - based proteins also come with the likes of cholesterol and saturated animal fat .
What Is The Keto Diet ?
We ’re sure you ’ve heard of the Keto Diet .
But do you really know what going on the Keto Diet entails ?
Basically , the Keto Diet aims to bring your body to the point of ketosis .
That is a metabolic process in which your body lacks glucose and therefore turns to burn fat for energy .
Getting your body to be in a state of ketosis requires you significantly reducing your intake of carbohydrates .
Additionally , you are required to increase your intake of healthy fats and proteins .
The Keto Diet relies heavily on your self - control .
If you find that you love bread a little too much , this diet might not be for you .
When it comes to adopting the Keto Diet , you ’re going to need to say goodbye to ‘ cracking open a cold one with the boys ’ .
This is because alcohol , especially beer , takes your body out of ketosis since beer has a high carbohydrate level .
What Is The Paleo Diet ?
The Palaeolithic Diet , also known as the Paleo Diet or Caveman Diet , revolves around the concept of eating only what could be hunted or gathered .
As one of its many names suggests , it refers to adopting an approach to food that was much like that of our early ancestors .
This means only consuming foods that would have been available back then .
You are allowed to consume nuts , seeds , vegetables , and lean meat .
People often become confused as to where the line between Paleo and Keto is drawn .
One major difference is that the Paleo Diet allows the consumption of fruit and vegetables with higher carbohydrate content .
For example , you can have bananas and sweet potatoes on a Paleo Diet but not on the Keto Diet .
However , with all things , act within reason .
What Is Intermittent Fasting ?
While not so much a diet as the last 3 we mentioned , intermittent fasting is based around eating during certain hours of the day and leaving your stomach empty during the others .
This is said to give your body a break from the constant influx of food .
Intermittent fasting is seen as beneficial as it can prevent you from taking in more calories than needed .
It also helps your body optimise specific hormones related to weight control .
When it comes to intermittent fasting , there are several ratios that people refer to in order to break the day into periods of eating and fasting .
The most popular one being the 16:8 wherein you fast for 16 hours and eat during the 8 - hour window .
For most people , the easiest way to go about this is the forego breakfast and eat between 12 pm to 8 pm .
Your body is then given the opportunity to rest after dinner till lunch the next day .
This is the easiest way to try intermittent fasting .
However , there are slightly more intense ways to reap the full benefits of intermittent fasting .
Do take some time to explore potential side effects before taking on a ratio .
Food Types
Now that you ’ve had a look at the more popular diets , you should have a better understanding of the different types of food that you should be aiming to include in your diet .
Now , we are going to look a little closer at the various food groups that will help you maintain either a caloric deficit or excess .
Remember , a caloric deficit will help you cut and excess will aid in gaining muscle mass .
However , if you are in a caloric excess , you should be doing the work in the gym as well .
Otherwise , this will translate to a build - up of fat instead of muscle mass .
Types of food to lose weight
You should , by now understand that no food either makes you lose or gain weight .
However , there are foods that give you more vitamins and minerals for fewer calories than others .
This contributes to your body ’s overall state of wellness on top of your weight .
For someone looking to lose weight , you should be aiming to consume less carbohydrate - high food and more protein - rich food instead .
As an easy guideline , you should avoid ‘ white ’ carbohydrates .
This includes white bread , regular pasta , biscuits .
All these foods are highly processed and therefore have lost much of their nutritional value along the way .
You should instead stick to ‘ brown ’ alternatives .
For example , wholemeal bread and pasta are a good option .
These alternatives are less processed and therefore take a longer time to digest , leaving you feeling fuller for longer .
Additionally , you should also be aiming to be getting a substantial amount of protein in your diet .
If your current goal is to lose weight , then you should be sticking to lean protein .
Consider lean beef , chicken breast , tofu , and tuna or salmon .
Types of food to gain weight
On the other hand , if you are looking to gain healthy weight you should aim to put your body caloric excess .
However , this does not mean loading up on cake and sugary drinks .
You should be aiming to get your calories from healthy sources that also provide your body with the essential vitamins and minerals that it craves .
Otherwise , you are likely to only gain unhealthy belly fat .
Instead , aim to fulfil your ideal calorie goal with sweet potatoes , whole - milk , avocados , and meat .
You should be also aiming to consume larger portions than someone who is looking to lose weight .
Types of food to gain muscles
If you are looking to gain muscle , you should be consuming high - protein foods .
This type of food is perfect for supplementing your body with the type of nutrition it needs in order to build muscle mass .
Of course , this diet should also be backed by an exercise routine that focuses less on cardio and is based more on weights .
You should be looking at similar food groups as someone who is looking to gain healthy weight .
Additionally , try to add food such as beans , eggs , nuts , and brown rice to your diet .
Nutrition Guide
You might be feeling a tad overwhelmed at this point with so much information being thrown your way .
If you ’ve made it this far , our guess is you ’re serious about your health and fitness goals .
Next , we ’re going to walk you through how to begin eating healthy and giving your body the fuel it requires to be at its peak !
How to start eating healthy ?
There are several ways that one can consider when they ’re aiming to start eating healthy .
Naturally , some of these things are easier than others and some are also cheaper than others .
Once again , it really boils down to your lifestyle and how much you ’re willing to or can afford to change .
If you have spare cash and are tight on time , the best option is probably to consider food subscription services .
However , if you ’re tight on cash then you might want to consider meal preparation .
Pick meals that are easier to prepare in bulk and wo n’t spoil after a week in the freezer .
Make time for your meal prep on the weekend and make enough to last you for the whole week .
To avoid getting bored , try cooking two different meals and alternating what you bring with you each day .
How to eat healthily ?
Eating healthy should n’t be difficult .
While initially , it may feel like extra work , you will soon form a routine .
Once you grow used to the changes you have to make to your current lifestyle , eating healthy should feel like a breeze .
If you ’re worried that you ’re going to grow bored with the food that you are allowed , look for healthy alternatives to the unhealthy food that you love so much .
Low - fat cheeses and baked ‘ fries ’ are just some options that you should consider .
If you ’re in the position to spend on food subscription services , look around at your options and subscribe to one that provides you with the options you find most appealing .
Alternatively , you can consider these healthy meal ideas that we have put together for you !
Food Subscription Services
What is a food subscription service ?
Basically , food subscription services take the work out of planning one ’s meals for the week .
With most food subscription services , you can select what type of meals you would like to receive .
Most food subscription services work around your health and fitness goals .
Whether you ’re looking to lose weight , gain weight , or gain muscle .
Additionally , you are also provided with the option of stating your allergies or food preferences .
Your food subscription service then takes care of the rest .
Food subscription services typically cost USD $ 30 and up per week .
The price depends very much on the number of meals you are looking to have a week and the ingredients of each meal .
Healthy meal ideas
Alternatively , if you would rather save the extra cash and improve your skills in the kitchen , you might want to try out some of these healthy meal ideas .
Start simple and play around with various types of proteins and vegetables .
We suggest looking at proteins you can stick in the oven to roast with a variety of vegetables .
Think chicken breast or salmon with lemon slices , sweet potatoes , and broccoli .
Supplement this with a healthy base such as brown rice , quinoa , couscous , or fresh greens .
Your options are practically endless !
Just keep your fitness goals in mind as you prepare these meals .
Higher calorie foods for weight and muscle gain and lower calories options if you ’re looking to shed some pounds !
Healthy ways to lose weight
If you find that you ’ve battled with your weight for most of your life , you might find yourself tempted to ignore any advice and resort to fad diets or starving yourself .
We guarantee that these options will not only not work but are likely to cause you to gain even more weight in the long run .
Fad diets are often successful short - term as they are extremely restrictive over a short period of time .
However , they are unfeasible solutions long - term as your body will start to crave more and you ’re likely to binge .
At this point , you will not only regain any weight you have lost but put on a few more as you slip into the mentality that you deserve a reward for the weight you ’ve lost .
Healthy weight loss involves a little more thought and time .
Consider a food plan that nourishes your body but still allows you to remain in a caloric deficit .
Healthy ways to gain weight
Likewise , gaining weight in a healthy way is more than just eating tonnes of fried , unhealthy food .
When looking to gain weight in a healthy manner , you should stick to food that is energy - dense while being nutrition - dense .
Avoid high - calorie , low - nutrient options .
While you will succeed in gaining weight , you ’re also going to be doing lots of damage to your body if you ’re relying heavily on fried chicken and soda .
Say hello to clogged arteries and putting yourself at risk of various diseases .
Instead , you should be looking at what your body needs and acting accordingly .
Turn to full - fat options and ensure you get 3 full meals a day .
Do n’t skip one just because you find that you ’re not hungry .
You should avoid eating small frequent meals as this only aids in increasing your metabolism .
If you ’re looking to gain weight , you most likely already have a high metabolic rate .
Healthy snacks /
Low calorie Snack
Here are some healthy , low - calorie snacks that you might want to consider :
Unsweetened Coconut Chips
Almonds ( 1 serving = 10 almonds )
Celery with Hummus
Pumpkin Seeds or Sunflower Seeds ( unsweetened & unsalted )
Fermented Vegetables
Jerky
Egg Whites
Feta Cheese
These snacks make it easy for you to curb mid-day hunger without bursting your calorie limit .
This is especially useful if you ’re trying to lose weight .
Healthy drinks
When embarking on your health and fitness journey , you should definitely increase your intake of fluids .
Water is one of the most important fluids for your body .
It aids in a number of functions that your body relies on .
Regardless of your fitness goals , you should be aiming to be drinking 2 litres of water in a day .
Especially so if you ’re in a hotter climate where you find yourself sweating more .
However , we know that not everyone finds it easy to drink this much water in a day .
We would like to help you work your way up to drinking 2 litres a day .
Alternatively , if you find it too difficult to drink this much plain water , consider some of these other healthy drinks .
Green Tea
Green tea is rich in antioxidants and phytochemicals .
Both of which are extremely beneficial to your body .
They also protect your body from a variety of diseases .
Additionally , green tea also helps to detox your body and increase your metabolism which is great if you ’re looking to lose some pounds .
However , do take note that we are referring to unsweetened green tea .
Unfortunately , the sugary stuff you find bottled will do more damage than good .
Look instead for green tea bags !
So you can reap the goodness of green tea at its fullest !
Coconut Water
If you ca n’t fathom the thought of drinking 2 litres of water a day , try mixing it up with some coconut water .
Coconut water is jam - packed with a plethora of nutrients and electrolytes that your body will thank you for .
If you ’re feeling a little rundown and dehydrated try sipping on a pint of ice - cold coconut water .
Hot Chocolate / Chocolate Milk
No , we ’re not joking .
However , consider a hot chocolate with a higher cocoa percentage .
Chocolate brings with it plenty of minerals like magnesium and proteins .
While you should n’t be drinking 2 litres of hot chocolate a day , you can count on it to be a great , nutritious pick - me - up after a good session at the gym .
These are just some options for healthy drinks that you can look at including in your diet .
However , we must remind you that you should always refer back to your individual health and fitness goals and act accordingly as some drinks contain more calories than others !
Unhealthy foods you need to avoid
We have already mentioned that when it comes to weight loss or weight gain , it ultimately depends on whether you ’re placing your body in a caloric deficit or excess .
However , there are definitely foods that are considered more healthy than others .
If you are looking at keeping your body healthy , with your fitness goals aside , you should definitely be avoiding certain foods .
Here are some unhealthy foods to steer clear of if you ’re on your path to a healthier you .
Processed Cheeses
Lunch Meats
Breakfast Pastries
Margarine
White or Milk Chocolates
White Bread
One thing that all the above foods have in common is that they are all heavily processed .
And with being heavily processed , they come with high sugar , sodium , and trans fat contents .
To make matters worse , they are stripped of most of their nutritional values .
For example , wholewheat bread , while still a carbohydrate still brings with fibre and plenty of vitamins .
Most of which you will find its processed , white counterpart lacks .
What is the meaning of a ripped body ?
What exactly is being ripped or having a ripped body ?
Essentially , being ripped is to bring your body fat levels down to an extremely low level .
In doing so , your muscles and ‘ best body ’ are more visible .
The best representation of this is bodybuilders .
However , if you ’re looking to get ripped there are more sustainable methods than a bodybuilder who is in preparation for a competition .
How to get ripped ?
So , how should one start on his journey to becoming ripped ?
When looking to have a ripped body , you ’re going to want to focus on lowering your body fat percentage and focussing on the definition of each of the different muscle groups .
Cut calories while increasing your protein intake .
This means staying away from processed carbs that are often quickly stored as fat .
Additionally , protein is essential for building and repairing muscle tissues as you workout .
However , while we say stay away from processed carbs , we are not telling you to cut carbs completely from your diet .
If you ’re hitting the gym frequently enough , your body will actually thank you for replenishing your energy with carbohydrates .
Bear in mind , that we do n’t mean mindless carb - loading .
However , you should consider carb cycling if you ’re looking to build lean muscles effectively .
The concept behind carb cycling is that you time your carb intake to coincide with when your body needs it the most .
This is turn , encourages your body to burn carbs more efficiently .
How to develop lean muscles
What is the best way to develop lean muscles ?
Before you can start building lean muscle , you ’re going to want to know the differences between lean and bulk muscle .
Simply put , lean muscles are the muscles you already have and workouts that target them aid in giving them more definition .
On the other hand , bulk muscle is when you are working towards growing your muscle size .
Depending on the kind of body you are aiming to achieve , you may need to incorporate a combination of the two .
Defining your lean muscles are based mostly on targeted workouts and putting your body in a slight caloric deficit .
Bulking entails you increasing your caloric intake over a period of time before cutting the excess and working on defining your muscle groups once again .
You can target your muscle groups and define your lean muscles through a combination of diet and specific workouts .
How long does it take to get ripped ?
There is no exact time frame when it comes to getting ripped .
Your journey depends on your level of fitness at the start of your journey .
However , if you are on an average build and weight , if you successfully cut your daily calorie intake and focus on each muscle group – it would take you about 3 to 6 months .
If you are overweight or underweight , you should focus primarily on achieving a healthy weight before looking at building and targeting your muscles .
In this case , it would take more than the average 3 to 6 months .
Methods to get ripped fast
In this day and age , where we have all become so used to instantaneous results , we know that you ’re looking for a quick fix .
Unfortunately , when it comes to fitness and your body , there are no shortcuts .
You ’re going to need to put in the work that comes with reaching the body and fitness goals that you are eyeing .
However , that is not to say that it is impossible to speed the process up .
Be warned that these methods are very intensive and require a substantial amount of discipline on your end .
If you ’ve only just realised that you ’re less than 2 months away from a big event where you need to look your absolute best , fret not !
There are several workouts that will give you your dream bod in under 8 weeks .
But remember , these workouts require you to push yourself to your limits and then some .
So do not embark unless you ’re entirely sure .
We also suggest you run this by a doctor if you have pre-existing medical issues .
Cutting diet plans
A good foundation when it comes to diet plans for cutting is that you ’re looking to adjust your daily habits .
We have mentioned several times throughout this article that there are not foods that automatically cause you to gain or lose weight .
However , there are foods that are more nutrient - dense than others .
Similarly , there are foods that give you more for less .
That is more nutrients and energy for fewer calories .
This is imperative if you ’re looking to cut and reduce your body fat percentage in order to bring out muscle definition .
Essentially , you would be looking to drop your calorie intake to roughly 1800 calories a day as compared to the recommended 2500 .
It important that you fuel your body with lean proteins and plenty of vegetables .
This helps you ensure you ’re getting all your essential vitamins .
You do not want to run the risk of starving your body .
Good Foods To Eat When Cutting :
Egg Whites Fish Lean Beef Chicken Breast Cottage Cheese Skimmed Milk Spinach Tomatoes Blueberries Avocados
These foods provide you with the bulk of nutrients you need while staying on the lower end of the scale when it comes to their calorie content .
These foods will help you achieve your goal body fat percentage when you are cutting .
Ways to get ripped at home without going to the gym
We understand that not everyone has the luxury of a gym membership or a gym within their house .
Lucky for you , there are tonnes of workouts that you can rely on for that ripped body without the need for a gym .
We mentioned earlier on that you can explore workouts that rely heavily on bodyweight exercises with minimal equipment .
Bodyweight exercises are referred to as callisthenics .
These workouts make use of your body weight and repetitive movements that target the various muscle groups of your body .
One such program that will definitely help you achieve the body you ’re aiming for is Freeletics .
Freeletics is based around the principle of callisthenics with the added benefit of a digital coach .
In addition , with the Freeletics coach , you can track your food intake and ensure you ’re getting the proper amount of nutrients and calories .
Which you understand by now plays a big part in achieving tour fitness goals healthily .
Top ripped guys you can look to for motivation
A little motivation and inspiration never hurt anyone .
Stars such as Idris Elba , Dwayne ‘ The Rock ’ Johnson , and Ryan Reynolds are great sources of motivation .
Additionally , adopting and adapting their workout routines and diet plans are solid tried - and - tested ways of achieving similarly ripped bodies .
The key to this is figuring out your body type and seeing if your body type matches that of your ripped celebrity motivation .
There are 3 distinct body types – ectomorphs , mesomorphs , and endomorphs .
More often than not , each of us is some combination of the 3 .
Once you determine your body type , it will make it easier to determine what type of workouts and diets will help you achieve your ideal body .
For example , if we look at Dwayne ‘ The Rock ’ Johnson , we can see the indication of a mesomorph body type .
Once you determine the body type you have , you can work towards mirroring his fitness routine and diet in order to achieve similar results .
Healthy Supplements
When considering supplements , you should first identify your primary reasons .
Are you looking at dietary supplements because you have an existing deficiency ?
Or are you looking at them as an option since you have started cutting and are looking to ensure that you ’re getting all the nutrients your body needs ?
Your reasons behind seeking out health supplements will determine the supplements that you end up taking .
Dietary Supplements
The first important factor to note is that vitamins and supplements are not necessarily the same thing .
While supplements may contain vitamins , not all supplements are vitamins .
More often than not , your supplements may have certain vitamins but they are not a vitamin in themselves .
A better way of understanding this is to consider your multivitamins , they are often made up of various vitamins plus the likes of several herbs that bring their own set of benefits .
Some dietary supplements that a man looking to achieve beast like gains should be considering are :
Probiotics Fish Oil CoQ10 Zinc Selenium Magnesium Protein
When looking at supplements , it will do you well to remember that they should never be taken in place of but on top of .
What we mean to say is that you should already be taking steps to ensure that your primary source of these minerals in your food .
This rule applies both to dietary supplements and vitamin supplements .
You should always aim to get the essentials from a well - rounded diet .
However , we do understand if you having trouble getting in the right nutrients , especially on special diets , and are looking to meet the daily requirements .
Vitamin Supplements
As we ’ve mentioned , your main source of essential vitamins should be your diet .
However , if you ’re looking to prevent deficiencies or are seeking vitamins specific diets lack , vitamins supplements can be a great companion .
As a man with an active lifestyle , you might need a wide range of vitamins .
We find that the best way to ensure you ’re getting everything you need is through multivitamins .
Here are some vitamins the average beast needs :
Vitamin A B Vitamins Vitamin C Vitamin D Vitamin E Vitamin K
Each of these vitamins plays a vital role in keeping your body functioning at its best .
This is especially true if you ’re working out regularly .
Your body relies on these vitamins to keep it running like a well - oiled machine .
Since the list can be pretty extensive , a multivitamin is what many swear by .
When looking for the right multivitamin for you , look for each of these in the ingredient list .
In addition , get yourself checked by a doctor and enquire as to whether there are specific vitamins that you are lacking in .
All - natural Supplements
All - natural supplements often refer to supplements that can be found in natural products .
For example , the herb , fenugreek is known for being an all - natural testosterone booster .
You can reap the benefits of fenugreek by drinking fenugreek tea .
Many consider turning towards all - natural supplements for a cheaper and more natural approach to giving your body all that it needs .
Since many vitamins occur naturally in many foods , seeking out these foods and including more of them in your diet can be just as effective as over - the - counter supplements .
FAQs
You ’re almost at the end of our god - level guide and we ’re sure by now you must have some questions .
Whether they ’re about maintaining your new diet or if you ’re getting enough sleep , we ’ve got you covered .
However , if you find that we ’re missing some of your most burning questions , we ask that you leave us a comment and we will be more than happy to get back to you with an answer !
How to maintain a healthy diet ?
So you ’ve made the big changes and you ’re starting to see your hard work pay off .
This is all well and good but how does one maintain a healthy diet ?
We understand that you ’re only human and you ’re going to find yourself craving some of the most delicious but most unhealthy foods around .
A good trick that we have found is to give yourself short term goals .
Setting 3 - month milestones gives you achievable goals .
This , in turn , makes it easier for you to stick to your healthy diet as you can see the end .
At which point , we suggest rewarding yourself ( within reason ) .
Celebrate the small victories with your favourite unhealthy meal before moving on to achieving your next goal .
It will become easier and easier to stick to and maintain a healthy diet as you will find that your lifestyle will begin to revolve around things other than food .
Your body will also begin to adjust and crave the unhealthy stuff much less than you might at the beginning .
How much sleep is healthy ?
When you sleep , you are giving your body a chance to heal and repair itself .
Many of us do n’t realise it but when you ’re not giving yourself enough sleep , you ’re putting more pressure and strain on both your mind and body .
How much sleep is healthy ?
As an adult man , you should be aiming to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night .
Which can be difficult with a busy schedule , especially if you ’re trying to introduce working out into your routine .
A good way to ensure that you ’re getting the sleep you need is to stick to a sleep schedule .
Try to get yourself ready for bed an hour before you intend to sleep and allow your body to slowly wind - down .
This includes switching off your devices to allow your mind to rest .
Using your phones before bed can stimulate your brain , making it hard to drift off peacefully .
You ’ll be glad to know that exercise helps your body fall asleep easier at night .
However , keep in mind that you should exercise at the start of your day .
If you find this too hard to manage , ensure you workout at least 2 hours before you intend to hit the sack .
What colour is healthy poop and pee ?
Both your poop and pee say a lot about your state of health .
Not only does it indicate if you ’re getting the proper vitamins and minerals , but it can also be an indicator of more serious issues .
If you notice a significant difference in the pattern of your visits to the toilet , you should definitely seek the advice of a doctor .
Healthy poop should be should light yellow to dark brown .
Certain foods can make your poop look a little greener than normal .
However , if your poo appears black or red , it could point to a more serious issue like bleeding in the gut .
Alternatively , you could be reacting to your iron supplements and this is harmless .
This is why it is extremely important to keep tabs on what your body is trying to tell you .
Healthy pee should be a pale yellow .
This is an indication that you are drinking enough water and your body is flushing out unwanted toxins .
Your pee should not be transparent , this indicates that you are possibly drinking too much water .
On the other hand , if your pee appears amber , brown , or reddish you should pay a visit to your doctor as soon as possible .
How to sleep well ?
You know you should be getting 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night .
However , what happens when you find that even though you ’re getting the recommended hours , you ’re not feeling rested .
It is likely that you are not sleeping well .
Your body is n’t being given the opportunity to reach deep sleep .
This is where most of its reparative work is done .
Aromatherapy
If you ’re having a hard time sleeping well , you might want to try aromatherapy .
Aromatherapy oils rely on the benefits of certain herbs and flowers , and the calming effect they have .
For sleep we recommend :
Lavender Vanilla Sandalwood Bergamot Juniper
Play around with the different scents and see which one you like the most .
You might want to even try a combination of a couple .
Not only will you find yourself lulling off to sleep easier but your space will definitely smell fresher !
Sleep music
In addition to aromatherapy oils , you might want to try listening to sleep music .
Many people find it difficult to fall asleep with complete silence .
This is why you might find white noise helpful .
Alternatively , soothing , lyric - free music has been proven to also help soothe the mind .
In turn , making it easier for you to fall asleep and stay asleep .
There are numerous playlists available .
Once again , we recommend you put a few to the test and find one that you find the most effective for you .
Conclusion
Now that you ’ve reached the end of our god - level guide to being healthy and getting ripped easily , we hope that you find ways to incorporate these healthy habits into your daily routine .
Health is all about finding a balance in your lifestyle and taking care of your body !
Remember , health is more than just being muscular .
Listen to what your body is telling you and you will find how easily those beast - like gains come to you !
Moritz Waldemeyer is a master of mechatronics – a job that 's equal parts mechanical engineering and electronics – and the go - to tech guru for some of the biggest names in design ( think Zaha Hadid , Ron Arad and Hussein Chalayan ) .
From robotic dresses to futuristic kitchens , Waldemeyer is known for wiring the low - tech , mundane objects of daily life .
He once designed a smooth - surfaced Corian table with 2,500 integrated LEDs on which passersby could play Pong .
" I specialize in using engineering in art and design , so I get to do all the really crazy projects , " says Waldemeyer .
" People come to me whenever they have a mad idea and they 're not quite sure how to deal with it . "
After building an interactive chandelier for Arad in 2004 that scrolled words sent via text message down a crystal spiral , Waldemeyer was back at work for Swarovski during this year 's Milan furniture fair .
For that event , he rigged up a massive shape - shifting chandelier conceived by design firm Fredrikson Stallard .
Named Pandora , it periodically settles into the form of a classic light fixture before disintegrating into seeming randomness .
The look ?
A mix of order and chaos .
It may be crystal , but do n't expect to find it above your grandmother 's table anytime soon .

Lighting up the $ 1 trillion power market
Silicon Valley has changed the world once .
Now , thanks to a wave of investment and innovation in solar power , it 's on to the next revolution : a massive disruption of the U.S. electricity market .
( Business 2.0 Magazine ) --
There 's a missile - bunker vibe you get when walking into Solaicx , a Silicon Valley startup that manufactures the silicon wafers that are the building blocks of solar panels .
In one half of the nondescript Santa Clara warehouse , three men sit hunched on a wood platform 8 feet above the cement floor , their eyes locked on two monitors .
The screens show data and video gathered from a 24 - foot - tall steel tower .
The tower begins in a squat , gourd - shaped base and tapers to a cannon - size column with a long drum spinning slowly on top .
Thick power cables snake down its sides .
Another sci -fi-looking tower rises up off to one side of the building .
Inside the tower that has everyone 's attention , molten silicon is being added to a thin , 8 - inch - long rod , or " seed , " of silicon .
After 15 hours of precise spinning and pulling , the seed will grow to a mirror - finished ingot about 4 feet long and weighing more than 150 pounds .
If it 's perfect - and that is the point of Solaicx 's cutting - edge technology - it will form a single crystal matrix , which is then trimmed and sliced into 1,000 wafers that sell for $ 5 apiece and are used by companies like General Electric ( Charts ) to build the most efficient solar modules on the market today .
An $ 11 billion solar energy market
Bob Ford , Solaicx 's CEO , bounds down from the platform and brushes a hand along an already cool ingot waiting to be cut into wafers .
His finger stops on a thin seam running laser - straight down the side of the overgrown crystal .
" That 's what you want to see , " Ford says .
" It means every atom is aligned .
I 've had guys literally knock on our front door asking if we can supply them with $ 5 million worth of these wafers a month .
We can sell as much as we can make . "
In fact , before Solaicx even flipped the switch on its first silicon crystal grower , GE promised to buy every wafer the four - year - old company can crank out .
Solaicx is one of dozens of Silicon Valley firms driving a sizzling $ 11 billion worldwide market in solar energy , part of a rapidly expanding alternative - energy economy that promises to shake up the way power is produced and consumed as profoundly as the region 's computer and Internet companies upended global communications and commerce in the late 20th century .
The signs of world - changing transformation are everywhere : Venture capitalists are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into Valley solar startups pursuing technological breakthroughs to make sun power as cheap as fossil fuel .
Three of the largest tech IPOs of 2005 were for solar companies , including San Jose - based SunPower ( Charts ) , a spinoff of chipmaker Cypress Semiconductor .
Other old - line Valley tech companies are also jumping into the market .
Among the most significant is Applied Materials ( Charts ) .
The world 's largest chip - equipment maker will begin producing machines to manufacture solar wafers , laying the groundwork for an industrial infrastructure that should lower the cost of producing solar cells .
For the first time in many years , high - tech manufacturing plants - yes , factories - are being built in Silicon Valley .
On the ballot in California
Why the gold rush ?
Solar is not the only alternative - energy source generating interest in the Valley : Biofuels , fuel cells , and hydrogen power are all attracting their fair share of investment .
But solar energy has just the sort of oversize potential that the titans of tech saw in computing : a free and practically inexhaustible power source that rises every day .
Fears about global warming have triggered public and political demand for renewable energy , which is expected to become a $ 167 billion global market by 2015 .
In September , California enacted landmark global - warming legislation to force the state 's largest industrial polluters to reduce their greenhouse - gas emissions 25 percent by 2020 .
The new law will likely lead to the creation of a California carbon market , allowing clean - energy producers in the world 's sixth - largest economy to sell carbon credits to polluters who can't or wo n't reduce their spew .
A similar regional market is being developed by New York and six other Northeastern states .
California is also committing $ 3.2 billion to fund a drive to install solar panels on a million rooftops by 2018 , and a November ballot initiative backed by Silicon Valley heavyweights such as venture capitalists Vinod Khosla and John Doerr and Google ( Charts ) co-founder Larry Page would tax Big Oil to provide $ 4 billion in funding for alternative - energy research , programs , and startups .
" There are huge forces at work right now , " says Sunil Paul , an Internet entrepreneur turned alternative - energy investor .
" With the subsidies that are already in place in California , and markets for carbon credits emerging , you have the perfect conditions for innovative companies to capture a piece of the $ 1 trillion U.S. electricity market .
As a startup you have a massive number of customers to go after .
And as an investor , it not only makes straight - ahead business sense to put money into these companies , but you can also be excited that you are doing something that 's good for the planet .
That is a powerful combination . "
The end of solar 's dark days
Silicon Valley 's solar flare began smoldering during the dark days of the new millennium .
In 2001 it seemed as if the plug was being pulled , in more ways than one , on the Internet boom that had made the Valley the epicenter of what was then known as the new economy .
While tech startups watched their billion - dollar valuations vanish in a flash and the dotcom death toll grew daily , rolling blackouts swept the Valley as California 's yearlong energy crisis intensified .
With the region in meltdown , some tech entrepreneurs began quietly starting solar companies .
For instance , when Barry Cinnamon 's online shopping site collapsed , he founded Akeena Solar , a solar panel installation firm .
" Solar power is a real brick - and - mortar business , " he explains , " with an incredible long - term demand built in . "
Solar , though , hardly seemed like the next big thing .
Long a cottage industry whose customers tended to live off the grid , solar energy saw its fortunes wax and wane with government subsidies and the price of oil .
Solar panels were expensive , and the basic technology had not changed much in 30 years .
In short , solar was a green business that did n't produce much green .
All of which , of course , made it ripe for technological innovation , Silicon Valley 's stock - in - trade .
And solar is fundamentally a silicon - based business .
By happy coincidence , many of the same materials and processes that the Valley has used for decades to make silicon wafers for computer chips can be reengineered to manufacture silicon solar wafers .
Among those heading back to the garage after the bust were veterans of the Valley 's old - guard chip companies , whose fortunes went into a tailspin along with those of their dotcom customers .
At the same time , tech companies like Google , Microsoft , ( Charts ) and Yahoo ( Charts ) faced spiking energy demands from running the hundreds of thousands of servers they need to power an economy increasingly conducted over the Internet .
A single rack of high - performance servers consumes as much electricity as a suburban home .
A large data center has hundreds of these racks , drawing as much power as a typical university .
Electricity costs can exceed the price of the computers themselves .
For Microsoft , the 2001 blackouts served as a wake - up call .
" We were n't going to sit idly by and let it happen again , " says Microsoft executive John Matheny , who runs the software giant 's Silicon Valley campus .
" That 's when we started investigating alternative power . "
So did a number of entrepreneurs tinkering in garages and anonymous office parks , fueled by the same conditions that gave rise to the computer industry a generation ago : ready access to capital , the presence of top - notch research universities Stanford and UC Berkeley , and an almost messianic belief that the world 's most intractable problems can be solved by technology .
SunPower founder Richard Swanson likens solar to the chip industry in the early ' 70s , when he was a Stanford professor .
" It was an extremely fun and dynamic industry , " he says .
" But unless you were in it , it was practically invisible until the IBM PC came out in 1981 . "
Taking on Big Oil
Semiconductor industry veteran Gary Conley knows the feeling .
He toiled under the radar for seven years to develop his solar technology .
Conley founded H2 Go in 1999 to develop ways to produce cheap hydrogen .
The company ended up creating a solar module - since the production of hydrogen required a cheap power source - and launched SolFocus last November to commercialize the technology .
The timing was right .
" In November we were two guys in my garage , " Conley says .
" Now we 've got 23 employees and $ 32 million in venture funding in the bank . "
SolFocus shows how the booming market in solar has touched off a feeding frenzy among investors in Silicon Valley .
Originally the company was going to close a $ 25 million round of funding in October , but the deal was consummated in July because so many investors were clamoring to get SolFocus growing quickly and bring its technology to market .
The company is ramping up its production of solar modules and hiring six new employees a month , mostly materials and optical scientists and engineers .
Like other solar startups , SolFocus is trying to lower the cost of solar arrays by using less silicon - which is costly and currently in short supply - while at the same time making them more efficient .
The company 's photovoltaic technology uses small lenses and curved mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto solar cells made of germanium , sort of a high - tech version of using a magnifying glass to focus sunlight on a piece of paper to set it aflame .
Within a few years , the company hopes to make solar cheaper than power derived from fossil fuels .
" We see ourselves as competing against Chevron rather than another solar energy company , " Conley says .
" There are tremendous opportunities in the rooftop solar market .
The 10 largest shopping centers in the country alone could produce 6 gigawatts of power with a rooftop solar array . "
Still , SolFocus will face competition from several other solar concentrator companies , including Valley neighbors Pacific SolarTech and Solaria , which landed $ 22 million in VC funding in September .
" There is a gold rush feeling to all of it , " says Solaria CEO Suvi Sharma .
" But there 's also real gold here - or , in our case , sunshine . "
Struggling with ' What 's Next '
Perhaps no startup has benefited more from the solar gold rush than Nanosolar .
The Palo Alto company , co-founded in 2002 by Internet entrepreneur Martin Roscheisen , got its start with an investment from Paul and Google 's Page and Sergey Brin ; all told , it has racked up more than $ 100 million in funding so far .
Nanosolar is pursuing a technology that produces solar cells on a film that 's a 100th the thickness of conventional silicon wafers .
The cells are made from copper , indium , gallium , and diselenide , elements that , while more expensive than silicon , are used in such small amounts that the overall cost is low .
Nanosolar 's thin - film cells are produced by a process that in many ways resembles printing .
Light - sensitive semiconductor particles are mixed into a kind of ink , which is printed onto a thin substrate of metal foil that 's continuously pulled off a series of rolls .
This highly efficient " roll - to - roll " technology makes it possible to produce a large volume of solar cells in a relatively small manufacturing space , further reducing costs .
" The Valley has its periods where everyone 's grappling with what 's next , and now we see that the energy market is a very solid and meaningful market opportunity , " says Roscheisen , whose previous startups , eGroups and TradingDynamics , were sold for a combined $ 1.2 billion before the boom went bust .
" New technology is going to make a difference in solar , and that 's what we do best here . "
The company is housed in a modest , low - slung building across the street from Palo Alto 's airport , and the buzz of private planes taking off and landing permeates its offices .
Nanosolar has built a thin - film solar factory in miniature , complete with a small clean room for testing how the cells respond to extremes of temperature , pressure , and light .
Its ultimate goal : integrating thin - film cells directly into building materials .
A skyscraper 's glass windows , for instance , could be embedded with thin - film cells , giving them energy - producing capabilities .
German and Japan : A step ahead
The possibility of such a breakthrough has many investors salivating .
Nanosolar 's backers include Valley heavyweights Mohr Davidow Ventures and Benchmark Capital , as well as OnPoint Technologies , the venture vehicle of the U.S. Army .
Nanosolar plans to build a manufacturing facility next year - along with a smaller plant in Germany - that will eventually produce 430 megawatts ' worth of solar cells per year .
That would nearly triple the nation 's manufacturing capacity and make Nanosolar one of the world 's largest solar producers .
Thanks to aggressive government subsidies , Germany and Japan are currently the global leaders in solar production , with Japan 's Sharp Electronics the world 's biggest manufacturer of solar cells .
But in September , Silicon Valley took a big step toward the industrialization of solar when Applied Materials launched an ambitious drive to repurpose some of the technologies it now uses to build machines that make silicon wafers and flat - panel video displays .
Microprocessors and solar cells are both made from polysilicon , a refined crystalline form of silicon that can be sliced into wafers .
Applied is betting that advances in materials science , improvements in manufacturing techniques , and mass production will further lower the price of solar cells , just as chipmakers have managed to squeeze the cost of processors over the years , turning personal computers into a mass commodity .
Although solar power is still two to three times more expensive than energy derived from fossil fuels , solar prices have declined steadily .
In 1980 the cost of generating solar power with a silicon cell was about $ 30 per watt ; today it averages $ 3 to $ 4 a watt .
Applied 's goal is to bring the cost down to $ 1 per watt , making it competitive with conventional power sources .
The company predicts that its annual sales of solar gear will reach $ 500 million by 2010 .
" Even if solar energy production grew 25 percent a year for the next 40 years , it still would n't supply a quarter of the expected growth in electricity demand , " says Mark Pinto , Applied 's chief technology officer .
" That 's a good story to be involved in . "
Abundant opportunities
While many of Silicon Valley 's solar startups are still little more than a twinkle in their VCs ' eyes , the opportunity is already generating big cash for some small players , including Cinnamon 's Akeena Solar .
The company , which was started in 2001 with a $ 1,000 bankroll and no business plan , has quickly grown into one of the nation 's largest solar power installers .
On a bright , cloudless September afternoon in the Valley , the kind of relentlessly dazzling California day that makes it seem as though the sun will shine forever , a dozen workers are busy putting the finishing touches on a huge array of 645 solar panels being installed on the roof of a biotech company just south of San Francisco International Airport .
The solar system will soon generate more than 134 kilowatts of electricity , enough to power about 20 homes .
The Black Eyed Peas blast from a nearby boom box as sun-burnished workers secure the large flat solar modules to the roof and begin interconnecting them with electrical wire .
The translucent panels glisten in the sunshine , the light reflected by the presence of the element that gave the area its nickname .
" Silicon Valley , " Cinnamon says , " is moving from a place that uses silicon to make something that consumes energy to one that uses silicon to produce energy . "
Net sales for the Los Gatos , Calif. , company during the second quarter doubled to $ 2.8 million from a year earlier .
Cinnamon now has 50 employees and is hard - pressed to keep up with demand .
Across San Francisco Bay in Berkeley , PowerLight , the nation 's biggest solar panel installer , is experiencing a similar boom .
Sales have been growing at an average of 49 percent since 2001 , and revenue will hit $ 250 million this year .
In April the company completed the largest solar installation in Silicon Valley , putting 31,000 square feet of SunPower solar panels on the roofs of Microsoft 's Mountain View campus .
They now generate 15 percent of the complex 's electricity .
Worries about another bubble
As the solar economy expands , investors see opportunities in consolidating smaller installation firms , as well as in new markets such as battery technologies for storage of solar energy and software to operate the systems .
The advent of a California carbon - trading market will create demand for brokers and software to manage inventory and trades .
Not surprisingly , solar is sparking the sort of optimism not seen in these parts since the go - go dotcom days .
" I believe that the Valley will be the place from which the next wave of solar and other alternative - energy technologies will emerge , " says T.J. Rodgers , CEO of Cypress Semiconductor , whose SunPower subsidiary has seen its revenue soar from $ 10 million in 2004 to a projected $ 230 million this year .
Still , some people worry that the solar market is in danger of becoming , shall we say , overheated .
Khosla , who has pinned his venture fund 's hopes on biofuels , thinks solar is overhyped .
" Even with subsidies , solar is quite uncompetitive , " he said in a speech in September .
The solar market certainly will need to overcome several significant hurdles before it becomes a truly mainstream source of energy .
Solar panels will need to become smaller and lighter so they can be part of the roofing material itself .
Costs will have to be squeezed to get the price of solar power below the game - changing $ 1 per watt .
The current bottleneck in silicon supply will have to be resolved .
And California 's global - warming law is sure to end up in the courts .
As in any boom , many startups will fail , and what seem like promising technologies today will ultimately prove to be as ephemeral as rays of sunshine .
Still , there 's no doubt that the realities of the energy market are radically different than they were in the 1970s , when solar power made its first and largely unsuccessful commercial push .
Higher gas prices are probably here to stay , the Middle East is certain to remain volatile for the foreseeable future , and global warming , alas , is n't going away anytime soon .
Little wonder , then , that the view from Valley rooftops is of blue skies ahead .
Now it 's up to the wizards of Silicon Valley to prove to the world that in the search for solutions to the planet 's toughest problems , there 's always something new under the sun .

If You Were a Terrorist , How Would You Attack ?
The TSA recently announced that most airplane carry - on restrictions will stay in place for at least another year , until new X - ray technology has been fully installed .
Surprisingly , one item that will now be permitted on board is a lighter .
While it seems crazy to keep people from bringing toothpaste , deodorant , or water on a plane , it does n’t seem so strange to ban lighters , which could be used to start fires .
I wonder whether the lighter manufacturers were lobbying for or against this rule change — on the one hand , having 22,000 lighters confiscated per day would seem good for business ; but on the other hand , maybe fewer people will buy lighters if they ca n’t travel with them .
Hearing about these rules got me thinking about what I would do to maximize terror if I were a terrorist with limited resources .
I ’d start by thinking about what really inspires fear .
One thing that scares people is the thought that they could be a victim of an attack .
With that in mind , I ’d want to do something that everybody thinks might be directed at them , even if the individual probability of harm is very low .
Humans tend to overestimate small probabilities , so the fear generated by an act of terrorism is greatly disproportionate to the actual risk .
Also , I ’d want to create the feeling that an army of terrorists exists , which I ’d accomplish by pulling off multiple attacks at once , and then following them up with more shortly thereafter .
Third , unless terrorists always insist on suicide missions ( which I ca n’t imagine they would ) , it would be optimal to hatch a plan in which your terrorists are n’t killed or caught in the act , if possible .
Fourth , I think it makes sense to try to stop commerce , since a commerce breakdown gives people more free time to think about how scared they are .
Fifth , if you really want to impose pain on the U.S. , the act has to be something that prompts the government to pass a bundle of very costly laws that stay in place long after they have served their purpose ( assuming they had a purpose in the first place ) .
My general view of the world is that simpler is better .
My guess is that this thinking applies to terrorism as well .
In that spirit , the best terrorist plan I have heard is one that my father thought up after the D.C. snipers created havoc in 2002 .
The basic idea is to arm 20 terrorists with rifles and cars , and arrange to have them begin shooting randomly at pre-set times all across the country .
Big cities , little cities , suburbs , etc .
Have them move around a lot .
No one will know when and where the next attack will be .
The chaos would be unbelievable , especially considering how few resources it would require of the terrorists .
It would also be extremely hard to catch these guys .
The damage would n’t be as extreme as detonating a nuclear bomb in New York City , of course ; but it sure would be a lot easier to obtain a handful of guns than a nuclear weapon .
I ’m sure many readers have far better ideas .
I would love to hear them .
Consider that posting them could be a form of public service : I presume that a lot more folks who oppose and fight terror read this blog than actual terrorists .
So by getting these ideas out in the open , it gives terror fighters a chance to consider and plan for these scenarios before they occur .

When it comes to domestic issues that pit the interests of large corporations against those of ordinary Americans , few equal the exploding crisis in consumer debt .
Yet with the exception of John Edwards , none of the leading presidential contenders in either party has made this a serious campaign issue .
Perhaps this should n’t come as a surprise , since the same financial institutions that engage in predatory lending practices constitute their largest contributors , as well as what is perhaps the most powerful lobby in all of Washington .
As it stands , approximately 40 percent of American households spend more than they make each year , and the average household debt to credit cards is about $ 10,000 .
According to the Federal Reserve , consumer credit card debt in the United States totals $ 880 billion ; this figure , adjusted to current dollars , has increased a hundred - fold in the last 40 years .
These numbers , huge by any standard , represent a growing factor in the nation ’s questionable economic future .
Those carrying credit card debt are not limited to self - indulgent spenders : “ The Plastic Safety Net , ” a 2005 survey of low and middle income households conducted by Demos and the Center for Responsible Lending , found that declines in public and private benefit programs — health coverage , pensions , and unemployment insurance among them — have contributed to the growth in credit card debt .
For example , 29 percent of households surveyed reported that medical expenses made up a portion of their current balances .
Meanwhile , lenders continue to aggressively troll for new borrowers , including many with low incomes and existing debt .
According to Maxed Out , last year ’s SiCKO - style film about the credit card crisis , lenders send 4 billion credit card offers through the mail every year .
And a 2006 report from the Government Accountability Office documented the growth in sneaky practices the companies use to increase profits — hidden fees , “ trailing ” interest , and so - called disclosures that “ have serious weaknesses that likely reduced consumers ’ ability to understand the costs of using credit cards . ”
Even so , today the credit card business remains virtually unregulated at the national level .
Companies can charge — or change — interest rates at will .
And while the companies may be regulated at the state level , two states , South Dakota and Delaware , have consumer protection laws so weak that credit card companies simply set up shop there and run their operations from these safe havens .
To make the situation worse , the new bankruptcy law that went into effect in 2005 makes it much harder to declare bankruptcy , and requires filers , including those with very modest incomes , to pay off much of their credit card debt regardless .
Initiated in 2001 , the law was vigorously opposed by consumer groups and unions , but championed by the president , whose largest campaign contributor had been the credit card giant MBNA ( which subsequently merged with Bank of America ) .
On an initial vote in 2001 , it also won the support of 36 Senate Democrats , including current presidential candidates Joe Biden , Hillary Clinton , and John Edwards , while only Chris Dodd voted against it ( as did Dennis Kucinich in the House ) .
“ I ’ve never seen a bill that was so one - sided , ” said Consumer Federation of America chair ( and former Ohio senator ) Howard Metzenbaum , at the time .
“ The cries , claims and concerns of vulnerable Americans who have suffered a financial emergency have been drowned out by the political might of the credit card industry . ”
When it came up for a second vote in 2005 , Barack Obama , Kucinich , and Dodd voted against it ; Biden ( who represents credit card central , the state of Delaware ) voted for it .
Hillary Clinton was the only member of the Senate who did n’t vote on the measure .
Now , most of the presidential candidates simply are not confronting the credit card issue .
For Republicans , this is a predictable state of affairs .
But the top three Democrats ’ relationship to powerful lenders is more complicated .
Obama , who made a strong floor speech in opposition to the 2005 bankruptcy bill , nonetheless voted against a key amendment that would have put a cap of 30 percent on interest rates .
Financial firms , according to Ken Silverstein ’s much - discussed Harper ’s article “ Barack Obama Inc. , ” “ constitute Obama ’s second biggest single bloc of donors . ”
You ’ll find nary a word about the debt crisis on his campaign web site .
Hillary Clinton , who receives large sums of money from banks and investment companies , has waffled on the issue .
In the The Two Income Trap : Why Middle - Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke , Harvard law professor Elizabeth Warren recounts a 1998 meeting with Clinton , who was then First Lady .
Clinton wanted to know more about credit cards and how they affected women and Warren , a leading critic of credit card company practices , gave her a short lecture over lunch , focusing on the drawbacks in an earlier version of the new bankruptcy legislation ( which Bill Clinton and the White House staff were quietly supporting in hopes of wooing the banking industry ) .
Warren writes that after their talk , Hillary promised to do what she could to stop the “ awful bill . ”
And , by the time the legislation passed Congress in 2000 , Bill Clinton had changed his position and vetoed it .
An aide later told Warren , “ A couple of days after Mrs. Clinton met with you , we changed sides [ on the bankruptcy bill ] so fast that you could see skid marks in the hallways of the White House . ”
But a year later , Clinton , then a freshman senator , voted for virtually the same bill when it was refloated by Bush .
“ Campaigns cost money , ” Warren writes , “ and that money was n’t coming from families in financial trouble .
Senator Clinton received $ 140,000 in campaign contributions from banking industry executives in a single year , making her one of the top two recipients in the Senate . ”
Despite his 2001 yes vote on the bankruptcy legislation , John Edwards is now one of the only candidates now taking up the issue of consumer debt — relying , in large part , on Elizabeth Warren ’s analysis and ideas .
In a speech on his campaign theme of “ the two Americas ” at Cooper Union in New York City last month , Edwards proposed “ setting up a new consumer commission to be called the Family Savings and Credit Commission … [ to ] deal with all financial services — credit cards , mortgages , car loans , check - cashers , payday loans , investment accounts , and more .
It will ban the most abusive terms and make sure consumers understand the others . ”
Edwards has also more directly pledged to “ pass strong national laws protecting us against the worst abuses in credit markets . ”
( On that front , of course , Congress would have to cooperate . )
Elizabeth Warren agrees that the credit card crisis needs to be addressed through legislation .
“ The current problem is that the Federal Reserve , the Office of the Controller of the Currency , and other financial regulatory institutions are not currently charged to protect consumer safety , ” she explains .
“ The primary responsibility of the regulatory agencies is to assure the profitability of the banks and other lending institutions , not to protect consumers from deceptive and unsafe products . ”
But she is less than sanguine about the chances of such legislation getting through .
“ The U.S. lived with usury laws from colonial days through the early 1980s , when a loophole in a federal banking law effectively abolished them .
The problem is not whether a practical federal usury limit could be established , particularly if the rate were pegged to inflation .
The problem with instituting a new usury law is politics .
The credit industry hires a lot more lobbyists than the consumer advocacy groups , and the creditors have been almost uniformly opposed to any usury laws . ”
Clinton , Obama , and the rest of the Democratic Congress may yet get another chance to go on the record on this issue :
On May 15 , the “ Stop Unfair Practices In Credit Cards Act ” was introduced by Democratic Senators Carl Levin of Michigan and Claire McCaskill of Missouri .
“ We have to fight for those who have not hired dozens of lobbyists to make sure that American consumers are not getting ripped off and are fully informed of how these companies are manipulating their financial security , ” McCaskill said of the bill .
And Chris Dodd , long known as a friend to Wall Street , has held hearings on credit card practices in his new position as chair of the Senate Banking Committee .
None of this means that Americans who ’ve been planning to cut up their cards should put away the scissors and go shopping .
If the bill ever makes it to a vote , it will face a nearly insurmountable obstacle :
All told , in 2006 , financial and credit card companies gave $ 7 million in campaign contributions , and banks $ 25 million , to candidates of both parties , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
Leading the pack , with $ 378,000 , was Hillary Clinton .
Clean manure may sound like an oxymoron , but Dr. Brent Auvermann is working with feedyard owners to help them get the most " spark " from it as a fuel source .
" We 're doing something that has never been done before , " said Arles " Bugs " Graham , Panda Energy International 's general manager for the Hereford plant .
Graham spoke at the meeting .
" We 're using your manure as an energy source , " he said .
" It 's a very complex process . "
After starting up the plant with natural gas as the boiler fuel , Panda Energy will eventually use manure as a fuel source when producing ethanol for an E10 fuel blend , Graham said .
The plant will initially process corn for ethanol , although the company is looking at alternative sources of starch to make the ethanol , and it will produce distiller 's grains as a by - product .
" But manure is our future , " Graham said , estimating each plant will use 1,500 tons a day .
Jim Adams , Panda Energy vice president - fuels , said the plant will begin asking yards in June to sign up for a percentage of their manure .
The past winter was a wake - up call , Adams said .
Sometimes when the weather is too wet , manure can't be harvested from the pens .
Manure will be used by this fall , so " we have to start stockpiling now " to ensure a steady supply .
Adams said the plant will use manure on a six - day basis , requiring 70 to 80 truckloads per day .
Panda 's contractor will collect from the pens when they are dry enough , but will need to pull from stockpiles when pen surfaces are too wet .
Quality is the biggest issue , Auvermann said .
The manure needs to burn at a minimum rate of 2,758 British thermal units per pound of manure .
That number changes according to the amount of pollutants - moisture and dirt - included when the pen is scraped .
If all the water and contaminants were removed from the manure , the highest quality would be 8,500 Btu , " but we can't do that , because we can't take the ash out completely , " he said .
Manure from soil - surfaced pens may not always meet the minimum heating value on an as - received basis , Auvermann said .
Feedyard operators will have to take some steps to improve it .
The timeliness of collection and depth of scraping will be key to keeping dirt content below 60 percent and moisture content below 20 percent , he said .
" Paving the pens with a crushed ash or a fly - ash material ( from coal - fired power plants ) will end up returning to you in the form of heating value û big time , " Auvermann said .
Partially composted manure from paved pens can have a heating value almost equivalent to that generated by burning Texas lignite coal , he said .
Feedyard owners should consider the process as " harvesting manure " rather than cleaning pens , Auvermann said .
The ultimate goal is to have a hard , smooth , well - drained corral surface .
Implementing good practices will pay at the bottom line , he said .
Conscientious manure harvesting can result in higher fuel and fertilizer values , reduced feed requirements for cattle , improved pen drainage , and reduced odor , dust and flies .

The 11 - month - old girl stood in the tub , playing in shallow water with a 2 - year - old girl , both looked after by a teenage mother home alone .
The last moments of normal life in the third - floor apartment on Classon Avenue in Bedford - Stuyvesant , Brooklyn , ended that way , with one young mother , a pot of rice on the stove down the hall and two children in shallow water that would not be shallow enough .
“ It was an accident , ” said the mother , Jovanna Shiriver .
She is just 18 but looked even younger last month in her new surroundings , a visiting room at a jail on Rikers Island , her hair pulled in pigtails .
Short and thin and draped in an adult - size gray jumpsuit , she looked less like an inmate than a girl in a schoolhouse play about jail .
She said , “ I do n’t belong here . ”
On July 3 , Ms. Shiriver was bathing her daughter , 11 - month - old Smeily Ordoñez , and her boyfriend ’s 2 - year - old sister when she stepped away to stir rice for the children .
She returned to find Smeily under the water .
When she and neighbors could not revive her , they called 911 .
The baby was placed on life support and , in the month since , has remained hospitalized on a ventilator .
She was transferred last week from Schneider Children ’s Hospital in New Hyde Park , on Long Island , to Blythedale Children ’s Hospital in Valhalla , in Westchester County , which specializes in medical and physical rehabilitation .
Vermont Governor Jim Douglas in his inaugural address today in Montpelier : “ I propose that by 2010 , Vermont be the nation ’s first true ‘ e - state ’ – the first state to provide universal cellular and broadband coverage everywhere and anywhere within its borders .
When you turn on your laptop , you ’re connected .
When you hit the send button on your cell phone , the call goes through .
There would be no more endless downloads , no more hopeless hellos , and no more ‘ can you hear me now . ’ ”
If your business or business idea involves serving a fully online population , you should consider field trials here in Vermont ; we ’re going to be the first “ e- state ” but the others are sure to follow You might even want to consider locating here .
This is already a great place to live ; now it ’ll have great connectivity as well .
You can easily get out of sight of civilization in Vermont ; whether you ’re also out of touch is your choice .
This is the vision Governor Douglas presented to the legislature .
The proposed mechanism for assuring that this tough goal is achieved is a State Rural Telecommunications Authority which will issue up to $ 40 million of State - backed bonding which the Governor expects will be the seed for more than an additional $ 200 million in private investment – all aimed at building communication infrastructure .
Much of the State money will go to build towers to assure universal coverage ; rentals from the towers and other facilities built will fund the indebtedness .
Use of State land and right of way will speed the process .
Jim Douglas gets it : “ Wireless communications and broadband internet access are near the point of convergence – meaning the technologies that support each will be the same .
More specifically , modern telecommunications will be based on Internet Protocol , or IP , a digital language that can support voice calls – like cell phones and standard telephones – as well as internet communications – such as email and web pages . ”
It does n’t stop there .
Knowing that broadband is universally available gives Vermont the freedom to build the next generation of state services to take advantage of this connectivity .
Teachers can give Internet - dependant homework .
Ca n’t do that today when too many members of the class may not have decent Internet access .
University of Vermont and the State Colleges which are already pioneers in distance learning can reach ALL of the population .
Home health care can be radically improved .
Vermonters can be monitored at home ; doctors do n’t have to be in the hospital or their offices to see results .
The new communication systems for emergency services will be built over a wireless IP infrastructure .
Imagine what this means for a next generation of E-911 .
It also means the end of the ridiculous situation where different first responder units can’t communicate with each other because their radios support different frequencies .
Instate business will obviously benefit from better communication capability and lower communication costs .
It will be easier for Vermonters to buy instate ( if that ’s what they want ) or sell out of state .
Without the density to support much mass transit , Vermont ’s economy is hurt when the price of imported energy goes up .
But the ability to substitute communication for transportation helps the environment , the economy , and the pocketbooks of individual Vermonters .
This is a bold vision .
Three years is not a long time .
But Vermont is determined to be an Internet leader in Internet time .
Full disclosure : I ’ve worked with the Governor ’s Telecom Advisory Council which provided significant input to this plan and have been giving both solicited and unsolicited advice as the plan developed .
I ’m an admirer of and rabid partisan of this bold stroke so it ’s possible that my coverage will be slanted by my enthusiasm and / or participation .
However , except where otherwise stated , all opinions in this post are mine and not necessarily the opinions of any other person or body .

ON THE evening of August 22nd 1991 — 16 years ago this week —
Alexei Kondaurov , a KGB general , stood by the darkened window of his Moscow office and watched a jubilant crowd moving towards the KGB headquarters in Lubyanka Square .
A coup against Mikhail Gorbachev had just been defeated .
The head of the KGB who had helped to orchestrate it had been arrested , and Mr Kondaurov was now one of the most senior officers left in the fast - emptying building .
For a moment the thronged masses seemed to be heading straight towards him .
Then their anger was diverted to the statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky , the KGB 's founding father .
A couple of men climbed up and slipped a rope round his neck .
Then he was yanked up by a crane .
Watching “ Iron Felix ” sway in mid-air , Mr Kondaurov , who had served in the KGB since 1972 , felt betrayed “ by Gorbachev , by Yeltsin , by the impotent coup leaders ” .
He remembers thinking , “ I will prove to you that your victory will be short - lived . ”
Those feelings of betrayal and humiliation were shared by 500,000 KGB operatives across Russia and beyond , including Vladimir Putin , whose resignation as a lieutenant - colonel in the service had been accepted only the day before .
Eight years later , though , the KGB men seemed poised for revenge .
Just before he became president , Mr Putin told his ex-colleagues at the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , the KGB 's successor , “ A group of FSB operatives , dispatched under cover to work in the government of the Russian federation , is successfully fulfilling its task . ”
He was only half joking .
Over the two terms of Mr Putin 's presidency , that “ group of FSB operatives ” has consolidated its political power and built a new sort of corporate state in the process .
Men from the FSB and its sister organisations control the Kremlin , the government , the media and large parts of the economy — as well as the military and security forces .
According to research by Olga Kryshtanovskaya , a sociologist at the Russian Academy of Sciences , a quarter of the country 's senior bureaucrats are siloviki —a Russian word meaning , roughly , “ power guys ” , which includes members of the armed forces and other security services , not just the FSB .
The proportion rises to three - quarters if people simply affiliated to the security services are included .
These people represent a psychologically homogeneous group , loyal to roots that go back to the Bolsheviks ' first political police , the Cheka .
As Mr Putin says repeatedly , “ There is no such thing as a former Chekist . ”
By many indicators , today 's security bosses enjoy a combination of power and money without precedent in Russia 's history .
The Soviet KGB and its pre-revolutionary ancestors did not care much about money ; power was what mattered .
Influential though it was , the KGB was a “ combat division ” of the Communist Party , and subordinate to it .
As an outfit that was part intelligence organisation , part security agency and part secret political police , it was often better informed , but it could not act on its own authority ; it could only make “ recommendations ” .
In the 1970s and 1980s it was not even allowed to spy on the party bosses and had to act within Soviet laws , however inhuman .
The KGB provided a crucial service of surveillance and suppression ; it was a state within a state .
Now , however , it has become the state itself .
Apart from Mr Putin , “ There is nobody today who can say no to the FSB , ” says Mr Kondaurov .
All important decisions in Russia , says Ms Kryshtanovskaya , are now taken by a tiny group of men who served alongside Mr Putin in the KGB and who come from his home town of St Petersburg .
In the next few months this coterie may well decide the outcome of next year 's presidential election .
But whoever succeeds Mr Putin , real power is likely to remain in the organisation .
Of all the Soviet institutions , the KGB withstood Russia 's transformation to capitalism best and emerged strongest .
“ Communist ideology has gone , but the methods and psychology of its secret police have remained , ” says Mr Kondaurov , who is now a member of parliament .
Scotched , not killed
Mr Putin 's ascent to the presidency of Russia was the result of a chain of events that started at least a quarter of a century earlier , when Yuri Andropov , a former head of the KGB , succeeded Leonid Brezhnev as general secretary of the Communist Party .
Andropov 's attempts to reform the stagnating Soviet economy in order to preserve the Soviet Union and its political system have served as a model for Mr Putin .
Early in his presidency Mr Putin unveiled a plaque at the Lubyanka headquarters that paid tribute to Andropov as an “ outstanding political figure ” .
Staffed by highly educated , pragmatic men recruited in the 1960s and 1970s , the KGB was well aware of the dire state of the Soviet economy and the antique state of the party bosses .
It was therefore one of the main forces behind perestroika , the loose policy of restructuring started by Mr Gorbachev in the 1980s .
Perestroika 's reforms were meant to give the Soviet Union a new lease of life .
When they threatened its existence , the KGB mounted a coup against Mr Gorbachev .
Ironically , this precipitated the Soviet collapse .
AP
But Iron Felix bounced back
The defeat of the coup gave Russia an historic chance to liquidate the organisation .
“ If either Gorbachev or Yeltsin had been bold enough to dismantle the KGB during the autumn of 1991 , he would have met little resistance , ” wrote Yevgenia Albats , a journalist who has courageously covered the grimmest chapters in the KGB 's history .
Instead , both Mr Gorbachev and Yeltsin tried to reform it .
The “ blue blood ” of the KGB — the First Chief Directorate , in charge of espionage — was spun off into a separate intelligence service .
The rest of the agency was broken into several parts .
Then , after a few short months of talk about openness , the doors of the agency slammed shut again and the man charged with trying to reform it , Vadim Bakatin , was ejected .
His glum conclusion , delivered at a conference in 1993 , was that although the myth about the KGB 's invincibility had collapsed , the agency itself was very much alive .
Indeed it was .
The newly named Ministry of Security continued to “ delegate ” the officers of the “ active reserve ” into state institutions and commercial firms .
Soon KGB officers were staffing the tax police and customs services .
As Boris Yeltsin himself admitted by the end of 1993 , all attempts to reorganise the KGB were “ superficial and cosmetic ” ; in fact , it could not be reformed .
“ The system of political police has been preserved , ” he said , “ and could be resurrected . ”
Yet Mr Yeltsin , though he let the agency survive , did not use it as his power base .
In fact , the KGB was cut off from the post - Soviet redistribution of assets .
Worse still , it was upstaged and outwitted by a tiny group of opportunists , many of them Jews ( not a people beloved by the KGB ) , who became known as the oligarchs .
Between them , they grabbed most of the country 's natural resources and other privatised assets .
KGB officers watched the oligarchs get super - rich while they stayed cash - strapped and sometimes even unpaid .
Some officers did well enough , but only by offering their services to the oligarchs .
To protect themselves from rampant crime and racketeering , the oligarchs tried to privatise parts of the KGB .
Their large and costly security departments were staffed and run by ex-KGB officers .
They also hired senior agency men as “ consultants ” .
Fillip Bobkov , the head of the Fifth Directorate ( which dealt with dissidents ) , worked for a media magnate , Vladimir Gusinsky .
Mr Kondaurov , a former spokesman for the KGB , worked for Mikhail Khodorkovsky , who ran and largely owned Yukos .
“ People who stayed in the FSB were B - list , ” says Mark Galeotti , a British analyst of the Russian special services .
Lower - ranking staff worked as bodyguards to Russia 's rich .
( Andrei Lugovoi , the chief suspect in the murder in London last year of Alexander Litvinenko , once guarded Boris Berezovsky , an oligarch who , facing arrest in Russia , now lives in Britain . )
Hundreds of private security firms staffed by KGB veterans sprang up around the country and most of them , though not all , kept their ties to their alma mater .
According to Igor Goloshchapov , a former KGB special - forces commando who is now a spokesman for almost 800,000 private security men ,
In the 1990s we had one objective : to survive and preserve our skills .
We did not consider ourselves to be separate from those who stayed in the FSB .
We shared everything with them and we saw our work as just another form of serving the interests of the state .
We knew that there would come a moment when we would be called upon .
That moment came on New Year 's Eve 1999 , when Mr Yeltsin resigned and , despite his views about the KGB , handed over the reins of power to Mr Putin , the man he had put in charge of the FSB in 1998 and made prime minister a year later .
The inner circle
As the new president saw things , his first task was to restore the management of the country , consolidate political power and neutralise alternative sources of influence : oligarchs , regional governors , the media , parliament , opposition parties and non-governmental organisations .
His KGB buddies helped him with the task .
AFP
The flowers fade , the Lubyanka stands
The most politically active oligarchs , Mr Berezovsky , who had helped Mr Putin come to power , and Mr Gusinsky , were pushed out of the country , and their television channels were taken back into state hands .
Mr Khodorkovsky , Russia 's richest man , was more stubborn .
Despite several warnings , he continued to support opposition parties and NGOs and refused to leave Russia .
In 2003 the FSB arrested him and , after a show trial , helped put him in jail .
To deal with unruly regional governors , Mr Putin appointed special envoys with powers of supervision and control .
Most of them were KGB veterans .
The governors lost their budgets and their seats in the upper house of the Russian parliament .
Later the voters lost their right to elect them .
All the strategic decisions , according to Ms Kryshtanovskaya , were and still are made by the small group of people who have formed Mr Putin 's informal politburo .
They include two deputy heads of the presidential administration : Igor Sechin , who officially controls the flow of documents but also oversees economic matters , and Viktor Ivanov , responsible for personnel in the Kremlin and beyond .
Then come Nikolai Patrushev , the head of the FSB , and Sergei Ivanov , a former defence minister and now the first deputy prime minister .
All are from St Petersburg , and all served in intelligence or counter - intelligence .
Mr Sechin is the only one who does not advertise his background .
That two of the most influential men , Mr Sechin and Viktor Ivanov , hold only fairly modest posts ( each is a deputy head ) and seldom appear in public is misleading .
It was , after all , common Soviet practice to have a deputy , often linked to the KGB , who carried more weight than his notional boss .
“ These people feel more comfortable when they are in the shadows , ” explains Ms Kryshtanovskaya .
In any event , each of these KGB veterans has a plethora of followers in other state institutions .
One of Mr Patrushev 's former deputies , also from the KGB , is the minister of the interior , in charge of the police .
Sergei Ivanov still commands authority within the army 's headquarters .
Mr Sechin has close family ties to the minister of justice .
The prosecution service , which in Soviet times at least nominally controlled the KGB 's work , has now become its instrument , along with the tax police .
The political clout of these siloviki is backed by ( or has resulted in ) state companies with enormous financial resources .
Mr Sechin , for example , is the chairman of Rosneft , Russia 's largest state - run oil company .
Viktor Ivanov heads the board of directors of Almaz - Antei , the country 's main producer of air - defence rockets , and of Aeroflot , the national airline .
Sergei Ivanov oversees the military - industrial complex and is in charge of the newly created aircraft - industry monopoly .
But the siloviki reach farther , into all areas of Russian life .
They can be found not just in the law - enforcement agencies but in the ministries of economy , transport , natural resources , telecoms and culture .
Several KGB veterans occupy senior management posts in Gazprom , Russia 's biggest company , and its pocket bank , Gazprombank ( whose vice - president is the 26 - year - old son of Sergei Ivanov ) .
Alexei Gromov , Mr Putin 's trusted press secretary , sits on the board of Channel One , Russia 's main television channel .
The railway monopoly is headed by Vladimir Yakunin , a former diplomat who served his country at the United Nations in New York and is believed to have held a high rank in the KGB .
Sergei Chemezov , Mr Putin's old KGB friend from his days in Dresden ( where the president worked from 1985 to 1990 ) , is in charge of Rosoboronexport , a state arms agency that has grown on his watch into a vast conglomerate .
The list goes on .
Many officers of the active reserve have been seconded to Russia 's big companies , both private and state - controlled , where they draw a salary while also remaining on the FSB payroll .
“ We must make sure that companies do n't make decisions that are not in the interest of the state , ” one current FSB colonel explains .
Being an active - reserve officer in a firm is , says another KGB veteran , a dream job : “ You get a huge salary and you get to keep your FSB card . ”
One such active - reserve officer is the 26 - year - old son of Mr Patrushev who was last year seconded from the FSB to Rosneft , where he is now advising Mr Sechin .
( After seven months at Rosneft , Mr Putin awarded Andrei Patrushev the Order of Honour , citing his professional successes and “ many years of conscientious work ” . )
Rosneft was the main recipient of Yukos 's assets after the firm was destroyed .
The attack on Yukos , which entered its decisive stage just as Mr Sechin was appointed to Rosneft , was the first and most blatant example of property redistribution towards the siloviki , but not the only one .
Mikhail Gutseriev , the owner of Russneft , a fast - growing oil company , was this month forced to give up his business after being accused of illegal activities .
For a time , he had refused ; but , as he explained , “ they tightened the screws ” and one state agency after another — the general prosecutor 's office , the tax police , the interior ministry — began conducting checks on him .
From oligarchy to spookocracy
The transfer of financial wealth from the oligarchs to the siloviki was perhaps inevitable .
It certainly met with no objection from most Russians , who have little sympathy for “ robber barons ” .
It even earned the siloviki a certain popularity .
But whether they will make a success of managing their newly acquired assets is doubtful .
“ They know how to break up a company or to confiscate something .
But they do n't know how to manage a business .
They use force simply because they do n't know any other method , ” says an ex-KGB spook who now works in business .
Curiously , the concentration of such power and economic resources in the hands of a small group of siloviki , who identify themselves with the state , has not alienated people in the lower ranks of the security services .
There is trickle - down of a sort : the salary of an average FSB operative has gone up several times over the past decade , and a bit of freelancing is tolerated .
Besides , many Russians inside and outside the ranks believe that the transfer of assets from private hands to the siloviki is in the interests of the state .
“ They are getting their own back and they have the right to do so , ” says Mr Goloshchapov .
The rights of the siloviki , however , have nothing to do with the formal kind that are spelled out in laws or in the constitution .
What they are claiming is a special mission to restore the power of the state , save Russia from disintegration and frustrate the enemies that might weaken it .
Such idealistic sentiments , says Mr Kondaurov , coexist with an opportunistic and cynical eagerness to seize the situation for personal or institutional gain .

Ivanov , Putin and Patrushev : the agency marches forward
The security servicemen present themselves as a tight brotherhood entitled to break any laws for the sake of their mission .
Their high language is laced with profanity , and their nationalism is often combined with contempt for ordinary people .
They are , however , loyal to each other .
Competition to enter the service is intense .
The KGB picked its recruits carefully .
Drawn from various institutes and universities , they then went to special KGB schools .
Today the FSB Academy in Moscow attracts the children of senior siloviki ; a vast new building will double its size .
The point , says Mr Galeotti , the British analyst , “ is not just what you learn , but who you meet there ” .
Graduates of the FSB Academy may well agree .
“ A Chekist is a breed , ” says a former FSB general .
A good KGB heritage — a father or grandfather , say , who worked for the service — is highly valued by today 's siloviki .
Marriages between siloviki clans are also encouraged .
Viktor Cherkesov , the head of Russia 's drug - control agency , who was still hunting dissidents in the late 1980s , has summed up the FSB psychology in an article that has become the manifesto of the siloviki and a call for consolidation .
We [
siloviki
] must understand that we are one whole .
History ruled that the weight of supporting the Russian state should fall on our shoulders .
I believe in our ability , when we feel danger , to put aside everything petty and to remain faithful to our oath .
As well as invoking secular patriotism , Russia 's security bosses can readily find allies among the priesthood .
Next to the FSB building in Lubyanka Square stands the 17th - century church of the Holy Wisdom , “ restored in August 2001 with zealous help from the FSB , ” says a plaque .
Inside , freshly painted icons gleam with gold .
“ Thank God there is the FSB .
All power is from God and so is theirs , ” says Father Alexander , who leads the service .
A former KGB general agrees : “ They really believe that they were chosen and are guided by God and that even the high oil prices they have benefited from are God 's will . ”
Sergei Grigoryants , who has often been interrogated and twice imprisoned ( for anti-Soviet propaganda ) by the KGB , says the security chiefs believe “ that they are the only ones who have the real picture and understanding of the world . ”
At the centre of this picture is an exaggerated sense of the enemy , which justifies their very existence : without enemies , what are they for ?
“ They believe they can see enemies where ordinary people can't , ” says Ms Kryshtanovskaya .
“ A few years ago , we succumbed to the illusion that we do n't have enemies and we have paid dearly for that , ” Mr Putin told the FSB in 1999 .
It is a view shared by most KGB veterans and their successors .
The greatest danger comes from the West , whose aim is supposedly to weaken Russia and create disorder .
“ They want to make Russia dependent on their technologies , ” says a current FSB staffer .
“ They have flooded our market with their goods .
Thank God we still have nuclear arms . ”
The siege mentality of the siloviki and their anti-Westernism have played well with the Russian public .
Mr Goloshchapov , the private agents ' spokesman , expresses the mood this way : “ In Gorbachev 's time Russia was liked by the West and what did we get for it ?
We have surrendered everything : eastern Europe , Ukraine , Georgia .
NATO has moved to our borders . ”
From this perspective , anyone who plays into the West 's hands at home is the internal enemy .
In this category are the last free - thinking journalists , the last NGOs sponsored by the West and the few liberal politicians who still share Western values .
To sense the depth of these feelings , consider the response of one FSB officer to the killing of Anna Politkovskaya , a journalist whose books criticising Mr Putin and his brutal war in Chechnya are better known outside than inside Russia .
“ I do n't know who killed her , but her articles were beneficial to the Western press .
She deserved what she got . ”
And so , by this token , did Litvinenko , the ex-KGB officer poisoned by polonium in London last year .
In such a climate , the idea that Russia 's security services are entitled to deal ruthlessly with enemies of the state , wherever they may be , has gained wide acceptance and is supported by a new set of laws .
One , aimed at “ extremism ” , gives the FSB and other agencies ample scope to pursue anyone who acts or speaks against the Kremlin .
It has already been invoked against independent analysts and journalists .
A lawyer who complained to the Constitutional Court about the FSB 's illegal tapping of his client 's telephone has been accused of disclosing state secrets .
Several scientists who collaborated with foreign firms are in jail for treason .
Despite their loyalty to old Soviet roots , today 's security bosses differ from their predecessors .
They do not want a return to communist ideology or an end to capitalism , whose fruits they enjoy .
They have none of the asceticism of their forebears .
Nor do they relish mass repression : in a country where fear runs deep , attacking selected individuals does the job .
But the concentration of such power and money in the hands of the security services does not bode well for Russia .
And not very good at their job
The creation of enemies may smooth over clan disagreements and fuel nationalism , but it does not make the country more secure or prosperous .
While the FSB reports on the ever - rising numbers of foreign spies , accuses scientists of treason and hails its “ brotherhood ” , Russia remains one of the most criminalised , corrupt and bureaucratic countries in the world .
During the crisis at a school in Beslan in 2004 , the FSB was good at harassing journalists trying to find out the truth .
But it could not even cordon off the school in which the hostages were held .
Under the governorship of an ex-FSB colleague of Mr Putin , Ingushetia , the republic that borders Chechnya , has descended into a new theatre of war .
The army is plagued by crime and bullying .
Private businessmen are regularly hassled by law - enforcement agencies .
Russia 's foreign policy has turned out to be self - fulfilling : by perpetually denouncing enemies on every front , it has helped to turn many countries from potential friends into nervous adversaries .
The rise to power of the KGB veterans should not have been surprising .
In many ways , argues Inna Solovyova , a Russian cultural historian , it had to do with the qualities that Russians find appealing in their rulers : firmness , reserve , authority and a degree of mystery .
“ The KGB fitted this description , or at least knew how to seem to fit it . ”
But are they doing the country any good ?
“ People who come from the KGB are tacticians .
We have never been taught to solve strategic tasks , ” says Mr Kondaurov .
The biggest problem of all , he and a few others say , is the agency 's loss of professionalism .
He blushes when he talks about the polonium capers in London .
“ We never sank to this level , ” he sighs .
“ What a blow to the country 's reputation ! ”

Generating income online is a dream for many people , as they get to take control of their time and spend more moments with their families .
Although online ventures are as not difficult as they seem , they need high levels of discipline .
There are endless paths for making money on the internet , ranging from affiliate marketing , email marketing , online training , podcasting , and online surveys .
Some of these options will return immediate results to help with monthly bills while others will potentially impact your long - term financial plans .
While money can be generated and spent , you cannot recreate time .
Time is the most valuable asset on online platforms .
If you are lucky enough have a lot of time , you can choose to focus on passive income .
This means that you would put a lot of effort and patience and not get paid immediately .
You ’ll reap the benefits somewhere down the road .
The good thing about passive income is that you will keep getting paid even when you stop putting in active work .
When you are working a nine - to - five job , however , you may lack this luxury of time and opt for passive income .
Working online needs a level of creativity to implement new income - generation tactics .
Most people begin their online pursuits with starting a blog , which provides the foundation for their online businesses .
Choosing the Right Niche
Your success in the online marketplace will be anchored on your niche .
These niches include nutrition and health , finances , and personal development .
Weight loss is also quite popular .
The tactic is to avoid spreading yourself too thin in trying to serve many markets .
Not all niches will interest you just as not all of them will be profitable which is why you need to choose one carefully .
Focusing efforts in a single area has a host of benefits .
You will understand the needs of your specific customer base and your marketing strategies will be tailored to appeal to them .
The expert status you will build when serving this market will establish you as an industry leader and make customers trust you .
The startup costs are low , and there is also a lesser risk in focusing on a specific market .
The first step in searching for a niche is to list all the potential idea for your business .
Do not think much about these concepts at this stage .
You can list your hobbies and interests as well as previous work experience that could morph into a business .
Pick the top five as you want to make sure you are passionate about the ideas for the company to be successful .
The next step is to determine the profitability of these ideas .
You can follow these steps to narrow down a niche :
Search Engine Search - People generally rely on search engines to navigate through the internet .
You can search for the broad topic and then for the more specific aspects .
Search results will include websites and blogs dedicated to the topic and articles as well .
You will need to check other online businesses focused on the topic .
The more competition , the more potential customers in the market .
If there are few results , the niche is not as profitable .
Keyword Search -
There are several resources to determine the profitability of a keyword including Google AdWords Keyword Planner .
If the keyword has over 10,000 searches in a month , then there is a good customer base for it .
Use Amazon -
The giant retailer has tons of information across all markets .
You can search for various topics and check which ones have the most products or customer interest .
Affiliate marketing sites dedicated to various niches will also give you a rough idea of the potential market .
5 Good Ways to Make Money Online
Once you have picked your niche , you can explore various ways of generating online income .
Below you will find 5 ways to generate good money online , however there are numerous other ways to make money from home .
1. Ads
Online advertisements offer a solid way of earning online income .
Some methods you can explore include :
Blogging -
The pay per click approach means that an advertiser will compensate you for every time their ads are clicked on your blog .
You can opt to sell direct ads on your site .
Blogs commonly have an “ Advertise with us ” page where you list the various formats of advertisements you offer and the cost per month .
Another type of ads are text - links where a piece of text connects a user from your site to another website .
Pop-ads are also commonly used as pop-unders or pop-tops .
Google Ads - Google AdSense is noted as the top ad provider in the world .
The program relies on internet search technology to display ads .
If someone visits a web page dedicated to yoga , for example , Google will display ads for yoga attire or yoga practices .
As the owner of the website , you will get rewarded every time an individual clicks on the ad .
This concept is called Cost Per Click advertising .
Facebook Ads - Facebook has more than 2 billion active users .
You can run ads for your own products / services or advertise for clients .
2. Affiliate Marketing
Affiliate marketing is a common strategy where people partner with businesses to earn commission by referring other people to their products .
An affiliate venture can become quite profitable and earn you passive income .
The links of the items you are advertising have a unique code which will alert the company that the customer was directed from your website , and you will subsequently get a commission .
Affiliate marketing is a strategy , which means that you will need to be intentional about getting a lot of commission .
Creating engaging content is the first step to courting the kind of profits you want .
Your posts should convince your audience to read on and learn about the product / service .
SEO strategies are also favored by online marketers .
You will need to load a lot of keywords naturally on your site and ensure that your posts are as resourceful as they can be .
Most affiliate marketers seek for paid traffic from social media platforms .
An email list is another means of creating organic traffic .
You need to lure people into signing up , and you can use giveaways .
The aim is to get them to trust you so that they will easily purchase your suggestions .
Another secret weapon commonly used among marketers is upselling .
A salesperson will encourage the purchase of a more expensive option in the form of an upgraded product or add - ons .
Marketers sometimes offer discounts if you sign up for a service for a long time .
Affiliate marketing needs some passion too , as selling products you are also interested in will be more convincing to your readers .
It is quite hard to advertise something you have no interest in .
Affiliate marketing works in a pretty straightforward fashion .
The standard structure is the pay per sale where an affiliate gets a percentage of the sale which results from the strategies of the affiliate .
The affiliate must , therefore , get the client to actually buy the services .
Pay per lead describes a situation where an affiliate encourages the reader to check out the merchant ’s site and perform actions like signing up for trial runs and filling contact forms .
In the pay per click structure , an affiliate is compensated for an increase in traffic on the merchant ’s website .
3. eBooks
Ebooks are books available in a format that can be downloaded online .
You can hire writers , write one yourself , or even use public domain content .
Ebooks have disrupted the traditional publishing industry .
They serve niches and include travel guides , self - help , technology , and romance .
You wo n’t need publishers or agents or even a bookstore to distribute and publish your ebooks .
The entire process depends on your efforts .
Self - published authors are enjoying massive success with greater access to the literary market .
Ebook publishers can launch their websites and sell the ebooks directly .
You might attach a PDF and a PayPal or shopping cart link .
Once a reader orders , they will get a link to download the book .
This process is mostly automated , and you will only be monitoring the site .
Other publishers opt to sell via third - party platforms like Amazon .
The Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing has a reach of millions of people even though they demand a commission .
About 38 % of daily purchases on ebooks are of self - published titles .
Once you upload your book , Kindle transforms it into its proprietary format and puts it up for sale .
You can even use the two platforms to maximize profits .
Ebooks need content to be bestsellers .
Your blog posts can be accumulated into a book once you organize them in a manner that makes sense .
Ghostwriters can also be hired from freelance sites to write the ebook .
Traditional publishers only market a few books , mostly those from best - selling writers .
As an ebook publisher , you have the marketing power in your hands .
A multichannel approach is advisable when you want to take marketing to social media .
Leverage on recognizable brands like Facebook and Linkedin , as well as niche platforms .
You can offer the first chapter for free to let people experience a part of your product .
4. Online Courses
The internet is just not a platform for interacting and entertainment , but it also has informational resources .
From video tutorials to recipes , people are turning online for instructions .
This need for information has resulted in a host of opportunities for many people .
Online courses are being increasingly used by people selling their knowledge and skills .
You do not have to be a professional or expert to create or sell an online course .
You can make money on topics like gardening , baking , music , photography , and personal development .
Take an inventory of your experience and skills to start , and try to recall challenges you may have faced in the past .
You may find that people are struggling with the same issues and would benefit from details of how you overcame them yourself .
Do not hesitate from testing your ideas to gauge the potential response .
The content you offer should contain an in - depth guide into the topic and touch on the important aspects .
A course is unlike a blog post in this regard .
Think in terms of lessons and modules when you organize the course to make it easier for readers to understand .
You will need to know where readers will access it .
A good platform is your website .
Udemy is ranked as the top marketplaces when it comes to selling online courses .
There are over 5 million registered users , and the platform handles video hosting and payment processing .
The bulk of the marketing efforts will , however , lie with you .
5. Membership Sites
A membership site is a platform where members can access whatever is offered on a monthly fee .
The sites can offer tutorials , webinars , templates , reports , or apps .
People join these sites to get resourceful information with more details than the articles on the internet .
Membership sites vary greatly in practice .
An online course , for example , can be delivered as a single weekly lesson through email .
Daily content is commonly used for industrial insights and product deals .
These sites have a membership area which can be accessed by members at their convenience .
A software subscription is a good idea for technical enthusiasts .
An application or WordPress plugin can earn you a lot of monthly fees .
The drip feed courses are online courses that are released gradually and teach members a particular skill .
Successful membership sites have active owners .
People commonly join a membership site because they relate with the story of the owner , which is why you need to keep being interactive to maintain this emotional connection .
You can organize group challenges and events to keep the members active and offer small prizes as incentives .
Another strategy is to invite influencers to the platform for free .
Wrapping Up
Working online is no longer a trend .
A computer and internet connection is all it takes to generate income online .
The internet poses immense opportunities and risks as well .
You can make good money fast , but you will need to sweat for the sizeable returns that keep giving .
Online marketing has opened up endless ventures for internet users .
You can simply host ads on your site and have them make you passive income .
Another favored way is affiliate marketing , where you channel traffic to a merchant ’s products and services and generate commission .
Online courses and ebooks have gained popularity at a time when people value specific education rather than general instructions they will never use .
Most of these online ventures rely on great marketing , organic content , and SEO strategies .

Those as intrigued as we were with Asus ' newly - announced Eee PC 701 ultralight will likely want to take the short hop over to Engadget Chinese , which has managed to gets its hands on the device and dig up a few more details on it .
Perhaps most interestingly , Asus ' product manger told them that while Windows XP has been successfully tested with the device , the final product will likely come with only Linux pre-installed , with XP driver support thrown in for good measure .
What 's more , Asus also said that the mini-laptop could eventually pack as much as 32 GB of SSD storage , and even hinted at the possibility of either an optional built - in 3G module or a separate dongle .
Asus also reiterated that seemingly too good to be true $ 200 starting price , adding that a version for " English speaking countries " could be available " as early as August this year . "
Indeed , Mr. Bush ’s decision may have given birth to a new sort of legal document .
“ I anticipate that we ’re going to get a new motion called ‘ the Libby motion , ’ ” Professor Podgor said .
“ It will basically say , ‘ My client should have got what Libby got , and here ’s why . ’ ”
As a purely legal matter , of course , Mr. Bush ’s statement has no particular force outside Mr. Libby ’s case .
But that does not mean judges will necessarily ignore it .
No one disputes that Mr. Bush has the authority under the Constitution to issue pardons and commutations for federal crimes .
But experts in the area , pointing to political scandals in the Reagan , Truman and Grant administrations , said Mr. Bush had acted with unusual speed .
“ What distinguishes Scooter Libby from the acts of clemency in the other three episodes , ” said P. S. Ruckman Jr. , a political science professor who studies pardons at Rock Valley College in Rockford , Ill. , referring to Mr. Libby by his nickname , “ is that in those episodes they generally served their time and some other president pardoned them . ”
Mr. Bush repeated yesterday that he had found Mr. Libby ’s punishment to be too severe .
But experts in federal sentencing law said a sentence of 30 months for lying and obstruction was consistent with the tough sentences routinely meted out by the federal system .
“ On what legal basis could he have reached that result ? ” asked Frank O. Bowman III , an authority on federal sentencing who teaches law at the University of Missouri - Columbia , said of the commutation .
“ There is no legal basis . ”
Nor is there a reason to think that the Justice Department has changed its position about the sentencing system generally .
Indeed , Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales said last month that the department would push for legislation making federal sentences tougher and less flexible .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
Let 's pause for a moment amid the worshipful buzz before the launch of Apple 's iPhone in June to consider the heretical notion that Steve Jobs might be promising more than he can deliver .
It would n't be the first time .
There was the Apple III computer , introduced in 1980 , which was prone to overheating , followed three years later by an acrobatic flop called the Lisa .
( Apple would eventually bury thousands of them in a landfill to get a tax credit . )
Jobs '
Next computer was another technological marvel , but it could n't find a market until Apple ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) bought the company and re-purposed its operating system for the Mac .
And the gorgeous Power Mac Cube , a Lucite box that looked like a fancy tissue - box holder , was " put on ice " in 2001 , a year after its launch .
That 's not to say that Jobs ' batting average has n't improved since he returned to Apple in 1997 .
He 's been the Hank Aaron of digital home runs .
The iPod alone , which he quietly unleashed in 2001 , atones for a lot of whiffs .
Still , the way Apple is growing , even a nano - manager like Jobs does n't have the bandwidth to fuss over every detail of every product , as is his wont .
Moreover , his notoriously secretive company has been preannouncing products months in advance - the iPhone is just the latest - and even then has missed promised ship dates .
Take Apple TV , the $ 300 set - top box that Jobs unveiled last October and that finally started shipping in at the end of February , several weeks late .
You do n't see many ads for it on TV , even though Apple is blitzing the airwaves with iPod and iMac spots , and after living with one for the past few weeks , I think I see why .
It 's just not very good .
It 's about as uninspired as another prominent dud , the Zune , the MP3 player Microsoft ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) launched last year .
In fact , the Apple TV is so Zune - like , you 'd think Jobs was so busy with the iPhone that he outsourced the Apple TV project to the folks up in Redmond .
To wit :
Apple TV 's most highly touted feature is its weakest one :
It requires an HDTV , but the video you download is so low - res that it looks as fuzzy as plain old broadcast TV .
It 's sort of like how the Zune digital music player 's touted Wi -Fi connection only lets you temporarily " lend " music to another Zune .
Apple TV 's coolest feature is one that was n't even intended : the screensaver , which plays an ethereal slide show of your digital photos .
I guess that tops Zune 's sexiest feature , which I would argue is that you can buy it in brown .
Love the brown .
There 's no way to order a movie directly from the iTunes store via your TV , even though Apple TV has its own connection to the Internet .
Instead , you have to download it to your computer first .
Likewise , the Zune wo n't allow you to purchase music directly via its Wi -Fi capability .
Apple TV lets you show photos only from a single computer , even though photos are the one source of HD content everyone has , and are easy and legal to share over a network .
That is especially odd , because Apple TV does allow you to share digital music from multiple PCs .
The Zune , in a similarly consumer - hostile way , wo n't let you play purchased digital music recorded in Microsoft 's previous music format .
There are shortcomings that even Microsoft would not have overlooked : Apple TV does n't have a DVD drive or a volume control on its minimalist remote or ... but enough .
You get the feeling that Apple did n't create this thing because it was insanely great but in order to freeze competitors out of downloadable video .
Apple TV could have been a versatile transitional product that not only made it easier for people to use their computer - based content in the living room but also helped unclutter their home entertainment systems .
Apple got the shape of the box right , and the screensaver is pretty nice , but that 's about it .
So it really makes you wonder whether the iPhone , when it finally arrives next month , will be clunky and misguided despite its gorgeousness and slick user interface .
Apple could turn off customers if the pricey device can't really do what it promises because of little gotchas like insufficient bandwidth or short battery life or an unusable virtual keyboard .
That 's the problem with hyping a product before it comes out .
It 's bound to disappoint no matter how good it is , and if it is n't quite as good as advertised , well , I suppose we 'll be surprised by some other cool thing .
Maybe the cellphone equivalent of Nintendo's Wii . Nobody saw that one coming .
General Odierno said the five additional brigades added this year under the president ’s troop increase were likely to be withdrawn on a timeline parallel to their arrival in Iraq .
Under this timeline , which is not yet the official plan , the troop increase would end by April with the five brigades leaving Iraq one each month , with American force levels returning to the troop levels existing before the increase by next August , he said .
Central to the internal debate on a “ postsurge ” strategy is the extent to which American troops would be able to ask Iraqi forces to take the lead on security missions in critical sections of the country , particularly in Baghdad .
Many Democrats in Congress , and even some Republicans , have demanded that Americans hand over more security missions to the Iraqis .
Although no decision has been made about the full extent of the American combat mission next year , administration officials and military officers say the troops in Iraq would shift priorities to training and supporting Iraq forces .
They said the large contingent of Special Operations forces now in Iraq would continue missions to capture and kill terrorist and insurgent leaders , and to disrupt their networks .
Under the new strategy , administration and military officials say , some American troops would be withdrawn from relatively stable regions in the Kurdish north and Anbar Province , and could be shifted to still - contested areas or into noncombat missions .
But the officials say they expect the strategy to call for American forces to retain a leading role at least well into next year in the dangerous fight to maintain security in Baghdad and a strategic ring of communities in a band around the capital .
“ That ’s the center of gravity , ” one official involved in the strategy discussions said .
Military officials said General Petraeus was still revising his calculations on what the exact mission of American troops should be , and how many would be required to carry it out .
One senior administration official said the political debate focused too much on the overall number of Americans in Iraq .
“ It ’s more than just the raw number of troops , ” the official said .
“ It ’s where they ’re deployed and how . ”
In a preview of the September report to assess progress , the administration said in July that accomplishments were satisfactory in nearly half of the 18 benchmarks set by Congress .
In recent weeks , several military , diplomatic and administration officials have sought to change the focus of the review , saying the official benchmarks might not be the best measures of success in Iraq , as they do not weigh factors like the growing power of local leaders and the willingness of the population to demand political reconciliation in the central government .
Refining my first steps with Parsec June 22 , 2007
To start gaining experience with Parsec and Haskell I completed the first working version of a parser for SmallTalk ’s version of ‘ Hello World ’ .
To follow up I decided it would be worthwhile getting advice on those parts that just did n’t feel right .
Off to Haskell Cafe I went .
I had only heard good things about the Haskell community , and after my experience I have nothing to say to the contrary .
My post and the follow up responses can be found here .
Thanks to all those that responded .
The Questionable Code
I was mainly concerned with the double do block present in primary .
For reference , here is the applicable code :
primary = do { i <- identifier ; return $ Primary Identifier i ; } < | > do { l <- stringLiteral ; return $ PrimaryLiteral l ; }
identifier = do i <- many1 letter return $ Identifier i
stringLiteral = do ( char ' \\ ' ' ) s <- manyTill any Char ( char '\\ ' ' ) return $ StringLiteral s
I had a feeling that Haskell was capable of producing more readable code than this .
Avoiding do
One disadvantage of do - notation , is that it can often obscure what is actually a simple monadic operation .
It is said better over at Data .
SyntaxFree :
Do-notation — and the fact that it ’s introduced in the context of IO — obscures the fact that monads are implemented quite simply in Haskell itself as a type - class and correspond to a simple algebraic structure that models many useful computational phenomena .
Modifying the above code so it does n’t require do notation results in the following ( Thanks to Dave Tapley ) :
primary = ( identifier >>= ( return . PrimaryIdentifier ) ) < |> ( stringLiteral >>= ( return . PrimaryLiteral ) ) identifier = ( many1 letter ) >>= ( return . Identifier ) stringLiteral = ( char '\ \ ' ' ) >>
( manyTill any Char ( char '\\ ' ' ) ) >>= ( return .
StringLiteral )
Although I would n’t consider this more readable than when using do notation , I believe this gives a better understanding of what ’s going on , and ideas on simplifying it .
In particular , some common constructs start to appear .
The most notable of these is of the form :
parser >>= return .
Constructor
Extracting the Common Construct
Thanks to the suggestions of many , there are Haskell functions that can simplify this common construct : liftM and fmap .
Which one to choose is a matter of style .
As is using them as infix functions .
In this case I ’ve decided to use an infix liftM .
primary = ( PrimaryIdentifier `liftM` identifier ) < |> ( PrimaryLiteral `liftM` stringLiteral ) identifier = Identifier `liftM` ( many1 letter ) stringLiteral = StringLiteral `liftM` ( ( char '\ \ ' ' ) >>
( manyTill any Char ( char '\ \ ' ' ) ) )
One last improvment
The final section of code this code that could do with improvement is in stringLiteral .
I have chosen to use a suggestion from Tillmann Rendel .
That suggestion is to define a new monadic combinator :
a >>~ b = a >>= \\x -> b >> return x
This combinator worse as for >> , but returns the result of the calculation on the left , rather than the right .
This is best demonstrated in use :
stringLiteral = StringLiteral `liftM` ( quote >> nonQuote >>~ quote ) quote = char ' \ \ '' nonQuote = many $ noneOf [ '\ \ '' ]
Summary
I had thought my first attempt at this parser resulted in a simple , readable parser .
I still think it did .
But now the expressive power of Parsec and Haskell have surpassed my expectations .
It 's designed for large organizations .
Large organizations have different aims from hackers .
They want languages that are ( believed to be ) suitable for use by large teams of mediocre programmers -- languages with features that , like the speed limiters in U - Haul trucks , prevent fools from doing too much damage .
The elitism issue .
" Yeah , I 'm a super - duper programmer who does n't make mistakes ; people who do n't work the way I do are just inferior . "
Yeah , tell that to the guys who wrote OCaml .
The cluelessness issue : " I write programs in Perl / Python / CommonLisp / ... with three other guys who are all lisp wizards , and if we do n't have a problem , then no one should , so that typing stuff is just nonsense to cover up for incompetence . "
There are problems that emerge as the size of a system and the number of people working on it increase .
Three people hacking on something is very different from 30 people hacking on it , which is very different from 300 people .
As the number of people involved increases , you need to do more to ensure that information gets to where it 's needed .
The information loss issue .
This is the one that actually bugs me the most .
Programmers know what types they 're using .
They know what types they 're passing .
They know information about the parameters they 're taking , and the parameters that they 're passing .
Good type system give them a way to write that down - and not just write it , but make it a part of the code , so that it can be tested .
Writing it down as a part of the code means that the information is recorded ; that it 's maintained ; and that it 's checked .
Not declaring types saves you a bit of keyboard time - but it means that there 's important information in your head which you 're not writing down .
( I have exactly the same rant about parallelizing compilers , which is that you have to structure your code very carefully and precisely to allow the compiler to figure out the information that you knew before you wrote the code ; but instead of letting you write it down , you have to trick the compiler into figuring it out on its own . )
( Since I see that there are still links pointing at this post , I 'll point out here that this blog has moved to scienceblogs .
This discussion was continued in a post there . ) I thought today I 'd go a bit off topic , and rant a little bit about stuff that 's been bugging me lately in my real work .
It does , in its bizzare way , relate to the lambda calculus series I 've been writing lately .
What I do professionally is research in a field called collaborative software development : how to build tools that help groups of people work together to build large systems .
It 's an interesting thing to do , with a huge range of things that can be done , ranging from better programming languages to better configuration management systems to better programming environments to entirely new kinds of collaborative tools .
It involves practical programming , math , psychology and human factors , and a few other interesting things .
My approach to this kind of work is to view the key problem as being one of communication .
Most problems in large systems are ultimately not algorithmic errors - they 're errors where some key piece of information was not correctly communicated between developers .
For example , one of the most common bugs in large systems occurs when the implementor of a piece of code makes assumptions about how their code is going to be called ; and the developer who uses that code makes different assumptions .
To be concrete ; I experienced this recently on my project at work .
I 'm working on a bit of code , and one function I call takes a lot of parameters , each of which is an array of objects .
Most of the time , you only supply a real value for one or two out of a list of 8 parameters .
I assumed that for unused parameters , it made sense to pass null - that 's how I would have written that method .
The person who wrote it expected callers to never pass null , but to use empty arrays for unused parameters .
Program compiles , deploys , and boom : exceptions out the wazoo .
( There was a dynamic check for null , but because of some proxy stuff we do , it was very hard to track it down . )
This is n't a result of incompetence on anyone 's part .
This project has some of the finest developers that I 've ever met working on it .
The person who wrote that method with the awful parameter list is actually a pretty great programmer - one of the top people from one of the top groups of developers that I know of .
I do n't think I 'm incompetent either :-) .
So why did the error happen ?
Because a key piece of information did n't get passed between us .
Between the size of our system , the number of people involved , the way the code is partitioned into components , and where the documentation lives , the information about what to do about empty parameters got lost .
What does any of this have to do with lambda calculus ?
Types .
That problem would n't have happened if we were programming in my favorite programming language , OCaml .
In OCaml , to be able to pass a " null " value , I actually need to specify that in the parameter declaration ( as an Option type ) .
There 's no way I can pass a null to a function that was n't expecting one .
It 's a common assertion among a lot of the elite hackers out there that " real programmers do n't use strongly typed languages " , or the Paul Graham line about strongly typed languages .
For example , here 's Paul on Java
This attitude really bugs me .
The thing is , types are meta - information about a program - and useful meta-information .
And the more people you have involved in a system , the more important it becomes to have strong , formal information about parts of the system that allow automatic checks .
The most common response from people like Paul to rants like mine is " Strong testing , not strong typing . "
The idea being , type checking is really something like a very simple kind of compile time testing , which is inferior to a real , complete test suite .
Sure , strong typing in a language is no replacement for testing .
But why on earth should I write tests to verify correct typing , when I can just put the type information in line in the code and have it tested automatically ?
Typing and type checking is one part of the process ; having a typed language does n't mean you should n't write tests ; writing tests does n't mean that compile - time type checking is useless .
Pulling the typing information out of line into a test is , frankly , just dumb : the more you spread the information around between multiple places , the less likely it is to be maintained , or even found .
I 'm a huge unit testing fan ; but one of the major limitations of testing is information scattering .
You 're putting information about the invariants and requirements of your code in the logic of the tests - and because of the multidimensional nature of software systems , that inevitably means that some of the information is here , some there .
Trying to assemble the information you need from a list of test failures can be incredibly frustrating ; and those tests often do n't get maintained , so things change , but the tests are n't changed to thoroughly respect the new semantics .
Compile time checking can't get out of synch with the current state of the code .
