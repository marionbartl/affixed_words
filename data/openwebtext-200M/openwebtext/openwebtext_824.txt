Do you love gadgets ?
Well , if you are going to answer “ No ” , you probably just do n’t know what I mean .
Gadgets are little ( and huge ) devices that are meant to make our lives easier .

TODAY ’S TWO MINUTES HATE ….
Here ’s the latest reason to hate credit card companies : Shop at Wal - Mart , obviously a sign of financial distress , and your credit limit gets lowered .
Hallelujah !
This is from American Express , which has now decided to hunker down and simply lie about their habit of doing this .
Compare and contrast the following news accounts .
When Kevin Johnson returned from his honeymoon last year he got a letter from Amex saying , “ Other customers who have used their card at establishments where you recently shopped have a poor repayment history with American Express . ”
Here ’s what they told the Atlanta Journal Constitution about this in December :
“ We ’re just doing this to manage risk , ” said Lisa A. Gonzalez , an American Express spokeswoman .
She declined to say which retailers or mortgage companies are associated with consumers with higher default rates .
She said it makes sense to examine these factors because “ customers who have loans outstanding with certain lenders or customers who make transactions with certain merchants tend to have a higher proportion of credit issues or a higher probability of default . ”
And here ’s what they told the New York Times this week :
“ The letters were wrong to imply we were looking at specific merchants , ” said Susan Korchak , a company spokeswoman … .
Now , the company says that there never was such a list .
So what about the language in its letters to cardholders , which calls out particular “ establishments ” where cardholders had shopped , I asked .
Well , apparently that was all just a big misunderstanding , despite the number of people who must have been in on drafting the notes in the first place .
So : a month ago monitoring your transactions with “ certain merchants ” was a legitimate way of managing risk .
This month the story is that they were never doing it in the first place .
You betcha .
Bastards .
I really hate these guys and their entire sleazy industry .
More here .
Kevin Johnson ’s website is here .
If , like many people , you are disgusted by the behaviour of Israel and happen to blog about , say , the latest massacre in Gaza ; the desperate situation the Palestinians are in ; the carnage in Lebanon or the provocation of UNIFIL peacekeepers ; the threat of attacking Iran or any of the other nefarious deeds that Israel is allowed to get away with , then there is a reasonable chance that you may attract the attention of GIYUS .
You ’ll know when that has happened when you find your post bombarded by comments ( usually anonymous and looking remarkably similar ) attempting to justify those actions and attacking you for daring to mention them .
A quick look at your stats will confirm that you ’ve been GIYUSed .
If this bothers you , here are some tips which may put a stop to the attack , or at least lessen the flow of moronic comments .
Of course I ca n’t guarantee that they will work , all I can say is that they seemed to work for me when I became their target .
First of all do n’t be intimidated , that ’s what this little army of cyber soldiers want you to be .
Instead you could try the following :
Update your post straight away explaining what has happened and adding a little bit about GIYUS for those unfamiliar with this annoying pressure group .
This also lets the GIYUS bots know that you ’re on to them .
If possible , add some links to previous posts you might have written on the issues to show that you are not going to be intimidated by their antics .
Refute their ‘ arguments ’ in the comments .
This is easy as they really do n’t have any .
Their comments go along the lines of “ it is about time that Israel completely ignore any condemnation of our effort to stay alive and have a simple life in a and keep pounding at the Palestinians … ” .
Also they do n’t stick around to argue , debate is the last thing they want and its what they are trying to stifle .
They just do as they are directed by GIYUS .
On no account say anything which they could construe as being anti-Semitic .
That is exactly what they want .
Not only is anti-Semitism so obviously wrong but you ’ll be lowering yourself to their level .
Their main objective is to ‘ prove ’ that anyone who disagrees with Israeli policies is a ) anti-Semitic , b ) a Holocaust denier , and c ) an ‘ Islamo - fascist ’ .
To do this they try to blur the distinctions between ‘ Zionist ’ , ‘ Israeli ’ and ‘ Jewish ’ .
Use reliable news sources to back up your points .
If you can find items from Israeli sources , so much the better .
Haaretz and B’TSalem are useful .
Invite others to join in the fun , it makes the thread more balanced and much more interesting .
It also saves you from having to repeat yourself or respond to every comment .
Do n’t delete their comments unless they really are particularly offensive .
That just makes it look like you have n’t got an answer to them .
Leave their comments up so we can all have a good laugh at them .
Use humour .
Believe me , these commenters have as much sense of humour as Ian Paisley on a bad day , and they do n’t like having the piss taken out of them ( who does ? ) .
The issues are deadly serious for both sides of the argument but the point here is to stop GIYUS bullying you into remaining silent about them .
If other bloggers link to your post then even more people will see it thus rendering their efforts to silence you completely counter - productive .
I ’ll take this opportunity to thank the Curious Hamster , Obsolete and D - Notice for linking to my post which helped GIYUS ’s attack on me backfire .
GIYUS has been particularly effective in distorting or wrecking on - line polls .
If you are conducting a poll about Israel and you find that GIYUS members turn up in great numbers to distort the result , my advice would be to shut it down immediately and post a message explaining why .
I have n’t conducted a poll about Israel but it ’s what I ’d do if I found my poll being distorted by GIYUS .
When I was targeted by GIYUS I did most of the things on this list and the comments slowed down and then stopped very quickly .
And it was n’t because the GIYUS bots stopped visiting .
As I write this they are still coming , they ’re just not bombarding me with their silly justifications for what is by any standard criminal behaviour .
Groups like this do n’t like to be exposed in this way , so when a light is shined on them they tend to scuttle back to whatever dark recesses they emerged from .
Mind you , having posted this I would n’t be surprised if they tried again .
If you have been GIYUSed and your post is genuine comment on Middle East news and not anti-Semitic or conspiracy theory garbage , feel free to drop me a comment and I ’ll link to it .
Freedom of speech is important and we have enough curtailment of it from our leaders , so we do n’t need these idiots to bully us into silence .
If all this sounds like behaving little better than GIYUS , it is n’t .
I ’m not advocating bombarding peoples web sites with comments or hurling abuse at anyone .
This is just a defence tactic which may or may not work if you find yourself under a coordinated virtual attack from a state sponsored pressure group .
No state is above criticism and when a state behaves the way Israel does it should expect to be criticised for its crimes .
Unfortunately many governments , particularly the American and British governments refuse to criticise these atrocities and are complicit in them , so it ’s up to us to do it .

Birmingham is one of 25 UK cities fully covered by the service
Google has launched the UK version of its Street View service , which allows users to browse a selection of pictures taken along city streets .
Street scenes in 25 UK cities from Aberdeen to Southampton can be viewed using the service .
The Netherlands version of the service also launched on Thursday , bringing the number of countries covered to nine .
The imagery available comprises video taken along 22,369 miles of UK streets by customised camera cars .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Google Maps users can zoom in to a given location and then drag the " Pegman " icon above the zoom bar on to a given street .
UK CITIES ON STREET VIEW Aberdeen Belfast Birmingham Bradford Bristol Cambridge Cardiff Coventry Derby Dundee Edinburgh Glasgow Leeds Liverpool London Oxford Manchester Newcastle Norwich Nottingham Scunthorpe Sheffield Southampton Swansea York A picture view of that street appears , which users can control to get a 360 - degree view of the area or to progress on street level , throughout the city .
Google says it has gone to great lengths to ensure privacy , suggesting that the service only shows imagery already visible from public thoroughfares .
It also uses face recognition technology to blur out faces and licence plates that appear in the images .
' Slipped halo '
The Information Commissioner 's Office ruled in 2008 that the face - and licence plate - blurring were sufficient to ensure that privacy was maintained .
However , Simon Davies of Privacy International says that existing case law suggests that images for commercial purposes cannot be taken without prior consent of those who appear in the images .
The ICO did not rule on that point in 2008 , meaning that the law on privacy protection remains unclear .
Mr Davies objects to the fact that " Google had not consulted with the very communities that it was about to capture " in order to address that issue .
" The Holy Grail is to know as much as possible but to protect to the greatest extent privacy rights .
Google 's halo has slipped for the very reason that it believes in the first part of the equation but not in the second , " he told BBC News .
HAVE YOUR SAY
In what way is it an invasion of privacy ?
They 're taking pictures of houses , not you .
Graham , Sheffield However , Mr Davies does not object to the Street View service altogether .
" We 're not trying to destroy the concept of Street View , what we 're saying is that it should be deployed in an environment of historic rights , and people should n't be seduced into believing that just because a technology appears to be cool it must be allowed to proceed . "
A Google spokesperson countered : " The images in Street View are lawful .
The Street View feature only contains imagery gathered on public property .
The imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street . "
What is more , the service provides " easily accessible tools for flagging inappropriate or sensitive imagery for review and removal " .
Art partner Artworks , pub recommendations , and tourist attractions are linked in Among Google 's partners in the venture is Tate , who have worked with Google to integrate precise locations in the UK associated with artworks by JMW Turner and John Constable , which can then be viewed alongside their real - world locations .
Other partners have selected a gallery of images to showcase the UK 's attractions .
London mayor Boris Johnson said : " It is simply fascinating , even for a Londoner like me , to whiz over Westminster Bridge past the Houses of Parliament , soak up the majesty of Regent 's Park , take in the stupendous views from Primrose Hill or simply wander around the streets near where I live . "
Also , hidden among the images is the popular children 's book character Wally - of striped - jumper Where 's Wally ?

I realized then that my girlfriend did not know what I meant by ' Pearl Necklace . '
FML
Film : Dev.D
Director : Anurag Kashyap
Cast : Abhay Deol , Mahie Gill , Kalki Koechlin
Ratings : *** 1/2
Dev D should have come with a few words of caution , more like a list , at the beginning :
Caution no 1 : Sarat Chandra fans , who are not looking - forward - to his Devdas being tweaked too much , may leave immediately .
There are also possibilities of him turning in his grave ( even though it 's non-existent ) if he ever found out about his most - loved story being adapted by Anurag Kashyap thus .
Caution no 2 : If you have walked in to watch this movie with your parents , sequences ahead may leave you in the ' cringe ' zone .
Scenes showing substance abuse , lovers making out like there 's no tomorrow and a high - end call girl using sexual innuendos might create situations embarrassing to both parents and children .
Caution no 3 : Be ready to be bombarded with a heavy dose of songs ( 18 , says the album cover ) one after the other and picturisations that may seem out of the ordinary .
With a taste for something different though , you 'll really enjoy it .
If you feel you can watch enjoy Dev D , these cautionary notes withstanding , go for it .
The story you know .
It 's Devdas .
In spite of that , Dev D is something you have n't seen before .
And credit goes to writer - director Anurag Kashyap for giving audiences a film to enjoy in spite of its numerous versions before .
Kashyap has shifted the scene to the lush green fields of Punjab this time .
A few other things remain unchanged .
When Dev ( Abhay , who else ) is 12 , his parents send him away to London to ' discipline ' him .
His childhood lover , Paro ( Mahie ) , is waiting for him back in apna Chandigarh .
Unlike in the original , Dev and Paro are no longer disconnected till the time they meet , when grown - up .
This time , the years apart include long - distance phone conversation , with large doses of sexual undertones .
Sample this : the first scene showing Dev talking to Paro has him asking her if she is touching herself as they talk .
Paro 's reactions might just surprise you .
Anurag Kashyap has turned Sarat Chandra 's novel on its head , giving the word interpretation a whole new meaning .
The lovers here are n't shy creatures , but young and hormonal ones , who can't wait to get there hands on each other .
It 's not just about lust though .
There 's love as well , but only Paro feels it ; Dev is n't so sure .
When he wrongly learns of Paro 's affair with a village lad while he was away in London , he does n't think twice before sleeping with another girl .
That , however , is n't the death knell of the relationship .
Neither are the parents .
In one of the most interesting twists in the film , Dev 's father actually wants Paro to come home as his bride .
But Dev does n't .
His pride stops him , even when Paro 's wedding is announced .
And before he knows it , she 's married off .
Then the realisation sets in :
He loves her ; she 's gone ; now he wants an escape route .
It 's Delhi .
Here , Dev stumbles upon a life of going to underground parties that start only after others end , rounds of vodka shots , some B - 52s and occasional snorting .
He has a partner : the wily Chunni .
He 's not the ' confidante ' as Chunnilal has been in earlier versions .
He 's the pimp , who sees in Dev nothing more than a rich , spoilt brat , who provides Chunni with a steady flow of money , in exchange of the booze and the women .
This is where Chanda enters .
Now this is Anurag 's masterstroke .
Chandramukhi , or Chanda for short , is n't the courtesan here .
She has a back story too , something not present in the novel at all .
A school girl from Delhi , the half - Indian Leni gets involved in a scandal over an MMS showing her indulging in oral sex with her boyfriend .
Anurag has taken references from a number of real - life cases , among them being the Alistair Perreira drink - and - drive case as well as the Delhi Public School MMS scandal .
But coming back to Chanda , or Leni in her later avatar , if you can get over Anurag taking his time developing her character , you 'll think of it as an asset to the story .
With a better actor than Kalki , it would have worked wonders .
But she definitely ' looks ' the part .
And that 's half the battle won .
The rest of it need n't be spoken of , but enjoyed .
For starters , there 's the music .
Hum Aapke Hain Kaun may have had 13 songs that stretched the film 's duration to eternity , but the 15 + here are woven so brilliantly into the script , that they are a bonus .
Other than the distinct sound , Anurag has given the songs an identity that remains there own , with Pardesi , Nayan Tarse , Aankh Micholi and the nation 's anthem , Emosanal Attyachaar all being brilliantly picturised .
The editing could have been tighter , especially in Chanda 's story , but that does n't really hamper proceedings .
Rajeev Ravi 's cinematography just adds to the zing .
Abhay Deol , take a bow .
After impressive performances in a number of films that have n't really gone anywhere as far as Box Office goes , Abhay delivers another believable , yet understated performance .
Even if Dev D meets with a similar fate at the ticket windows ( and it just might ) , Abhay 's talent can not be undermined .
Playing a character immortalized by the best in each generation , be it KL Saigal in 1936 , Dilip Kumar in 1955 or Shah Rukh Khan in 2002 , Abhay has managed to leave his distinct stamp on the role .
Whether casually rolling a joint first thing he wakes up or downing one shot after another in a dinghy pub , Abhay brings charm and an underplayed angst to his young man gone astray .
Mahie Gill does a courageous turn on Paro .
Here again , credit goes to Anurag for taking a liberal approach to a woman 's sexual needs , but Mahie has balanced the lusty aspect of the girlfriend well with being a girl who 's emotionally vulnerable .
In the end though , Dev D is an Anurag Kashyap film .
Bouquets or brickbats , Anurag has gone all out to dish out something out - of - the - ordinary and the man deserves credit for that .
After innumerable false starts ( Paanch , Black Friday , No Smoking ) , it takes immense guts to go out there and stick to your convictions , irrespective of commercial considerations .
And Anurag has done just that .
If he 's reading this , let 's have an encore , Anurag !
CARACAS , Venezuela ( CNN ) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said he supported U.S. President Barack Obama 's efforts to find alternative energy sources but does n't believe the United States can do it .
Venezualan President Hugo Chavez said improved relations depend on the United States .
" I do n't know how he will achieve what he said he would , " Chavez said in an exclusive 30 - minute interview with CNN en Espanol 's Patricia Janiot Monday night .
" It 's very difficult for the United States to diminish its use of oil . "
The United States , a major Venezuelan oil consumer , needed petroleum " like air , like oxygen to live , to survive , " Chavez said .
" We employ thousands of workers in the United States , " Chavez said .
" We give aid to hundreds of thousands of poor families in the United States with our heating oil program . "
Chavez added that also is n't worried about the falling price of crude oil because there is such worldwide hunger for petroleum .
" The world will need to sustain its industrial rhythm , " he said .
Chavez certainly hopes that 's the case .
Oil revenues account for about 90 percent of Venezuela 's export earnings , about half of federal budget revenues and some 30 percent of gross domestic product , according to the CIA Factbook .
Chavez , who once called former President George W. Bush " the devil , " welcomed talks with Obama , saying , " I wish we could restore relations to the same level we had with President Clinton , " referring to the 1993 - 2001 years .
But improved relations depended on the United States , Chavez said .
" We wo n't accept disrespect from anyone , " he said , adding that respect from the United States must include all of Latin America .
On the domestic front , Chavez said he expected to win the February 15 referendum to amend the constitution so he can run for a third six - year term in 2012 .
But he 's willing to accept any outcome , Chavez said .
" If we lose , we lose , " he said , but declined to rule out calling for another referendum if he does not succeed this time .
Venezuelans narrowly rejected a similar measure in a December 2007 referendum .
Chavez has been campaigning hard in favor of the referendum , which he called for in November , a week after candidates he backed won a majority of seats in local elections seen as a test of his influence .
Chavez was elected president in 1998 , six years after a failed coup attempt to depose then - President Carlos Andres Perez .
Chavez was sworn in on February 2 , 1999 .
He was re-elected in a special election in July 2000 after a new constitution was adopted and again in 2006 .
The current constitution limits him to two consecutive six - year terms .
Although Venezuela has been hit particularly hard by the recent drop in oil prices , Chavez said social programs he has instituted will continue .
" I have told those who oppose me :
Put the price of petroleum at zero and I wo n't do away with social programs . "
Chavez noted that when he took over , there were 20 doctors for every 100,000 Venezuelans .
Now , he said , there are 65 physicians for every 100,000 people .
Likewise , free health coverage was available to 95 percent of Venezuelans , he said .
Ten years ago , it was available to only 25 percent of the population , he said .
Chavez made his comments on a particularly busy day in which Latin American leaders assembled in Caracas to mark the 10th anniversary of his rise to power , a period described by state - run television as " a decade of successes . "
Earlier Monday , Chavez and representatives of the leftist group Bolivarian Alternative for the Peoples of Our Americas , or ALBA , walked through the National Pantheon , which holds the sarcophagus of Simon Bolivar .
Chavez credits him as " the father of the revolution . "
In 1819 , Bolivar founded Gran Colombia , a federation of what is now Venezuela , Colombia , Panama and Ecuador .
In attendance were presidents Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua , Jose Manuel Zelaya of Honduras and Evo Morales of Bolivia ; Roosevelt Skerrit , prime minister of Dominica ; and Cuba 's first vice president , Jose Ramon Machado Ventura .
Absent was Chavez 's friend and mentor , former Cuban President Fidel Castro , who has been sick .
But that did n't stop Chavez from addressing him .
" Fidel , from here I salute you , " he said .
" Revolutionary father , from here we , your sons and daughters , salute you ! "

Henchmen are an essential part of every plot to take over the world .
Unfortunately , even the best henchmen let us down .
Is it something inherent in the henchman archetype ?
Or is it just that we expect too much from grown men in form - fitting body armor ?
Honestly , we do n't know .
But we do know that it hurts every time , and nowhere more so than in the six cases below .
6 Imperial Stormtroopers

Who Are They ?
Soldiers of the Galactic Empire , as featured in the Star Wars franchise .
Why Were They Feared ?
Stormtroopers started out strong .
The way they stormed that Rebel blockade runner in Star Wars was pretty sweet .
And the way they overran that Rebel base in The Empire Strikes Back was the epitome of cool ( OK , so they let most of the rebels escape from Cloud City , but the rebels had inside help from known scoundrel Lando Calrissian , so we could let it slide ) .
By that point , it seemed like Stormtroopers could do no wrong .
But then something happened , something ... awful .
Pictured : something awful .

What Went Wrong ?
After convincing us that they were the baddest asses in henchmen history , Stormtroopers suddenly went all France on us .
Somehow , a frigging army of Stormtroopers was outwitted , outmaneuvered and just plain outfought by a bunch of overgrown merkins whose most advanced weaponry was flint - tipped arrows .
But that 's not even the worst part .
The worst part is that these were n't just any Stormtroopers .
No , these were , in the Emperor 's own words , his best troops , for fuck 's sake .
Who were his worst troops .
Of course , no one wanted the Stormtroopers to win .
Yes , we loved them the way only impressionable adolescents can love something , but we knew they were evil , and we wanted them to get their comeuppance in the end .
But not like this .
Losing as ignominiously as they did on Endor did n't just diminish the villains , it also diminished the heroic men and women who defeated them .

A Typical Stormtrooper 's Last Thought :
" I can't see a thing in this helmet ! "
Link of the day - I will pay you $ 25 , if you come up with a cool domain name for me .
CARDIFF ( Fortune Small Business ) -- Bob Hertzberg 's audience seems as muted as the dismal gray skies outside .
The attendees are pale , polite civil servants .
The location is a conference room in Wentloog , a rainy industrial town outside Cardiff , the capital of Wales .
These 16 Welsh officials have come to hear California native Hertzberg preach the gospel of solar energy .
The brightest splash of color in this room ( if not all Wentloog ) is the scarlet cable - knit sweater that Hertzberg wears as he enters .
At six feet and 230 pounds , Hertzberg would be hard to miss in any room .
He still radiates the charisma of the California politician he used to be .
Back in Sacramento he was nicknamed " Huggy Bear " for his tendency to embrace everyone he met .
( Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , whose transition team Hertzberg helped to manage , calls him " Hertzie . " )
Hertzberg served as Speaker of the California Assembly during the electricity crisis of 2002 , when Enron squeezed favorable contracts out of the state by choking off its power supply .
That debacle left him passionate about the importance of renewable energy .
And a failed primary campaign for mayor of Los Angeles left Hertzberg in need of a new career .
So he founded a solar - power company , G24i , and quickly became the most contrarian guy in the renewable energy business .
Most of his rivals produce silicon solar panels for the first world .
Hertzberg is building silicon - free solar strips , and says his earliest customers are in the developing world , especially Africa and India .
Most solar companies seek government handouts ; Hertzberg avoids them like the plague .
And while few solar firms would think of bringing their product to a cloudy climate , Hertzberg set up his headquarters in Wales - in part to prove that G24i 's technology can work anywhere .
Hertzberg talks to his audience as if he 's still running for office .
" So far , solar power has benefited rich people , governments and corporations , " he declaims .
" We 're going to provide it for ordinary folks . "
He explains that G24i's solar strips will fit on backpacks , computer cases and even purses .
They will charge cell phones and other gadgets , even on a dreary day like this .
Wales , a land once known for dirty coal mines , could host a clean - energy revolution .
" We 're telling the story of the transformation of Europe ! " he bellows .
A battered market
Based on this performance , you would never know that shares in solar - power companies were being pummeled in the global markets .
First Solar , a G24i rival , saw its share price drop from a high of $ 311 to a low of $ 85 in 2008 .
The bear market was caused , ironically , by a strong year for production .
Investors think solar producers are less likely to receive the government subsidies on which they 've relied to date .
But Hertzberg has made a long - term commitment to solar power .
G24i , with 66 employees , is sitting on $ 100 million in venture funding .
It helps that Hertzberg co-owns the investment firm Renewable Capital , which partly bankrolled G24i .
The only handout he received from the Welsh government went to building a fence around G24i 's factory .
Hertzberg 's golden rule : " Do n't rely on subsidies .
You spend all your time and money lobbying government and filling in forms . "
Hertzberg learned that lesson the hard way .
In 2005 , after his failed mayoral bid , he set up a firm called Solar Integrated Technologies in Watts , a blighted area of Los Angeles .
The business model relied on job -creation subsidies .
The company planned to sell solar panels that could be built into walls and roofs .
On the day that Solar Integrated Technologies received a large shipment of equipment , the city canceled its job - creation program - forcing Hertzberg to rip up stacks of contracts .
The company was doomed .
Though a lawyer by training , Hertzberg has little patience for red tape .
As a California state lawmaker , he drafted legislation designed to reduce the regulatory burden on green - energy startups .
But it was n't enough .
" The government loves its cockamamie forms , " Hertzberg says .
" With all the money and time it took us to go through the regulatory maze , we were basically chased out of the country . "
To his surprise , Hertzberg found less onerous regulations in Europe .
Thanks to carbon - emission cuts mandated by the 1998 Kyoto accords , many European governments are keen to attract renewable energy companies .
In 2006 , Hertzberg heard about a disused factory in Wales .
Acer Computers commissioned the facility but did n't take full occupancy because of corporate cutbacks .
Hertzberg had never been to Wales , but he figured it was close enough to London - two hours by train - that he could tap the British capital 's glut of green investment funding .
Also , he would n't have to compete for cash and attention with scores of solar companies on the European mainland .

Obama on Friday announced his plan to tackle what he called an " international security challenge of the highest order . "
Stressing soberly that " the safety of people around the world is at stake , " Obama said the " situation is increasingly perilous " in the region in and around Afghanistan , where the United States has been fighting al Qaeda and the Taliban for more than 7 ½ years after attacks in New York and at the Pentagon .
" The United States of America did not choose to fight a war in Afghanistan .
Nearly 3,000 of our people were killed on September 11 , 2001 , for doing nothing more than going about their daily lives , " said Obama , who has vowed to make Afghanistan the central front in the fight against terrorism .
" So let me be clear : Al Qaeda and its allies -- the terrorists who planned and supported the 9/11 attacks -- are in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Multiple intelligence estimates have warned that al Qaeda is actively planning attacks on the U.S. homeland from its safe haven in Pakistan .
Watch how the U.S. will target terrorist safe havens »
" And if the Afghan government falls to the Taliban -- or allows al Qaeda to go unchallenged -- that country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can . "
Obama said it is key Americans understand that Pakistan " needs our help " against al Qaeda .
" Al Qaeda and other violent extremists have killed several thousand Pakistanis since 9/11 .
They have killed many Pakistani soldiers and police .
They assassinated [ former Pakistani Prime Minister ] Benazir Bhutto .
They have blown up buildings , derailed foreign investment and threatened the stability of the state .
Make no mistake : Al Qaeda and its extremist allies are a cancer that risks killing Pakistan from within . "
Watch Obama 's speech on Afghanistan , Pakistan threats »
Flanked by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Obama called on Congress to pass a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Sens.
John Kerry , D - Massachusetts , and Richard Lugar , R - Indiana .
The legislation authorizes " $ 1.5 billion in direct support to the Pakistani people every year over the next five years -- resources that will build schools , roads and hospitals and strengthen Pakistan 's democracy , " he said .
He also urged Congress to pass legislation that would create opportunity zones in the border region .
The goal is to develop the economy and bring hope to places plagued by violence .
Obama said , " We will ask our friends and allies to do their part , " including at a donors conference next month in Tokyo , Japan .
" After years of mixed results , we will not provide a blank check .
Pakistan must demonstrate its commitment to rooting out al Qaeda and the violent extremists within its borders .
And we will insist that action be taken -- one way or another -- when we have intelligence about high - level terrorist targets . "
Obama said the United States must work with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and others to help Pakistan get through the economic crisis .
" To lessen tensions between two nuclear - armed nations that too often teeter on the edge of escalation and confrontation , we must pursue constructive diplomacy with both India and Pakistan . "
Afghan President Harmid Karzai watched the speech on CNN from Kabul , said Richard Holbrooke , Obama 's special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Karzai " is extremely grateful and will issue his statement of support , " Holbrooke said .
Obama stressed that " Afghanistan has been denied the resources that it demands because of the war in Iraq " and now a commitment must be made .
Obama said he is sending another 4,000 troops to Afghanistan , along with hundreds of civilian specialists , such as agricultural experts , educators and engineers .
The troops -- which are in addition to the 17,000 announced earlier -- will be charged with training and building the Afghan army and police force .
The stakes are high as al Qaeda and the Taliban have escalated the insurgency and the number of U.S. troops deaths spiked last year -- the highest yearly death toll for them in the war .
Obama said the soldiers and Marines " will take the fight to the Taliban in the south and east " and will work with Afghan troops along the border .
He said such an effort will bolster " security in advance of the important presidential election in August . "
Watch Obama tell terrorists U.S. will defeat them »
Obama said the coalition " will accelerate " efforts to " build an Afghan army of 134,000 and a police force of 82,000 so that we can meet these goals by 2011 -- and increases in Afghan forces may very well be needed as our plans to turn over security responsibility to the Afghans go forward . "
He said Afghanistan 's government has been " undermined by corruption and has difficulty delivering basic services to its people " and its economy is undercut by " a booming narcotics trade that encourages criminality and funds the insurgency . "
Watch Obama 's remarks on the Afghan situation »
Obama said the United States will set clear benchmarks for international assistance and wo n't ignore attention to corruption .
He said the United States will develop a new contact group for Afghanistan and Pakistan that would include not only NATO allies and other partners but also Central Asian states , Gulf nations and Iran , Russia , India and China .
Reacting to Obama 's plan , Sen. Russell Feingold , D - Wisconsin , said he is pleased the president is focusing on al Qaeda and is addressing the role of Pakistan but expressed concern the strategy could remain " overly Afghan - centric . "
Citing Friday 's suicide attack on a mosque in the Pakistani tribal region near Afghanistan , Feingold said , " This new administration must ensure that we do what we must not only in Afghanistan but also in Pakistan . "
He said , " As the bombing near the Khyber Pass this morning highlights , we need to fully address the inextricable links between the crisis in Afghanistan and the instability and terrorist threats in Pakistan . "
The bombing killed at least 48 people and wounded 80 to 90 others .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell praised Obama 's plan , saying it is " a significant pivot " away from the Democratic Party 's left wing .
" So the president 's decision to continue Secretary Gates , follow [ U.S. Central Command chief ] Gen . [ David ] Petraeus ' advice -- which may be somewhat exasperating to his own political left -- I think is in the best interest of the country and I think he 's going to enjoy pretty strong Republican support for the plan , " the Kentucky Republican told reporters .

Here was my original problem :
The BellSouth building on the left , and the Nations Bank Building on the right are two of the highest buildings in downtown Atlanta .
See that narrow gap between them ?
That was my aiming point .
Because of the narrow gap between the buildings the television signal bounced around downtown Atlanta creating a condition known as " Multipath " or " Ghosting " , resulting in a very irregular signal , as seen on this spectrum analyzer .
Here was my solution : I took a standard Winegard PR - 9014 UHF antenna and suspended it inside a wooden frame using plastic zip ties .
I was careful not to make the box so small as to impede the UHF signal frequencies that I was interested in receiving .
I then wrapped the wooden frame in aluminum screening with one end of the box open at the receiving end of the antenna to pick up the UHF signal .
( Note the copper ground wire coiled up at the back of the box .
This is used to ground the screen and any interfering multipath signals from reaching the antenna inside . )
The plastic zip ties insulate the antenna from the screen as seen here .
With the antenna just sitting flat on the roof of the Rich Building I now get an almost textbook signal with no multipath distortions .
It 's not pretty , mainly because it 's just a prototype , but I think you 'll agree it gets the job done .
We ’ve got two bits of good news , and one bit of bad news about Mozilla ’s Firefox web browser .
Starting with the bad news – in 2008 , Fiefox suffered from considerably more security holes than Internet Explorer and Safari .
However , the first bit of good news is that Mozilla was much faster at patching zero - day exploits , according to a report by Secunia .
The zero - day flaws of Firefox were also less severe than those of IE .
The other bit of good news is that Firefox ’ upcoming Tracemonkey JavaScript engine is so good , the next Firefox release has been bumped from 3.1 to 3.5 .
In 2008 , Firefox faced 115 reported security flaws , which is nearly four times as many as any other popular web browser .
Microsoft , Apple , and Opera respectively reported 31 , 32 , and 30 security flaws in their browser .
It is valuable to note , though , that Firefox is an open - source product , and therefore , security flaws may be be dragged kicking and screaming into the light of day easier than with its closed - source brethren .
Still , if that can account for such a major difference is debatable , at best .
Like I said , there is good news on the security front as well for Firefox .
In 2008 , Internet Explorer faced 6 zero - day flaws , two of which were rated “ moderate ” or “ high ” in severity .
Firefox faced only three zero - day flaws in 2008 , and none of them were labelled moderate or severe by Secunia .
Mozilla also responded much , much faster to these zero - day flaws than Microsoft did , with three of them still unfixed in Internet Explorer ( the higher - rated flaws were fixed , though ) .

It boggles the mind , yet according to multiple news reports this morning it is absolutely true : Italian prosecutors as I type are trying four Google executives over their roles -- which were non-existent -- in the posting of a video that depicted cruelty toward a disabled child .
From an IDG News Service story :
In what is believed to be the first instance of a privacy executive being held accountable for his firm 's actions , Google 's global privacy counsel is scheduled to appear before a criminal court in Milan , Italy , on Tuesday on charges of defamation and failure to exercise control over personal data .
Peter Fleischer and three other Google executives face criminal charges in Italy over the posting of a video showing a disabled teen being harassed by peers .
They face up to a maximum of 36 months if convicted on the charges .
" It 's akin to prosecuting mail service employees for hate speech letters sent in the post , " a Google spokeswoman said in an e-mail .
" Seeking to hold neutral platforms liable for content posted on them is a direct attack on a free , open Internet . "
As might be expected , the matter has caught the attention of the International Association of Privacy Professionals , which notes :
According to Google , more than 200,000 videos are uploaded to Google Video each day .
Under EU legislation incorporated into Italian law in 2003 , Internet service providers are not responsible for monitoring third - party content on their sites , but are required to remove content considered offensive if they receive a complaint about it .
Between November 6 and 7 , 2006 , Google received two separate requests for the removal of the video - one from a user , and one from the Italian Interior Ministry , the authority responsible for investigating Internet - related crimes .
Google removed the video on November 7 , 2006 , within 24 hours of receiving the requests .
Yet four mention sit in an Italian courtroom with their very liberty on the line .
Mind - boggling .
Of course , it 's somewhat difficult for this American to muster too much indignation over the notion of local authorities exercising egregiously excessive control over an Internet that they do not control .
We 've had our fair share here , what with -- to cite but two examples -- the state of Kentucky seizing domain names and the governor of Massachusetts threatening to jail online poker players ( I 've never believed he was serious ) .
Italian authorities appear to be serious .
I mean a trial -- a trial -- is happening right this minute .
( Update : This story quotes Italian officials attempting to explain that which cannot be explained .
Also quoted in support of the legal action , unfortunately , is an advocate for children with Down syndrome ... and I say unfortunately as the father of an autistic 7 - year - old boy .
I will take a back seat to no one in their outrage at those who would torment a disabled child , but that is not the primary point here . )
Your photographs really amaze me .
If you do n't have them published in magazines like National Geographic , you really should , because they 're as good or better than the photographs you 'd find in there .
Oh ... and I absolutely love this picture .

For the graham cracker crust :
12 graham crackers ( or 1 3/ 4 cups graham cracker crumbs )
1/4 cup canola oil
For the chocolate pie filling :
1 lb silken tofu ( NOT the vacuum packed kind ) , drained
1/4 cup hazelnut liquer ( other liquers would work too , like coffee liquer or chocolate liquer , or just use rice milk or soy milk )
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 Tablespoons arrowroot
12 oz bittersweet chocolate , melted ( you do n't need directions for melting chocolate , do you ? )
For the caramel peanut butter :
( This is basically the same as the recipe in caramel apple bars , but the quantities are tweaked a bit )
1/3 cup natural peanut butter , smooth or chunky , at room temperature
3 tablespoons pute maple syrup
2 tablespoons brown rice syrup
For the maple candied pecans :
1 cup pecans
2 teaspoons canola oil
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons maple syrup
For the chocolate drizzle :
4 oz bittersweet chocolate , chopped ( or 1/4 cup chocolate chips )
1/4 cup soy or rice milk
Preheat oven to 350F .
Prepare the crust by processing the grahams into fine crumbs .
Place them in a bowl and drizzle the oil into them .
Use your fingertips or a fork to mix the oil in until all crumbs are moistened .
Spray a 10 inch pie plate with cooking spray .
Pour the crumbs into the pie plate and firmly press them to the bottom and sides of plate .
Set aside .
Prepare the filling :
First melt your chocolate .
Crumble the tofu into a blender or food processor .
Add the liquer , vanilla and arrow root and blend until completely smooth .
Scrape down the sides to make sure you get everything .
Add the chocolate and blend again until completely combined .
Pour the filling into the pie crust and bake for 40 minutes .
The center may still be jiggly , but that 's fine .
Let cool on a counter top for 10 minutes then chill in the fridge for at least 3 hours , the top of the pie should be firm to the touch .
Meanwhile , prepare your candied pecans .
Have ready a large plate , preferably covered in parchment paper .
Preheat a heavy bottomed frying pan over medium heat .
Add the pecans and stir them very frequently for 3 minutes , until the start to brown .
Stir constantly for 2 more minutes , until they are a few shades darker and relatively uniformly toasted .
( If a few do n't look toasted do n't worry about it .
That 's better than having them burn . )
Add the oil ans salt and stir for another minute .
Add the maple syrup and stir constantly for about a minute .
The maple syrup should get bubbly and dry .
Use a spatula to transfer the pecans to the plate and spread them out as much as you can , it 's best if they are n't touching .
Place in the fridge until ready to use .
Once the pie has been chilling for at least 3 hours , prepare the peanut butter caramel and chocolate drizzle .
Have your pie out and ready to be assembled .
To prepare the caramel :
Stir all the ingredients together in a small sauce pan .
Gently heat everything over low heat , stirring constantly with a fork , just until smooth and heated through .
It should fall from your fork in ribbons .
If it seems stiff , turn the heat off immediately and add a little extra brown rice syrup , until it 's fluid again .
This happens because different peanut butters have different amounts of moisture .
Pour the peanut butter over the center of the pie , leaving an inch or two at the edges because it spreads .
Get your pecans and place them on top of the caramel , pressing them in firmly .
You may have to break the pecans apart from each other if they were touching .
Prepare chocolate drizzle :
In a small sauce pan , heat the soy milk to boil .
Once boiling , add the chocolate and lower heat .
Use a fork to stir it until compeletely combined .
Turn the heat off and let cool for 5 minutes , stirring occasionally .
You can either drizzle the chocolate over the pie with a spoon , but I like to put it in a pastry bag fitted with a wide writing tip and drizzle it that way , in stripes .
Chill for at least 10 minutes before serving .

We have entered the third week of Israel ’s war on Gaza .
Pundits have said whatever needed to be said from the comfort and safety of their cocoons .
In fact , we have all begun repeating ourselves as we struggle to capture the magnitude of the man-made tragedy that Gaza is over and over again .
Hundreds of millions of agitated people have been on the streets worldwide for days — from Los Angeles to London and from Cairo to Kuala Lumpur — pleading with Israel to spare the people who have , God knows , suffered enough .
But that does n’t seem to have made any difference to the great State of Israel founded for and by the people who call themselves descendants of prophets and inheritors of divine scriptures .
Israel continues to kill without batting an eyelid and without the slightest hint of mercy for its victims .
Nearly a thousand people have been killed in full view of the international community and the civilised world routinely goes about its business .
As if nothing has happened …as if it ’s perfectly normal for an all - powerful military power with a pile of nukes and other weapons of mass destruction at its disposal to take on unarmed civilians including women and children who ca n’t even fight pangs of hunger let alone fight a brute military power !
It took Arab and European states more than two weeks to get a worthless resolution passed by the UN that finally asked Israel to please call back its valiant forces from Gaza .
And if the world expected the Zionist state to run for its life , it would have been disappointed .
Let alone respond to and act on the UN call , Israel did n’t so much as acknowledge it .
In doing so it has once again driven home the message that in its view the UN resolution is n’t worth the paper it ’s printed on .
After all , what have so many other resolutions in the past done to rein in Israel ?
Not to mention 40 others that Israel ’s patron saint America has vetoed since after the 1967 War !
Talking of America , watching the US - based television networks and reading US publications is a sobering experience .
For the majority of Americans , Gaza is a completely different war and different story .
According to their narrative , the homeless , starving and all the time dying Palestinians are not the victims here .
It ’s the other way round .
The poor , democratic and God-fearing Israel is surrounded by the bloodthirsty Arabs and Muslim terrorist states that are out to obliterate God ’s own country from the map .
Even if some liberal and balanced newspapers at times manage to report this completely one - sided war on the Palestinians and their suffering , they bend over backwards to ‘ balance ’ their coverage by splashing stories and images of horrified Israeli ‘ victims ’ of Hamas rockets .
I mean how do you ‘ balance ’ this endless parade of dead children with that of people getting all worked up expecting rockets that are little more than firecrackers ?
This is no defence of Hamas rockets .
In fact , I believe they have n’t exactly helped Palestinians .
But what do you expect from a community that has spent the last 60 plus years under a punishing occupation and without justice or promise of justice from the international community .
They do not see even a glimmer of hope for their children .
Even if you accept Israel ’s fiction that Hamas rockets are to blame for this war , is there any sense and justification for its utterly , utterly disproportionate and asymmetrical response ?
It ’s like using a battle tank to kill a fly !
This wilful suspension of belief and disconnect with what is really going on in the Middle East and what Israel ’s friends choose to believe is not limited to the US media .
From Republican conservatives to Democratic liberals , everyone appears to live on a different planet when it comes to Palestine - Israel conflict .
This past week the US Congress passed a resolution backing Israel ’s war on Gaza and its right to ‘ defend itself against Hamas terror ’ .
The resolution was passed by an overwhelming majority , and followed a similar , unanimous Senate motion , passed on Thursday .
The House resolution was passed by 390 - 5 .
That is , against 390 supporting the war on Gaza that has killed nearly a thousand innocents , nearly 400 of them children , only five were opposed to the aggression .
Lawmaker after US lawmaker sang hosannas to Israel .
No mention of hundreds of Palestinian children who were too young to know why they were being killed .
No reference to the total devastation and destruction that Israel has unleashed on Gaza .
And out of five who opposed the motion , moved jointly by Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican House majority leader John Boehner ( R ) , only Congressman Ron Paul had the courage to confront Israel for its crimes against humanity .
Ron Paul , the lone Republican Congressman who unsuccessfully ran for presidential nomination last year , tried to hold a mirror to the powers that be in the US by pointing out the US is aiding and abetting Israel in Gaza through its financial and military support .
“ The weapons being used to kill Palestinians are American weapons , and American funds are being used for this , ” said the congressman .
Unfortunately though , when it comes to Israel , conscientious voices like those of Ron Paul might have as well been raised in wilderness .
And this is not the first time the US lawmakers have taken the side of a ruthless bully against a long wronged underdog .
The House has passed similar measures expressing America ’s loyalty to Israel in recent years by landslides .
In 2006 , the House voted 410 - 8 to condemn Hamas and Hezbollah for “ unprovoked and reprehensible armed attacks against Israel ” and supported Israel ’s invasion and destruction of Lebanon .
In 2004 , the vote was 407 - 9 to support a statement by Bush that it was “ unrealistic ” to expect Israel to return to pre-1967 borders .
In 2003 again , it was 399 - 5 to back another devastating crackdown on Palestinians .
What explains this ?
Why ’s the Palestinian blood so cheap in American eyes ?
How long will the US remain a hostage of cutthroat manipulators and moneybags ?
How can a country that calls itself land of the free and claims to champion freedom , justice and human rights be so blind and so callous to the persecution of Palestinians ?
In Bob Dylan ’s words , how many times can you turn your head and pretend you do n’t see ?
America has to open its eyes to the Palestinian Holocaust before it ’s too late .
Israel ’s dance of death in Gaza is sowing seeds of all - consuming hatred and strife around the world .
If the US and the West do not act now , they will all reap this harvest of hatred .

JOHANNESBURG ( Reuters ) - Gangs of South African men are raping lesbians in the belief it will “ cure ” the women ’s sexual orientation , an aid agency said Friday .
NGO ActionAid said in a report titled “ Hate Crimes : the rise of corrective rape in South Africa ” lesbians were increasingly at risk of rape , particularly in South African townships where homosexuality is largely taboo .
South Africa has one of the world ’s most progressive constitutions and became the first country in Africa to allow gay marriage in 2006 , but homosexuality is still widely frowned upon and same - sex unions are often decried as “ un-African . ”
The brutal rape and murder last year of female soccer player Eudy Simelane , a lesbian , threw a spotlight on homophobic violence , particularly toward women .
“ We get insults every day , beatings if we walk alone , you are constantly reminded that you deserve to be raped , ” Action Aid quoted one lesbian as saying .
“ They yell , ‘ if I rape you then you will go straight , you will buy skirts and start to cook because you will have learnt how to be a real woman ’ . ”
One lesbian and gay support group told ActionAid it was dealing with 10 new cases of lesbians being targeted for what it called “ corrective rape ” every week in Cape Town alone .
Thirty one lesbians have been reported murdered in homophobic attacks since 1998 , but support groups say the actual number is probably much higher because crimes on the basis of sexual orientation are not recognized in the South African criminal justice system , Action Aid said .
Of the 31 cases , only two cases were brought to South African courts and there has been only one conviction .
South Africa has one of the world highest rates of rape but activists say very few cases end in conviction , and women ’s groups say police and the justice system have failed to tackle the problem .
ActionAid estimates there are 500,000 rapes in South Africa every year .
It said the police were particularly reluctant to investigate crimes against lesbians and said support for survivors was inadequate .
Dear Cecil :
This question came up recently in a conversation and was hotly discussed : does a pig have a corkscrew - shaped penis ?
Joe C. , Los Angeles
Cecil replies :
Only worthless California degenerates such as yourself are interested in things like this , Joe , but what the heck , I have n’t gotten any threatening letters from the postal inspectors in weeks , and it ’s time to shake those suckers up .
The answer to your question , incredibly enough , is yes — pigs do have corkscrew - shaped penises .
You may think I ’m making this up , but Uncle Cecil is here to tell you he never makes things up .
Permit me to quote from Reproductive Behavior in Ungulates , by A.F. Fraser : “ The manner of intromission [ i.e. , hosing ] in the pig is unique .
In this species , the male , when mounted , makes thrusting actions with the penis , which repeatedly makes semi-rotary actions .
Only when the spiral glans penis [ my emphasis ] of the boar becomes lodged tightly in the firm folds of the cervix does the action stop and ejaculation commence .
It is clear , in fact , that the locking of the penis in the cervix acts as the essential stimulus to ejaculation in the boar . ”
Accompanying this passage is a helpful drawing revealing that not only does the male pig have a corkscrew - shaped wanker , the female pig has a corkscrew - shaped receptacle , as it were — actually , a corkscrew - shaped cervix .
Cecil is aware that in humans the penis does n’t penetrate the cervix , but as should be obvious by now , there are many differences between human and porcine sexual practices , the principal exception being a girl I met in St. Louis in 1974 .
But I digress .
I regret to report that hours of diligent research have failed to turn up an actual photograph of the pig ’s amazing Roto - Rooter .
For some reason , publishers of livestock breeding manuals prefer to publish lavish photo spreads of pigs ’ anuses , for which I ca n’t confess to having any particular fascination .
Fortunately , cartoonist Slug Signorino , being the sensitive artistic genius that he is , has managed to come up with the lifelike representation shown here , which gives you the basic idea .
Much remains to be learned about pig reproductive physiology .
For instance , it ’s unclear whether the male pig , in the midst of his amatory labors , employs a clockwise or a counterclockwise rotation .
It may be that pigs come in both versions , as with right - and left - handed humans .
We can only guess at the life of heartache and misery that must await the little Porky equipped with a left - handed tool in a world of right - handed Petunias .
Furthermore , in view of the locking action of the male member in the cervix , we can imagine the danger of the male and female reproductive organs becoming cross - threaded during the heat of romance , resulting in the lovers being unable to separate themselves after completing the act .
For this reason we would advise farmers to equip themselves with crowbars , graphite , and 3 - in - 1 oil , so that unintended tragedy may be prevented .
Here at the Straight Dope , public service is our only goal .

Eircom , Ireland 's biggest internet provider , has agreed to block access to any website the music industry says is responsible for illegal music - swapping .
In a letter sent to ISPs across the country last week , the Irish Recorded Music Association ( IRMA ) disclosed the deal and warned others to follow suit or face legal action .
Bowing to legal pressure from the music labels , Eircom had earlier settled to implement a French - style " three strikes " rule to disconnect customers repeatedly accused of illegally accessing copyrighted material .
But a recent letter revealed IRMA 's more worrisome scheme against internet piracy .
IRMA - which represents the " big four " labels ; EMI , Sony - BMG , Universal and Warner - will compile a list of websites the group claims harbors illegal music sharing .
The labels will then file a court order to attempt to force other Irish internet providers to block access to the site .
Eircom 's compliance will be automatic .
Under the settlement deal , Eircom has agreed not to oppose any court applications to blacklist websites .
Speaking to The Sunday Business Post , an Eircom spokesperson confirmed IRMAs claims of the provider 's automatic compliance .
The music labels said the notorious den of P2P , The Pirate Bay , will be the first website targeted under its new censorship regime before it moves unto " similar websites . "
IRMA 's letter demanded other Irish ISPs join blocking websites on the music group 's list or they 'll face a lawsuit the same as Eircom . ®

BBC diplomatic correspondent
The revelation to the BBC was made by Sir John Sawers , Britain 's UN envoy Iran offered to stop attacking British troops in Iraq to try to get the West to drop objections to Tehran 's uranium enrichment project , a UK official says .
The disclosure by UN ambassador Sir John Sawers in a BBC documentary throws new light on backroom discussions between Iran and the West .
Roadside bombing attacks on British and American soldiers in Iraq were at their height in 2005 .
The extent of Iran 's role in arming and training those militias was uncertain .
Tehran denied a role , while British officials tended to hedge their accusations with references to ' circumstantial evidence ' .
Private talks
But now a senior British official has revealed that not only did the Iranians privately admit their involvement , they even made an astonishing offer to switch off the attacks in Iraq if in return the West would stop blocking Iran 's controversial nuclear programme .
We stop killing you in Iraq ... you allow us to carry on with our nuclear programme
Sir John Sawers on the Iranian offer Sir John Sawers , currently Britain 's ambassador to the United Nations , said Iranians raised the offer during informal private talks at a hotel in London .
" There were various Iranians who would come to London and suggest we had tea in some hotel or other .
They'd do the same in Paris , they'd do the same in Berlin , and then we 'd compare notes among the three of us , " he told the BBC .
" The Iranians wanted to be able to strike a deal whereby they stopped killing our forces in Iraq in return for them being allowed to carry on with their nuclear programme :
' We stop killing you in Iraq , stop undermining the political process there , you allow us to carry on with our nuclear programme without let or hindrance . ' "
The deal was dismissed by the British government and Iran 's nuclear enrichment restarted shortly after .
Old pattern
It is just one incident in a revealing pattern of on - off backroom deals with the Iranians that appear to go back to 2001 .
Former President Khatami offered to help oust Saddam , the report says
It emerges from interviews with both Iranian and American officials that after 11 September , 2001 , Tehran collaborated so closely with the US in order to topple the Taleban and remove al - Qaeda from Afghanistan , that they even provided intelligence information to pinpoint military targets for bombing .
Hillary Mann , one of the US delegates , remembers how one Iranian military official pounded the table in his eagerness to get the Americans to change targets .
" He unfurled the map on the table and started to point to targets that the US needed to focus on , particularly in the north , " she told the BBC .
" We took the map to Centcom , the US Central Command , and certainly that did become the US military strategy . "
Over Iraq too , Iran 's reformist President Mohammad Khatami offered to collaborate on ousting Saddam Hussein , arguing that the Iraqi leader was also Iran 's enemy .
But relations deteriorated after former US President George W Bush accused Iran of being part of an " Axis of Evil " .
Attempts at negotiations initiated by the Europeans in the end led nowhere .
Current prospects According to Nick Burns , in charge of Iran policy at the State Department for the Bush administration until last year , the American policy of talking tough with Iran did not prove productive .
Iran insists on its right to pursue a nuclear programme " We had advocated regime change , " said Mr Burns .
" We had a very threatening posture towards Iran for a number of years .
It did n't produce any movement whatsoever . "
The glimpses in this TV documentary of a whole series of backroom talks over several years that on occasion yielded real collaboration would appear to be encouraging .
But the impressive collection of interviews does not address what prospects now lie ahead for a possible improvement in relations .
And the essential gap remains : without exception all Iranian policy makers , even the reformist Mr Khatami who may well stand again for the post of president this summer , insist on Iran 's legal right to pursue its nuclear programme without impediment .
But the West remains deeply suspicious and alarmed at what it fears is subterfuge and deliberate procrastination to conceal Iranian plans to be able to make weapons from its uranium stocks , and therefore the Western demand remains that Iran must suspend nuclear enrichment .
President Obama 's promise to " extend a hand " if Iran " unclenches its fist " may not be enough to break the logjam .
The documentary , Iran and the West : Nuclear confrontation , airs on Saturday , 21 February , at 2100 local time ( GMT ) on BBC Two .

Most people do n’t realize that kids can suffer from arthritis .
There are 300,000 in the United States alone .
It can impact a child ’s ability to get dressed in the morning or hold a pencil long enough to take a test in school .
Recently , I had the privilege of volunteering for the fifth year at the Juvenile Arthritis Weekend .
This Arthritis Foundation event took place at the Great Wolf Lodge in Williamsburg , Virginia .
The Juvenile Arthritis Weekend started with families from Virginia .
However , it has now expanded to include families from several surrounding states as well .
Parents were able to listen to experts on topics related to dealing with juvenile arthritis .
They were also able to learn from each other .
While the parents were in sessions , the kids participated in some fun activities and learned from experts and each other as well .
Putting on an event like the Juvenile Arthritis Weekend requires a significant number of volunteers .
One of my passions is to support those suffering from arthritis because of my own family experiences dealing with arthritis .
What is your passion ?
How are you going to start acting on that passion and help others ?
Start today .
Monkeys in India have been stealing electricity meters
But residents in India are powerless to stop a gang of monkeys from stealing their electricity .
Dozens of homes in Delhi have been left without power after cheeky primates ripped electricity meters off the side of their homes .
Angry residents have complained to the authorities but the police are unable to act , according to the Austrian Times .
" Theft laws are for people , not monkeys , " said a police spokesman .
Local power supplier BSES Rajdhani revealed they replaced more than 50 stolen meters .
One annoyed resident was puzzled about the monkeys ’ motives .
He said : " We do n't know what they get out of it but they play with them for a while and then steal another one . "
deserves scrutiny : Kevin Kelly ( we 've worked together on a couple of projects in the past and I 've found him incredibly insightful ) posits a very interesting premise that I thinkscrutiny :
The idea of progress has been slowly dying .
I think progress lost its allure at the ignition of the first atom bomb at the end of WWII .
It has been losing luster since .
Even more recently the future has become boring and unfashionable .
No one wants to live in the future .
The jet packs do n't work , and the Daily Me is full of spam .
Nobody finds the Future attractive any longer .
The only thing left to believe in is collapse .
That 's not boring !
The end of civilization would be terribly exciting , and unlike any future we could imagine , probably more likely .
Dystopias are a favorite science fiction destination now .
We all are collapsitarians these days .
This is a conclusion that I think Nietzsche would concur with .
In short : it implies that without a real challenge that tests the limits of our creativity as individuals or as a species - civilization , we wither .
It that light , the growing doom is a violent psychological reaction to the terrible soul - draining ennui of Fukuyama's " end of history . "
Glad to find that I 'm not the only one pondering this element of the zeitgeist .
Welcome to PyBrain
PyBrain is a modular Machine Learning Library for Python .
Its goal is to offer flexible , easy - to - use yet still powerful algorithms for Machine Learning Tasks and a variety of predefined environments to test and compare your algorithms .
PyBrain is short for Python - Based Reinforcement Learning , Artificial Intelligence and Neural Network Library .
In fact , we came up with the name first and later reverse - engineered this quite descriptive " Backronym " .
How is PyBrain different ?
While there are a few machine learning libraries out there , PyBrain aims to be a very easy - to - use modular library that can be used by entry - level students but still offers the flexibility and algorithms for state - of - the - art research .
We are constantly working on more and faster algorithms , developing new environments and improving usability .
What PyBrain can do
PyBrain , as its written - out name already suggests , contains algorithms for neural networks , for reinforcement learning ( and the combination of the two ) , for unsupervised learning , and evolution .
Since most of the current problems deal with continuous state and action spaces , function approximators ( like neural networks ) must be used to cope with the large dimensionality .
Our library is built around neural networks in the kernel and all of the training methods accept a neural network as the to - be - trained instance .
This makes PyBrain a powerful tool for real - life tasks .

かつ てLinux がPoor man ’s Solarisと揶揄されていたのは遙か昔、今では商用UNIXのシンボル的存在であったサン・マイクロシステムズのSolarisもOpenSolarisとしてオープンソース化される時代となった。今回紹介するJaris（ヤリス）は、OpenSolarisをベースに、デスクトップOSとしての使いやすさ加えること目指して開発されている国産のディストリビューションである。ファイルシステムにはほぼ無限のスケーラビリティや高速スナップショット機能などで話題のZFSを採用し、Windowsアプリケーションの実行機能、キヤノン・エプソン製プリンタドライバの同梱などで、正規版の登場以前から注目を集めている。
なお、正規版であ るJaris 1.0はフルコンテンツ・バージョンと、機能を厳選したベーシック・バージョンの2種類の公開が予定されている。本稿は、2008年10月にリリースされたベータ版である、Jaris b98ベーシック・バージョンでテストを行った。
ライブ版で起 動
Jarisのインストールメディアはライブ版としても機能する。図1にライブ版のデスクトップ画面を示す。GNOMEをカスタマイズした美しいでデザインのデスクトップが印象的だ。パネルは下タスクバーのみの1パネル構成で、Windowsユーザーの取り込みを狙ってか「Start」メニューが左下に配置されている。
図1：秀逸なデザインのデスクトップ
X Window SystemはXorgだが、NVIDEAなどのプロプライエトリなビデオドライバも標準で搭載され、多くのマシンでCompizによる3Dデスクトップが利用可能だ（図2）。
図2：Compizによる3Dデスクトップ
なお 、Jarisのサイトでは、ライブDVD版の他にライブUSB版のイメージも公開されている。ただし、現状ではインストールスクリプトの「usbcopy」を実行するためには、Solaris系UNIX環境が必要である。
簡単インストー ル
高度なシステムの自動認識機能を備えたGUIインストーラにより、Jarisのインストールは驚くほど簡単だ。ライブ版DVDでシステムを起動し、デスクトップの「Jarisをインストールする」をダブルクリックするとGUIのインストーラが起動するのでその指示に従えばよい（）。ユーザーが入力する必要があるのは、タイムゾーンの設定、rootのパスワードと一般ユーザーのアカウント名/パスワードと、インストール先のパーティションのみだ。ネットワークはDHCP経由で設定される。なお、ブートローダにはLinuxでもおなじみのGRUBを使用しているため、WindowsやLinuxとのデュアルブート環境も構築可能だ
図 3：インストーラ画 面
パッケージ管理はIPS
Jarisのパッケージ管理システムは、OpenSolarisで新たに開発されたIPS（Image Packaging System）を採用している。これはLinuxにおけるyumやAPTと同じように、インターネットなどに置かれたリポジトリと連動するシステムだ。もちろんパッケージ間の依存関係を判断し、必要なパッケージは同時にインストールされるようになっている。IPSの操作はpkgコマンドを使用し、GUIフロントエンドとしては「パッケージマネージャ」が用意されている（）。
図 4：パッケージマネージャ
Windowsアプリケーションの実行
Jarisの目玉の1つが、Wineを独自にカスタマイズした「 Madoris Windows Program Loader」による 、Windowsアプリケーションの実行機能だろう。多くの日本語版Windowsアプリケーションを動作させることが可能だ。もちろん、すべてのソフトが動作するわけではないが、Jarisプロジェクトによって動作確認を行ったアプリケーションの一覧が公開されているので参考にするとよいだろう。
Windowsプログラムのインストールは簡単だ。「xxx.exe」などのセットアッププログラムを右クリックし、メニューから「Madoris Windows Program Loaderで開く」を選択すればよい（図5）。
図5：セットアッププログラムをMadorisで実行
インストールされたアプリケーションは「すべてのアプリケーション 」 →「 Madoris 」 → 「 プログラム名」で起動できる 。
ZFSの採用
標準ファイルシステムのZFSは128ビットという膨大なアドレス空間をサポートする、安定性と拡張性に優れたファイルシステムだ。ストレージプールと呼ばれる仮想的なデータストアに必要に応じて物理的なパーティションを追加していくことにより、ディスク空間をダイナミックに拡張していける。また、ソフトウエアRAID（RAID-0、RAID-1、RAID-Z）を簡単に構築することも可能だ。
数あるZFSの特徴の中で、デスクトップユーザーにもっとも恩恵があるのが、ファイルシステムのその時点の状態を記憶するスナップショット機能だろう。スナップショットは差分データとして保存されるため作成は一瞬で終了する。また、使用サイズも少ない。まさに“スナップショットを撮る”という感覚だ。たとえば、すべてのユーザのホームディレクトリのスナップショットを作成したければ以下のコマンドを実行すればよい。LinuxのLVMでもスナップショットは作成できるが、LVMのスナップショットがLV（論理ボリューム）単位でしか作成できないのに対し、ZFSのスナップショットは任意の単位（ファイルシステム、ディレクトリ、ファイル）で作成できる。
# zfs snapshot rpool / export/home@mySnap1
また、ZFSではロールバック機能を使用してスナップショットを作成した時点の状態に簡単に戻ることが可能だ。なお、現状ではスナップショットの操作にはコマンドラインで「 zfs snapshot / rollback 」などのコマンドを実行する必要がある。今後Mac OS XのTime Machineのようなユーザーインターフェイスが搭載されると、デスクトップユーザーに対してより強力なアピールとなるだろう。
Linuxユーザーへの配慮
コマンドライン はLinuxユーザーを意識した作りになっている。まず、Solaris系UNIXのデフォルトのログインシェルはたいていBournシェルだが、Jaris（およびOpenSolaris）では、Linuxの標準シェルであるbashがデフォルトのログインシェルに設定されている。また、ls、cp、tarといった基本コマンドはUNIX系OS間でオプション体系が異なるため使い勝手に違いがあるが、JarisではSolarisオリジナルのコマンドに加えて、GNUプロジェクトによるコマンド群が/usr/gnu/binディレクトリに用意されており、GNUコマンド群のほうが優先して使われるようになっている。
$ echo $ PATH /usr / gnu / bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin ←/usr/gnu/binの優先順位が高い $ ls /usr / gnu/bin/ ← GNU の基本コマンドの保存先 amd64 expand mv tail awk expr ncurses5 - config tar basename factor nice tee captoinfo false nl test cat fgrep nohup tic chgrp fmt od toe chmod fold paste touch chown freetype - config patch tput chroot grep pathchk tr cksum groups pentium_pro+mmx true clear head pr tset cmp hostid printf tsort comm hostname pwd tty cp iconv reset uname csplit id rm unexpand cut infocmp rmdir uniq date infotocap sdiff unlink dd join sed uptime df kill sh wc diff link sleep which diff3 ln sort who dirname logname split whoami du ls stty yes echo mkdir sum egrep mkfifo sync env mknod tack
たとえば、tarコマンドを実行した場合、GNU tarが実行されるわけだ。GNU tarに慣れたユーザーはSolarsiのtarにgzip/bzip2圧縮機能が無いことに面食らうわけだが、Jarisであればそういうこともないだろう。逆にSolarisオリジナルのコマンドを実行したければ、絶対パスで指定する必要がある。
以上 、Jarisの概要を駆け足で紹介した。ベーシック・バージョンは収録アプリケーションが少ないが、これはフルコンテンツ・バージョンが登場すれば解消されるだろう。Jarisのウリの1つであるプリンタサポートはフルコンテンツ・バージョンに含まれる予定だ。まだ若いディストリビューションだが、今後の動向に注目したい。
Speaks the Erlang network protocol and impersonates an Erlang node on the network .
Fully capable of bi-directional communication with Erlang .
Erlang types are , as far as reasonable , mapped to Haskell types .
Messages to Erlang are just function calls in Haskell , and messages from Erlang are delivered to MVars .
That ’s right , ladies and gentlemen .
We ’re talking about circumcision this week .
And we fully expect you to bring it .
Editor ’s note : Today ’s feature is the next installment in our new parenting column written by two sets of Richmonders : Jorge and Patience Salgado ( veteran parents of four gorgeous children ) , and Ross and Valerie Catrow ( total parenting rookies who have only been doing this “ raising a child thing ” for a couple months ) .
Check back fortnightly to watch them discuss / agree / disagree / throw down over all kinds of parenting issues , Richmond - related and beyond .
We are SURE to stir the pot with this next topic …
Today ’s question :
To circumcise or not to circumcise ?
The Salgados
Turtleneck or no turtleneck ?
For some couples , this is a huge discussion and others not even a blip on the radar .
Culturally , it is very uncommon for Latino males ( especially those not born in this country ) to be circumcised .
Is it just a white thing ?
We did some research and quickly decided either way ; this surgery was definitely not for our boys .
Needless to say , this invited some undesirable opinions from those close to us .
My older sister ( who was childless at the time ) , in the height of her sex - in - the - city days , was mildly horrified .
I think she was convinced we were dooming our beautiful son to a life of sexual embarrassment .
As a woman , I really did n’t get what the big deal was .
Jorge just continued to shout from the next room , “ but the sex is better ! ”
The funniest part was five years later when she had her first son and the little guy remained intact .
Cosmetic just seemed like a silly and weak reason to us .
The American Academy of Pediatrics does not endorse circumcision as a way to prevent any medical conditions like infections , potential risks of diseases , etc .
It also does not find sufficient evidence to recommend or argue against it .
The AAP is pulling a Switzerland .
While this was n’t our only reason for choosing not to circumcise , from a medical standpoint it seemed unnecessary .
At seven weeks old , our infant got a urinary tract infection .
A simple round of antibiotics solved the problem but the hospital ordeal was intense and scary .
We were new parents and everywhere we turned someone implied this might not have happened had we circumcised our son .
They may have been right , the statistics support it .
I have to admit , I was questioning our decision in the moment .
In the end , he never had another infection and was fine .
We have stood on both sides of the argument and have dealt with a potential complication due to our decision , yet we both still feel pretty secure in our choice .
It was n’t just a physical / medical one for us , it was cultural and emotional .
We did n’t hesitate when our second son was born , it ’s turtlenecks for this family .
The Catrows
When we found out we were having a baby , Ross was adamant about two things : 1 ) we were not finding out the sex of the baby and 2 ) if it was a boy , we were not getting him circumcised .
Well , we had a boy .
Knowing that , now you also know specifics about his genitalia .
That ’s weird .
Sorry , kid .
Anyway , I was surprisingly not gung - ho about either of these points , particularly when it came to the whole “ To cut or not to cut ” question .
I figured as a dude Ross was much more acquainted with the specifics of this area .
So I deferred to him .
From our conversations , it came down to these points …
We subscribe to no religious conventions that require us to circumcise our son .
Our pediatrician said there was no reason to do it and no reason not to do it .
How ’s that for non-committal ?
The whole “ embarrassment in the locker room ” is a complete joke because no one showers after gym anymore anyway .
And if they do , no one ’s going to admit they were looking at anything anway .
Word on the street is that , um , certain things are , ahem , more enjoyable should things be left intact .
( OH GOD , it almost killed me to write that as it required the knowledge that one day my CHILD will be involved in such things . )
Considering numbers 1 through 4 , why put the kid through it ?
Yes , we understand that he would n’t remember the pain and we know that most little boys have no trouble with it – just pop a pacifier in their mouths as you make the cut and they ’re typically ok .
We also know that we will eventually have to “ teach him to take care of it ” at some point , although our pediatrician has assured us ( like with most things pertaining to children ) if you keep it simple and make it a non-issue , the kid wo n’t think twice about it .
For us , we just did n’t see the point .
We figured , it ’s his equipment .
If he wants to make modifications later on in life , that ’s his call .
While he ’s on our watch , all of his parts will remain intact until he decides otherwise .
Let ’s face it , most of us either have some health related goals or need to get with it and create some .
Think about it , less than half of the US manages to meet the government ’s minimum exercise target ( either thirty minutes of moderate exercise , five days a week , or twenty minutes of vigorous exercise , three times a week ) .
The trouble with health goals is that you do n’t just achieve them and stop .
You need to keep up a consistent effort in order to achieve and maintain a good standard of physical health .
This means staying motivated and choosing to head out for a jog or gym class when you ’d rather just sit on the sofa to watch American Idol while downing a bag of potato chips .
Here are a few ways that will help you stay motivated .
Get Support
When you ’re working on a challenging , long - term goal like losing weight , do n’t feel that you have to do it alone .
Find a friend who also wants a healthier lifestyle and share your triumphs and struggles with one another .
Or , look for someone who ’s successfully lost weight – perhaps a family member or colleague – and ask for their advice and tips .
Your doctor can provide a lot of help and support – such as diet plans , referrals to a dietitian , and health checks to ensure there ’s no medical problems that would prevent you exercising .
Track Progress
When you ’re working on a big goal , it helps to keep track of your daily or weekly progress .
( For example , writers often keep track of their daily word count towards a book – 100,000 words is less scary when broken down into 200 days of 50 words each . )
You can do something similar with your health goals : being able to see the progress you ’ve made can give your motivation a huge lift on days when you ’re wondering why you bother .
Some good things to track are :
Your weight ( most dietitians advise weighing weekly , to avoid any discouragement caused by natural day - to - day fluctuations ) .
( most dietitians advise weighing weekly , to avoid any discouragement caused by natural day - to - day fluctuations ) .
Your waist , chest and hip measurements
Specific nutrition goals , such as portions of fruit and vegetables eaten , or grams of fiber
, such as portions of fruit and vegetables eaten , or grams of fiber Exercise sessions : keep track of how many you do in a week , and what level you ’re working at
If you have a daily goal , such as “ do at least thirty minutes of exercise each day ” , then mark a cross on the calendar or in your diary each day that you achieve it .
The idea is to create an unbroken chain of crosses , day after day – the longer you manage it for , the more reluctant you ’ll be to skip a day and break the chain .
Make It A Habit
Do you brush your teeth every day ?
Hopefully so – and you probably do n’t ever think about being “ motivated ” to do it .
Brushing your teeth is simply a habit .
A great way to circumvent the need for motivation is to turn your health goals into habits .
If you go for a walk every day before breakfast for three weeks , chances are , it ’ll become as much a habit as brushing your teeth is .
If you always eat a piece of fruit before deciding if you really want that chocolate bar , again , this becomes nearly automatic .
In particular , look out for any bad habits that you have established in your eating or exercising habits .
Do you always buy a mid-morning muffin from the canteen at work ?
Do you pour yourself a glass of wine with dinner every evening ?
Try limiting your habitual indulgences to occasional treats – you ’ll find that you enjoy them all the more .
Try Something New Lastly , one of the reasons why many people give up on their diet or exercise plan is because they get bored of it .
Do n’t fall into the trap of running through exactly the same exercise DVD every couple of days , or using the same three pieces of equipment in the gym .
Do n’t eat the same thing for lunch and dinner every day – even if it does let you tick all the nutritional boxes .
Try mixing things up a bit : it ’s good for your body and your mind .
Have a go at a new exercise class ( even one you think you wo n’t like ) .
Get the gym instructors to demonstrate a piece of equipment you ’ve never tried before .
Look through your recipe books , or search for healthy recipes online , and try cooking a dish you do n’t normally eat .
Have you got a health goal ?
How do you keep up your motivation over the long term
Blawgletter scanned a Fourth Circuit decision last week .
It looked dull .
Something to do with a bankruptcy trustee 's power to undo pre-bankruptcy transfers from a debtor .
Yowza !
But on second viewing , a wondrous thing twinkled from the electronic page -- yet another way Congress aided and abetted the financially poison credit default swaps industry .
[ Recall here that CDSs may have caused the financial meltdown that started in earnest last September . ]
Federal bankruptcy law cuts a big swath of the U.S. Code .
It even owns its own title -- lucky 11 .
And does it go on for miles .
Section 101 alone hews more than 55 separate definitions into our legal firmament .
Which may explain why you did n't realize four years ago that Congress vastly expanded protections for a " swap agreement " , which appears to include CDSs .
See 11 U.S.C. 101( 53B ) .
The amendatory statute , you 'll recall , bears the fetching -- and inaccurate -- name of Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 .
The legislative expansion broadened the definition of " swap agreement " to just about any type of derivative instrument .
The new scope in turn exempted lots more swap agreements from the bankruptcy " automatic stay " , which generally stops creditors from enforcing obligations of the bankrupt entity , and prohibited actions under the Bankruptcy Code to set aside preferences and constructively fraudulent transfers involving a much wider variety of swap transactions .
The Fourth Circuit case arose from supply contracts that National Gas Distributors signed with several gas purchasers , including chemical giant E.I. du Pont , during the year before NDG filed for bankruptcy protection .
Apparently the contracts locked in the prices NGD could charge for future deliveries of gas -- which price commitment proved a bad bet when spot gas prices rose .
The bankruptcy court concluded that the contracts did n't fit within the new " swap agreement " definition and that therefore NGD 's trustee could pursue claims to avoid them .
The Fourth Circuit praised the bankruptcy judge 's paper ( he made a " staunch effort " ) but gave him a failing grade anyway .
Congress did n't mean to pinch the scope of " swap agreement " to cover only instruments that trade on active markets and that do n't result in physical delivery of a commodity .
No .
It purposed to " protect [ ] financial markets from the instability that bankruptcy might cause " if swap agreements did n't get special favors .
In re National Gas Distributors LLC ( Hutson v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. , Inc. ) , No. 07-2105 ( 4th Cir. Feb. 11 , 2009 ) .
We do n't rightly know how granting even more preferences to complex financial instruments like CDSs could avoid " instability " in financial markets .
As best we can tell , the deregulation of CDS transactions in 2000 contributed mightily to the deep turmoil the markets now find themselves in .
Perhaps the law of getting consequences you do n't intend applies ?
Wow .
So , a Gametrailers poster who openly admits to being completely wrong about something fairly Sony - specific ( see his sig ) now has an ‘ insider ’ at Sony R&D , where they apparently make Firmware updates .
And nuclear weapons .
And monkeys with 3 heads .
Anyway , said insider has furnished the aforementioned poster with a likely list of updates we ’ll see in Firmware 2.7 .
If you do n’t want your brain fried by the responses over at Gametrailers , here ’s the meat of the post :
Friends List :
– Voice Messaging is now available as an alternative to text after selecting a user on the friends list .
Voice message recordings are capped at 30 seconds .
– Home Integration : Saved Playstation
Home avatar photos can be selected as photo ID for Gamer Card / Friends List .
– Trophy number and Gamer Level are listed under Friend names for quick reference .
Gamer Card & Trophies :
– Gamer Card layout has been changed to more closely resemble the Playstation Store aesthetic .
– Past Trophy information can be viewed in detail by selecting “ Recent Trophy History ” option .
– Newly aquired trophies auto-sync in the background
– Server infrastructure for Trophies has been optimized .
Resulting in faster retrieval time for Gamer Card and Trophy information .
In - Game XMB :
– Loading time for In - Game XMB has been drastically reduced , resulting in a more seemless in - game experience .
– “ Theme settings ” options while in - game is now available , allowing custom themes to be applied to the In - Game XMB .
– Internet Browser can now be accessed while in - game .
– Voice messaging and voice chat options can be used while in - game .
– Options that cannot be used in the XMB during game sessions are grayed out ( but still selectable ) to eliminate user accessibility confusion .
Misc :
– Other slight UI tweaks and enhancements .
So , the web browser that does n’t have enough bloody RAM to run when there ’s no game playing is now going to magically just ‘ appear ’ on the XMB when in - game , huh ?
Still , it ’s about time the Trophies auto - synced , if there ’s something a Firmware update needs it ’s the fixing of those damned Trophies – but it ’s the ‘ slight UI tweaks ’ that I ’m interested in the most .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama will urge European allies to support his new strategy for Afghanistan , telling NATO partners this week their security could be at risk if the country falls into chaos .

Making his first major foreign trip since taking office on January 20 , Obama will discuss the economic crisis at the London Group of 20 summit of major economic powers on Thursday .
He will then attend the NATO summit in Strasbourg , France , on Friday and Saturday , marking the alliance ’s 60th anniversary .
Just ahead of the NATO summit , Obama has unveiled a plan for Afghanistan , where violence is at its highest level since U.S. - led forces toppled the Taliban in 2001 and where the NATO mission has been criticized for disorganization .
Obama ’s strategy broadens the U.S. focus to include Pakistan and puts as the highest priority the defeat of al Qaeda militants who he said were plotting new attacks on the United States .
He will send 4,000 more U.S. troops to help train the Afghan army and will add more civilian personnel to help tackle problems such as a booming narcotics trade and government corruption .
But Obama emphasized that international cooperation was crucial to the plan ’s success and promised to take that message to Europe , where the public has grown increasingly impatient with the Afghanistan effort .
“ The world cannot afford the price that will come due if Afghanistan slides back into chaos or al Qaeda operates unchecked , ” Obama said in a speech in Washington on Friday .
“ What ’s at stake now is not just our own security -- it is the very idea that free nations can come together on behalf of our common security .
That was the founding cause of NATO six decades ago .
That must be our common purpose today , ” he added .
In a shift that has been welcomed in Europe , Obama , a Democrat , has promised a more consultative foreign policy than that of his Republican predecessor , George W. Bush .
His administration hopes Obama ’s popularity abroad will raise the profile of his push for greater support for Afghanistan .
In preparing the new Afghanistan strategy , Obama launched a 60 - day review that included input from European allies as well as other countries with a stake in the region .
A TOUGH SELL ?
Obama said that from NATO allies , he hoped for “ not simply troops , but rather clearly defined capabilities , ” including support for the Afghan elections , training of security forces and increased civilian support .
Analysts said that might be a tough sell .
Stephen Flanagan , a scholar at the CSIS think tank , said Obama will not have much luck obtaining more combat forces .
“ There just is n’t the willingness on the part of most of the European allies to do that , ” Flanagan said , but there would be greater willingness to help with training missions and civil resources .
“ It ’s going to be challenging , but I think this is where the administration and President Obama need to take full advantage of the goodwill that they have created with their new approach and emphasis on diplomacy , ” said Juan Zarate , a former counterterrorism adviser to Bush .
“ The real challenge is national interests have not changed , ” said Zarate , who praised the Obama Afghanistan plan as well thought out .
“ There is not a lot of popularity in Europe and Brussels for sending more troops and certainly not a lot of appetite for sending civilians into what is a security - challenged environment . ”
White House deputy national security adviser Denis McDonough said that while Obama had secured some new commitments of resources for Afghanistan before the NATO summit , it would be an “ ongoing process ” to solicit support .
Obama ’s schedule at the Strasbourg summit will include bilateral meetings with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
He will have a lengthy meeting in London with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
On the sidelines of the NATO summit , he will also set aside time to interact with the public during a speech and question - and - answer session with students from various parts of Europe .
After the NATO summit , Obama will attend a gathering of 27 European Union heads of state in Prague , where he also plans to deliver what his aides are billing as a major speech on nuclear proliferation .
Looming over the Prague meeting will be the issue of missile defense .
A U.S. plan to place a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic has angered Moscow .
Obama has suggested the United States would have no need to deploy proposed missile defenses in Eastern Europe if Moscow could help stop Iran from developing long - range weapons .
How to write a GIMP plug - in Written By Dave Neary
In this article , I present GIMP plug-ins basics and introduce the libgimp API .
I will also show how to use the PDB to make our plug - in available to other script authors .
Introduction New developers are often intimidated by The GIMP size and its reputation .
They think that writing a plug - in would be a difficult task .
The goal of these articles is to dumb this feeling down , by showing how easily one can make a C plug - in .
In this part , I present a plug - in 's basic elements .
We will see how to install a plug - in and how to get data from an image and directly manipulate it .
Architecture
The GIMP script interface is centered on the Procedural database ( PDB ) .
At startup , The GIMP looks into a predefined set of places for scripts and plug-ins , and asks each new script to identify itself .
The plug - in declares itself to the PDB at that time , and passes informations like the position it wishes to get in the menu hierarchy , input parameters , and output parameters .
When a script or a plug - in wants to use our plug - in , it gets through the PDB , which manages communicating parameters in one direction and the other in a transparent way .
Internal functions that wish to get exposed to plug-ins have to be packaged first in the core , that will register them in the PDB , and secondly in the libgimp that will allow the function to be called as a normal one .
This was the introduction - now , we will look closer at our first plug - in , a " Hello , world ! " .
Compiling the plug - in
To be able to compile simple plug-ins for The GIMP , one needs libgimp headers , as well as an associated utility named gimptool .
With that utility , one can install a plug - in either in a private directory ( ~/.gimp-2.0/ plug-ins ) , or in the global plug - in directory .
Syntax is gimptool - 2.0 -- install plugin.c or gimptool - 2.0 -- install -admin plugin.c
This utility , with other options , can also be used to install scripts , or uninstall plug-ins .
Behaviour A GIMP plug - in can typically behave three different ways .
It can take image data , modify it , and send back the modified image , like edge detection .
It can generate an image and send it back , like some script - fus , or file reading plug -ins like jpeg .
Or it can get an image , and process it without modifying its data , like a file saver plug - in .
Essentials #include < libgimp / gimp.h>
This header makes all basic plug - in elements available to us .
GimpPlugInInfo PLUG_IN_INFO
= { init , quit , query , run } ;
This structure has to have that name .
It contains four pointers to functions , which will be called at set times of the plug - in life .
init and quit are optional , and thus can hold NULL values , but the last two functions , query and run , are mandatory .
The init ( ) function is called each time The GIMP starts up .
This function is not typically used .
Some plug - ins use it to make a secondary search that is not done by the core .
This function is not used by any standard GIMP plug - in , but could be useful for example for a plug - in that would like to register some procedure conditionally on some files presence .
The quit ( ) function is not used much either .
It is called when The GIMP is about to be closed , to allow it to free some resources .
It is used in the script - fu plug - in .
The query ( ) function is called the first time the plug - in is present , and then each time the plug - in changes .
The run ( ) function is the plug - in 's centrepiece .
It is called when the plug - in is asked to run .
It gets the plug - in name ( as a plug - in can register several procedures ) , input parameters , and a pointer to output parameters , then determines if it is launched in a interactive way or by a script , and does all the plug - in processing .
Its prototype is void run ( const gchar * name , gint nparams , const GimpParam * param , gint * nreturn_vals , GimpParam ** return_vals ) ; MAIN () MAIN is a C macro that holds a bit of dark magic to initialise arguments .
It also calls the appropriate PLUG_IN_INFO function depending on the timing .
Your plug - in needs it .
The query ( ) function query ( ) deals with the procedure registration and input arguments definition .
These informations are saved to speed up startup time , and refreshed only when the plug - in is modified .
For our " Hello , world ! " plug - in , the query function will look like this : static void query ( void ) { static GimpParamDef args [ ] = { { GIMP_PDB_INT32 , " run-mode " , " Run mode " } , { GIMP_PDB_IMAGE , " image " , " Input image " } , { GIMP_PDB_DRAWABLE , " drawable " , " Input drawable " } } ; gimp_install_procedure ( " plug - in - hello " , " Hello , world ! " , " Displays \ " Hello , world ! \ " in a dialog " , " David Neary " , " Copyright David Neary " , " 2004 " , " _Hello world ... " , " RGB * , GRAY * " , GIMP_PLUGIN , G_N_ELEMENTS ( args ) , 0 , args , NULL ) ; gimp_plugin_menu_register ( " plug- in - hello " , " / Filters / Misc " ) ; } GimpParamDef contains three things - the parameter type , its name , and a string describing the parameter .
gimp_install_procedure declares the procedure name , some description and help strings , menu path where the plug - in should sit , image types handled by the plug - in , and at the end , input and output parameters number , as well as the parameters descriptors .
" RGB * , GRAY * " declares the image types handled .
It can be RGB , INDEXED or GRAY , with or without Alpha .
So " RGB * , GRAY * " describes RGB , RGBA , GRAY or GRAY image type .
GIMP_PLUGIN declares this procedure to be external , and not to be executed in The GIMP core .
By adding a stub run function now , we can check that our plug - in has all the essential elements , and test that it registers itself in the PDB with the " Xtns - > Plug - in Details " plug - in .
The run ( ) function
The other required function for PLUG_IN_INFO is run .
The core of the plug - in stands there .
Output values ( return_vals in the prototype ) must have at least one value associated - the plug - in status .
Typically , this parameter will hold " GIMP_PDB_SUCCESS " .
Run-modes
One can run a plug - in in several different ways , it can be run from a GIMP menu if The GIMP is run interactively , or from a script or a batch , or from the " Filters - > Repeat Last " shortcut .
The " run_mode " input parameter can hold one of these values : " GIMP_RUN_INTERACTIVE " , " GIMP_RUN_NONINTERACTIVE " or " GIMP_RUN_WITH_LAST_VALS " .
" GIMP_RUN_INTERACTIVE " is typically the only case where one creates an options dialog .
Otherwise , one directly calls the processing with values from input parameters or from memory .
For our test plug - in , we will simply display a dialog containing a " Hello , world ! " message .
Thankfully , this is really easy with GTK +.
Our run function could be : static void run ( const gchar * name , gint nparams , const GimpParam * param , gint * nreturn_vals , GimpParam ** return_vals ) { static GimpParam values [ 1 ] ; GimpPDBStatusType status = GIMP_PDB_SUCCESS ; GimpRunMode run_mode ; /* Setting mandatory output values */ * nreturn_vals = 1 ; * return_vals = values ; values [ 0 ] .
type = GIMP_PDB_STATUS ; values[0].data.d_status = status ; /*
Getting run_mode - we wo n't display a dialog if * we are in NONINTERACTIVE mode */ run_mode = param[ 0].data.d_int32 ; if ( run_mode != GIMP_RUN_NONINTERACTIVE ) g_message ( " Hello , world !
" ) ; } Now , when we run our plug - in , there is action :
Have a look at the full hello . c plug - in code .
Next part
In next part we will go on , making a more useful plug - in that will get its hands on image data .
We will see how to use
The GIMP image architecture to make the plug - in perform better , processing the image tile by tile .

On the surface , the most daunting task facing US envoy George Mitchell in his trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories is strengthening the Gaza cease - fire , and helping Gazans rise from the rubble .
But actually , the super diplomat 's biggest challenge , as he wraps up his first trip and lays plans for future journeys , lies in coming to terms with a grim and unavoidable fact :
The two - state solution is on its deathbed .
Since the Six - Day War of June 1967 , the two - state solution , based on the concept of " land for peace , " has been the central focus of almost all diplomatic efforts to resolve this tragedy .
But because of Israel 's unrelenting occupation and settlement project in the West Bank , the long - fought - for two - state solution has finally , tragically , become unworkable .
Consider :
• In 1993 , when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat famously shook hands on the White House lawn , there were 109,000 Israelis living in settlements across the West Bank ( not including Jerusalem ) .
Today there are 275,000 , in more than 230 settlements and strategically placed " outposts " designed to cement a permanent Jewish presence on Palestinian land .
• The biggest Israeli settlement outside East Jerusalem , Ariel , is now home to nearly 20,000 settlers .
Their home lies one third of the way inside the West Bank , yet the Israeli " security barrier " veers well inside the occupied territory to wrap Ariel in its embrace .
The settlement 's leaders proclaim confidently that they are " here to stay , " and embark on frequent missions to seek new waves of American Jews to move to the settlement .
• A massive Israeli infrastructure to serve and protect the settlements – military posts , surveillance towers , and settlers - only " bypass roads " that allow Israelis easy access to prayer in Jerusalem or the seaside in Tel Aviv – has cut the West Bank into tiny pieces , fragmenting Palestinian life .
• To maintain separation between West Bank Arabs and West Bank Jews , Israel has erected more than 625 roadblocks , checkpoints , and other barriers – a 70 percent increase since 2005 in a land the size of Delaware , the second - smallest state .
Israelis rarely encounter such obstacles , but Palestinians seeking to travel between villages and towns must seek permits , and even then , a short journey can take hours .
• Israel 's " suburbs " in Arab East Jerusalem , home now to nearly 200,000 Jews , form a concrete ring , isolating the would - be Palestinian capital from the rest of the West Bank .
It is therefore increasingly difficult to imagine how a Palestinian president would govern from a capital that is sealed off from the people of his nation .
These massive changes on the ground – the majority made since the initiation of the Oslo " peace process " – have , after 41 years , rendered the two - state solution all but impossible .
Workaround " fixes " – land swaps , consolidated settlements , and networks of roads and bridges to funnel Palestinians under and around the Jewish West Bank presence – have become increasingly hard to imagine .
The goal , after all , is a " viable , contiguous " Palestine , not one cut up by the visions of Israeli engineers in order to maintain an everlasting Jewish presence on Arab land .
Adding to the increasing impracticality of a two - state solution is the stubborn presence of the settlers themselves , some of whom have pledged violence should soldiers come to evict them .
Their religious fervor , and their formidable numbers – dozens of times that of the Gaza settlers removed in 2005 – suggest such threats are not idle .
Israeli President Shimon Peres warned in London recently that such an " evacuation " could trigger a civil war in Israel .
Weakening the two - state option even further has been the rain of Hamas rockets from Gaza , and Israel 's outsized response , which have placed basic necessities and reconstruction well above peacemaking on the list of priorities .
Mr. Mitchell would do well to listen to people who are thinking beyond two - state options , and foster an openness and creativity absent from American diplomacy since the beginning of this tragedy 60 years ago .
He will continue to hear from former US negotiators , such as Aaron Miller , author of " The Much Too Promised Land , " that two states represent " the least bad alternative . "
Indeed , some of the nightmare futures – the continuation of the status quo , which is growing inexorably into apartheid ; or , expulsion of West Bank Palestinians to Jordan , which is already being seriously discussed among Israelis – are completely unacceptable .
So is a one - state solution , to Israelis , which they insist would mean the end of the Jewish state .
Yet it was no less a man than Albert Einstein who believed in " sympathetic cooperation " between " the two great Semitic peoples " and who insisted that " no problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it . "
A relative handful of Israelis and Palestinians are beginning to survey the proverbial new ground , considering what Einstein 's theories would mean in practice .
They might take heart from Einstein 's friend Martin Buber , the great philosopher who advocated a binational state of " joint sovereignty , " with " complete equality of rights between the two partners , " based on " the love of their homeland that the two peoples share . "

Zimbabwe ’s new power - sharing government is n’t ideal .
Robert Mugabe remains president , despite losing last year ’s election .
His loyalists remain in charge of the army , the Justice Ministry and other key posts that allow them to arrest and intimidate opponents .
Yet respected and competent former opposition leaders now run important ministries like health , education and finance .
These reformers ran on the promise of improving the lives of Zimbabwe ’s long - suffering people .
The United States and Europe can help them deliver on those promises by providing increased financial resources .
Zimbabwe ’s own economy has been bled dry by decades of Mr. Mugabe ’s disastrous policies , which have destroyed its currency , crippled its agriculture , mining and industry , and blighted millions of lives through preventable famine and epidemics .
Any new resources must be packaged in ways that ensure they are used for their intended purposes .
And without continued sanctions targeted against Mr. Mugabe and his thuggish collaborators , even the limited progress so far achieved could easily be reversed .
The challenge is to keep the pressure on the relatively few villains committed to keeping Mr. Mugabe in power , while providing some relief to the millions of victims of his catastrophic misrule .
If you ’ve been following along it would be clear that we are on a kick to find out exactly which cheerleading squad to hire for the ultimate football party .
We ’ve found two college squads worth hiring : USC and UCLA .
But the Busted Coverage editors wanted more options so the logical thinking was to inquire with NFL teams for hiring their cheerleaders .
And the results were shocking .
If you are using the Tennessee Titans cheerleaders to promote a business they will run you $ 300 / hr ( minimum of 4 ladies ) .
On the other end of the spectrum , Seattle is a steal at just $ 150 per hour .
At these prices we are calling this segment , “ The Ultimate NFL Experience : Hire A Cheerleader . ”
The $ 300 / hr level from San Diego Chargers cheerleaders will get you :

Inside Europe 's strangest ' theme park ' :
A secret underground base offers a terrifyingly realistic reminder of Soviet occupation
A pistol - wielding guard , his snarling alsatian , a blinding spotlight in my face ... why did I spend £ 25 to be tortured in this freezing KGB bunker ?
As a snarling alsatian growls at my heels , straining at its leash , the fierce KGB interrogator barks in harsh Russian for me to face the wall for a terrifying search .
Once cleared , I am herded with the rest of this ragtag band of ‘ dissenters ’ to salute the Soviet red flag , our threadbare gulag - issue jackets offering scant protection against the biting Baltic chill .
We are told to stop thinking ‘ because the party will do that for you ’ , while anyone who shows disrespect is forced to the ground and compelled to do punishing press -ups until they fall into line .
Menacing : Keri is led down into the bunker as a snarling alsatian snaps at her feet
We are then brutally frogmarched into a dark , damp underground bunker , where we are ordered to run around a maze , thoroughly disorientating us , before we are forced to watch propaganda films boasting of Soviet prowess beneath a monstrous white bust of Lenin .
Anyone deemed too ‘ independent ’ is taken into a separate chamber and hit with belts .
Perhaps the strangest thing of all , though , is that I have just paid £ 25 for this sinister three - hour experience in one of the most unlikely new tourist attractions in Europe .
This once - secret bunker , 15 miles outside the Lithuanian capital Vilnius , has recently been opened up to visitors as a grim reminder of the realities of Soviet occupation .
Claustrophobic : Participants don Soviet gas masks
Theatre producer Ruta Vanagaite , who is behind the project , says : ‘ Usually at least one member of each party faints , and there are always people crying – the older ones mostly .
It ’s intense because in two or three hours we must make them feel what it is like to suffer under Soviet oppression . ’
After the disorientating maze and propaganda films , we are told to don claustrophobic grey rubber gas masks – the GP - 5s that were issued to Soviet citizens during the Cold War .
Our next ordeal is in a terrifying subterranean ‘ surgery ’ , where I am made to sit in a dentist ’s chair and my mouth is stuffed full of cotton wool .
I am threatened with a menacing mental implement designed to pull teeth .
The intimidation is designed to wear me down before interrogation .
We are then given a demonstration of what the Soviets ’ free health care , fondly remembered by many older Lithuanians , really entailed .
A 15 - year - old boy is told to remove his shirt as the doctor puts cotton wool between a pair of tongs .
She sets the cotton wool alight and drops it into a glass jar , which she then places against the boy ’s skin to create suction .
I feel queasy at this demonstration of ‘ fire cupping ’ , which is supposed to draw out disease through the skin .
We are then led into the interrogation room , where a lieutenant employs psychological tactics to wear us down .
Although Ruta translates for us , being screamed at in an alien language makes the experience all the more frightening .
A single desk lamp is pointed towards us as the lieutenant , wielding a standard - issue Tokarev TT - 33 service pistol – which he had earlier fired into the air to intimidate us – says we can never escape the KGB .
He pulls us one by one on to a metal stool to make us sign confessions .
One man is made to admit that he has stolen from the factory where he works as an act of ‘ anti- Soviet sabotage ’ .
Others are cajoled into writing letters pledging their allegiance to the USSR .
Keri was subjected to a psychological interrogation before signing a ' confession '
One teacher fights back the tears as she refuses to comply with the bullying officer .
Her reaction is moving and suddenly the historical context of the re-enactment becomes all the more resonant .
Ruta translates : ‘ He is saying she will be in trouble if she does not sign .
Her children will be brought here and hanged and she will have to watch . ’
This is genuinely shocking .
I find it disturbing that the actor playing the interrogator can maintain his composure while stirring up such bitter emotion .
To add to the realism , in the Eighties this actor served in the military where he was actually trained in psychological tactics by the Soviet secret police .
As well as working here , 45 - year - old Aleksejus Soldatenka is a local police commissioner who specialises in fighting organised crime .
The final act of cruelty is being told to run towards the ‘ door of freedom ’ – which has , in reality , been shut for 20 years .
We run down the filthy dank tunnel as the captain shouts orders through a megaphone .
Midway we are plunged into darkness ; and after the strains of interrogation I feel totally bewildered in the pitch blackness .
Grim reminder : Fellow ' dissenters ' are lined up on the stairs
After an indeterminate amount of time , the lights come back on and we despondently trudge back into the bunker , the promise of freedom having been so cruelly snatched away .
We ‘ Soviet citizens ’ then sit down to a typical meal of gruel and a sweet biscuit .
Finally , we are allowed to go .
Before our release , we are given vodka to steady our nerves while incongruously jovial music plays to a backdrop of multicoloured disco lights .
It feels as if I am trapped in a sinister cabaret show .
We move to an upper level , where an enormous door is pushed open , letting in a welcome blast of icy air .
The nightmare is over , at last .
It is hard to see how this place has become a tourist attraction , but Survival Drama In A Soviet Bunker , as the experience is known , has become popular with everyone from stag parties to corporate outings , prompting accusations that this is nothing more than a cynical ‘ gulag theme park ’ .
But fun it is n’t .
Ruta says this is a ‘ social project ’ to recreate life under Soviet rule in 1984 with a serious point to make .
Many Lithuanians still harbour a strange nostalgia for the dark days of Soviet occupation , choosing to remember the free health service and high levels of employment while burying memories of the tyranny that sent tens of thousands to death or exile in Siberia .
These tunnels , 15ft underground , were dug in 1983 and used to house emergency TV and radio studios in case of Nato attack .
They were later used as a Soviet base during Lithuania ’s successful struggle for independence in 1991 , but have lain empty ever since .
Now Ruta , 52 , is using them to ensure no one forgets the unpleasant truth of that era .
After my nerves settled following the experience , I asked actor Irmantas Jankaitis , who plays the Soviet captain , what it is like reliving the horrors of the past on a daily basis for the show .
Participants line up in icy temperatures outside the bunker , in the forest near Lithuania 's capital Vilnius
The 39 - year - old father of five says : ‘ I would not let one of my children do it .
But it is important that people do not become nostalgic about the past .
People forget the terrible times we had . ’
Ruta agrees .
‘ My husband hates the show .
He does n’t understand why people would pay to be tortured .
‘ It ’s not for everyone .
But these days children must learn that it ’s not a laughing matter .
Many do not understand what it was like .
‘ By the end visitors should feel how , under a totalitarian regime , they are nothing .
They should realise how much progress there ’s been over the past 17 years . ’
I was lucky .
I always knew that my time bearing the brunt of the KGB ’s terror tactics was both temporary and make - believe .
But the harrowing experience will stay with me for ever .
On March 1 , 1999 The Oprah Winfrey Show aired a show on wives who beat their husbands , excerpted from Oprah 's Web site .
Here 's some information about that show .
You can order a transcript from Oprah 's web site .
Monday 's Show : Wives Who Abuse Their Husbands Different Roles , Same Story
When you hear the term " domestic violence " you 're likely to picture a woman , battered and abused at the hands of an angry and unreasonable husband or boyfriend .
But that 's only one side of this ugly picture .
According to the latest studies , 835,000 men are attacked each year by their girlfriends or wives , and the true figure may actually be higher .
On Monday , Oprah talked to the men and women who occupy these different roles in the drama of domestic violence .
Take it Like a Man
The stories we heard from abused men are no less horrifying than those told by women .
They were kicked , hit , stabbed , pushed down stairs and through plate glass doors .
Like their female counterparts , the men often covered up for their wives , lying to doctors and authorities about the true cause of their injuries .
As one man said , " I 'm supposed to take it like a man . "
That often means not fighting back , not only because all the men on this show said they were raised not to hit women , but also because many police departments automatically consider the man the aggressor in cases of domestic abuse .
Even when the woman is at fault .
The Cycle of Abuse
Likewise , abusive women sound very much like husbands who beat their wives .
Lisa said the first time she battered her husband , " I beat the hell out of him … he walked away with bruises .
I was so ashamed of myself .
It 's not that I did n't love him , it 's that I did n't know how to react any other way …
I know he 's not going to do anything . "
Afterward , they apologize , they make up , and eventually , the cycle begins again .
Shut Up… And Listen
Claudia Dias has counseled abusive men and women for over twenty years .
She criticizes the different ways domestic violence against men and women is viewed .
" When a man hits a woman , it 's abuse and felony .
When she does it , it 's because she has a bad temper . "
Claudia describes the cycles of domestic abuse as " a dance … it does n't matter which gender does which part . "
The major difference , she says , is that men hit women to " make them shut up " whereas women hit men in order to " make them listen . "
Walking on Eggshells
Rick kept his wife 's abuse secret for 21 years before finally leaving her .
At one point he was forced to defend himself with Mace .
When the police were finally called , Rick was the one arrested .
" I felt betrayed by the system … by the courts … and by my wife . "
Today , Rick has temporary custody of his children after his wife , angry because he returned them a few minutes late from a visitation , rammed his car with her vehicle while the children were still in it .
Stephanie , their 14 - year - old daughter , says her mother would often rage at the children as well , and that life at home was like " walking on eggshells "
Changing Your Children
By witnessing their parents ' battles , children grow up believing that a normal family life is one defined by a cycle of fear , violence and tearful apologies .
In turn , that begins another cycle , one that passes the legacy violence down from parent to child .
As Oprah told Lisa , who believed her children were " very well adjusted " despite the violence they 'd witnessed from her , " There 's no question that when you argue in front of children , you change their self - esteem … in way that you will never know and they can't tell you . "
Obviously , both parents can be part of the problem in cases of domestic violence .
And both can also be part of the solution .

Dirty snow causes early runoff in Cascades , Rockies
Part of the changing climate , earlier spring snowmelt could affect hydropower generation , agriculture
News Release
January 12 , 2009
RICHLAND , Wash . —
Soot from pollution causes winter snowpacks to warm , shrink and warm some more .
This continuous cycle sends snowmelt streaming down mountains as much as a month early , a new study finds .
How pollution affects a mountain range 's natural water reservoirs is important for water resource managers in the western United States and Canada who plan for hydroelectricity generation , fisheries and farming .
Scientists at the Department of Energy ’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory conducted the first - ever study of soot on snow in the western states at a scale that predicted impacts along mountain ranges .
They found that soot warms up the snow and the air above it by up to 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit , causing snow to melt .
" If we can project the future -- how much water we 'll be getting from the rivers and when -- then we can better plan for its many uses , " said atmospheric scientist Yun Qian .
" Snowmelt can be up to 75 percent of the water supply , in some regions .
These changes can affect the water supply , as well as aggravate winter flooding and summer droughts . "
The soot - snow cycle starts when soot , a byproduct of burning fossil fuels , darkens snow it lands upon , which then absorbs more of the sun 's energy than clean white snow .
The resulting thinner snowpack reflects less sunlight back into the atmosphere and further warms the area , continuing the snowmelt cycle .
This study revealed regional changes to the snowpack caused by soot , whereas other studies looked at the uniform changes brought by higher air temperatures due to greenhouse gases .
Previous studies have also examined the effect of airborne or snowbound soot on global climate and temperatures .
Qian and his colleagues at PNNL used a climate computer model to zoom in on the Rocky Mountain , Cascade , and other western United States mountain ranges .
They modeled how soot from diesel engines , power plants and other sources affected snowpacks it landed on .
They found that changes to snow 's brightness results in its melting weeks earlier in spring than with pristine snow .
In addition , less mountain snow going into late spring means reduced runoff in late spring and summer .
They will report their findings in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research -- Atmospheres .
Making Snowhills from Mountains
Researchers know that soot settles on snow .
And like an asphalt street compared to a concrete sidewalk , dirty snow retains more heat from the sun than bright white snow .
Qian and colleagues wanted to determine to what degree dark snow contributes to the declining snowpack .
To get the kind of detail from their computer model that they needed , the PNNL team used a regional model called the Weather Research and Forecasting model -- or WRF , developed in part at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colo .
Compared to planet - scale models that can distinguish land features 200 kilometers apart , this computer model zooms in on the landscape , increasing resolution to 15 kilometers .
At 15 kilometers , features such as mountain ranges and soot deposition are better defined .
Recently , PNNL researchers added a software component to WRF that models the chemistry of tiny atmospheric particles called aerosols and their interaction with clouds and sunlight .
Using the WRF - chem model , the team first examined how much soot in the form of so - called black carbon would land on snow in the Sierra Nevada , Cascade and Rocky Mountain ranges .
Then the team simulated how that soot would affect the snow 's brightness throughout the year .
Finally , they translated the brightness into snow accumulation and melting over time .
Gray Outlook
" Earlier studies did n't talk about snowpack changes due to soot for two reasons , " said atmospheric scientist and co-author William Gustafson .
" Soot has n't been widely measured in snowpack , and it's hard to accurately simulate snowpack in global models .
The Cascades have lost 60 percent of their snowpack since the 1950s , most of that due to rising temperatures .
We wanted to see if we could quantify the impact of soot . "
Their simulations compared well to data collected on snowpack distribution and water runoff .
But their first experiment did not include all sources of soot , so they modeled what would happen if enough soot landed on snow to double the loss of brightness .
In this computer simulation , the regional climate and snowpack changed significantly , and not in a simply predictable way .
Overall , doubling the dimming of the snow did not lead to twice as high temperature changes -- it led to an approximate 50 percent increase in the snow surface temperature .
The drop in snow accumulation , however , more than doubled in some areas .
Snowpack over the central Rockies and southern Alberta , for example , dropped two to 50 millimeters over the mountains during late spring and early winter .
The most drastic changes occurred in March , the model showed .
The team also found that soot decreased snow 's brightness in two ways .
About half of soot 's effect came from its dark color .
The other half came indirectly from reducing the size of the snowpack , exposing the underlying darker earth .
Studies like this one start to unmask pollution 's role in the changing climate .
While greenhouse gases work unseen , soot bares its dark nature , with a cloak that slowly steals summertime 's snow .

Jimmy Kimmel Live ’s security guard Veatrice Rice lost her battle with cancer and passed away from the disease yesterday .
Veatrice was a tough as nails , foul mouthed woman who would make us laugh whenever she opened her mouth on the show which was n’t that often so you it was special when she did !
Recently I started calling people dumb a$$es thinking it was because of That ’ 70s
Show , but it was n’t that show that did that .
It was Veatrice who helped to add that word to my vocabulary .
So go ahead and call someone dumb a$$ today in her honor .
My prayers go out to her husband John and everyone at Jimmy Kimmel Live !
Donations can be made in her honor to The American Cancer Society at www.cancer.org or the Paralyzed Veterans of America at www.pva.org
UPDATE : The producers of Jimmy Kimmel Live ! posted video of some Veatrice Rice ’s funniest bits on the show on the Jimmy Kimmel Live !

Thousands of Mexican soldiers pour into the country 's most violent city in crackdown on drug gangs
Armed to the hilt , they came from land and air , determined to restore order to Mexico 's most violent city .
Nearly 2,000 Mexican soldiers and armed federal police poured into the border town of Ciudad Juarez last weekend .
The city - just across from El Paso in Texas - has been ravaged by drug gangs .
Just this month 250 people were killed there by hitmen fighting for lucrative smuggling routes .

The soldiers ' mandate is clear - and ambitious .
' This is to reinforce the operation in general ... to eradicate kidnappings , extortion , assaults and homicide , ' army spokesman Enrique Torres said .
The soldiers are the first contingent of as many as 5,000 troops and federal police being sent to Juarez .
The deployment is part of a five thousand man troop increase planned for this city - given the unlucky title of Mexico 's most violent
The soldiers and police were flown in by air as well as driven in
Almost 2,500 soldiers and federal police have been there for nearly a year , but they have failed to curb the violence plaguing the city of about 1.6 million people .
President Felipe Calderon 's military operation is supported by the United States , which is concerned the violence could destabilize Mexico , a key trading partner , and spill over the border .
Mexico has deployed some 45,000 troops across the country to try to crush drug gangs , but clashes between rival cartels and security forces killed around 6,000 people last year .
MASSACRE CENTRAL : HOW DRUG GANGS HAVE MADE MURDER AND TORTUE A WAY OF LIFE IN MEXICO
Yesterday Mexico's army blitzed a former holiday resort that 's now the most deadly place on Earth .
ANDREW MALONE reports
Bristling with firepower , faces hidden by balaclavas and sunglasses , the troops arrived by land and air .
In scenes reminiscent of a Hollywood action film , convoys of military vehicles stretching for more than half a mile snaked into the Mexican border town of Ciudad Juarez yesterday , carrying 5,000 soldiers and federal police armed with assault rifles and rocket - propelled grenades .
Their mission ?
To tackle rampaging drugs gangs whose turf wars have left more than 6,000 people dead in a year - 700 in the past month .
It is a last desperate move in what has become the murder capital of the world .
Once an upmarket holiday resort for rich Americans , Ciudad Juarez is in the grip of anarchy as rival gangsters battle each other - as well as the police and army - for control of this key staging post for drugs into the lucrative U.S. market as well as onwards to Europe .
Between federal police and Mexican Army soldiers up to 2,000 law enforcement officers swarmed the streets of Juarez over the weekend to join the 2,500 already there - and there are more to come
Described as a ' narco insurgency ' that threatens the entire nation , the scale of the crisis was dramatically underscored last week when the city 's head of police in the city was forced to flee .
Robert Orduna had been warned that one of his men would be slaughtered every 48 hours until he quit .
The drug lords kept their promise : they butchered five of Orduna 's officers in ten days .
The killings came after hit - lists were pasted on shop windows warning of ' never - ending ' bloodshed until police ' backed off ' - and Orduna left town .
' I can't allow my men to continue losing their lives , ' Orduna said in a statement after being smuggled out of his office , where he slept inside a bulletproof cage .
' I am presenting my permanent resignation . '
To the dismay of Mexican President Felipe Calderon , Orduna had only been in the job for six months : his predecessor fled across the border to Texas after he , too , was told to leave town or die .
He , in turn , had replaced a police chief murdered by the gangs .
Mexican soldiers are ready for battle with drug gangs .
The Government is deploying 5,000 troops to try to restore order in the country 's most violent city
These slayings were the latest chilling sign that the gangs are determined to control this border city .
Once popular with U.S. stars such as Frank Sinatra , Marilyn Monroe and Ernest Hemingway , the bars are empty now and the once - elegant streets awash with blood .
Every day , gun battles rage along Triumph of the Republic Boulevard , the city 's main thoroughfare , and the heads of enemies of the drug lords have been impaled on spikes in parks once popular with picnicking families .
Hospitals treating victims regularly come under machine - gun fire .
Radios used by emergency services are interrupted by the drugs gangs , who warn paramedics they will be killed if they treat any wounded .
Over one 24 - hour period last month , 17 people were murdered , a relative of a U.S. congressman was kidnapped , and scores of buildings were set ablaze .
The war is being fought between a bewildering array of gangs , many of them using ex-Special Forces soldiers recruited from the Mexican military .
They are supported by corrupt police - with as many as one in five of local law - enforcement officers believed to be in the pay of the gang lords .
A forensic police officer investigates yet another gang - related murder
One commander was arrested last month on charges of attempting to smuggle a ton of drugs into the U.S. through El Paso .
Much of the bloodshed is being orchestrated by Joaquin ' Shorty ' Guzman , one of the world 's most wanted men , who leads a cartel from the Pacific - coast state of Sinaloa .
Guzman has already turned his homeland into his own personal fiefdom .
Blamed for the deaths of 600 people already this year , the drugs baron has become enraged by the Mexican government 's attempts to curtail his operations .
In one recent shoot - out , he exacted revenge by killing seven federal agents and beheading them .
Armed with AK - 47 assault rifles - known in Mexico as cuernos de chivo ( goat 's horns ) due to their curved magazines - they also pumped more than 100 rounds into two police officers who had the temerity to stop one of their men .
Guzman , who wears orange ostrich - skin cowboy boots and gold jewellery in the shape of machine guns , has been battling the rival Gulf Cartel for control of Tijuana , another town near the U.S. border , where he has posted videos of executions and beheadings of rivals on the internet .
He has also left headless corpses of rival gangs in playgrounds as a ' warning to the next generation ' .
Mexico's President Felipe Calderon has vowed to keep up the pressure on the drug cartels
Not content with his estimated £ 15 bn drugs business on the Pacific coast , however , Guzman wants to expand his empire into Ciudad Juarez , currently in the hands of rival Vicente Carrillo Fuentes .
Fuentes , who has had a $ 5 million ( £ 3.5 m ) bounty put on his head by the U.S. , has for years controlled this overland shipment route for billions of dollars worth of drugs into the U.S. , running his operation from a quasi-military headquarters possibly in Chile or Argentina .
Among the brutal methods in his ' narco - war ' was the so - called ' House of Death ' - an infamous building in Ciudad Juarez where torture and mass murders took place .
It was discovered by an undercover U.S. agent - but the resulting court case was thrown out because American officials had colluded in the killings rather than blow the cover of their agent .
And the crisis has even spilled across the border into the U.S. , where there has been a spate of killings and kidnappings by the murderous cartels .
Officers detain alleged members of a criminal gang .
The police chief in Ciudad Juarez , Robert Orduna , quit after five of his men were murdered in 10 days
Barack Obama has been warned that Mexico 's drugs lords now pose as big a threat to U.S. national security as Islamic insurgents .
The U.S. is now planning to deploy the military to the border to try to contain the bloodshed .
' The violence is spreading like wildfire across the Rio Grande , ' said George Greyson , an expert on Mexico at the College of William & Mary in Virginia .
The latest troop movements were ordered after President Calderon vowed to wipe out the drugs gangs , and pledged to send 5,000 men into Ciudad Juarez for a final showdown .
' We 're throwing everything into this .
We are cleaning the house , ' the President insisted .
The stakes could not be higher .
As one of the Mexican president 's aides predicted last night , if the government gave up its fight against the cartels , ' the next president of the republic would be a drug dealer ' .
But Jose Reyes Ferriz , mayor of Ciudad Juarez , believes the drug war will end only when both sides have ended up killing each other - and there is no one left to deal drugs .
Reyes said : ' But then someone else will just move in and take over .
It 's all just a nightmare . '
Shell Game
Кто кого ? — В. И. Ленин
There are two ways you can look at the current banking crisis .
The first is that we are in the middle of a panic , and that this panic has frozen the markets for various complex assets .
As a result , the few of these assets that do sell get sold for far less than their actual value .
This seems to be the official administration view , as expressed in the bank bailout plan released yesterday .
This point of view requires you to believe some odd things .
For one , you have to accept that none of the titans of Wall Street has been rational enough to snap up the incredible deals now lying in the street , hoovering up every " depressed legacy asset " it can find , knowing that in the fullness of time it will turn into a beautiful swan of value .
You have to somehow simultaneously believe that the government has a clearer view of correct price levels than the market ( otherwise the Geithner plan makes no sense ) , and that the market does better at setting prices than the government ( otherwise you would n't need private " partners " in the plan at all ) .
You have to believe that market prices are deeply irrational , markets are driven by emotion , and the government is both better and worse than the private sector at price discovery .
This is a weird set of beliefs for an American government , especially one whose economic team comes straight from Wall Street , to hold .
The second way to look at things is that we are not in a panic , but in the painful process of deflating a credit bubble .
Bank assets are not trading at pretend prices that we can just dismiss as a collective case of the vapors , but at prices near their actual value .
The markets are frozen because price discovery would force banks to apply the cold , wet hand of reality to their balance sheets , and many of them would be bust .
As long as you do n't open up your vault and look inside , you can continue to believe it 's filled with gold ingots .
If this second point of view is true , then the bank rescue plan is a shell game .
Half a trillion dollars is going to make a one - way trip from the FDIC to a number of large banks , with a big taste skimmed off for the usual Wall Street intermediaries in return for their political support .
The FDIC is not taxpayer - funded , but the FDIC also does not have a half trillion dollars .
In fact , it is nearly broke .
If asset prices fail to reinflate to pre-crash levels , someone is going to have to cover a half - trillion - dollar tab .
For a hint as to who this will be , I suggest a visit to the nearest mirror .
Though the bailout plan seems complex , simple examples demonstrate that it is a sucker 's bet .
But for some reason you wo n't see this kind of critical analysis on the front page of the New York Times .
Instead , today 's paper has headlines about A.I.G. returning $ 50 million in bonuses ( one ten - thousandth of the bank bailout cost ) , along with a People - style front - page article focusing on Geithner 's struggle to convince Wall Street plutocrats to take more free money :
Mr. Geithner and other administration officials spent days briefing crucial people on Wall Street and working to line up endorsements from prominent equity fund managers and other private - sector “ validators , ” in particular two leading global investment management firms , BlackRock and Pimco .
Since BlackRock and Pimco stand to make more cash on this deal than the entire Times readership could roll in if it spent the rest of its life rolling in money , I do n't really understand why these briefings took days to complete .
Probably because the fund managers kept pinching themselves and demanding that Geithner furnish proof that they were not actually dreaming .
There 's a nice American variant of the Lenin quote at the top of this post :
If you do n't know who the sucker in the room is , you 're the sucker .
As you read about this plan in the mainstream press , notice how everybody in it ends up a winner - the behemoth private partners who earn their guaranteed profit , the banks that get to trade their sulky , misunderstood securities for sweet cash , and the Treasury , whose superior understanding of asset value is going to earn it a mint .
The plan is such a good deal for everyone that it 's amazing we did n't try it sooner .
And not a sucker in sight !

Sony workers at a video tape plant in Pontonx - sur - l ' Adour , south - west France , yesterday demonstrated a bit of the old Bastille spirit by taking hostage the company 's chief exec who'd dropped in for a final " courtesy visit " to the 300 dismissed employees .
The workers are apparently a bit miffed that their redundancy packages are less than those offered to other French Sony workers , and " dozens of staff " seized Serge Foucher at 5 pm and then " barricaded the entry to the site with tree trunks " .
According to the Guardian , roughly 80 workers presented themselves for picket line and guard duty at the factory at 8 am this morning , while local authorities attempted to negotiate Foucher 's release .
Patrick Hachaguer of the " communist - leaning " CGT union " confirmed that Foucher had spent the night shut in a meeting room " .
He reported : " He wo n't listen to us , we did n't find any other solution . "
Those among you who consider the workers ' reaction to their dismissal a little excessive should note that Foucher is fortunate not to be chief exec of Graziano Transmissioni India .
Lalit Kishore Choudhary was last year beaten to death by angry former employees at the company 's car parts factory in Uttar Pradesh state . ®
Update
It appears Foucher has now been released , having agreed with to return to the negotiating table .
More here for those with a command of the French lingo .

Academics meeting in Bristol at the weekend for Britain 's first conference on the psychology of climate change argued that the greatest obstacles to action are not technical , economic or political — they are the denial strategies that we adopt to protect ourselves from unwelcome information .
It is true that nearly 80 % of people claim to be concerned about climate change .
However , delve deeper and one finds that people have a remarkable tendency to define this concern in ways that keep it as far away as possible .
They describe climate change as a global problem ( but not a local one ) as a future problem ( not one for their own lifetimes ) and absolve themselves of responsibility for either causing the problem or solving it .
Most disturbing of all , 60 % of people believe that " many scientific experts still question if humans are contributing to climate change " .
Thirty per cent of people believe climate change is " largely down to natural causes " , while 7 % refuse to accept the climate is changing at all .
How is it possible that so many people are still unpersuaded by 40 years of research and the consensus of every major scientific institution in the world ?
Surely we are now long past the point at which the evidence became overwhelming ?
If only belief formation were this simple .
Having neither the time nor skills to weigh up each piece of evidence we fall back on decision - making shortcuts formed by our education , politics and class .
In particular we measure new information against our life experience and the views of the people around us .
George Lakoff , of the University of California , argues that we often use metaphors to carry over experience from simple or concrete experiences into new domains .
Thus , as politicians know very well , broad concepts such as freedom , independence , leadership , growth and pride can resonate far deeper than the policies they describe .
None of this bodes well for a rational approach to climate change .
Climate change is invariably presented as an overwhelming threat requiring unprecedented restraint , sacrifice , and government intervention .
The metaphors it invokes are poisonous to people who feel rewarded by free market capitalism and distrust government interference .
It is hardly surprising that political world view is by far the greatest determinant of attitudes to climate change , especially in the US where three times more Republicans than Democrats believe that " too much fuss is made about global warming " .
An intuitive suspicion is then reinforced by a deep distrust of the key messengers : the liberal media , politicians and green campaign groups .
As Jeremy Clarkson says , bundling them all together : " ... everything we 've been told for the past five years by the government , Al Gore , Channel 4 News and hippies everywhere is a big bucket of nonsense . "
Michael O'Leary , the founder of Ryanair , likens " hairy dungaree and sandal wearing climate change alarmists " to " the CND nutters of the 1970s " .
These cultural prejudices , however simplistic , align belief with cultural allegiance : " People like us , " they say , " do not believe in this tripe . "
However much one distrusts environmentalists , it is harder to discount the scientists … depending , of course , on which scientists one listens to .
The conservative news media , continues to provide a platform for the handful of scientists who reject the scientific consensus .
Of the 18 experts that appeared in Channel 4's notorious sceptic documentary The Great Global Warming Swindle , 11 have been quoted in the past two years in the Daily and Sunday Telegraph , five of them more than five times .
Dr Myanna Lahsen , a cultural anthropologist at the University of Colorado , has specialised in understanding how professional scientists , some of them with highly respected careers , turn climate sceptic .
She found the largest common factor was a shared sense that they had personally lost prestige and authority as the result of campaigns by liberals and environmentalists .
She concluded that their engagement in climate issues " can be understood in part as a struggle to preserve their particular culturally charged understanding of environmental reality . "
In other words , like the general public , they form their beliefs through reference to a world view formed through politics and life experience .
In order to maintain their scepticism in the face of a sustained , and sometimes heated , challenge from their peers , they have created a mutually supportive dissident culture around an identity as victimised speakers for the truth .
This individualistic romantic image is nurtured by the libertarian right think tanks that promote the sceptic arguments .
One academic study of 192 sceptic books and reports found that 92 % were directly associated with right wing free market think tanks .
It concluded that the denial of climate change had been deliberately constructed " as a tactic of an elite - driven counter - movement designed to combat environmentalism " .
So , given that scepticism is rooted in a sustained and well - funded ideological movement , how can sceptics be swayed ?
One way is to reframe climate change in a way that rejects the green cliches and creates new metaphors with a wider resonance .
So out with the polar bears and saving the planet .
Instead let 's talk of energy independence , and the potential for new enterprise .
And then there is peer pressure , probably the most important influence of all .
So , when dealing with a sceptic , do n't get into a head to head with them .
Just politely point out all the people they know and respect who believe that climate change is a serious problem — and they are n't sandle - wearing tree huggers , are they ?

The chief judge at the Guantanamo Bay war crimes court Thursday rejected President Obama ’s call to halt the prosecution of terrorism suspects , ruling that a delay in the case of a Saudi accused in the Cole attack would “ not serve the interests of justice . ”
Army Col. James L. Pohl said the government ’s request to postpone until May the Feb. 9 arraignment of Abd al Rahim al Nashiri was “ not reasonable . ”
Prosecutors and defense lawyers in the case already had agreed to Obama ’s request for a four - month suspension in the proceedings to review the military commissions process created under former President Bush .
Legal scholars and Pentagon officials said Pohl ’s ruling was not insubordination because Obama ’s proposal was a request , not an order .

Pohl pointed out that the rules for military commissions adopted by Congress in 2006 gave the military judges “ sole authority ” to grant delays once charges had been referred for trial .
“ Technically , it ’s within the judge ’s discretion to treat this as a request or a motion on the part of the prosecutors and the government , ” said Carl Tobias , a law professor at the University of Richmond .
“ We like to think that even military judges are independent , to some extent , of the commander in chief .
“ But given the clear message in the executive orders of last week , it ’s difficult to understand why that request would n’t be granted , ” Tobias added .
“ If the issue is really forced , the judge would probably have to yield . ”
One factor in the judge ’s decision to proceed with Nashiri case could be that some evidence against the Saudi would not be admissible in U.S. federal court , where critics of Guantanamo want the war crimes cases moved .

Nashiri is one of the terrorism suspects the Bush administration admitted waterboarding , an interrogation method in which a person is made to feel he is drowning .
Eric H. Holder Jr. , Obama ’s nominee to be attorney general , called the technique torture during his confirmation hearing last week , and Obama has signed an executive order banning torture .
“ Judge Pohl ’s decision to unabashedly move forward in the Al Nashiri military commission case shows how officials held over from the Bush administration are exploiting ambiguities in President Obama ’s executive order as a strategy to undercut the president ’s unequivocal promise to shut down Guantanamo and end the military commissions , ” said Anthony D. Romero , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union .
Legal analysts said they doubted the standoff between Obama and Pohl would be allowed to mushroom .
The top official in the tribunal , former Pentagon judge and Bush appointee Susan J. Crawford , has the authority to step in and drop the capital charges against Nashiri , said his Navy defense lawyer , Lt. Cmdr. Stephen Reyes .

Crawford recently indicated a desire to distance herself from the legacy of Guantanamo by refusing to prosecute Mohammed Qahtani , a prisoner suspected of aiding the Sept. 11 plotters , on the grounds that his treatment under interrogation amounted to torture .
She also dropped charges in October against five prisoners connected with Al Qaeda recruiter Abu Zubaydah without explanation , stirring speculation that the government had been relying on evidence produced by “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” that would n’t be admissible even in the war crimes court .
Still , Guantanamo ’s supporters in the Pentagon have continued to push ahead with trials .
Just days before Obama ’s inauguration , military prosecutors filed new terrorism charges against three of the five men Crawford dropped charges against .
A Pentagon spokesman insisted that Obama ’s call for a halt in the proceedings would be honored .
Advertisement
“ The Department of Defense is currently reviewing Judge Pohl ’s ruling .
We will be in compliance with the president ’s orders regarding Guantanamo , ” said Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey D. Gordon , a public affairs officer .
Military judges presiding over two other cases at Guantanamo , including that of alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and four others , agreed to suspend those proceedings last week after Obama made the request .

Hillary Clinton presented Russia with an " easy button " to celebrate our awesome new relationship but then everything went terribly wrong .
Because , you know , nothing says " new chapter in Russo - American relations " like A BIG RED BUTTON but that is just the beginning of this bizarre snafu : the button was supposed to say " reset " in Russian .
Instead it says " overcharge . "
And the Russian Foreign Minister is all " ok nice work on the translation , morons , " and Hillary tries to laugh it off but basically it's the Cold War again guys , let 's all go see Watchmen .
A German 16 - year - old named Kim ( born Tim ) has become the youngest person to undergo a sex change operation .
Paid for by the German health service , psychologists stated he / she was “ without doubt a girl in a boy ’s body “ .
Since the age of 12 , Kim has been undergoing hormone therapy .
Dr Bernd Meyenburg , head of the Psychiatric Special Outpatient Clinic for Children and Adolescents with Identity Disorders at the University of Frankfurt Hospital explained
Very few youth psychiatrists have any experience with transsexual developments …
I was always against such operations on children so young but after seeing how happy one of my patients was and how well adjusted after returning from having the operation abroad while still a teenager – I realised that in some cases it is the right decision …
Kim is such a case – she always knew what she wanted .
Kim ’s father explains his feelings :
I suppose it took me longer than my wife to accept it , but Kim is a very persuasive girl , she knows what she wants and how to get it .
I am very proud of what she has achieved , how she has managed to get there and how she sticks to her dreams no matter how hard and painful they are to follow .

PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) - Investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N said on Monday it had no plans to purchase new corporate jets or build an airport hangar until it has repaid the funds it got through the U.S. governments Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) .
ABC News had reported that JPMorgan , the recipient of $ 25 billion in TARP funds , planned to spend $ 138 million to buy two new luxury planes and build a corporate hangar .
JPMorgan spokesman Joseph Evangelisti , however , said the company would not buy any aircraft or spend money on a hangar until 100 percent of the TARP funds were repaid .
< section > is not just a “ semantic < div > ”
HTML 5 introduces new elements like < section > , < article > and < footer > for structuring the content in your webpages .
They can be employed in many situations where < div > is used today and should help you make more readable , maintainable , HTML source .
But if you just go through your document and blindly replace all the < div>s with < section >s you are doing it wrong .
This is not just semantic nit-picking , there is a practical reason to use these elements correctly .
In HTML 5 , there is an algorithm for constructing an outline view of documents .
This can be used , for example by AT , to help a user navigate through a document .
And < section > and friends are an important part of this algorithm .
Each time you nest a < section > , you increase the outline depth by 1 ( in case you are wondering what the advantages of this model are compared to the traditional < h1 > - < h6 > model , consider a web based feedreader that wants to integrate the document structure of the syndicated content with that of the surrounding site .
In HTML 4 this means parsing all the content and renumbering all the headings .
In HTML5 the headings end up at the right depth for free ) .
So a document like the following :
< body > < h1 > This is the main header </ h1 > < section > < h1 > This is a subheader </ h1 > < section > < h1 > This is a subsubheader </ h1 > </ section > </ section > < section > < h1 > This is a second subheader </ h1 > </ section > </ body >
has an outline like :
This is the main header +-- This is a subheader +-- This is a subsubheader +-- This is a second subheader
If you just blindly convert all the < div>s on your pages to < sections > it 's pretty unlikely your page will have the outline you expected .
And , apart from being a semantic faux - pas , this will confuse the hell out of people who rely on headings for navigation .
Hopefully , in time , we will get tools that make this kind of mistake obvious and CSS support for selecting headings based on depth .
Until then remember < section > is not just a semantic < div >
Alan Schneider , who admitted helping steal $ 60 million from investors , wo n't spend a day in prison .
A judge 's decision Thursday to give him probation instead of sending him to prison outraged bilked investors , who said the ruling amounted to a free pass .
Schneider , according to prosecutors , was the lesser party in a scheme his wife , Joanne , ran to lure investors into fraudulent securities , mortgages and other investments that included the failed Cornerstone retail and entertainment development in Parma Heights .
He had pleaded guilty to securities and theft charges last month that could have resulted in up to 7 ½ years in prison .
Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Eileen A. Gallagher instead skipped prison and sentenced him to five years ' probation .
Schneider must do 5,000 hours of community service .
As victims of the scheme threw up their hands in the courtroom and cursed under their breath , Gallagher said she was honoring the plea agreement .
Assistant County Prosecutor Dan Kasaris deferred to Gallagher 's decision , saying only that he was disappointed jail was not part of the sentence .
He stressed afterward that the plea agreement left the sentencing up to the judge .
Joanne Schneider is scheduled to appear in the same court Mar. 12 .
Investors who had urged Gallagher to take a stand against white - collar crime complained that the system failed and left no option but street justice .
One told others she knew where Schneider lives and gave the address .
Cynthia Glenn , who told the court that she believed stress from the case had caused the heart attacks that killed her husband , sat with her mouth open , asking over and over if she had heard the sentence properly .
" It 's disgusting , " she said .
" No justice . "
Catherine Ulan urged Gallagher to give a harsh sentence to the operator of a Ponzi scheme , so he would n't be free in two years and living at a resort with money he hid away .
She was incredulous that Schneider did n't even receive those two years .
" I want to know how to get in the program where you can steal $ 60 million and not go to jail ? " she said .
" Wow . "
Court officials told Gallagher during the hearing that they have no evidence of Schneider hiding missing money .
The sentence brought the second gasp from victims during the session .
The first came when Gallagher noted Bishops Roger Gries and James Quinn , from the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland , wrote on Schneider 's behalf .
When victims spoke , most mentioned how the Schneiders had won their trust with prominent displays of Catholic imagery , mentioning they did business with the diocese and using faith as a bond .
Cleveland police officer James Simone , known as " Supercop , " came to court to speak on behalf of Schneider , but Gallagher did not allow it .
Simone said afterward that he was a friend of the Schneider family .
Schneider 's lawyers said he rents an apartment for $ 300 a month and lives off Social Security and pensions .
Schneider apologized and said he never meant to cause harm .
He said he and his wife paid returns to investors for years but were in over their heads on the Cornerstone project and kept taking in money to stay afloat .
" I did it not for my gain but to try and resurrect things and save them money , " he said .

BBC News , Caracas
President Hugo Chavez has said he intends to run for re-election in 2012 Venezuela 's National Assembly has voted to switch control of the country 's highways , ports and airports from the state to the federal level .
The move gives control of key transport links to President Hugo Chavez .
Critics say it is unconstitutional and will further consolidate Mr Chavez 's hold on power by weakening governors and mayors in opposition - run states .
Mr Chavez recently won a referendum removing limits on how many times he and others can run for re-election .
This change to the law on decentralisation puts the control of key transport and maritime links out of the hands of the states and under the control of the executive for what the government calls " strategic reasons " .
During a lengthy debate in the assembly , which is largely made up of the president 's supporters , the head of the United Socialist party , Mario Isea , said they were approving the changes to " defend the right of access " and " guarantee essential public services " to all Venezuelans .
Since the government lost a number of key seats , including the mayoralty of Caracas , in local elections last year , there have been regular clashes over jurisdiction between local mayors and the national government .
This change to the law comes just weeks after Venezuelans voted for a constitutional amendment granting Mr Chavez and other elected officials the right to stand for election beyond the previous limit of two terms .
The socialist leader has indicated on several occasions that he intends to run again for office in 2012 and has talked of remaining in power until 2021 .

CHICAGO – How did the universe begin ?
How will it end ?
Do other universes exist ?
Everyone at some time or another ponders these questions .
Generations of researchers have brought us to our current point of understanding , but our picture of the universe has changed more in the past decade or so than it did in the past century .
The changes have had a significant effect upon our understanding of the future of the universe and life within it .
Lawrence Krauss , a theoretical physicist and cosmologist at Arizona State University , will describe how these revolutionary discoveries in cosmology have dramatically altered our views on the universe at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting on Feb. 16 .
In his lecture " Our Miserable Future , " Krauss will discuss the impact of new discoveries , including the key facts that the universe is flat and the dominant form of energy in the universe resides in empty space .
While significantly impacting our understanding of the future of our universe , these changes have also effected the questions asked in modern cosmology , forcing researchers to confront several profound questions .
" Are fundamental cosmological questions falsifiable ?
Are the laws of nature fixed , or environmental ?
Are there fundamental cosmological limits to knowledge , and to life ? " asks Krauss , a professor in ASU 's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences where he is a faculty member in the School of Earth and Space Exploration and the Physics Department .
" The revolutionary developments of the past decade have forced us to confront truly fundamental questions at the basis of science .
" In the far future all evidence of the big bang will disappear and scientists will think we live in a static eternal universe , " explains Krauss .
Looking out at a night sky twinkling with distant light , it 's a disturbing challenge to imagine that one day – far in the future – we will be alone in a dark empty universe .
The rest of the universe will disappear before our very eyes .
Krauss adds , " We may live at a very special time in the history of the universe .
Understanding why that appears to be the case is one of the biggest open questions in cosmology . "

When Losing Leads to Winning
Here ’s my favorite new fact about N.C.A.A. basketball : teams that are behind by one point at halftime are actually more likely to win than teams that are one point ahead .
This striking finding comes courtesy of a terrific new paper by my Wharton colleagues , Jonah Berger and Devin Pope .
Their findings are summarized in this graph , which collects info from 6,572 N.C.A.A. basketball games since 2005 :
The first dot ( on the bottom left ) shows that among those teams behind by 10 points at halftime , only 11.8 percent won ; the next dot shows that those behind by 9 points won 13.9 percent , and so on .
The line of best fit ( the solid line ) shows that raising your halftime lead by two points tends to be associated with about an 8 percentage - point increase in your chances of winning , and this is a pretty smooth relationship .
But notice what happens when we contrast teams that are one point behind at halftime with teams that are one point ahead : the chances of winning suddenly fall by 2.4 percentage points , instead of rising by 8 percentage points .
Berger and Pope are two of the brightest young behavioral economists around , and they posit a behavioral explanation .
Losing can lead to winning because of the strong motivating effects of being close to your goal .
You can link some of this to Prospect Theory — loss aversion suggests that you may be willing to work harder to avoid a negative outcome ( a loss ) ; the leading teams , by contrast , are n’t focused on the losing domain .
And in fact , most of this “ catch - up ” occurs in the first 10 minutes after halftime .
But how can we tell whether this is the losing team working harder , or the halftime leader easing up ?
Here , they move from field evidence to the Wharton behavioral lab , setting up a very simple experiment in which their subjects were challenged to a trivial task — how many times they could type “ a ” then “ b ” in half a minute .
The subjects were told that if they beat their opponent , they would get a bigger payout .
After the first round of competition , some were given feedback , and others were n’t .
And here ’s the key to the experiment : they randomly told some folks that they were a long way behind their opponent , others were told they were a little bit behind , or exactly tied , a little ahead , or even a long way ahead .
Those who were randomly told they were a little bit behind improved their performance dramatically , while the other groups improved by about the same amount as the control condition ( that is , the same improvement as those given no feedback at all ) .
It ’s an intriguing finding : being behind by a little yields the greatest possible effort .
And while these researchers measure these effects on the basketball court , or on pounding keyboards , their implications for the rest of our lives are even more intriguing .

Tell them that they are running a close second in the race for promotion .

Supply , Demand , and English Food
We Americans like to boast about our economic turnaround in the
' 90s , but you could argue that England - - where I 've spent the past few
weeks -- is the real comeback story of the advanced world .
When I
first started going there regularly in the early ' 80s , London was a
shabby and depressed city , and the country 's old industrial regions
were a Full Monty - esque wasteland of closing factories and
unemployment lines .
These days , however , London positively buzzes
with prosperity and with the multilingual chatter of thousands of
young Europeans -- French especially -- who have crossed the Channel in
search of the jobs they can no longer find at home .
How this
turnaround was achieved is a fascinating question ; whether the new
Labour government can sustain it is another .
But I 'm not going to try answering either question , because I've
been thinking about food .
Marcel Proust
I 'm not ( what the hell is a
madeleine , anyway ? ) , but the change in English eating habits is
enough to get even an economist meditating on life , the universe , and
the nature of consumer society .
For someone who remembers the old days , the food is the most
startling thing about modern England .
English food used to be
deservedly famous for its awfulness -- greasy fish and chips ,
gelatinous pork pies , and dishwater coffee .
Now it is not only easy
to do much better , but traditionally terrible English meals have even
become hard to find .
What happened ?
Maybe the first question is how English cooking got to be so bad
in the first place .
A good guess is that the country 's early
industrialization and urbanization was the culprit .
Millions of
people moved rapidly off the land and away from access to traditional
ingredients .
Worse , they did so at a time when the technology of
urban food supply was still primitive : Victorian London already had
well over a million people , but most of its food came in by horse -
drawn barge .
And so ordinary people , and even the middle classes ,
were forced into a cuisine based on canned goods ( mushy peas ! ) ,
preserved meats ( hence those pies ) , and root vegetables that did n't
need refrigeration ( e.g. potatoes , which explain the chips ) .
But why did the food stay so bad after refrigerated railroad cars
and ships , frozen foods ( better than canned , anyway ) , and eventually
air - freight deliveries of fresh fish and vegetables had become
available ?
Now we 're talking about economics -- and about the limits
of conventional economic theory .
For the answer is surely that by
the time it became possible for urban Britons to eat decently , they
no longer knew the difference .
The appreciation of good food is ,
quite literally , an acquired taste -- but because your typical
Englishman , circa , say , 1975 , had never had a really good meal , he
did n't demand one .
And because consumers did n't demand good food ,
they did n't get it .
Even then there were surely some people who
would have liked better , just not enough to provide a critical mass .
And then things changed .
Partly this may have been the result of
immigration .
( Although earlier waves of immigrants simply adapted to
English standards -- I remember visiting one fairly expensive London
Italian restaurant in 1983 that advised diners to call in advance if
they wanted their pasta freshly cooked . )
Growing affluence and the
overseas vacations it made possible may have been more important -- how
can you keep them eating bangers once they 've had foie gras ?
But at
a certain point the process became self - reinforcing : Enough people
knew what good food tasted like that stores and restaurants began
providing it -- and that allowed even more people to acquire civilized
taste buds .
So what does all this have to do with economics ?
Well , the whole
point of a market system is supposed to be that it serves consumers ,
providing us with what we want and thereby maximizing our collective
welfare .
But the history of English food suggests that even on so
basic a matter as eating , a free - market economy can get trapped for
an extended period in a bad equilibrium in which good things are not
demanded because they have never been supplied , and are not supplied
because not enough people demand them .
And conversely , a good equilibrium may unravel .
Suppose a country
with fine food is invaded by purveyors of a cheap cuisine that caters
to cruder tastes .
You may say that people have the right to eat what
they want , but by thinning the market for traditional fare , their
choices may make it harder to find -- and thus harder to learn to
appreciate -- and everyone may end up worse off .
The English are often
amused by the hysteria of their nearest neighbors , who are terrified
by the spread of doughnuts at the expense of croissants .
Great was
the mirth when the horrified French realized that McDonald 's was the
official food of the World Cup .
But France 's concern is not entirely
silly .
( Silly , yes , but not entirely so . )
Compared with ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and the plunging yen ,
such issues are small potatoes .
But they do provide , well , frites

We live in an age of grave economic ignorance , if central - bank policy is an indication of prevailing economic theory .
It is apparent that we 've learned nothing from several millennia of monetary destruction .
The persistent demonstration that capital , not paper , is the basis for prosperity has fallen on deaf ears .
Daily , we face the sad spectacle of government officials , pundits , and even Nobel laureates telling us that printing money is the answer to an economic downturn .
Consider that since the eruption of the financial credit crisis in the second half of 2007 , all major central banks have embraced an irresponsibly loose interest - rate stance .
For instance , the policy rate of the Bank of England ( BOE ) was lowered from 5.75 % in November 2007 to the current level of 1 % .
The sharp decline in the BOE policy interest rate is in line with policies of other central banks .
The US central bank ( the Fed ) has lowered its policy rate ( the federal - funds rate target ) from 5.25 % in August 2007 to around zero at present .
Also , the relatively " conservative " European Central Bank ( ECB ) has been aggressively lowering its policy interest rate .
The rate was lowered from 4.25 % in September last year to the present target of 2 % .
Similarly , the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) has visibly eased its interest rate stance .
The policy rate was reduced from 0.5 % in September 2008 to the current level of 0.1 % .
Given that , so far , already extremely low interest rates have failed to revive economic activity , central bankers are now considering another approach .
Last Wednesday , February 11 , the governor of the Bank of England said that the UK central bank is going to embrace a quantitative easing policy to revive the economy .
The idea here is to flood the economy with money by buying government bonds .
US central - bank policy makers are currently contemplating a simliar idea .
We should n't overlook the fact that , since embracing the aggressive lowering of rates , central banks have been aggressively pushing money into the banking system without succeeding in reviving economic activity .
So why should aggressive money pumping work now ?
The yearly rate of growth of the US central - bank balance sheet ( money pumping ) jumped from 3.9 % in August last year to 152.8 % in December 2008 before falling to 127.5 % in January .
The yearly rate of growth of the balance sheet of the Bank of England jumped from negative 7.2 % in May 2007 to positive 179.4 % by October 2008 before easing to 157.6 % in November last year and 129 % in January .
The growth momentum of the European Central Bank balance sheet has accelerated in January .
Year on year , the rate of growth jumped from 7 % in July 2007 to 45.5 % in December and to 56.5 % in January .
Also , the yearly rate of growth of the BOJ balance sheet follows a visible uptrend .
The rate of growth climbed from negative 0.8 % in August last year to 10.3 % in December before easing to 5.7 % in January .
What permits real economic growth is an improvement in the investment infrastructure of the production process .
What makes the improvement possible is real savings .
It is real savings that fund the enhancement of infrastructure through various tools and machinery , i.e. , capital goods .
With better tools and machinery , a better quality and a greater quantity of goods and services can be produced .
In a free , unhampered market economy the established infrastructure is in accordance with the tendency toward harmony between various activities .
This means that the flow of real savings is sufficient to fund various lines of production without any disruption .
On this Murray Rothbard , paraphrasing Ludwig Lachmann , wrote ,
Capital is an intricate , delicate , interweaving structure of capital goods .
All of the delicate strands of this structure have to fit , and fit precisely , or else malinvestment occurs .
The free market is almost an automatic mechanism for such fitting ; … with its price system and profit - and - loss criteria , [ it ] adjusts the output and variety of the different strands of production , preventing any one from getting long out of alignment .
As a result of the artificial lowering of interest rates and massive money pumping , an additional demand for various goods and services emerges .
This leads to an attempt to expand the infrastructure .
This attempt is bound to fail since the flow of real savings is not large enough to support the expansion of the capital structure .
Consequently , the attempt to expand the infrastructure leads to the diversion of real funding from various activities that make the present flow of real savings possible .
Thus , the flow of real savings comes under pressure and the rate of real economic growth follows suit .
Neither an artificial lowering of interest rates nor monetary pumping by central banks has direct input in the production of capital goods and the production of goods and services that are required to promote and maintain human life and well - being .
The artificial lowering of interest rates and monetary pumping only give rise to various false activities by diverting a portion of the flow of real savings to these activities .
The more false activities that emerge on the back of the artificial lowering of interest rates and monetary pumping , the less real savings will be available for wealth - generating activities .
The fact that economic conditions have continued to deteriorate despite the aggressive lowering of interest rates and massive money pumping by central banks raises the likelihood that the flow of real savings is in trouble .
Note again that monetary pumping and the artificial lowering of interest rates can't replace nonexistent real savings .
Without additional real savings , it is not possible to undertake various new projects without weakening the existent structure of production .
Remember that the interest rate is just an indicator of the state of demand and supply for real savings .
The falsification of this indicator cannot expand the flow of real savings .
Likewise money is just a medium of exchange .
Its function is to permit the exchange of the products of one specialist for the products of another specialist .
More money cannot generate more real savings or real economic growth .
On the contrary , a further planned expansion in monetary pumping by central banks can only weaken the flow of real savings and undermine prospects for a sustained economic revival .
It is no secret that advertising tends to be very sexist especially if the target audience is specifically male , or specifically female .
Frito - Lay has been / is researching how women feel about snacking and guilt in order to create a more effective marketing campaign , packaging that appeals more to women , and new flavors to entice women to eat Frito - Lay snacks .
A recent article in the New York Times by Stephanie Clifford says :
Women are snacking more than men , but are not eating as many Frito - Lay snacks , said Jill Nykoliation , the president of Juniper Park , the advertising agency that handled the Frito - Lay women ’s project .
“ So if it ’s , you ’re snacking two times as much , but you ’re not snacking with us , why , and what can we do for you ? ”
In order to determine why women are n’t snacking with Frito - lay and how to encourage them to snack with Frito - Lay , Nykoliation did research on how women ’s brains compared to men ’s brains , employing “ pop neurology ” and “ neuromarketing ” techniques .
She was especially interested by the guilt factor .
Frito - Lay and Juniper Park asked about 100 women to keep journals about their lives for about two weeks .
According to their logs , the women felt guilty about quite a lot , whether it was snacking , not seeing their children enough , or not spending enough time with their husbands .
Trying to exploit women ’s guilt , huh ?
Why do women “ feel guilty ” about so much ?
Because in this supposed post - feminist world , women are supposed to be perfect and do it all – they have to be thin , in shape , beautiful , always well dressed or made up , perfect moms who can balance work and family time , etc .
In our patriarchal society , we are not good as we are – we always have to be better at something , to improve on something .
All these double standards ( a man in power is admirable but a woman in power is a bitch ) , conflicting messages ( be pure and virginal , but also be sexy and seductive for your man ) , and constant demands on women to achieve perfection in all aspects of their lives can get very overwhelming .
Is n’t it great , capitalizing off women ’s guilt to try to make us spend money on useless crap and then eat it too ?
But I digress … Check out Frito - Lay ’s new ad campaign specifically targeted to women .
The cartoon series features four animated women ( Anna , Cheryl , Maya and Nikki ) who are “ fab funny , fearless females ” as the site puts it .
They talk about men and health : eating healthy and exercising .
The Times calls it “ something of an animated Sex and the City . ”
Here is one of their ( problematic ) advertising images :
The woman on the left points to the Lays bag and says , “ This is the best invention since the push up bra ” and the woman on the right looks down at her breasts and responds , “ I would n’t go that far . ”
I frankly do n’t get it – chips and push up bras ?
Huh ?
A bag of chips better than a push up bra is supposed to make me want to buy and eat those chips ?
What ’s wrong with this “ Only in a Woman ’s World ” campaign ?
1 . The women are all heterosexual : Anna is dating Steve , Cheryl is married to Mike , Maya is married to Simon , and Nikki is single but looking for Mr. Right .
This assumes heterosexuality , thus perpetuating heteronormativity .
2 . The women are so stereotypically feminine : Nikki is the single girl who wants to have a boyfriend ( because women always want or need men ) , Maya owns a fashion boutique ( owning something definitely indicates some degree of power but at the same time it is in a stereotypically feminine sphere : fashion which sort of minimizes her power ) , Cheryl is a full time mom who “ sometimes finds herself wishing the annoyingly perfect Super - Mom next door would have a mental breakdown ” ( classical : pitting women in competition with each other .
Cheryl is jealous of her Super - Mom neighbor and just wants her to crack so that she does n’t feel as threatened ) and Anna is an avid yoga practitioner ( there ’s nothing wrong with yoga – I practice and enjoy it myself , but at the same time it is generally more associated with women than men .
Why could n’t they have made her really into baseball or hockey or something that challenges dominant perceptions of femininity ? )
3 . If you look at the Get your goodies section of the site , there are three different wallpaper backgrounds that you can download that all have to do with women eating and feeling guilty .
In the middle image , a woman is looking in a mirror and sees a big cupcake with pink icing on top and says “ Whoa .
Bad mirror . ”
This is supposed to encourage women to snack on salty foods rather than sweets because apparently research shows that women prefer snacking on sweets rather than salty foods .
It does n’t seem to do that though , at least not for me .
It just further shows how this marketing campaign is trying to exploit and capitalize off female guilt concerning food .
A larger problem underlying the ad campaign is women and food , tying together self esteem , body image , how to be healthy , unhealthy eating practices and behaviors , eating disorders , and how privilege factors into what some women can or ca n’t eat .

Do men objectify women ?
Well some say there may be a tendency , since there ’s a booming business in pornography .
But to answer the how , when and why men objectify women requires some science .
Princeton psychologist Susan Fiske presented findings from a new study this past Sunday , at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Chicago , where she and her colleagues compared , " ... heterosexual men ’s perceptions of scantily clad women , scantily clad men , and fully clothed men and women . "
And what they found is the 21 male subjects had the best memory for photos of sexy bikini - clad women .
No surprise .
Then they had the men look at the photos while their brains were scanned and what she found was that , " ... this memory correlated with activation in part of the brain that is a pre-motor , having intentions to act on something , so it was as if they immediately thought about how they might act on these bodies . "
Fiske explained that the areas , the premotor cortex and posterior middle temporal gyrus , typically light up when one anticipates using tools , like a screwdriver .
" I ’m not saying that they literally think these photographs of women are photographs of tools per se , or photographs of non-humans , but what the brain imaging data allow us to do is to look at it as scientific metaphor .
That is , they are reacting to these photographs as people react to objects . "
Fisk also tested the men for levels of sexism and found a surprising effect those who scored high on this test , " ... the hostile sexists were likely to deactivate the part of the brain that thinks about other people 's intentions .
The lack of activation of this social cognition area is really odd , because it hardly ever happens .
It ’s a very reliable effect , that the medial prefrontal cortex comes online when people think about other people , see pictures of them , imagine other people . "
" Normally when you examine social cognition , people ’s aim is to figure out what the other person is thinking and intending .
And we see in these data really no evidence of that .
So the deactivation of medial prefrontal cortex to these pictures is really kind of shocking . "
To be sure this is a preliminary study , and Fiske intends to follow up with a larger sample , but nonetheless she concludes , " ... these findings are all consistent with the idea that they are responding to these photographs as if they are responding to objects and not to people with independent agency . "
Fiske suggested that if there are sexualized pictures of women in the workplace , there may be a spillover effect , perhaps influencing the way people perceive female colleagues .

A new approach primes antibodies to instantly attack cancers , HIV , and other diseases .
The body ’s immune system is often likened to an army , and vaccines to training exercises that build up defenses against pathogens .
By exposing the immune system to inactive forms of a virus or bacteria , a vaccine trains antibodies to fight off a real pathogen in the event of an invasion .
However , while vaccines prepare antibodies to identify an attacker , they often do n’t give specific instructions on exactly how to bring it down .
Some antibodies may successfully hit a pathogen ’s weak spot , while others may miss the mark entirely .
That ’s part of the reason why it normally takes several weeks or months for some vaccines to build up an effective immune response .
Now researchers at the Scripps Research Institute have developed preprogrammed chemicals that bind to antibodies and tell them how to recognize part of a pathogen , known as its epitope .
In experiments , the team found that such chemicals prompted a therapeutic immune response that inhibited the growth of two types of tumors in mice .
The researchers published their findings in the latest issue of the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science .
“ We used a chemistry - based approach that would n’t induce antibodies that might be wasted , ” says Carlos Barbas , a professor of molecular biology and lead investigator on the paper .
“ [ This approach ] could focus an immune response on functional epitopes of the pathogen , be it cancer or a virus . ”
The group ’s chemical - based vaccine may address a number of problems with some current vaccines , both in the clinic and in the lab .
Today , there are only two FDA - approved , licensed cancer vaccines : one that targets Hepatitis B associated with liver cancer , the other for human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , which leads to cervical cancer .
For both vaccines , patients must go in for multiple immunizations to build up an effective defense over time .
There are no licensed therapeutic vaccines that directly treat existing cancers , and researchers have found it difficult to train antibodies to attack cancer cells , since they arise from the body and are not generally regarded by the immune system as foreign .
In the past few years , however , researchers have identified cell - surface markers unique to cancer cells .
There are molecules called adjuvants that attach to such markers and trick the immune system into recognizing and attacking tumors .
Adjuvants are used in clinics today , but some come with unwanted side effects –for example , soreness , fever , and arthritis .
Scientists are now looking for ways to genetically engineer monoclonal antibodies–antibodies created from a single cell line –to recognize tumor markers and attack cancer .
But these methods are expensive , and Barbas says that a chemical - based approach may provide a cheaper and faster alternative .
Barbas and his team developed a two - stage chemical strategy that first puts the body ’s antibodies on alert , and then gives them instructions on which targets to destroy .
In the first stage , Barbas designed a chemical that , once injected , enables antibodies to form covalent bonds .
Normally , antibodies cannot form such bonds .
The second stage involves injecting a small adapter molecule with two parts : one that bonds covalently with antibodies , and the other that binds with a specific epitope , or cancer marker .
When injected , this adapter molecule links with antibodies and then seeks out and attaches to a target ’s specific epitope .
The method is essentially like handing antibodies a beeper and putting them on standby .
They wait around for a “ call , ” in the form of the adapter molecule , which , once connected , instantly leads them directly to a target ’s weak spot , where the antibody can attack and deactivate the pathogen .
In their experiments , Barbas and his colleagues implanted tumors for colon cancer and melanoma into the flanks of mice and watched the tumors grow over time .
They then injected mice with a chemical that “ primed ” antibodies , before injecting them again with adapter molecules that bind both with antibodies and with integrins –surface proteins found on each type of tumor .
The researchers measured the volume of tumors up to a month after injection , then removed the tumors and weighed them .
They found that those treated with the two - stage vaccine were significantly smaller than those removed from animals that had been injected with just the adapter molecules , or with a commonly used adjuvant vaccine .
“ The molecules we used can also bind human receptors as well , ” says Barbas .
“ This could potentially translate directly into humans . ”
Barbas says that it may be possible to tailor the new vaccine approach to other cancers and diseases .
Researchers would have to first identify specific molecular markers for each disease , and then design adapter molecules that lead antibodies to bind to those markers .
“ The challenges are just coming up with these targeting molecules , ” says Barbas .
“ Certainly , a lot exist in the literature that can be used , but the fascinating ones we want to go after do n’t exist yet .
Recently , there ’s an epitope in flu that was found that ’s highly conserved , and we would like to design a small molecule that binds to that epitope and binds to an antibody .
We ’d also like to do the same thing with HIV . ”
Howard Kaufman , director of the Mount Sinai Melanoma and Sarcoma Program , studies cancer ’s immunosuppressive mechanisms , particularly in melanoma , and is beginning phase I clinical trials to test a melanoma vaccine .
Kaufman says that Barbas ’s vaccine technique represents a new way to treat cancer and other diseases .
“ It ’s appealing as an approach , ” says Kaufman .
“ It ’s a way to get instant immunization as opposed to waiting for kinetics to develop T cell responses . ”
Kaufman also stresses that more work needs to be done to figure out if the technique would work in humans .
“ It ’s not clear if this is towards long - term protection , and it would be interesting to try and challenge mice who have rejected tumors with [ another ] tumor later , to see if they ’re still protected , ” he says .
“ That would be more relevant to the human situation . ”

The town of Vulcan , Alberta , has about 2,000 residents .
They are , of course , Vulcans .
The Vulcan Tourism and Trek Centre has been lobbying for the town to host the premiere of Star Trek XI for a couple of years now .
Paramount said no .
Leonard Nimoy , the only original cast member who will appear in the new film , sided with Vulcan , going so far as to lobby for the town .
The problem is that Vulcan , Alberta has no movie theater !
They have a space - themed water park and a Vulcan starship .
They ’ve even hosted a Star Trek convention , but still no movie theater .
A compromise has been reached between Paramount Pictures , Nimoy , and Vulcan .
The plans now are to have a special advanced screening for 300 Vulcan residents in Calgary , probably on May 6th .
They will be brought in by bus , as the Vulcan starship is currently inoperable .
The Alberta premiere will be on May 8th .
Nimoy calls the compromise “ logical ” .
Idle thoughts about a little brewery in Black River Falls - Find out whats brewing in our kettles and whats on our mind .
Really , it probably only takes one , but just in case that does n't quite do the trick , we here at The Stonecipher Report present you three :
What I love about Alan Keyes is how reasonable and level - headed the guy is .
With logic like this , it is shocking that he only managed to garner 27 % of the vote against Barack Obama in the U.S. Senate race in Illinois in 2004 .
So what if he claimed that Jesus endorsed him and that the right to vote for Senators should be stripped from the American public , he 's just here to keep up the good fight and save us all from the certain destruction of this country that " President " Obama will bring about shortly :
Next up , we have the world 's smartest man , Glenn Beck .
Our insightful viewers may begin to pick up on a pattern here , according to Beck , just like Alan Keyes said , the Obama Administration will lead us to near certain destruction .
Only Keyes never specified how this nation would implode and Beck ( along with some help from a very bright FOX News anchor ) pointed more specifically towards some sort of revolution that the military is preparing for whichmay or may not be sparked by a rancher in Texas named Bubba who shoots a Mexican .
The seriousness of the conversation was underscored by one of the FOX anchors actually crawling under her desk :
Beck followed that brilliant performance up on Friday night with an hour of cable news so awesome that it required a viewer discretion warning .
Wow , you do n't see that every day .
During one segment of the show , Beck actually uttered the phrase " do n't get me wrong , I am against the government . "
Was n't there something Bush slipped into the PATRIOT
Act about people who say things like that ?
Ca n't we lock this guy up and send him to Guantanamo for that little outburst ?
Or did we eventually decide freedom of speech was cool ?
I can't remember .
Anyway , after watching this clip , I have determined that there is a 100 % chance that Glenn Beck is not a Chuck Klosterman fan .
If he was , he would have read this piece and would n't be hyperventilating about the coming great Bubba Revolution .
At the end of this clip , Beck asks " is this crack - pot stuff ? "
Well , you decide :
Finally , for your viewing pleasure , and because I do n't really want to ruin your weekend , our last right - wing whack - job will not be brought to you raw and uncut , and will not feature any direct references to the imminent end of American History .
Instead , several solid doses of sanity will be sprinkled in by Keith Olbermann and The Nation 's Chris Hayes .
In case you do n't remember Congresswoman Michele Bachmann , she famously went on Hardball with Chris Matthews and called for a major media investigation into the potential anti-American views of all members of Congress , including Barack Obama - and a call for the revival of McCarthyism is n't the only insane thing she 's suggestedduring her brief Congressional career .
In fact , to paraphrase the late Hunter S. Thompson , Bachmann just keeps cranking out the jams - and this past week she offered us another gem :
So , sorry if I ruined what was otherwise a nice , relaxing weekend for you by getting your blood pressure up on this Monday morning , but hate Mondays are supposed to suck , right ?
Well , I Hope Alan Keyes , Glenn Beck , Michele Bachmann and could all help make yours more miserable .
As I write the book Modern Perl , I keep looking for organizational principles and guidelines to govern what to discuss , what to leave out , and the metaphors and explanations I give .
( I 'm getting close to the point where I can post draft chapters for comments ; if you 're interested in reading and giving feedback , please contact me privately . )
The most important question I 've asked so far is " What 's the minimal amount of Perl knowledge necessary to prepare someone to write and understand Modern Perl effectively ? "
I 've decided there are three facets .
How to identify individual chunks of information in a single Perl statement .
This is effectively the same type of behavior as diagramming sentences in a written language .
You may not know exactly what $ $ means in the statement $ pids - >{$ $}-- , but you should be able to recognize that $ pids refers to a scalar variable , that ->{...} performs a hash dereference of a single key , that -- is the postfix decrement operator , and that $ $ is a scalar variable .
means in the statement , but you should be able to recognize that refers to a scalar variable , that performs a hash dereference of a single key , that is the postfix decrement operator , and that is a scalar variable .
How to refer to the appropriate places of the Perl documentation to understand individual chunks .
This is the Perl equivalent of using a dictionary to look up words you do n't understand .
You may know that squamous is an adjective when H.P. Lovecraft uses it , but to understand the sentence fully , you need to look in the dictionary .
While some people claim that you have to understand all of Perl to read anyone else 's code , I disagree .
You have to be able to look up the parts you do n't know .
How to recognize and use common Perl idioms .
The while / readline / chomp loop is one such idiom .
So is the Schwartzian transform .
So is the use of hashes for identifying set membership .
( This suggests the existence of a perlidioms document . )
While creating the outline for and writing the book , I 've realized that I have to leave out more information than I can include .
( This is most apparent when discussing regular expressions . )
If , however , I can teach people these three facets , I believe I can prepare them to write and maintain Perl well .
The kidney is removed in a bag US surgeons say they have successfully removed a healthy donor kidney through a small incision in the back of the donor 's vagina .
Removing the kidney through " a natural orifice " speeds up recovery and gives a better cosmetic result - avoiding a six inch abdominal scar - they say .
The Johns Hopkins team say the 48 - year - old woman who donated the organ to her niece on 29 January is " doing well " .
Surgeons have also removed gallbladders and appendixes through the mouth .
Diseased gallbladders , kidneys and appendixes have been removed through the vagina before .
But this is believed to be the first time that doctors have managed to harvest a healthy donor kidney for transplantation in this way .
Removing the kidney through a natural opening should hasten the patient 's recovery and provide a better cosmetic result
Team leader Dr Robert Montgomery Dr Robert Montgomery , chief of the transplant division at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Maryland , who led the team that performed the operation , said : " Surgeons have been troubled by the need to make a relatively large incision in the patient 's abdomen after completing the nephrectomy to extract the donor kidney .
" That incision is thought to significantly add to the patient 's pain , hospitalisation and convalescence .
Removing the kidney through a natural opening should hasten the patient 's recovery and provide a better cosmetic result . "
Cosmetically attractive
The operation left three pea-size scars on the Lexington Park woman 's abdomen , one hidden in her navel , from where the wand - like camera and operating tools were inserted through small incisions .
Once the kidney was cut from its attachments to the abdominal wall and its arteries and veins were stapled shut , the surgeons placed the kidney in a plastic bag inserted through an incision in the vaginal wall and pulled it out through the vaginal opening with a string attached to the bag .
Dr Montgomery said the surgery took about three and a half hours , roughly the same as a traditional keyhole or laparoscopic procedure .
With keyhole surgery , an incision is typically made below the bikini line to remove the kidney .
The surgeons hope the new procedure will lead more women to become donors .
Anecdotal reports suggest living donor transplant numbers went up after keyhole procedures became available .
Dr Anthony Kalloo , the director of the Division of Gastroenterology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , who pioneered the procedure , said : " Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery is the final frontier to explore in making surgery scar- less , less painful and for obese patients , much safer . "
In the UK , living donor kidney transplants are increasing - from 589 in 2005 - 2006 to 829 in 2007 - 2008 - and now represent more than one in three of all kidney transplants .
But the number of people on waiting lists for a transplant is also increasing - nearly 7,000 people were on the list last year and more than half of these will still be waiting for a donor , according to UK Transplant .
A spokesman for UK Transplant said : " Any development that is likely to boost donor numbers would be positive for people on waiting lists .
" Although 90 % of people in the UK say that they are in favour of organ donation in principle , only 26 % of the population have actually registered on the NHS Organ Donor Register .
We need more people to join the register . "
David Mayer , consultant transplant surgeon at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham , said : " This is quite interesting in terms of having scar - less surgery and because one of the obvious problems after surgery is pain .
" There might be some discomfort but nothing like having a wound the size of a kidney on the surface of the body which might cause pain for several weeks . "

Report : Slain US Nazi hated Obama , had parts for ' dirty bomb ' Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday March 9 , 2009
Print This Email This Claim : Depleted uranium purchased over the Internet from an American company
Trust fund millionaire James G. Cummings , an American Nazi sympathizer from Maine who was slain by his wife Amber in December , allegedly had the radioactive components necessary to construct a " dirty bomb , " a newly released threat analysis report states .
The man , allegedly furious over the election of President Obama , purchased depleted uranium over the Internet from an American company .
" According to an FBI field intelligence report from the Washington Regional Threat and Analysis Center posted online by WikiLeaks , an organization that posts leaked documents , an investigation into the case revealed that radioactive materials were removed from Cummings  home after his shooting death on Dec. 9 , " reported the Bangor Daily News .
" Amber ( Cummings ) indicated James was very upset with Barack Obama being elected President , " reported the Washington Regional Threat and Analysis Center ( PDF link ) .
" She indicated James had been in contact with ' white supremacist group (s ) . '
Amber also indicated James mixed chemicals in the kitchen sink at their residence and had mentioned ' dirty bombs . ' "
" Also found was literature on how to build ' dirty bombs ' and information about cesium - 137 , strontium - 90 and cobalt - 60 , radioactive materials , " said the Bangor Daily .
" The FBI report also stated there was evidence linking James Cummings to white supremacist groups .
This would seem to confirm observations by local tradesmen who worked at the Cummings home that he was an ardent admirer of Adolf Hitler and had a collection of Nazi memorabilia around the house , including a prominently displayed flag with swastika .
Cummings claimed to have pieces of Hitlers personal silverware and place settings , painter Mike Robbins said a few days after the shooting . "
After Amber Cummings admitted to the murder and entered an insanity plea , Belfast , Maine police felt it necessary to bring the FBI on the scene .
Bangor Daily reporter Eric Russell followed up in a filmed interview with Belfast Police Chief Jeffrey Trafton :
The paper also reported that Cummings had a long history of violence .
Public safety officials were quick to claim there was no threat .
The story of the first attempt at constructing a " dirty bomb " in the United States was not carried by any mainstream press outside of Maine .
" Conservatives apparently did n't want to draw attention to a radioactive , wealthy version of Timothy McVeigh coming from their own sphere , although nearly every day during Bush 's reign saw " dirty bombs " hyped as the ultimate threat , " summarized Wikileaks .
" The left did n't want to repeat another ' dirty bomb ' story , the likes of which Republicans had used to drive hundreds of billions of dollars into Republican dominated military and security contractors . "
In the report , an unnamed source noted , " state authorities detected radiation emissions in four small jars in the residence labeled ' uranium metal ' , as well as one jar labeled ' thorium . '
The four jars of uranium carried the label of an identified US company . "
" Further preliminary analysis on 30 December 2008 indicated an unlabeled jar to be a second jar of thorium .
Each bottle of uranium contained depleted uranium 238 .
Analysis also indicated the two jars of thorium held thorium 232 . "
" An Internet search of the James B. Cummings Trust indicated that it has an annual income of $ 10 million , " noted a report republished by Wikileaks .

Israel 's doctrine was ' go crazy ' in the name of deterrence - but rockets still come
By Paul Wood
Middle East correspondent
" Did we even fight a war in Gaza ? " asked one Israeli newspaper editorial .
This was a reference to the fact that rockets are still falling on Israeli soil two months after the Gaza offensive .
At the time , Israeli officials said the aim of Operation Cast Lead was to restore the principle of deterrence in southern Israel .
As it is understood in this part of the world , that means bludgeoning your enemies into submission , causing enough pain that they will hesitate to come back for more .
Israel now had a new military doctrine : " go nuts " once and your enemies will fear to strike again .
The next government will be led by Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud .
He believes that the threat from Gaza is far less than that from a nuclear armed Iran
Israeli voices : Still under fire Hamas threatens rocket militants
As Israeli commentator Ofer Shelah put it : " In the face of enemies who have opted for a strategy of attrition and attacking from a distance , Israel will present itself as a ' crazy country ' , the kind that will respond ( albeit after a great deal of time ) in a massive and unfettered assault , with no proportion to the amount of casualties it has endured . "
Certainly , there was massive bombing of Gaza ; some 1,300 Palestinians lives were lost , many civilians .
From Israel 's point of view , did it work ?
The answer must be , only partially .
Hanukah ' miracle '
There is a lot less rocket fire on Israeli towns like Sderot and Ashkolon now than there was late last year .
As that antiseptic military phrase has it , the capabilities of Palestinian armed groups were " degraded " .
So when the Israeli F - 16s flew overhead on their way back from the first wave of bombings in Gaza , on 27 December , residents of Sderot cheered and honked their car horns .
" This is a Hanukah miracle , " one told a passing TV crew .
Israel has not found that the ' rules of the game ' have changed ( Israelis will not have missed the significance of calling the operation " Cast Lead " .
A popular children 's song during the Jewish holiday of Hanukah is about playing with a spinning top made of cast lead .
Palestinians will no doubt find the choice of words rather ghoulish . )
But the " Hanukah miracle " did not last .
It is , again , an unusual day when Israelis in the southern towns do not have to run for the bomb shelters at least once .
Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot said that Operation Cast Lead had failed miserably in its aim of " creating new rules of the game in the south " .
" The arms smuggling was renewed and the rocket fire has continued , " said an editorial .
" The residents of Gaza are now perceived by the world as victims of Israeli vindictiveness . "
The paper concluded : " In brief , we 're screwed . "
So will Israel go back into Gaza ?
Probably not .
Despite the editorial in Yediot , most newspaper coverage and most political discourse is dominated by the economic crisis sweeping Israel , as it is the rest of the world .
Things have moved on .
Although the residents of the south wo n't like it , the rest of the country probably thinks it can live with the handful of rockets or mortars now being fired .
After all , Israeli intelligence estimates the Palestinian militants were capable of firing up to 300 rockets a day before the Gaza offensive took place .
A new scenario
For the time being , there are assassinations , or targeted killings as the Israelis call them , and air strikes on the tunnels used to smuggle weapons in from Egypt .
But there seems to be no appetite in Israel to step up this activity into another offensive .
The next government will be led by Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud .
He believes that the threat from Gaza is far less than that from a nuclear armed Iran .
Any Israeli military strike against Iran is still far from certain .
But the chances will be greater with Mr Netanyahu as prime minister .
That is especially true after the head of military intelligence , General Amos Yadlin , said this week that Iran could now make a nuclear device if it chose , having amassed enough uranium and perfected the technology .
( Iran denies this . )
If the leaks to the Israeli media are any guide , the country 's military planners are now busying for scenarios for attacking Iran - not Gaza .

The administration also paid close attention to the political climate .
With the private sector increasingly wary of Congressional intervention in the business of those who participate in government bailout programs , Mr. Obama substantially dialed back the near endorsement he had given late last week to the House vote for a confiscatory 90 percent tax on bonuses like those A.I.G. doled out .
“ As a general proposition , you do n’t want to be passing laws that are just targeting a handful of individuals , ” he said in an interview on Sunday night on CBS ’s “ 60 Minutes , ” in what administration officials said was a signal to investors that he understood their concerns about doing business with the government .
The Treasury Department also increased the amount of equity the government would provide for the public - private financing package , to as much as $ 100 billion , up from some earlier estimates of as low as $ 50 billion .
“ The private sector stepped up on the day of the announcement saying they wanted to participate , which provided a Good Housekeeping seal , ” Mr. Emanuel said .
“ And the second thing was that the presentation was organized in a way that the expectations of the program were met by the actual program . ”
For both , he gave credit to Mr. Geithner and his still - small Treasury team .
There was even good news by Monday evening on the matter of Treasury ’s much criticized understaffing .
The White House announced the nominations of two Clinton administration veterans to top posts : Neal S. Wolin to be Mr. Geithner ’s deputy Treasury secretary , and Lael Brainard to be under secretary for international affairs .
Yet even as Mr. Geithner tries to focus further on the financial rescue plan , the A.I.G. controversy will dog him for a second week .
On Tuesday he will be on Capitol Hill to answer questions from the House Financial Services Committee about his handling of the A.I.G. bailout and bonuses .
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke of the Federal Reserve and William C. Dudley , Mr. Geithner ’s successor as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , also will testify .
Both have shared jurisdiction over A.I.G. with Treasury since last September , when the government bailed out the global insurance giant to prevent it from collapsing and taking down the major financial institutions that were among its customers .

Bipedal reptiles like Hesperonychus eventually gave rise to birds
The smallest meat - eating dinosaur yet to be found in North America has been identified from six tiny pelvic bones .
Hesperonychus was the size of a small chicken , and used its rows of serrated teeth to feed on insects , experts say .
The bird - like creature is closely related to Microraptor - a tiny feathered dinosaur discovered in China .
The specimen helps to confirm that reptiles , and not mammals , filled the role of small predators during the age of the dinosaurs .
The fossil skeleton , which lay misidentified for 25 years as a lizard , belongs to a group of dinosaurs called the theropods - bipedal reptiles that eventually gave rise to birds .
" Despite the discovery of exquisitely preserved skeletons of small bird - like dinosaurs in Asia , they are exceedingly rare in North America , " explained Dr Philip Currie , a palaeontologist from the University of Alberta and co-author on the paper .
Dr Currie had been pondering why so few small fossils have been unearthed in Alberta , Canada - one of the world 's richest sites for large - dinosaur bones .
He suspected that small dinosaurs did not preserve well in the region of the prevalence of larger predators in the area .
" There were many large dinosaurs running around eating them , and small bones are easily washed away by rivers [ common in this region during the Cretaceous period ] " , Dr Currie said .
The new find casts more doubt on whether mammals would have acted as small predators in Cretaceous - era North America .
The fossilised pelvis came from an animal that weighed no more than 1.9kg ( 4.2lb ) and appears distinctively reptilian .
" This tells us that [ as in Asia ] , North American dinosaurs likely out - competed mammals for both large and small predator niches , " Dr Currie told BBC News .
' Tree - hugging raptor '
The authors also suggest this discovery helps to resolve debate over whether flight originated from animals that ran on the ground , flapping their arms , or whether it started with tree - climbing animals gliding downwards .
Based on the size of the hips , and because one of the hip bones was bent - the pubis , a small bone that sits between the legs - " we know this dinosaur was a tree - climber " , Dr Currie explained .
" It likely used the long feathers on its limbs to glide or parachute from tree to tree . "
The specimen , Hesperonychus elizabethae - named after its collector Dr Elizabeth Nicholls - was reclassified by palaeontolgist Dr Nicholas Longrich , a co-author of the paper , from the University of Calgary .
The findings were reported in a recent article in the journal Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences .

Insiders
Rajendrasinh Makwana was a UNIX contractor for Fannie Mae . On October 24 , he was fired .
Before he left , he slipped a logic bomb into the organization ’s network .
The bomb would have “ detonated ” on January 31 .
It was programmed to disable access to the server on which it was running , block any network monitoring software , systematically and irretrievably erase everything — and then replicate itself on all 4,000 Fannie Mae servers .
Court papers claim the damage would have been in the millions of dollars , a number that seems low .
Fannie
Mae would have been shut down for at least a week .
Luckily — and it does seem it was pure luck — another programmer discovered the script a week later , and disabled it .
Insiders are a perennial problem .
They have access , and they ’re known by the system .
They know how the system and its security works , and its weak points .
They have opportunity .
Bank heists , casino thefts , large - scale corporate fraud , train robberies : many of the most impressive criminal attacks involve insiders .
And , like Makwana ’s attempt at revenge , these insiders can have pretty intense motives — motives that can only intensify as the economy continues to suffer and layoffs increase .
Insiders are especially pernicious attackers because they ’re trusted .
They have access because they ’re supposed to have access .
They have opportunity , and an understanding of the system , because they use it — or they designed , built , or installed it .
They ’re already inside the security system , making them much harder to defend against .
It ’s not possible to design a system without trusted people .
They ’re everywhere .
In offices , employees are trusted people given access to facilities and resources , and allowed to act — sometimes broadly , sometimes narrowly — in the company ’s name .
In stores , employees are allowed access to the back room and the cash register ; and customers are trusted to walk into the store and touch the merchandise .
IRS employees are trusted with personal tax information ; hospital employees are trusted with personal health information .
Banks , airports , and prisons could n’t operate without trusted people .
Replacing trusted people with computers does n’t make the problem go away ; it just moves it around and makes it even more complex .
The computer , software , and network designers , implementers , coders , installers , maintainers , etc. are all trusted people .
See any analysis of the security of electronic voting machines , or some of the frauds perpetrated against computerized gambling machines , for some graphic examples of the risks inherent in replacing people with computers .
Of course , this problem is much , much older than computers .
And the solutions have n’t changed much throughout history , either .
There are five basic techniques to deal with trusted people :
1. Limit the number of trusted people .
This one is obvious .
The fewer people who have root access to the computer system , know the combination to the safe , or have the authority to sign checks , the more secure the system is .
2. Ensure that trusted people are also trustworthy .
This is the idea behind background checks , lie detector tests , personality profiling , prohibiting convicted felons from getting certain jobs , limiting other jobs to citizens , the TSA ’s no -fly list , and so on , as well as behind bonding employees , which means there are deep pockets standing behind them if they turn out not to be trustworthy .
3 . Limit the amount of trust each person has .
This is compartmentalization ; the idea here is to limit the amount of damage a person can do if he ends up not being trustworthy .
This is the concept behind giving people keys that only unlock their office or passwords that only unlock their account , as well as “ need to know ” and other levels of security clearance .
4 . Give people overlapping spheres of trust .
This is what security professionals call defense in depth .
It ’s why it takes two people with two separate keys to launch nuclear missiles , and two signatures on corporate checks over a certain value .
It ’s the idea behind bank tellers requiring management overrides for high - value transactions , double - entry bookkeeping , and all those guards and cameras at casinos .
It ’s why , when you go to a movie theater , one person sells you a ticket and another person standing a few yards away tears it in half :
It makes it much harder for one employee to defraud the system .
It ’s why key bank employees need to take their two - week vacations all at once — so their replacements have a chance to uncover any fraud .
5 . Detect breaches of trust after the fact and prosecute the guilty .
In the end , the four previous techniques can only do so well .
Trusted people can subvert a system .
Most of the time , we discover the security breach after the fact and then punish the perpetrator through the legal system : publicly , so as to provide a deterrence effect and increase the overall level of security in society .
This is why audit is so vital .
These security techniques do n’t only protect against fraud or sabotage ; they protect against the more common problem : mistakes .
Trusted people are n’t perfect ; they can inadvertently cause damage .
They can make a mistake , or they can be tricked into making a mistake through social engineering .
Good security systems use multiple measures , all working together .
Fannie
Mae certainly limits the number of people who have the ability to slip malicious scripts into their computer systems , and certainly limits the access that most of these people have .
It probably has a hiring process that makes it less likely that malicious people come to work at Fannie Mae .
It obviously does n’t have an audit process by which a change one person makes on the servers is checked by someone else ; I ’m sure that would be prohibitively expensive .
Certainly the company ’s IT department should have terminated Makwana ’s network access as soon as he was fired , and not at the end of the day .
In the end , systems will always have trusted people who can subvert them .
It ’s important to keep in mind that incidents like this do n’t happen very often ; that most people are honest and honorable .
Security is very much designed to protect against the dishonest minority .
And often little things — like disabling access immediately upon termination — can go a long way .

If you ’ve got sex on the brain but your body ’s feeling unsexy , put away the blue pill !
You do n’t need Viagra , you need food .
( Just not potato chips . )
Sexual health and energy is synonymous with a healthy , energized you .
An active lifestyle , balanced diet and self - confidence are the best ways to get the sexual charge you need – but that does n’t mean there are n’t a few foods out there that can give you that extra…boost you ’re looking for .
Maca
This Andean root is the first food that comes to mind when I think of sexual health and stamina .
Just me ?
It ’s been commonly used in Peru since the times of the Inca to increase strength , energy and libido – and modern studies seem to confirm it .
Modern foodies consider it a superfood , and with good reason .
Maca is excellent for balancing hormones and makes a tasty addition to deserts and smoothies .
Cacao
Always a woman ’s favorite .
Real dark chocolate ( we ’re not talking See ’s Candies here ! ) with a high cacao content contains natural stimulants and wellbeing chemicals ( giving a boost to neurotransmitters associated with euphoria during sex ) , plus plenty of magnesium which is good for the heart and women ’s libido .
A healthy heart means better circulation , and that means better sex drive .
Melt it , pour it , lick it …
Chiles
You ca n’t travel in Latin American without hearing a hot and spicy joke about the size of a man ’s chile .
And if you ’re a fan of picante foods , you know how they can make you a bit sweaty and excitable ( mimicking the state of sexual arousal ) .
Blame it on the capsaicin , the substance in hot peppers which releases endorphins , stimulates nerve endings and increases heart rate .
Cardamom
This deliciously exotic little spice has a reputation in its home country of India for being an aphrodisiac .
I just think it ’s got a wonderful , sensual taste .
But there may be some science behind it too : cardamom is high in cineole , which stimulates the nervous system .
Ginger
The spicy taste of hot , fresh ginger tea will heat your body up , make your heart race and increase the heat .
What more do you need to get it going ?
Pumpkin Seeds
High in zinc , which is needed for testosterone production , pumpkin seeds are essential for the libido in both men and women .
Toast some up , pop in a movie , oh , forget the movie …
Oysters
Cold , slimy : I always wondered why oysters have such a reputation as an aphrodisiac food .
Some say it ’s the shape , but I say it ’s the zinc , baby .
Hemp
Whether you prefer the seed , the milk , or the oil , hemp is high in the Essential Fatty Acids needed to help balance hormones for a better libido .
Whip up a hemp milk latte and cozy up to your sweetie for some kisses to get things going .
Almonds
Best when eaten raw , almonds are high in libido - boosting vitamin E . A very sensible sex - boosting insurance policy .
Eat daily .
Garlic
This one surprised me , because we all know how unattractive it is to be around someone who reeks of garlic .
But take note , allicin improves blood flow to the sexual organs , so just make sure you and your partner have garlic in your meal together and you wo n’t mind the way the other smells .
You have to admit , for garlic , that ’s a sexy picture .
Bananas
This suggestively shaped fruit regulates blood pressure , and you ’d do well to eat one a day , because there ’s nothing quite like excessively high blood pressure ( also known as hypertension ) to cause erectile dysfunction .
Pomegranate Juice
A very sensual juice and luscious juice ( surely Nigella Lawson would approve ) , many think that pomegranate ’s high antioxidant content keeps free radicals from interfering with circulation .
Which would have a positive effect on erectile dysfunction .
Goji Berries
These superfood berries are considered a potent sexual tonic in Asia .
They improve mood and well being and increase testosterone production .
They ’re tart , complex and intriguing – fittingly .
Celery
Granted , celery is not the sexiest food , but it does contains andresterone , which is the hormone that gives men a subtle smell that drives women wild .
I ’m talking that t- shirt smell , ladies .
( Men : we like this . )
Ginseng
This high energy root normalizes hormones levels in both men and women and it ’s been used for centuries by the Chinese to increase stamina and desire .
Ginkgo Biloba
Sort of a wonder herb touted for many purposes , ginkgo can be used to increase sexual energy and regulate blood circulation .
Guava
High in vitamin C , guava is great for the antioxidants .
Kiwi and berries are high in vitamin C too , which keeps the sexual glands running smoothly .
There ’s nothing like sharing a cool fruit salad on a hot summer ’s day ” ¦
Wild Salmon
Another great source of Essential Fatty Acids .
Try it cold with creme fraiche , crackers , wine and a little hand - feeding .
Avocado
Such an amazing food anyway , avocados are high in EFA ’s and B - vitamins for hormone balance , and folic acid which is good for the heart and gives you energy .
Leafy Greens
Eat your salads , ladies , dark leafy greens help your liver metabolize estrogen , and create a good balance of this hormone essential for healthy female sexuality .
Sure , they do n’t look sexy , but they ’ll make you feel amazing .
Of course , there ’s no one food that ’s going to magically improve your sex life .
The key is to avoid cigarettes and excessive alcohol and maintain a state of general health and wellbeing .
You ca n’t expect to sit on your tuckus all day snacking on potato chips and be an excellent lover !

Even if by some miracle the nations of the world could bring carbon dioxide levels back to those of the pre-industrial era , it would still take 1,000 years or longer for the climate changes already triggered to be reversed , scientists said Monday .
The gas already here and the heat that has been absorbed by the ocean will exert their effects for centuries , according to an analysis published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Over the long haul , the warming will melt the polar icecaps more than had previously been estimated , raising ocean levels substantially , the report said .
And changes in rainfall patterns will bring droughts to the American Southwest , southern Europe , northern Africa and western Australia comparable to those that caused the 1930s Dust Bowl in the U.S .

“ People have imagined that if we stopped emitting carbon dioxide , the climate would go back to normal in 100 years , 200 years , ” lead author Susan Solomon , a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , said in a telephone news conference .
“ That ’s not true . ”
The changes will persist until at least the year 3000 , said Solomon , who conducted the study with colleagues in Switzerland and France .
Scientists familiar with the report said it emphasized the need for immediate action to control emissions .
“ As a climate scientist , this was my intuition , ” said geoscientist Jonathan T. Overpeck of the University of Arizona .
“ But they have done a really good job of working through the details and . . . make a case that the situation is more dire than we thought if we do n’t act quickly and aggressively to curb carbon dioxide emissions . ”

Kevin Trenberth , head of climate analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colo. , said the persistence of climate change caused by global warming was “ poorly appreciated by policymakers and the general public , and it is real . ”
“ The policy relevance is clear :
We need to act sooner , even if there is some doubt about exactly what will happen , because by the time the public and policymakers really realize the changes are here , it is far too late to do anything about it , ” Trenberth said .
The report came as President Obama ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to consider allowing states the right to enact auto emission standards stricter than federal rules .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton also is expected to appoint a new envoy for climate change to bolster the administration ’s credentials in environmental policy .

The slowness with which ocean water circulates is central to the new findings .
Carbon dioxide is primarily removed from the atmosphere through absorption into seawater , an incredibly slow process because of the time it takes for surface water saturated with the gas to be replaced by deeper water that can further absorb carbon dioxide .
That gas accounts for about half of the global warming caused by greenhouse gases , but the other gases are removed from the atmosphere more quickly .
Thus , the long - term influence of carbon dioxide will have the greatest effect on climate change , the report said .
Moreover , heat absorbed by the ocean is released slowly , and will continue to contribute to global warming even if the concentration of greenhouse gases should decline , the authors said .
Solomon said in a statement that absorption of carbon dioxide and release of heat -- one acting to cool the Earth and the other to warm it -- would “ work against each other to keep temperatures almost constant for more than 1,000 years . ”

Geoscientist Jorge L. Sarmiento of Princeton University said , “ This is really a wake - up call about the seriousness of this issue . ”
The study looked particularly at ocean levels and rainfall .
The team found that by thermal expansion of ocean water alone , sea levels will rise from 1.3 to 3.2 feet if carbon dioxide climbs from the current level of 385 parts per million to 600 parts per million , and twice that if it peaks at 1,000 parts per million .
Melting of the icecaps could increase sea levels even more , inundating low - lying islands and continental shorelines , but the effects are too uncertain to quantify , Solomon said .
Reductions in rainfall would also last centuries , the report said , decreasing drinking water supplies , increasing fire frequency and devastating dry - season farming of wheat and maize .

TeleGeography says that cross - border telephone traffic grew 14 percent in 2007 and is estimated to have grown 12 percent in 2008 , to 384 billion minutes .
Falling prices and rising popularity have flattened the revenues ( see graph below the fold ) .
The big bump in minutes ( and the flattening of revenues ) has come courtesy of Skype , the company owned by San Jose , Calif . - based eBay ( s EBAY ) .
[ digg=http://digg.com/tech_news/Skype_Now_the_Largest_Long_distance_Phone]
Skype ’s cross - border traffic grew approximately 41 percent in 2008 , to 33 billion minutes — equivalent to 8 percent of combined international telephone +
Skype traffic .
Skype uses wholesale carriers such as iBasis and Level 3 ( s LVLT ) for handling its network traffic .
Five years after its launch , Skype is now the largest provider of cross - border voice communications in the world , Telegeography says .
Or as my friend Andy Abramson would say :
The world ’s biggest minute stealer .
Knoji reviews products and up - and - coming brands we think you 'll love .
In certain cases , we may receive a commission from brands mentioned in our guides .
Learn more .
The short answer is , no .
We do n't use only 10 % of our brains .
We use virtually all of our brain .
Mind you , science 's understanding ofÂ exactly how we use any single part of the brain is just starting to come together .
What we do know is all sections of our brain get used .
A story to illustrate my point : Â Back in my college days , I took a class on Biopsycholgy .
The professor started the class with the sentence " This class will teach you what part of your brain is the best to have damaged . "
The class then spent extensive time teaching us about all the horrible things resulting from damage in nearly any part of the brain .
As it turns out , it all does useful stuff .
The science of exactly what happens where and how is n't complete yet , but we 're at the point where it 's safe to say :
We use all of our brain , just not at the same time .
Does this answer the question ?
If it is specific to the roughly 3 pound mass of grey stuff in your head , yes .
If it is asked asking about the mind instead of the brain , I 'll have to answer it a bit more .
The problem with putting numbers on well anything in the mind is a problem psychology has been trying to solve for over a hundred years ( less if you cut out the time when behaviorists decided just to ignore anything they could n't measure ) .
Â
As a side note , the lack of being able to do this consistently is why some people believe psychology is a pseudoscience .
But I digress .
To properly answer the question of do we use 10 % of the mind 's potential , we need several pieces of information .
The first is a definition of what the mind is .
The second is what the mind 's potential is .
The third is how can we objectively calculate this .
There are probably more bits which would allow us to answer this question further and with better accuracy , but these are the basics .
Any cursory look through either scientific , philosophical , religious , or mystical definitions of the mind would tell you none of these groups agree with themselves let alone eachother .
We still are n't sure what the mind is in any exact sense .
What is definitely a harder question is exactly what the mind 's potential is .
While we 've collectively ruled out some things like being able to move cars with our minds , we 've also had to incorporate a much larger definition of what the mind is capable of when properly trained .
Yoga masters are capable of an array of things most people would find " impossible . "
Â Meditation can do astonishing things with blood pressure and other bodily functions .
Biofeedback can accomplish similar feats only 50 years ago would have been considered impossible .
What is the mind 's potential ?
We do n't know .
It is tempting to say " infinite " and over time ( especially evolutionary time ) this is probably true .
The question of what is any one mind 's potential ...
We 've got an array of things trying to assign numbers or scores to that ranging from personality and intelligence tests to skills and job compatability tests .
Yet , even the best of these tests only measures specifically defined parameteres , not full potential .
Even worse , our most standard test for something as basic as intelligence ( IQ ) keeps having to be renormed every decade to keep being accurate ( Norming is the process a psychological test goes through to make sure it provides an accurate range in the group of people who are to use it ) .
And even if we had a definition of what mind was and knew just how good it could get , we 'd still need to develop an accurate way of measuring it so we could find out if we used 10 % of it or not .
The details of exactly how hard it would be to create such a test are their own branch of psycholgy called psychometrics and volumes have been written on the subject .
One other possibility the questioner might have had is :
If we develop our minds , do we get superpowers ?
As per usual , the answer to this question depends on what one means by " superpowers . "
Will we be able to move faster than a speeding locomotive , leap tall buildings in a single bound , and bend powerful rivers with our hands ?
Probably not .
Could we heal faster , maintain a higher level of heath , and do normal body processes more efficiently ?
Yes .
Of course , under this definition , any person in good physical shape has " superpowers " compared to someone whose muscles have atrophied from say being in space too long .
So , in the final analysis , we use more than 10 % of our brains .
Â
We probably use much , much less than 10 % of our minds but would n't know either way .
And we probably are n't going to start flying around any time soon .
Gays and Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Agencies ( GLIFAA ) recently hand - delivered a letter to Hillary ’s office asking that she address discrimination in terms of how the State Department handles the partners of gay and lesbian employees .
This is their letter , and they make an excellent point ( the Washington Post also picked up the story today ) :
The Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton , Secretary of State
U.S. Department of State
2201 C Street NW
Washington , DC 20520
Madam Secretary :
We congratulate you on your Senate confirmation , and we look forward to working with you in promoting America ’s interests and strengthening our national security in this rapidly changing world .
Whether assigned stateside or overseas , Civil Service or Foreign Service , active or retired , we are all proud to be serving our nation .
We , the undersigned and representing the diversity of the foreign affairs agencies , would like to bring to your attention a matter that concerns us all .
All of us are troubled that our families are not all treated equally and with the same respect .
We are concerned that access to the federal health care insurance program is denied to same - sex partners of employees serving in Third World countries with substandard medical care .
We question the logic of leaving same - sex partners to fend for themselves during an emergency evacuation of a high danger post .
We are embarrassed when the Department will reimburse a variety of moving expenses , including the cost of transporting a pet , when an employee is assigned overseas , but will not do the same for a same - sex partner .
We are saddened that individual and community safety are put at risk because full language instruction is not available to same - sex partners .
We are uncomfortable that same - sex partners receive less compensation and fewer benefits for performing exactly the same job inside the mission as an opposite - sex spouse , that is , when same - sex partners are given a chance to work .
An order from your office designating same - sex partners as Eligible Family Members ( EFMs ) could remedy many of the inequalities that these families face .
Other remedies will require coordination between the Executive and Legislative branches .
Madam Secretary , we believe that no colleague of ours is a second - class colleague , and no colleague ’s family is a second - class family .
Given your commitment to protecting the safety and promoting the welfare of all Foreign Service families , we ask for your full consideration of our concerns and we hope that a dialogue aimed at ending this unequal treatment can be started .

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee warned supporters Tuesday that the $ 828 billion stimulus package is “ anti-religious . ”
Huckabee : Stimulus is ' anti-religious '
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee warned supporters Tuesday that the $ 828 billion stimulus package is “ anti-religious . ”
In an e-mail that was also posted on his blog ahead of the Senate ’s passage , Huckabee wrote : “ The dust is settling on the ‘ bipartisan ’ stimulus bill and one thing is clear :
It is anti-religious . ”

The former Republican presidential candidate pointed to a provision in both the House and Senate versions banning higher education funds in the bill from being used on a “ school or department of divinity . ”
“ You would think the ACLU drafted this bill , ” Huckabee said .
“ For all of the talk about bipartisanship , this Congress is blatantly liberal . ”
“ Emily ’s List , radical environmental groups , etc. all have a seat at the decision making table in Washington these days , ” he continued .
“ Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid are in charge and they are working with an equally ‘ progressive ’ President Obama ( remember his voting record is more liberal than Ted Kennedy ! ) . ”
In the e-mail , Huckabee concedes that there is little that conservatives can do in the near term , but advocated mobilization to defeat those “ masquerading as ‘ conservative Democrats . ’ ”
“ This is the opening round of the Democrats ’ campaign for big government , ” he wrote .
“ We can not afford to sit round one out , because if we do , they will only become more emboldened and their grab for power more audacious and damaging to our country and our freedoms . ”
Watch Obama ’s reaction to the Senate stimulus vote :
British liberals seek alliance with right in name of defending liberty
By Chris Marsden
16 March 2009
Will Hutton was one of the most important speakers at the Convention on Modern Liberty conference in London on February 28 , addressing the theme " Freedom and democracy after the market meltdown . "
The Convention on Modern Liberty has the backing of several civil rights groups , as well as the Guardian newspaper .
Hutton himself is the former editor - in - chief of the Observer and director of Guardian national newspapers and is now the leading light in The Work Foundation , which provides consultancy and research to business , government and charities .
His remarks exemplify the response to the worsening economic and political crisis of capitalism by a layer of the liberal intelligentsia represented at the convention — the forging of an alliance with the conservative right in a movement to defend the existing order , under the banner of preserving democracy from the threat of extremism .
Hutton painted a candid and accurate depiction of the scale of the economic crisis now gripping world capitalism .
He described an ongoing collapse worse than any other in history , including the Great Depression in the Hungry Thirties , one made more serious in its implications because of the unprecedented degree of social polarization .
He began by describing an " astonishing economic background " that has seen Japan 's industrial production fall by a third in the three months to January and that of the United States fall by almost a quarter .
The same picture is repeated in Europe , with Britain 's GDP predicted to have declined by 6 percent by summer 2009 .
This drop in the space of just 18 months is greater than that suffered in the four years between 1929 and 1933 .
He concluded , " In many respects , I am beginning to think that what is taking place internationally is graver than what took place in the early 1930s . "
Hutton then asked , " What 's the impact of all this going to be for liberty ? "
Internationally he described a descent into beggar - thy - neighbour protectionist measures , particularly in Europe where , " There 's a real sense of ‘ sauve qui peut ' [ every man for himself ] at the moment . "
Regarding the domestic implications of the economic crisis , Hutton gives vivid expression to the fears this generates within Britain 's ruling elite .
He knows that the acute social tensions produced by the crisis of the profit system will in turn result in an eruption of the class struggle and a political polarization between left and right .
" Everyone knows the story of the 1930s , " he said .
" When unemployment climbs as precipitately as it does and when the safety net is as weak as it is , people blame the other . "
This danger was particularly acute , given the destruction of welfare measures over the past quarter century .
Britain would see a rise in unemployment of up to two million in the immediate period , Hutton suggested .
In the 1980s under Thatcher , with over three million out of work and social unrest that culminated in a year - long miners ' strike , the unemployed had to live on benefits equivalent to two - fifths of average earnings .
Today , Jobseekers Allowance is set at £ 60.50 , equivalent to just one - fifth of the average annual wage of £ 25,000 .
" It 's an absolute calamity , " said Hutton .
" There will be , I think , demands for vengeance . "
Regarding the demand for " vengeance " he declares , " This could be a moment for the left or it could be a moment for the right . "
In either case this would be a threat to " not just economic liberties , " many of which he admits " got us into this mess in the first place , but actually political liberties .
I think that there will be the rise of parties all over Europe which will be extremely unpleasant . "
Hutton 's reaction to the worsening crisis is that of extremely privileged layer which fears nothing more than a challenge to these privileges from below .
Thus he makes the danger of fascism and socialism coeval ; both being portrayed as different forms of " authoritarian statism " and threats to democracy .
Portraying himself as the defender of democracy from political extremism of all kinds , he calls for the reassertion of " the great Enlightenment traditions " and the restoration of the necessary " checks and balances " in economic and political life to prevent " a migration to a world of authoritarian statism on either the left or the right ... more slump and even war . "
In an earlier article in the Guardian , Hutton also declared baldly that the defence of liberty " is n't a question of left or right .
We should fight together . "
Despite such pretensions , in reality he and the layers represented by the convention are allying themselves with forces whose commitment to " Enlightenment values " is non-existent : the top leadership of the Conservative Party and the party 's hardline Thatcherite wing , up to and including the union - busting Freedom Association , which has historic links to the far right .
Hutton justifies this alliance by claiming that a united struggle for liberty must not be prevented by disagreements over " the distribution of income , the role of markets . "
Rather the defence of liberty lies through the preservation of " a complex skein of institutions , " including " government , an independent civil service , a free media , independent shareholders , free trade unions , independent universities , regular elections . "
This turns reality on its head .
It is precisely the polarization of wealth between an oligarchy of the super - rich at one pole and the majority of working people who face ever greater financial hardship at the other that has been the driving force for the constant erosion of civil liberties over the past decade and more .
This unprecedented transfer of social wealth from the vast majority to a tiny minority has been accomplished through the destruction of living standards , the smashing up of welfare provisions and the return to the most predatory forms of imperialist militarism in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Enlightenment traditions cited by Hutton were based on the equality of all citizens before the law , but this in turn rested on the belief by representatives of the bourgeoisie that private ownership of the means of production was the basis for individual liberty .
In the struggle against feudalism , such a claim was indeed progressive .
But today , centuries later , the institutions created by the bourgeoisie to administer its rule preside over the most economically unequal society in world history .
Even formal democracy is no longer compatible with such a diseased social order .
Consent cannot be won for policies that are detrimental to the interests of the vast majority .
Coercion is required .
Today there can be no successful defence of democratic rights outside of a conscious pursuit of the class struggle against the capitalist profit system based on a socialist programme .
It is not the working class seeking " vengeance " that poses a threat to democracy as embodied in the institutions of the state , the " free media , " etc .
It is the state , including parliament , the civil service and the judiciary , as well as a media controlled by big business , that is being used to curtail and destroy civil liberties and which , as instruments of bourgeois class rule , represent the greatest threat to democratic rights .
It is against this danger that the working class must be mobilized .
Time is the school in which we learn .
Time is the fire in which we burn .
– Delmore Schwartz
His Story
Tick - tock , tick tock …
It ’s the pulse that endlessly beats through his mind .
He attempts to ignore it .
He jogs , reads , writes , drinks , chats , anything to distract its drumming .
But it persists .
The pulse follows him .
It calls to him .
Wherever , whenever … it ’s always present .
There is no idle time .
Tasks are due now .
Tasks are due soon .
Every moment is meticulously accounted for .
At work , at lunch , while socializing , even in bed with his wife … his mind wanders .
What time is it ?
Where is the minute hand now ?
He has to look .
Tick - tock , tick - tock … the rhythm consumes him .
It ’s inside of him .
And he knows it .
“ It ’s a part of who I am , ” he tells his wife when she gets irritated with his rigidness .
He sets the alarm to 5:00 AM seven days a week , but he does n’t need it .
Even on Sundays his eyes robotically pop open around 4:50 AM .
It ’s the internal pulse that arouses him .
His body simply knows it ’s time .
Time for productivity .
Time for action .
It ’s always time for something .
The clock radio reads 4:00 … now 4:01 AM .
No , not yet !
It ’s still too early .
One more hour of sleep … one more hour of peace .
As he drives to work , a countdown plays out in his mind .
33 minutes before he arrives at the office .
2 hours and 48 minutes before the weekly marketing conference call .
5 days , 4 hours and 15 minutes before his bi-annual review .
1 month , 2 weeks , 3 days , 12 hours and 30 minutes before his spring vacation .
And as his overloaded mind begins to spin , he thinks about what life would be like if he could just let go of it all … if the internal pulse died and allowed him to simply be in the moment , and live for the sake of existing .
“ It would be blissful , ” he says to himself .
“ Sheer freedom ! ”
He pulls into the parking lot at exactly 7:00 AM , enters his office , and opens his desktop calendar .
After staring at it blankly for almost a full minute , he closes his eyes and pushes the palms of his hands against his forehead .
Overwhelmed , anxious , trapped … but conscious of what must be done .
He slowly lowers his quivering hands , opens his eyes , and begins to draft his daily to - do list .
Her Story
She does n’t manage her time .
In fact , she rarely knows what time it is .
In her mind , there are no deadlines .
She understands the concept of time management , and that others are bound by schedules , but she refuses to participate .
“ Stop bothering me , ” she says .
“ My time is mine . ”
She does n’t own an alarm clock , or a calendar , or even a cell phone .
If you question her ways , she ’ll snicker and tell you , “ You ’re just another member of the corporate cattle herd … wasting your time to meet someone else ’s agenda . ”
She ’s totally free to do whatever she wants , whenever she wants .
A unique , free spirit in charge of her own destiny … completely immune to the forces that attempt to confine her .
“ Do n’t lecture me on time management , ” she exclaims .
“ Instead , why do n’t you ponder the last time you actually enjoyed yourself .
I bet , in your quest to satisfy needless commitments and fill a 9 to 5 quota , you enjoy yourself a lot less than I enjoy myself .
If you ask me , you ’re the one wasting time ! ”
Naturally , absolute freedom from the bounds of time has its inherent limitations .
Human beings cannot achieve goals without dedicating time to them .
Likewise , it ’s impossible to coordinate productive social interactions without planning a time and space to do so .
Thus , she failed out of college , loses jobs faster than she finds them , and ca n’t maintain a healthy intimate relationship .
Even her closest friends have written her off as a failure .
And , to her parent ’s dismay , she currently lives in their basement , rent free , at the ripe age of 29 .
Time Management is Like Gravity
Time management is like gravity .
Too much of it , and we ’re stuck in place .
Not enough of it , and we ’re lost in space .
We need it to live , but in moderation .
The South by Southwest ( SXSW ) music festival is one of the largest and most popular in the United States .
For the fifth year in a row , SXSW has released a DRM - free , RIAA - safe collection of songs totaling 6 GB , which can all be downloaded for free , thanks to BitTorrent .
For some of the previous editions , SXSW itself has offered torrents showcasing the artists scheduled to perform at the festival .
Starting last year , however , SXSW stopped releasing a torrent of their own .
Since all of the mp3s are available for download on the festival ’s site , it only takes one person to get a torrent up and running .
Last year it was Greg Hewgill who took the time and effort to put all the MP3s into one big torrent , and for the 2009 edition Ben Stolt did the same .
Since there ’s over 6 GB of DRM - free music , using torrents makes it much easier than laboriously downloading every MP3 separately .
In addition , using BitTorrent instead of the server based system saves SXSW money in bandwidth costs .
The good news is that , for once , the RIAA is n’t watching over your shoulder when downloading music .
There are three torrents for the 23rd SXSW edition which contain a record breaking 1267 MP3s of both upcoming , as well as established artists who will appear at this year ’s festival .
Needless to say there should be something to suit everyone ’s tastes , and all in all it ’s a great way to expand your horizons and discover new and upcoming artists , all for free .
This year ’s SXSW music festival takes place from March 18 - 22 in Austin Texas .
All the tracks released for the previous editions are also still available for those people who want to fill up their iPod without having to invest thousands of dollars .
This summer has just become a real exciting times for collectors of action figures because ReAction are going to release a new range of action figures based on the television shows ‘ Arrow ’ and ‘ The Flash ’ .
The figures , which will stand 3 and 3/4 inches are inspired by the Kenner figures that were released in the 1980s and still to this day remain very collectable .
You can expect to see these figures hit stores and online outlets sometime in July , but as ever that date could change .
So keep your eyes open .
The ‘ Arrow ’ range will include figures of Arrow , Black Canary , Deathstroke and The Dark Archer .
The Flash range will include The Flash and Captain Cold .
At present no images are available for the Flash range , but we have a gallery below for the ‘ Arrow ’ figures so feel free to check those out .

From Rudolph Bell at GreenvilleOnline : Ex - Fed governor feels ' accountable ' in economic crisis ( ht Scott )
[ Former Fed Governor from 2001 - 2007 ]
Susan Schmidt
Bies is having second thoughts about some of the votes she cast as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in the years leading up to the present crisis .
...
" I never , never would have guessed it was going to be like this , never , " she said .
In an interview with The Greenville News , Bies reflected on her time at the Fed -- and expressed regret at not acting to raise interest rates faster or doing more to strengthen mortgage underwriting .
...
Bies said the bigger problem was lenders granting mortgages to people without the means to repay the loans .
That concern fell to Bies , since she was the Fed 's point person for bank oversight .
" As regulators , we did n't see the whole picture of how poorly the loans were being underwritten , because there 's so many regulators in this country .
None of us saw the whole picture , and we did n't tighten down enough , fast enough on it , " Bies said .
...
" I think everybody just really lost touch with how much the underwriting of loans had deteriorated , " Bies said .
...
Before the collapse , she said , " every bank risk model , every securitizer , broker dealer , all the rating agencies , were all basically where I was . "
" I just did n't realize it was as bad as it was , " she said .
[ W ]e see indications that underwriting standards are beginning to weaken .
For example , " affordability products " -- such as interest - only loans , negative amortizations , and second mortgages with high loan - to - value ratios -- are becoming more popular ; subprime lending is growing faster than prime lending ; adjustable - rate mortgages , or ARMs , have grown substantially and now account for more than a third of all mortgage originations , the highest level since 1994 .
Industry experts are increasingly concerned about the quality of collateral valuations relied upon in home equity lending and residential refinancing activities .
More homes are being purchased not as primary dwellings , but as vacation homes or pure investments , in which case anticipated price appreciation may be a large factor influencing purchase decisions .
... [ T ]he agencies have observed some easing of underwriting standards , with lenders competing to attract home equity lending business .
Lenders are sometimes offering interest - only loans and are sometimes requiring very small down payments and limited documentation of a borrower 's assets and income .
They are also relying more on automated - valuation models and entering into more transactions with loan brokers and other third parties .
Given this easing of standards , there is concern that portions of banks ' home equity loan portfolios may be vulnerable to a rise in interest rates and a decline in home values .
In other words , there is concern that not all banks fully recognize the embedded risks in some of their portfolios .
Bank supervisors today have similar concerns about commercial real estate lending , defined as those real estate loans in which the primary source of repayment is derived from the rental income or sale proceeds of commercial property .
This has historically been a highly volatile asset class , and it played a central role in the banking problems of the late 1980s and early 1990s .
It 's tempting to say : Hoocoodanode ?
But actually Bies did realize there was a problem , but she just did n't act aggressively to understand the depth of the problem ... here are some excerpts from a speech she gave in June , 2005 : Yes , Bies was late realizing there was a problem .
And she did n't seem to recognize the extent of the underwriting issues - even though this speech outlined many of the key issues and was given almost two years before New Century went down .
Think of all those poorly underwritten loans made after Bies gave this speech .
Why did n't the Fed move more aggressively to understand the underwriting issues , and why did they drag their feet for the next two years ?
I think those are key questions that still need to be answered .
The Obama administration failed  miserably  the first test of its commitment to ditching the extravagant legal claims used by the Bush administration to try to impose blanket secrecy on anti-terrorism policies and avoid accountability for serial abuses of the law .
On Monday , a Justice Department lawyer dispatched by the new attorney general , Eric Holder , appeared before a three - judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco .
The case before them involves serious allegations of torture by five victims of President Bush ’s extraordinary rendition program .
The five were seized and transported to American facilities abroad or to countries known for torturing prisoners .
Incredibly , the federal lawyer advanced the same expansive state - secrets argument that was pressed by Mr. Bush ’s lawyers to get a trial court to dismiss the case without any evidence being presented .
It was as if last month ’s inauguration had never occurred .
Voters have good reason to feel betrayed if they took Mr. Obama seriously on the campaign trail when he criticized the Bush administration ’s tactic of stretching the state - secrets privilege to get lawsuits tossed out of court .
Even judges on the panel seemed surprised by the administration ’s decision to go forward instead of requesting a delay to reconsider the government ’s position and , perhaps , file new briefs .
Even dog shows in Russia are rigged
If Russia Today is to be believed , out of 12,000 dogs competing at the recent Eurasia - 2009 dog show in Moscow , President Dmitry Medvedev ’s three dogs just happened to all win top prizes :
The president ’s two English setters , Joly and Daniel , got first place in their individual classes , while his golden retriever , Aldu , received a silver medal at the Eurasia - 2009 dog show .
I find this about as convincing as a Chechen election , but one audience member swears that the presidential pooches deserved their honors :
“ I understand that some people may think that the president ’s dogs only won because of their master , but his dogs really performed well .
And they are beautiful . ”
Whatever .
The judges are just lucky Putin ’s dogs Koni and Tosya were n’t competing .
Awkward .

This morning , radio host Bill Press brought up the recent closing of liberal station Obama 1260 when speaking with Michigan Sen.
Debbie Stabenow , and talked about whether there needs to be a balance to right - wing talk on the radio dial .
BILL PRESS : Yeah , I mean , look :
They have a right to say that .
They ’ve got a right to express that .
But , they should not be the only voices heard .
So , is it time to bring back the Fairness Doctrine ?
SENATOR DEBBIE STABENOW ( D - MI ) : I think it ’s absolutely time to pass a standard .
Now , whether it ’s called the Fairness Standard , whether it ’s called something else — I absolutely think it ’s time to be bringing accountability to the airwaves .
I mean , our new president has talked rightly about accountability and transparency .
You know , that we all have to step up and be responsible .
And , I think in this case , there needs to be some accountability and standards put in place .
BILL PRESS : Can we count on you to push for some hearings in the United States Senate this year , to bring these owners in and hold them accountable ?
SENATOR DEBBIE STABENOW ( D - MI ) : I have already had some discussions with colleagues and , you know , I feel like that ’s gonna happen .
Yep .
Although Obama has been publicly opposed to reinstating the fairness doctrine , conservative radio has talked nonstop about the fear of it returning ( or perhaps something like it with another name ) while there 's a Democrat in the White House and a Democratic majority in Congress .
UPDATE : A commenter points out that Stabenow is married to Tom Athans , a liberal talk radio executive .

DAVID BROOKS GETS SHRILL ….
Just yesterday I argued that respectable figures of the political establishment are reluctant to call obvious stupidity “ stupid , ” especially when it comes to truly painful ideas like a spending freeze in the midst of the economic crisis .
To his credit , the NYT‘s David Brooks said on ABC ’s “ This Week ” today what many are of his colleagues have been unwilling to say .
Describing Republican leaders , Brooks said , “ The problem with them and the problem with Limbaugh in terms of intellectual philosophy is they are stuck with Reagan .
They are stuck with the idea that government is always the problem .
A lot of Republicans up in Capitol Hill right now are calling for a spending freeze in a middle of a recession / depression .
That is insane .
But they are thinking the way they thought in 1982 , if we can only think that way again , that is just insane . ”
On this , Brooks could n’t be more correct .
But what I ’m especially impressed with is his willingness , in this case , to lay it on the line .
There ’s no sugar - coating — what Republican leaders are proposing is “ insane . ”
There ’s no defense for such madness , and Brooks did the audience a service by saying so .
At the risk of sounding picky , I ’d just add one small caveat , though .
GOP lawmakers are “ stuck with Reagan ” and a pre-recession mindset ; this much is obvious .
But what occasionally bears repeating is that they do n’t even remember Reagan especially well .
Reality may be blasphemous in some Republican circles but the inconvenient truth is Reagan raised taxes .
He raised them several times .
The conservative Republicans — with Gingrich and the WSJ editorial page , I mean that literally — who are whining incessantly about President Obama ’s proposed tax increases on the wealthy are the same ones who complained bitterly about Reagan ’s tax increases in 1982 .
Brooks is right ; conservative Republican lawmakers want desperately to turn back the clock to how they perceive the 1980s .
But they ’re not only wrong about today ’s economy , they ’re not even getting the ’ 80s right .
They were wrong about Reagan ’s tax increases .
They were wrong about Clinton ’s tax increases .
They were wrong about Bush ’s tax cuts .
And now , they ’re wrong again about Obama ’s tax policy while simultaneously pushing “ insane ” ideas .
If they could just let the grown - ups talk for a while , we ’d all be better off .
COUPLES wondering if the love will last could find out if theirs is a match made in heaven by subjecting themselves to a mathematical test .
A professor at Oxford University and his team have perfected a model whereby they can calculate whether the relationship will succeed .
Illustration : Cathy Wilcox
In a study of 700 couples , Professor James Murray , a maths expert , predicted the divorce rate with 94 per cent accuracy .
His calculations were based on 15 - minute conversations between couples who were asked to sit opposite each other in a room on their own and talk about a contentious issue , such as money , sex or relations with their in - laws .
Soccer Flip Throw - In To The Face ( Video )
Total Pro Sports –
Have you ever wondered what a Soccer Flip Throw is ?
A flip throw - in allows you to turn a basic restart of play into an offensive tactic by shooting the ball back into play like a cannon . [ eHow ]
Step 1 – Grasp the ball with both hands on the sides of the ball so your thumbs almost touch .
Step 2 – Stand 15 to 20 feet away from the touch line .
Step 3 – Begin running with a burst of speed , taking no more than three or four steps .
Step 4 – Plant the ball on the ground .
Step 5 – Flip your legs up as you plant the ball to complete a front handspring .
Step 6 – Use your momentum to fling the ball as you become upright again .
Step 7 – Land on your feet .
If you still do n’t understand what a Soccer Flip Throw is , all you have to do is ask Paul Ladd who manages to nail a kid from Thetford in the face during a State D3 Championship game .
The unidentified player from Thetford gets an upfront taste of the soccer ball .
I wonder if he lost his Chiclets ???
Here is video footage on why standing in front of a football player taking a long throw in is definitely a bad idea .
And this is what is supposed to happen when nobody is standing in front of a Soccer Flip Throw .

Four hours south of Perth lies a small country town that was once the centre of an extraordinary experiment ...
... a home - grown spiritual movement that for a brief time in the 70s was Australia 's most successful alternative community .
Stephen Carthew
Some of these sheds are still there .
Have n't been developed .
It 's not totally developed out .
Narration
Stephen Carthew was one of its founding fathers .
Stephen Carthew
Community Centre .
They 've even got a sign for it .
We used to have big sign saying Universal Brotherhood , and some people just stopped at it and turned at that sign , wondering what is this ?
And then ended up living there .
They should n't have stopped , but they did !
Narration
Thirty years ago , Stephen convinced nearly 200 young idealists ...
... to give up everything and put their lives in the hands of their very own New Age guru ... and his wife .
Linda Moctezuma
And we really believed that it was a turning point for mankind .
We honestly , honestly believed that .
And there was no turning back .
Matt Taylor
To most people who 've never been through anything like this , they 'd look at us and say are you nuts or something ?
Narration
They thought they could change the world .
What came of their dreams has haunted them ever since .
Susan Allwood
People allowed themselves to be controlled and manipulated .
People who absolutely believed in what was happening have been lost ever since .
Anita Chauvin
If Mary had said to us : we 've reached the right vibration , we do n't need our bodies any more .
We 're all going to drink cyanide .
I wonder if we 'd done it .
Narration
Today the property that once housed the Universal Brotherhood is still run as a community ...
A loose co-operative with no religious connections .
Only a handful of former members still live here .
Now , after many years , Stephen 's finally come back .
Stephen Carthew
Wow !
Quite different .
Look at that - that 's a lot of extra growth ... The old homestead .
Here we are .
It 's changed a bit because the house has been renovated .
Still very much here , very much it .
Wow ( laughs ) Hey Marg .
How are you ?
Margie Miskimmini
It 's nice to see you .
Does it look anything like you remember ?
Stephen Carthew
Yeah - it 's pretty much the same ...
Narration
Stephen 's here to write the definitive history of the Brotherhood ...
... A final accounting of the paradise they built - and lost .
Stephen Carthew
So my path used to be up this line - and that used to be the driveway into Mary 's house ...
We had such a vision for what could be .
And while the gardens were really growing really well like that , you could really feel um and see
how it was expanding and it was beautiful .
Unless somebody actually writes it down and gets it out there then they can't , there wo n't be a way of reflecting on it properly .
And this is the school .
This is the old school house .
And my place is just down , just down through here ...
What you invoke you 're responsible for .
And what I invoked I still feel a sense of responsibility .
And so that sense of responsibility 's not involved with the community as such , but in getting the story straight .
Getting the story out .
Narration
News of Stephen 's visit has spread through the community , and he 's been asked to speak about the little known days of the Brotherhood .
Stephen Carthew
There 's a lot of things that were n't easy and a lot of mistakes that I made , or I can look back and see we made as a group and - But I can't say , I can't say I 'm sorry that we tried .
And we -
And I 'm actually really proud of the fact that we did create uh this community .
Narration
But in the audience are a handful of former followers ...
...
And they 're about to take the meeting in a very different direction .
Susan Allwood
Really used to upset me about the fact that Mary used to have these dreams and say God spoke to her in dreams and then everyone used to have to do what Mary said because of some bloody dream she had .
( Crowd laughs )
That is weird stuff !
Cos Stephen 's here talking about it like he did 30 years ago , he 's recreating it all over again , is n't he ?
Stephen Carthew
Actually , that 's really unfair .
I went through a lot of the things that you 're talking about and I can relate to some of it .
But I 'm trying to give a historical perspective not an emotional perspective to this although emotions are very much part of it .
Narration
But these emotions have been waiting 30 years for the chance to erupt .
Stephen Carthew
They came to the community and found healing .
And found a new life there .
And so - Bye Bye .
Susan Allwood
You can't shut me up Steven , and I do n't care if I 'm emotional .
I 'm allowed to be emotional , even if it 's 30 years late .
You can't stop me from talking like you did in the community .
I was one of the outspoken people .
Okay there 's a lot of repressed stuff inside me because he tried to shut me up and control me the whole time .
He separated me from my husband when I was pregnant , and I nearly had a breakdown , put me on a silence fast , and made me look after myself , you know .
And I 'm sorry , I 'm here to get over all of that stuff and you are full of shit , Steven .
And it was a lot of hocus pocus , mumbo jumbo .
And do n't you tell me to shut up anymore .
Stephen Carthew
Susan , I have n't told you .
Susan Allwood
You did .
You put me down in front of everyone and you told me to shut up like you did all those years ago .
And I 'm sorry if I 'm emotional if you 're a socialist or social worker or something .
That 's me .
And this was a load of mumbo jumbo .
We had good will , but you were an arsehole !
Narration
It had all begun in an era of such peace , love
and harmony .
It was 1971 and hundreds of middle class kids were looking for a way out .
Turning their backs on jobs , mortgages and a safe life in the suburbs .
For many , it was the chance to experiment with alternative lifestyles , drugs and free love .
Stephen Carthew
Oh hello , my name 's Stephen and I 'm on holidays ...
Narration
But a few were on a more serious path to enlightenment .
Stephen Carthew
Many of us had been involved in the drug culture and we realised that was n't where we wanted to be .
Narration
Stephen Carthew came from a privileged upbringing on Sydney 's north shore .
But like many others , he soon found himself on the hippy trail through India .
At just 23 , he 'd come back to start Sydney 's first New Age environmental education centre .
Stephen Carthew
I was interested in the New Age .
I 'd been in touch with New Age communities in India , in Scotland and America ...
For a long time I was speculating , wondering and so on , but now I do n't have to believe that I breathe , I know I breathe , and it 's got nothing to do with religion , it 's just a cosmic point of view ...
Narration
It was n't long before he met Fred Robinson , Australia 's grand old man of organic farming .
Eighty year - old Fred was a self - styled eco-prophet .
His mission : to guide the younger generation into a golden New Age .
Fred Robinson
The truth for the first time in the history of this planet is available to all who seek and ask .
No matter what it is about .
From pollution , from the point of view of organic gardening , from the point of view of anything , where from man can make this a heaven upon earth instead of a hell upon earth .
Stephen Carthew
He was a hippie of his generation talking to hippies of my generation .
So he was one of the few that had pioneered a path that we already wanted to take .
Narration
So Stephen and Fred joined forces .
Stephen cashed in his inheritance and began selling Fred 's message ...
... Calling for volunteers to pioneer a model community that could save the planet , and mankind .
Fred Robinson
If we do not take constructive action in this direction , then the obvious , the obvious collapse of the whole world system , is becoming evident even to the man in the street .
Linda Moctezuma
He was convinced that the economy was about to go and that we needed to get away from the world so that we'd be economically protected .
And I thought this is it .
This is what I was meant to do with my life was to start a new society that would be the alternative society to mankind .
And I really believed that .
Narration
Linda Ward was one of their first converts .
An intense teenager desperate to escape the insular world of Sydney 's northern beaches .
Linda Moctezuma
I was young .
I was only 18 and terribly idealistic I was finishing school , not knowing what I wanted to do .
Did n't want to go to university , did n't want to go out and work .
So I was lost and I was ripe for the picking basically .
Narration
And so were many others ... as Stephen and Fred 's roadshow travelled to festivals around the country .
Their audience included impressionable sixteen year - olds like Anita Chauvin .
Anita Chauvin
My father was a yoga teacher .
My mother had been taking me to yoga and Jung and theosophy and a whole lot of things since I was about twelve .
I left school .
I 'd been doing very well at school and I think my family had a collective faint .
Narration
By now , Stephen and Fred 's campaign had reached the Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne ...
Their band of converts now included rock stars of the day .
Matt Taylor
You know we just had a number one record and everything like that .
And so I just sold everything up .
Because number one records were n't as important as finding out how the universe worked .
I think there 's much more inspiration in the country , you know , just to walk out like here and just see beauty ...
Narration
Before long a stream of young disciples were following Fred and Stephen west ...
They handed over all their savings to buy 300 acres of remote farmland four hours south of Perth .
This was to be the birthplace of a new utopia : the Universal Brotherhood .
Anita Chauvin
We arrived in our Kombie with the seagrass matting roof .
These innocent young hippies .
See - through clothes , free spirit floating as you do .
Stephen Carthew
It was a real buzz having all these people come together with so many ideas and so much that we could do .
You never know who was going to turn up tomorrow and what skills they might have .
One was always thinking and maybe praying for somebody to come that could do this .
And then they 'd turn up the next day and you 'd go wow !
Matt Taylor
Well Fred used to get terribly upset .
He 'd say I wanted carpenters and plumbers - not musicians .
And I 'd say Fred , it 's only the musicians that can understand what you 're talking about - the carpenters and plumbers do n't want to know about it .
Narration
But there were a few working class kids , like Jason Hart from Kalgoorlie , to help turn their dreams into reality .
Jason Hart
It was basically a collection of hippy type people .
And for me , being an underground miner ( laughs ... )
You know
Susan Allwood
And me ?
I walked straight out of Melbourne in my designer clothes with my leather jacket on and my Toorak hairdo and came over
Narration
Susan Allwood gave up a fashion career for the chance to be part of this new community .
Susan Allwood
I lost my father when I was 12 , had fairly turbulent teenage years , and was looking for a group of people I could trust and a group of friends , family I could belong to .
And I found that .
Matt Taylor
And what was lovely about them is that these were n't the talkers these were the doers .
They were n't talking about creating a new world , they were doing it .
Narration
From a handful of pioneers , the Universal Brotherhood quickly grew to over 100 members .
Within a year , it had become an almost completely self - sufficient community ...
... Putting into practise all its principles of biodynamic farming and wholistic living .
Those who still went out to work handed in their pay packets unopened .
In exchange the Brotherhood took care of everyone 's food , shelter and clothing .
Everything was shared - and everyone ate , played and prayed together .
Anita Chauvin
What I liked about what Fred was offering was it was n't just um abstract ideas , or one particular discipline , it was a package .
So it was n't just meditate and do yoga .
It was the entire thing .
It was grow the healthy vegetables , live a certain lifestyle , um , do these spiritual practices , be a community , get married , have the golden children , bring in the New Age .
Linda Moctezuma
And we really believed that it was a turning point for mankind .
We honestly honestly believed that .
And we were going to be the spearhead , the leaders of this new age .
We were creating the model that the whole world was going to be built on .
And so we had this great responsibility to do it properly .
Stephen Carthew
We call ourselves a Brotherhood , um , and the reason we do that is we 're not an unorganised group of people come together just because we want to escape .
We want to create a really pure alternative society in a world where there is a tremendous amount of pollution .
Stephen Carthew
We used to say it 's down to earth and up to heaven , or back to the land and in tune with god .
//
Even though the environmental and the ecological and the physical things of growing things were all important .
For me this personal relationship with a god that lived inside me , around me or however one wanted to look at it ; this relationship with god was the most important aspect of it .
Jason Hart
Every morning we used to have a group meditation .
And it was a very powerful and dynamic thing because the whole emphasis of the community was to follow your inner spirit .
The spirit of limitless love and truth .
Narration
With Fred still on the road recruiting , Stephen now took on the role of preacher ...
It was a mixed bag of mystical teachings , new age philosophies and old - fashioned Christian values .
Unlike other hippy communes , purity in the Brotherhood was n't just a state of mind .
Matt Taylor
Well there 's no drugs for a start .
There 's no unmarried sex .
This , this is ( laughs ) a convent for married people .
Linda Moctezuma
You know we wore very conservative clothes covering us - making sure .
No bikinis - girls could n't wear bikinis .
It was very modest .
Anita Chauvin
You had to find all your defects and polish your soul to become a better person .
Help bring in the New Age .
Margie Miskimmini
We had meditations , we had prayers , we had exercises , we had yogas , we had disciplines
Narration
Margie Miskimmins was a veteran of San Francisco in the psychedelic sixties .
She 'd been hitching round Australia with her daughter when she stumbled across the Brotherhood .
Margie Miskimmini
In a certain sense it was a refuge .
And somehow events conspired to produce a place where , I do n't know , for a moment in space and time a lot of things came together .
You felt safe .
Narration
But if life in the Brotherhood was safe and pure , the world outside was increasingly seen as dangerously corrupt .
Linda Moctezuma
We were terrified of going out into the world , terrified .
the truck had to go out sometimes to bring in supplies .
And we'd have all these meditations before the truck went out and surround the truck in a ball of light so that the truck would n't get polluted by thoughts from the outside world .
Narration
TV and radio were banned .
Believing they had all the answers , the Brotherhood cut themselves off from the rest of society .
But with guru
Fred at the helm , they soon found themselves in uncharted waters .
Fred was a farmer , who'd been bankrupted by the Great Depression
Since then he'd been developing his own cosmic vision of the future .
Stephen Carthew
Fred believed strongly that part of the New Age message was that we were coming in contact again with the rest of the galaxy .
Our elder brothers were linking up with us again , those of us that could understand and were preparing the planet for a graduation into a higher school of evolution , or a higher , to a higher consciousness .
Anita Chauvin
Fred used to talk about how we were raising our personal vibrations and perhaps one day we would even shed our physical bodies and not need them anymore and just function as a etheric spiritual beings .
Stephen Carthew
He saw the world as the Titanic about to hit the iceberg
Susan Allwood
And there 'd be an increase in earthquakes , there would be a climate change , there 'd be less water , there 'd be catastrophes in the world .
And eventually the UFO's would come with Christ and the flying saucers and take the people who believed and did good things away and save us .
Linda Moctezuma
And they even brought a property that had an airstrip on it so that the elder brothers would have somewhere to land , and come and take us and rescue us .
Now there 's only one thing more amazing than him saying that - and that 's us believing it .
Stephen Carthew
I 'm still really ambivalent about a lot of his flying saucer message .
But it was sort of part of the package of Fred .
I wanted to focus on what I could work with , and what I did appreciate in his message .
And so that was my focus .
If Fred wanted to focus on other things that was his freedom to do that .
Narration
Young Stephen took over the running of the place ... under the direction of Fred 's wife , Mary .
Mary had married Fred in 1963 .
She shared his New Age vision and soon found herself at the helm .
Stephen Carthew
Fred was never involved in the organisation .
He was the prophet , giving the cosmic message .
That was his job .
Mary 's job was to try and organise the rabble that had turned up on her front door .
That 's how she saw it .
Linda Moctezuma
She was the one who decided the rules of the place and the way everything was going to be run .
And Mary 's word was gospel .
Mary had to be followed .
Matt Taylor
Basically you 've got to realise it was n't a democracy , it was a theocracy .
Narration
Power was now being concentrated in a few
select hands .
Mary and Stephen even created their own governing council - a small group of trusted advisers , known as the Centre Core ...
They claimed an authority that was channelled straight from God .
Susan Allwood
Mary had her belief that she slept at night and she had dreams and God spoke to her , and we then had to follow what God had said to her .
Linda Moctezuma
Stephen 's role was like the adviser .
He was also a channel for God .
We all had delusions of grandeur , but he had big ones .
Narration
And those delusions grew as the new converts just kept on coming .
Within 3 years , hundreds had come to visit and nearly 200 stayed .
Stephen Carthew
I thought in 1972 and 73 , 74 that the whole social landscape would change .
I thought there would be little communities springing up all over Australia and this was going to set the world on fire .
Narration
Stephen was on a roll ... feted by the press and visiting celebrities like American country music singer John Denver .
Meanwhile , out of the spotlight , the disciples kept up the hard work .
Matt Taylor
I was n't there to teach , I was there to learn .
And I was there to participate in a great group effort .
Once a week I 'd empty every dunny in that place by hand .
Would never complain .
I was happy to do it because everyone had to do certain jobs , everything like that .
Happy to do it .
Linda Moctezuma
You would have thought that Matt would have been a star recruit .
He was a pop singer .
But remember we 'd rejected the world .
So what happened out in the world did n't really mean anything to us .
Matt Taylor
The closer you were to the Centre Core the easier the life was .
And Stephen had quite a nice life .
I do n't think he ever emptied a toilet .
Susan Allwood
Cos I had a friend who'd go and do the dishes for them .
And I used to say , why can't they do their own dishes ?
Do n't do them .
And she used to say , but work is love , and I used to say , no - they 're just lazy .
Linda Moctezuma
You can parallel the whole of ' Animal Farm ' to characters in the Brotherhood .
It worked perfectly .
I had all the names of people .
I knew exactly who was who .
I knew who were the cows and who were the sheep and who were the pigs .
Yeah , oh , I was like Boxer and his donkey I must work harder .
I must work harder .
Then of course you got the pigs and no prizes for guessing who the pigs were
Stephen Carthew
Problems would come when those people that had just arrived all of a sudden wanted to run the place because they saw a better way of doing it , and life does n't work that way .
Anita Chauvin
You were told if you 're feeling down or you had doubts come and speak to the Centre Core .
Because they 're more spiritually evolved and they will be in a position to help you .
Do n't speak to your peers because you'd be a negative influence on them .
Narration
The ruling Centre Core was growing more hardline .
They made sure everyone was pure enough for the New Age by constantly scrutinising their behaviour and polishing their souls .
For earnest young followers like Linda this meant being summoned in for criticism at any time .
Linda Moctezuma
I remember walking to Stephen 's to be interviewed thinking what was it .
What have I done ?
What have I done ?
Wracking my brains to wonder what I 'd done wrong .
And I 'd get in there and it was always a shock .
Something that I had n't even thought of that he 'd bring up .
Stephen Carthew
I think that when people care enough to try and tell you you 've got this weakness and you 've got to work on it , you say yeah okay and I will .
And you try and say , thanks very much for thinking so much about me that I 'm now polishing my soul .
Linda Moctezuma
Sometimes it was terribly harsh .
I remember feeling it in my heart sometimes , walking out of that room just feeling just so worthless and so awful .
Narration
And the humiliations were n't just verbal .
Linda and others were punished with menial jobs and cut off from community life .
Threatened with expulsion , they also endured ' silence fasts ' , sometimes for weeks on end .
Anita Chauvin
Because the community was such a closed nurturing nest , if you were isolated , as an exercise in polishing your soul that was pretty intense .
Linda Moctezuma
It sounds like we were stupid for believing all this and swallowing it all , but the thing is we wanted so desperately to form a new society .
We wanted to be together , we wanted to fulfil this dream .
And we were little by little willing to do anything to stay within that group .
The group became our world , and to be rejected from the group would be to lose our whole identity .
Narration
Meanwhile , on the surface at least , life in the Brotherhood was all smiles and positive vibrations .
There was no room in Fred 's new " heaven on earth " for any unhappiness .
Linda Moctezuma
A child died while we were there .
A little baby , it was a cot death .
And I was just inconsolably crying .
I was crying and crying and crying .
And everyone else was singing and dancing .
And I was called in afterwards and told that how dare I display such emotions .
It 's not part of the consciousness .
That child 's soul had gone to God .
What on earth was I crying about ?
And I ended up apologising for crying about the death of a baby !
Narration
Few dared confess to any doubt , anger or distress ...
Those who did were demonised and shunned .
Anita Chauvin
Mary told me when I talked about the black moods I was having and images in my head that were frightening me .
Mary told me that I had been taken possession of by negative beings from the astral plane and she isolated me from most of the community .
Susan Allwood
But I defied it .
I found some people and I said to them , I can't go on like this any longer I 'll go crazy so will you talk to me ?
And they said yes .
And I 'd sneak down to their caravan every night and have a chat to them and they saved my sanity .
Matt Taylor
It was like Nazi Germany .
You knew what the rules were and so you just kept your mouth shut .
If you lived in Soviet Russia you did n't say Stalin 's a bastard , or the next day you 're out of the consciousness .
So you just play the game and at that time I still completely and utterly believed in what we were doing ; we were going to build just a whole new society , build it on love , love of nature , on love of each other , you know the whole nine yards .
And a few rules ?
Yeah , what 's it matter ?
Linda Moctezuma
this was going on but at the same time we were still having a really good time .
We were still having our fun nights and our gardening and our group things and our games and all this was still going on and we still loved it .
Narration
And people were still falling in love and getting married within the community ... including young Anita .
She 'd become a Brotherhood celebrity after her mother kidnapped her ...
... Bringing her back to Sydney to get her deprogrammed .
Anita Chauvin
I was canny enough to present well to the psychologist .
The psychologist decided that I was very well adjusted young woman and decided that my poor mum might have some anxiety issues .
Where in fact she probably was right on the money .
What happened then was the community banded together and raised the funds to fly me back .
And turned me into some sort of hero .
And from that day I did not receive , I was not allowed to receive a letter from my mother .
Well she tried writing letters , signing off with my dog 's names so that I 'd recognise them .
And people filtering them would n't .
But I was so inculcated that I actually handed them back unopened .
Narration
The Brotherhood 's utopian dream was only six years old ... but the rot was already spreading from within .
In 1977 Linda was brought before the Centre Core for the last time .
She 'd been reported for flirting with Anita 's new husband .
Matt Taylor
Like Linda would have obviously been informed on .
Who ?
Does n't matter .
It would have been someone who was sharing a secret with someone .
Linda Moctezuma
I really felt like I was on trial for my life .
And I knew I was going to get the death sentence .
I could feel it .
I could feel that behind me , about to fall .
And then it came .
All this stuff came and it was the worst .
It was like a 5 - year culmination of everything I 'd ever done , and every good thing that I 've ever done was denigrated and put down and interpreted as evil .
And they said we had a meeting .
We 've had a meeting with all of your friends and your family and we put it to the vote .
We do n't put many things to the vote here but we 've put it to the vote and the vote was almost unanimous that you have to go .
And I could n't believe it .
I said everyone said I should go ?
All your friends said you should go .
Matt Taylor
No one wanted Linda to leave .
She was as I said a vivacious young girl and we needed that energy there .
Linda Moctezuma
And they said you 've got 24 hours to leave .
Matt Taylor
I think she might have been one of those ones where they got rid of really fast then told everybody : Linda 's decided to leave .
She was a bit out of the consciousness .
I can't remember .
But that 's how they would have done it .
Stephen Carthew
At a certain point when someone seems to be causing a lot of difficulties you just want to get them out of your hair in a sense .
Out of the community hair was all that could be done .
Linda Moctezuma
I just came back to Sydney shell - shocked .
And I knew there was no one I could talk to about this .
I felt like a complete failure .
And when I look back now I think I actually think I had a breakdown .
I actually think I had a nervous breakdown .
Narration
Even Matt found himself in the firing line .
A few months later , he was ordered to stop playing his own music .
Stephen told him he could only play from Brotherhood sanctioned songbooks .
Matt Taylor
And I 'm just sitting there thinking this is wrong , this is wrong .
This is not what we 're here for .
This is just power out of control .
Trying to control each individual .
Because that 's what it was .
If I would have said , yes , I 'll learn the 1000 Songs from the - they 've got me .
I 've given everything to be part of this .
And they want to take the one thing that is truly mine ; and the one thing that will always be mine .
And then it pretty much hit me .
Wait a second .
If I accept this then I 'm just going to lose myself .
I 'm just going to turn into something I 've always disliked .
You know just a mouthpiece for other people 's thoughts .
Narration
Matt defied his rulers .
He spoke out at the next morning service .
Matt Taylor
I talked about being out of the consciousness - the whole works .
I just pull the whole thing - just said what was happening there .
Stephen Carthew
It was a huge surprise .
It felt like a huge betrayal , that 's how it felt to me as an individual at the time .
That some of the people all of a sudden came out with this diatribe of things that were so terrible .
And I did n't know really what they were talking about .
Matt Taylor
The genie was out of the bottle , you could n't argue with this one .
And even as the meeting finished , people were walking out and saying , Did you know Steve came to me and he told me to do this ?
Oh , you 're joking !
And I was n't supposed to talk to you , that 's why I 've been ignoring you .
It was n't that I did n't like you .
All of this sort of thing began to hit the fan .
All the manipulation that was going on
Anita Chauvin
And it started a ripple where people , the only thing that happened that blew the community apart was for the first time people started saying to each other , how are you feeling ?
Margie Miskimmini
We went to bed one night as a community , we woke up in the next morning and everything was different .
It was that extreme .
Anita Chauvin
And within a week , 40 of us I think , around that number , packed up our children and our homes and left .
Without a penny , nothing .
We just left .
We left our little caravans , we left our dreams and we walked back into a world that we just did n't understand at all .
Susan Allwood
Being the cheeky person that I am , I wrote on the community noticeboard God , Has Told Me To Leave .
And I thought , well , everyone will think that 's right , they wo n't question me .
And I got on the bus and came to Perth with my son .
Anita Chauvin
And I think some of the people who were left behind must have been bewildered .
Because if they did n't participate in any of those few days of conversation about how are you feeling , I 'm not happy , they 'd have had absolutely no idea .
Margie Miskimmini
It was as if a magic wand had been waved and everything had changed and all location points had disappeared and some people were n't able to balance in that situation , you know .
Anita Chauvin
One person was running up and down the hill with his toothbrush because he thought the elder brothers were going to come and take us now .
Yeah , I think there was probably a lot of suffering for some people .
Narration
Many never recovered ...
Some like Jason wound up in hospital , needing psychiatric treatment for years to come .
Jason Hart
I started having these intensely profound spiritual experiences .
And because I experienced it so profoundly I lost the plot .
For example whether you can really understand this or not my physical body started spinning like a top .
Narration
Their world had crumbled - but the elder brothers in their space ships never came .
Even Fred had stopped believing in a golden future for the Universal Brotherhood .
Matt Taylor
When it collapsed , he somehow knew what was going on .
He was n't upset about what I 'd done .
He was thankful that someone had actually stood up to them .
Because he could n't any more .
He was so marginalised by this stage that at the end .
//
At the end even Fred was n't allowed to talk .
Narration
By 1978 the New Age dream was over .
Fred died of pneumonia soon after .
Mary persisted with her God - given mission until her death a decade later .
But the mood of the times had changed , as the world woke up to the danger of religious cults .
Anita Chauvin
I think Jonestown happened not long after we'd left the Brotherhood .
And I sometimes wondered you know with Fred 's theory that we were raising our vibrations and one day we would n't need our physical bodies and we'd only need our etheric bodies .
When Jonestown happened there was a moment where I thought , if Mary had said to us : we 've reached the right vibration , we do n't need our bodies any more .
We 're all going to drink cyanide .
I wonder if we 'd done it .
I 'd like to think that we would n't have , because by that time we 'd left .
But I wonder .
And we had come to it in such innocence and good will , and had been led to it by innocence and good will - but extraordinary deluded thinking .
Matt Taylor
I do n't think even Mary was capable of that .
It was on a mental level , it would never have come to physical harm .
I never saw any physical harm the whole time I was there .
Mental harm 's just as nasty , but you can walk away from it .
Narration
Thirty years later Stephen Carthew is still trying to come to terms with his part in it all .
Stephen Carthew
It was a trauma to realise that I 'd been part of bringing about a cult .
It was traumatic .
There was a while there after leaving the community , coming back into the world as we used to call it umm in which I found I was almost stuttering and I was n't able to speak coherently .
It was a challenging time working out how I could come back into society , having been in a pretty privileged position
Narration
Back in suburban Sydney , Linda too is searching for resolution .
Now a teacher , and married with children , she 's ready to look back on 6 years of her life - that till now she 's kept hidden .
Linda Moctezuma
I felt like I had wanted to forget about the Brotherhood for the last 30 years and I do n't know what happened .
I just woke up one morning , I guess it 's time and I thought I should n't be forgetting about this , I should be remembering .
Narration
So Linda is planning a reunion , a last chance to heal old wounds .
Linda Moctezuma
And I 'm hoping a lot of other people will be keen to join the reunion and discuss old times , learn about where each of us has gone in the last 30 years , and see what we 've gained from the experience .
Narration
For Anita , now a Brisbane social worker , news of the upcoming reunion has brought back emotions she thought she 'd long since left behind .
Anita Chauvin
My marriage exploded apart after leaving the Brotherhood .
I did n't know what to believe anymore .
I was frightened that it meant I was mad or maybe I would still go mad
When I was first asked if I 'd come to the reunion , I threw the letter out .
And then a number of people rang and said we'd love you to go , and I became curious about my level of anger and realised that maybe I had n't worked through my reactions to the Brotherhood at all and in fact began to realise that as a 19 year - old I had in fact buried it .
Matt Taylor
I went to the Universal Brotherhood to find God .
I went there to find out how the universe works .
I went there to find the truth .
And I found me .
Narration
Like many other ex-devotees , Matt Taylor simply slammed the door on his Brotherhood days and threw himself back into his music .
For him , like the others , this reunion will be his first meeting with his former Brothers since it all fell apart .
Matt Taylor
If you hold grudges you only hurt yourself , you 're not hurting anybody else .
And I think I will see him .
We 'll have a nice conversation and have a bit of a laugh .
I 'd like to meet that Stephen who I first went with Fred who hired the Myer Bowl .
Susan Allwood
Gosh , you look exactly the same !
Look at you !
Wow .
Linda Moctezuma
Are n't you gorgeous !
Susan Allwood
So are you .
Look at you !
You were a little girl when I knew you .
Linda Moctezuma
I was I know .
Susan Allwood
I brought a diary with me .
Linda Moctezuma
Fabulous .
Susan Allwood
Yeah , I kept diaries .
Narration
Susan 's come all the way from Perth to make sure this reunion calls Stephen to account .
Linda Moctezuma
the first week , you should have known .
Why did n't you turn and run there and then .
Susan Allwood
I should have .
I was idealistic ...
Linda Moctezuma
Oh ! Hello Matt !
Matt Taylor
Still got the big red hair .
Linda Moctezuma
Look at you !
Narration
But out of all of them , Stephen Carthew has the most at stake ... He knows he has a lot to answer for .
Stephen Carthew
I 'm turning embarrassment into an art form in a lot of ways .
It 's very strange because I 'm not the same person I was then .
But it 's still very important because it did shape me .
It did shape my life and I have to admit that .
I can't escape it .
And I think it 's much better to have these things out and being talked about then there to be smoulderings .
Narration
The reunion is already underway at Linda 's home in Sydney .
And Stephen knows fifty of his former followers are waiting inside .
Anita Chauvin
I 'm a bit of a stunned mullet .
Matt Taylor
You 'll be even more stunned the more you walk through there .
Stephen Carthew
It 's amazing .
Anita Chauvin
Hi Stephen .
How are you .
I do n't know whether to hug you or not .
Stephen Carthew
You can , it 's all right .
Linda Moctezuma
I just want to say welcome everybody to my home ...
Narration
The pleasantries are soon over ...
The Time has come to answer for the past
Stephen Carthew
Personally I want to apologise for my fanaticism .
Something born out of a sincere but misguided enthusiasm for the project we were undertaking .
The line between enthusiasm and fanaticism can be thin and I believed I crossed that line too often to used to the power and influence bestowed on me as a co-founder and vice principal of the Universal Brotherhood to try and keep people in the community when they were deliberating whether to stay or go , and that 's one of the saddest things for me is that in my enthusiasm I tried to interfere with people 's personal decision making process to be too much involved in snooping into others private lives was not helpful .
Fred did not have beliefs as we know , just truths ( laughter ) and Mary really was a mixed - up mystic in many ways but she was sincere and she was my teacher for many years and I just do n't want to demonise a person I spent ... so that 's that really
Matt Taylor
I think Stephen 's more a victim of this than anyone because he just gave himself to her completely .
And he started doing her dirty work .
And when he 's lost his temper that 's the little part of Stephen that wants to come back .
No you 're not .
Okay , be more harsh .
Susan Allwood
I could see that there were people at the community down at Balingup who were spoilt , protected , had servants .
Played these power games .
Got people to shut up by silence fasts , banned from the community .
Verne was n't allowed to communicate with his family .
People went crazy .
And they were dumped in the psychiatric department .
Doctor Jones got another one .
If I could see that - and attempted suicides apparently - how come you could n't see it .
Why could n't you see it as I saw it ?
Stephen Carthew
Because I was n't you , I was me and I was obviously misguided in many ways .
But - and there 's no real but ;
Susan Allwood
Well I have to try and find compassion in my heart for you because you hurt a lot of people .
Stephen Carthew
I appreciate it .
Thanks Susan .
Linda to Stephen
What people do n't realise is we actually like each other ;
Stephen to Susan
I 'm tempted to put my arm around you .
Susan Allwood
No do n't please .
I 'm trying to be forgiving ...
Susan Allwood
He 's not to blame for everything that happened .
We were a bunch of young kids who were trying to find an ideal lifestyle and a way forward and we were clumsy .
And everyone was trying to do their best .
And we stumbled and we fumbled along the way .
And we did some stupid things .
And we had some great times .
Matt Taylor
Good people can do some terrible things .
In fact people who think they 're morally superior , or good , or better than others , can treat the others despicably as we saw
Linda Moctezuma
He 's admitted to all that .
What more can he do ?
You can't change the past .
Stephen 's selling roses .
He 's no big deal any more .
He 's not going to do it again .
Stephen Carthew
Look selling is selling is selling is selling .
I 've sold insurance .
I 've sold financial advice since um since I was selling my religious wares in the community .
And so selling roses is much the same in a way .
It 's just a relationship between myself and the people I 'm selling with .
If I could sell Fred Robinson , I could sell roses ...
With the new year coming up , I 've been planning what I 'll be focusing on in 2009 .
I toyed with the idea of learning Haskell , but after watching these videos I could n't help but give Clojure a shot .
I 've played around with functional programming a bit in Elisp and Scheme and am familiar with the concepts , but I do n't think you can really get immersed in FP without the variables - are - immutable - by - default paradigm that the strict FP languages offer .
Clojure is a modern dialect of Lisp designed from the ground up with concurrency in mind .
First impressions about the language :
It 's fast .
Really fast .
[ 1 ]
Being hosted on the JVM means a language gets access to what seems to be the most advanced compiler and runtime known to mankind , regardless of the manifold shortcomings of Java™ the language .
When the normal speed is not enough , ( " No no ; Light Speed is too slow .
We need to go to Ludicrous Speed . " if I may mix metaphors ) it 's trivial to add hints that provide Java - native speeds .
The basic data structures Clojure provides are brilliant .
In Lisp , lists are composed by attaching a new head to an existing list .
The list structure is very flexible and has a convenient syntax , but vectors , hash - tables , and sets are much more efficient for many uses .
So in Common Lisp folks generally prototype applications using lists since they 're simple and convenient , and then switch over to more efficient structures once they have a better idea of the structure of the program .
The problem is that most of the fast structures do n't have convenient literal syntax , and they do n't use same APIs , so rewiring a program to use hash tables instead of associative lists can be a pretty significant change in most lisps .
Clojure has convenient literal syntax for all its basic data structures , and they have the property of being composable in the same way lists are , so hardly any change is necessary to switch between them .
They also offer lots of internal structure sharing so that creating new ones based on existing ( immutable ) ones is very cheap .
Clojure 's approach to concurrency centers on using immutable data structures , which makes most code safe for parallel execution by default .
When you do need to change state , it uses a Software Transactional Memory system to ensure that the changes are coordinated across threads .
This means you never have to write any locks manually , which is usually the most error - prone kind of concurrency strategy .
I have n't done much with the STM system yet , but being immutable by default means most confusing issues you run into with parallel code in other languages simply do not occur .
The biggest shortcoming of Clojure is easily its packaging and command - line interface .
Launching it from the shell involves simply invoking the java CLI launcher with the proper arguments ; there are no shell scripts in the distribution .
The problem with this is that you 're supposed to know your classpath up front .
When you 're dealing with lisp code , the classpath acts a lot like the load path in other lisps , but when you 're dealing with Java libraries you 're supposed to specify each jar file up front .
Libraries that you install into your system ( say via apt - get ) are not automatically visible to your programs ; you actually have to change your shell invocation to get access to them .
This is inconvenient and feels very awkward when you 're used to a good integrated package manager .
Fortunately this is not a problem intrinsic to the language ; it 's just what you get when you use a language that has n't been around very long .

Fortunately this is not a problem intrinsic to the language ; it 's just what you get when you use a language that has n't been around very long .
Making up for this shortcoming is the excellent SLIME interface .
Instead of using the command - line launcher , you get a much more integrated experience by connecting to a Lisp process using Emacs .
This lets you send new function definitions on the fly without reloading or restarting your whole process .
You can even use SLIME to debug production servers .
In the end , this more than makes up for the lousy command - line experience , but it takes a bit of getting used to if you 're more familiar developing with short - lived processes that run a few tests and then exit .
I 'm looking at using the Hashdot project to help improve the CLI situation .
We 're using it at work with JRuby , but it works with anything that 's JVM - hosted .
It gives you a better launcher and overall shell experience but also makes the process name look decent instead of the meaningless jumble of alphanumerics that java gives you out of the box and provides some dæmonization help .
As a way of diving in , I 'm using the Compojure web framework to port over my RailsDay 06 application .
Compojure is inspired by Sinatra [ 2 ] , and it seems to be a pretty slick way to put together web apps , though overall the Clojure community is not nearly as web - centric as Ruby's .
All in all , Clojure is an extremely impressive package .
Lisp has always offered significant advantages in expressivity and power , but it 's often come packaged in some rather disagreeable garb , like the ANSI Common Lisp standard that feels like it has n't changed since the mid-80's or Elisp 's lack of lexical scoping .
Things that only made sense back then are stuck with most present - day lisps , but Clojure is very refreshing in the way that it learns from history while still being able to break away from it in places where it needs to .

Why the survival of our Constitutional Democracy may hinge on factually justified criminal prosecutions of the Bush / Cheney cabal ...
[ UPDATED : Spanish prosecutors file complaint calling for arrest of Bush ' torture attorneys ' ]
Ernest A. Canning Byon 3/25/2009 , 5:05 am PT
Guest Blogged by Ernest A. Canning
" It will remain one of democracy 's best jokes that it provided its deadly enemies with the means by which it was destroyed . "
- Joseph Goebbels
* * *
Gradually , as the veil of secrecy lifts , a growing number of Americans are beginning to comprehend the lawlessness of the cabal which seized control of the White House in 2000 in what amounted to a judicially - aided coup d'etat . [i]
This lawlessness extended across the board .
It included the packing of federal agencies with lobbyists from industries they were designed to regulate , deception to take this nation into a war of choice , fraudulent no - bid contracts , torture , extraordinary rendition , warrantless NSA eavesdropping on the entire stream of domestic electronic communications , and , if Seymour Hersh 's recent allegations are accurate , the creation of a highly secretive " executive assassination ring " which reported only to Dick Cheney 's office and which had " been going into countries , not talking to the ambassador or the CIA station chief , and finding people and executing them and leaving . " [ ii ]
The reaction of leading Democratic politicians to these unprecedented high crimes has been ambivalent , at best .
Even before she assumed the role of Speaker , Nancy Pelosi announced that impeachment was " off - the - table , " thereby enabling two more years of executive lawlessness , not to mention the nation 's economic demise .
Pelosi evaded so much as mentioning their high crimes until February 2009 .
President Obama acknowledged that " no one is above the law , " but added that the focus of his administration is to look forward , not back .
There are fundamental deficiencies in the President 's formulation .
First , it is impossible to observe the rule of law without looking back .
It would make no sense , for example , for a man charged with armed robbery to come before a judge and say , " Well , the robbery was in the past .
You 've got to look forward .
I have every intention of abiding by the law in the future .
So why prosecute me ? "
Second , looking forward does not mean handling current events at the expense of the rule of law .
The point is to look far enough into the future to appreciate that the same people who brought us the last eight years of executive lawlessness could one day return to power ...
* * *
As noted by Scott Horton , citing remarks by " Professor Manfred Nowak , the United Nations Rapporteur responsible for torture , " existing treaties , which the president is obligated to enforce , mandate the commencement of " an investigation of Bush 's torture practices . "
Law Professor Jonathan
Turley , who concurs , notes that in calling for foreign prosecutions while protecting our own , " the U.S. is seen as a nation of hypocrites . "
Undoubtedly , both the Speaker and the President , a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School , are well aware of our treaty obligations .
They know that neither those obligations nor the rule of law can be satisfied by Senator Leahy 's proposed " truth commission . "
So why do they not insist on criminal investigations and , where factually warranted , prosecutions ?
Setting aside the exigencies of having to clean up the disasters the cabal left them , I believe the principle reason stems from a failure to comprehend the true nature of the American hard - right --- a billionaire - funded , well - organized group of anti-egalitarian ideologues .
It is a " revolutionary power " [ iii ] whose agenda is aimed at nothing less than smashing the framework of the American constitutional order .
Any doubts as to their radically subversive aims ended with the recent release of a series of Justice Department memos ...
* * *
In a 10/23/01 memo [ PDF ] , John
Yoo concluded that , in the wake of 9/11 , the president could deploy the military inside the U.S. and ignore all constitutional safeguards of individual liberty , including those provided by the 1st and 4th Amendments .
A 6/27/02 Yoo memo [ PDF ] asserted the president had the unchecked power to declare American citizens " enemy combatants " who could then be placed in " preventative detention " indefinitely without any right to challenge their detention in court .
These memos flow from the " Unitary Executive " theory first enunciated in 1986 by Samuel Alito when he was an attorney in the Reagan Justice Department .
It is a theory that is not merely radical but subversive to the rule of law .
It postulates that , despite a president 's solemn oath to enforce the law , a president is free to disregard any provision of the law which the president perceives to interfere with his executive powers .
Under " Unitary Executive " theory , a president is not simply above the law .
The president is the law .
As revealed by Jane Mayer in a New Yorker piece entitled " The Hidden Power , " it was a spin - off of this radical theory --- dubbed " the new paradigm " by Cheney 's chief of staff , David Addington --- which formed the quasi-legal basis for the nearly 1,200 presidential signing statements , torture , military tribunals that were straight out of Kafka and warrantless NSA eavesdropping on Americans .
The Mayer article reveals that Addington knew torture , often applied to innocent men , was ineffective , but he did n't care .
A Bush administration lawyer , quoted by Mayer , said : " Torture is n't important to Addington as a scientific matter , good or bad , or whether it works or not .
It 's about his philosophy of Presidential power .
He thinks that if the President wants torture he should get torture .
He always argued for ' maximum flexibility . ' "
Commenting on the scope of the Justice Department memos , attorney Scott Horton observed that John Yoo , the principal author of the memos , had " concluded that in wartime , the president was freed from the constraints of the Bill of Rights with respect to anything he chose to label as a counterterrorism operation inside the United States …
We may not have realized it at the time , but for the period from late 2001 - January 19 , 2009 , this country was a dictatorship . "
Horton overstated his case .
While the aim was dictatorship , several factors prevented its fruition : Alternative media countered the propaganda that flowed from the right - wing echo chamber ; hardworking bloggers like Brad Friedman exposed how easy it was to manipulate E-voting , and a slender Supreme Court majority in Hamdan ( 2006 ) slammed the administration 's effort to utilize an endless " global war on terror " [ iv ] as justification for unlimited presidential power .
The court found the military tribunals to be at odds with Common Article III of the Geneva Conventions .
In his concurring opinion , Justice Kennedy fired a shot across the bow of the U.S.S. " Unitary Executive , " noting that violations of Common Article III were war crimes within the meaning of the U.S. War Crimes statute ...
* * *
The loss of democracy was averted , but only because a right - wing project to remake the federal judiciary had not been completed .
It is a project in which , following the Senate 's 1987 rejection of Robert Bork , whose subversive views were well known , future nominees affiliated with Bork 's Federalist Society secured confirmation by evading hard questions designed to expose their radical legal theories .
Although seven of the nine Justices are Republican appointees , only four are connected to the Federalist Society .
All four are what Law Professor Cass Sunstein refers to as " radicals - in- robes . "
The Federalist Society is committed to all of the hard - right agenda , especially Unitary Executive theory .
Thanks to a bottling up of Clinton nominees in committee , the judicial project enjoyed greater success in the intermediate appellate courts where , by the end of 2005 , approximately 60 % of federal appellate judges were Republican appointees .
This was followed in 2006 by a Republican threat to end the right of a filibuster in order to secure the appointment of Bush 's most radical nominees .
The danger to democracy and the rule of law remains .
While the 2008 election placed Democrats in control of the executive and legislative branches , the right - wing judicial project continues with the circulation of a new Senate Republican letter which not only threatened to filibuster Obama 's appointees but suggested that " Obama begin by appointing holdover Bush nominees who were never confirmed by the Senate . "
Other set - backs ---
Nixon 's forced resignation ; Iran-Contra convictions --- were followed by Ford 's pardon of Nixon and G.H.W .
Bush 's pardoning of his Iran - Contra co-conspirators .
These pardons set a dangerous precedent - impunity - which emboldened the hard - right to return with a vengeance during the Bush / Cheney reign .
Unless the rule of law is restored and applied to the Bush / Cheney cabal , the next time around our constitutional democracy could be lost , forever .
The survival of the republic mandates nothing less than criminal investigations and prosecutions not only of war crimes and financial crimes but " crimes against democracy , " an apt phrase that should be applied to voter suppression , illegal manipulation of election results and the attempted misuse of the Justice Department to gain partisan advantage .
Note :
For those so inclined , they can petition Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a special prosecutor right here .
UPDATE 3/29/08 : A 98 - page complaint has been filed by Spanish prosecutors with Baltasar Garzón , the judge who ordered the arrest of the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet .
As reported by the New York Times today , the complaint is based on the Geneva Conventions and the 1984 Convention Against Torture .
" The move represents a step toward ascertaining the legal accountability of top Bush administration for allegations of torture … "
A Spanish " official said that it was ' highly probable ' that the case could lead to arrest warrants . "
The complaint specifically targets Alberto Gonzalez , Douglas J. Feith , John C. Yoo , Jay S. Bibee , David S. Addington and William J. Haynes II .
It is nothing short of shameful that a Spanish court has to step forward to carry out a task that our own Justice Department should be pursuing .

a couple years back , in a wheat field outside the town of Reardan , Washington , Fred Fleming spent an afternoon showing me just how hard it ’s gotten to save the world .
After decades as an unrepentant industrial farmer , the tall 59 - year - old realized that his standard practices were promoting erosion so severe that it was robbing him of several tons of soil per acre per year — his most important asset .
So in 2000 , he began to experiment with a gentler planting method known as no-till .
While traditional farmers plow their fields after each harvest , exposing the soil for easy replanting , Fleming leaves his soil and crop residue intact and uses a special machine to poke the seeds through the residue and into the soil .
The results are n’t pretty :
In winter , when his neighbors ’ fields are neat brown squares , Fleming ’s looks like a bedraggled lawn .
But by leaving the stalks and chaff on the field , Fleming has dramatically reduced erosion without hurting his wheat yields .
He has , in other words , figured out how to cut one of the more egregious external costs of farming while maintaining the high output necessary to feed a growing world — thus providing a glimpse of what a new , more sustainable food system might look like .
But there ’s a catch .
Because Fleming does n’t till his soil , his fields are gradually invaded by weeds , which he controls with “ judicious ” amounts of Roundup , the Monsanto herbicide that has become an icon of unsustainable agribusiness .
Fleming defends his approach : Because his herbicide dosages are small , and because he controls erosion , the total volume of “ farm chemistry , ” as he calls it , that leaches from his fields each year is far less than that from a conventional wheat operation .
None­theless , even judicious chemical use means
Fleming can’t charge the organic price premium or appeal to many of the conscientious shoppers who are supposed to be leading the food revolution .
At a recent conference on alternative farming , Fleming says , the organic farmers he met were “ polite — but they definitely gave me the cold shoulder . ”
That a recovering industrial farmer ca n’t get respect from the alternative food crowd may seem trivial , but Fleming ’s experience cuts to the very heart of the debate over how to fix our food system .
Nearly everyone agrees that we need new methods that produce more higher - quality calories using fewer resources , such as water or energy , and accruing fewer “ externals , ” such as pollution or unfair labor practices .
Where the consensus fails is over what should replace the bad old industrial system .
It ’s not that we lack enthusiasm — activist foodies represent one of the most potent market forces on the planet .
Unfortunately , a lot of that conscientious buying power is directed toward conceptions of sustainable food that may be out of date .
Think about it .
When most of us imagine what a sustainable food economy might look like , chances are we picture a variation on something that already exists — such as organic farming , or a network of local farms and farmers markets , or urban pea patches — only on a much larger scale .
The future of food , in other words , will be built from ideas and models that are familiar , relatively simple , and easily distilled into a buying decision :
Look for the right label , and you ’re done .
But that ’s not the reality .
Many of the familiar models do n’t work well on the scale required to feed billions of people .
Or they focus too narrowly on one issue ( salad greens that are organic but picked by exploited workers ) .
Or they work only in limited circumstances .
( A $ 4 heirloom tomato is hardly going to save the world . )
Such problems are n’t exactly news .
Organizations such as the W.K. Kellogg Foundation ( which despite its namesake is a real leader in food reform ) have long insisted that truly sustainable food must be not just ecologically benign , but also nutritious , produced without injustice , and affordable .
And yet , because concepts like local or organic dominate the alternative food sector , there is little room left for alternative models , such as Fred Fleming ’s , that might begin to bridge the gap between where our food system is today and where it needs to be .
And how big is that gap ?
Using the definition of sustainability above , about 2 percent of the food purchased in the United States qualifies .
Put another way , we ’re going to need not only new methods for producing food , but a whole new set of assumptions about what sustainability really means .
food is not simple .
To make it , you have to balance myriad variables — soil , water , and nutrients , of course , but also various social , political , and economic realities .
But because our consumer culture favors fixes that are fast and easy , our approaches toward food advocacy have been built around one or two dimensions of production , such as reducing energy use or eliminating pesticides , while overlooking factors that are harder to define ( and ditto to market ) , such as worker safety .
Consider our love affair with food miles .
In theory , locally grown foods have traveled shorter distances and thus represent less fuel use and lower carbon emissions — their resource footprint is smaller .
And yet , for all the benefits of a local diet , eating locally does n’t always translate into more sustainability .
Because the typical farmers market is supplied by dozens of different farms , each transporting its crops in a separate van or truck , a 20 - pound shopping basket of locally grown produce might actually represent a larger carbon footprint than the same volume of produce purchased at a chain retailer , which gets its produce en masse , via large trucks .
And for all our focus on the cost of moving food , transportation accounts for barely one - tenth of a food product ’s greenhouse gas emissions .
Far more significant is how the food was produced — its so - called resource intensity .
Certain foods , like meat and cheese , suck up so many resources regardless of where they ’re produced ( a pound of conventional grain - fed beef requires nearly a gallon of fuel and 5,169 gallons of water ) that you can shrink your footprint far more by changing what you eat , rather than where the food came from .
According to a 2008 report from Carnegie Mellon University , going meat - and dairyless one day a week is more environmentally beneficial than eating locally every single day .
Certainly , we can broaden concepts like food miles into more practical , ecologically honest terms .
To that end , the British retail chain Tesco is testing a new labeling system that discloses a product ’s life - cycle carbon emissions in a per-serving figure .
But even that focuses too much on a specific outcome , says Fred Kirschenmann , former director of the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture .
Real sustainability , he argues , is defined not by a food system ’s capacity to ensure happy workers or organic lima beans , but by whether the food system can sustain itself — that is , keep going , indefinitely , in a world of finite resources .
A truly sustainable food system is inherently resilient — more capable of self - correction and self - revitalization than its industrial rival .
Unfortunately , in the real world of farming , ideas like “ resilience ” must compete with realities like “ costs ” and “ profits , ” and producers and consumers alike gravitate toward simpler standards — even if those standards do n’t represent truly sustainable practices .
Worries Kirschenmann , “ We ’ve come to see sustainability as some kind of fixed prescription — if you just do these 10 things , you will be sustainable , and you wo n’t need to worry about it anymore . ”
This tendency to replace complexity with checklists is the hallmark of the alternative food sector .
Today ’s federal requirements for organic food , for example , only hint at the richness of the original concept , which encouraged farmers to not only forgo chemical fertilizers but also replenish soils on - site , using livestock manure or crop rotations .
The problem is that replenishing on - site is costly and time consuming .
As demand for organic has grown and farmers have been pushed to gain the same überefficiencies as their industrial rivals , more of them ( particularly those selling to chain groceries ) simply import manure from feedlots , sometimes hundreds of miles away .
Technically , these farms are still organic — they do n’t use chemical fertilizers .
But is something really sustainable if the natural fertilizer must travel such distances or come from feedlots , the apotheosis of unsafe , unsustainable production ?
Forget about food miles .
What about poop miles ?
before the thought of the carbon being emitted to move manure around the country gets you down , consider that on countless farms around the world , innovative farmers are reintegrating livestock and crop operations in closed - loop , self - sustaining operations .
On a seven - acre farm on the Japanese island of Kyushu , for example , polyculture pioneer Takao Furuno produces enough rice , duck meat , duck eggs , fish , and vegetables to feed 100 local families — producing , according to some measurements , an output that rivals an industrial monoculture farm’s .
But even in sustainable agriculture , there ’s no such thing as a free lunch .
To achieve such yields , polyculture requires far more intensive and continuous management than does its industrial counterpart .
Furuno , for example , must carefully monitor the performance of each crop and apply any new insights the following season — requirements that add considerably to a farmer ’s labor hours .
Matt Liebman , a polyculture expert at Iowa State University , says a reintegrated model can require almost twice the labor hours of a conventional agribusiness one .
This is a critical point :
The industrial agribusiness model of simplified monoculture became dominant not only because it gave us cheap food , but because it reflected a society that was becoming more urban .
Scaling up a model like Furuno ’s and re-creating a nation of small farmers might have appeal , particularly in the current labor market , but making it happen — that is , reversing the century - long shift away from farm labor — presents serious policy hurdles .
In fact , most of the familiar candidates for alternative food would have trouble operating on the kind of scale necessary for a world of 6.7 billion people .
Consider what it would take to make our farm system entirely organic .
The only reason industrial organic agriculture can get away with replenishing its soils with manure or by planting nitrogen - fixing cover crops is that the industry is so tiny — making up less than 3 percent of the US food supply ( and just 5.3 percent even in gung - ho green cultures like Austria ’s ) .
If we wanted to rid the world of synthetic fertilizer use — and assuming dietary habits remain constant — the extra land we ’d need for cover crops or forage ( to feed the animals to make the manure ) would more than double , possibly triple , the current area of farmland , according to Vaclav Smil , an environmental scientist at the University of Manitoba .
Such an expansion , Smil notes , “ would require complete elimination of all tropical rainforests , conversion of a large part of tropical and subtropical grasslands to cropland , and the return of a substantial share of the labor force to field farming — making this clearly only a theoretical notion . ”
That does n’t mean sustainable agriculture can’t happen .
But if we want to build large - scale capacity , we ’re going to need to broaden our definitions of sustainable practices .
Suppose that instead of insisting that farmers forgo synthetic fertilizers and pesticides , as current organic regulations do , our goal was to dramatically reduce the need .
We ’d probably be able to recruit more conventional farmers , many of whom regard the switch to organic as highly risky .
And even a small relaxation of the prohibition could open up massive potential for both crop yields and lower ecological impacts .
Liebman , the Iowa State professor , has developed a farm model that uses a multiyear crop rotation ( to fertilize naturally ) and controls weeds naturally with populations of mice and other “ seed predators ” that eat weed seeds before they sprout .
He uses herbicide and nitrogen fertilizers , but roughly 80 percent less than do conventional farms , while generating competitive , even improved , yields .
The local - food movement , too , must learn to bend .
The reality of 21st - century America is that food demand is centered in cities , while most arable land is in rural areas .
What open land remains around cities is so expensive that it either is out of reach for farmers or requires that farmers focus on high - end , high - margin products with little utility as mainstream foods .
Thus , although there is great potential to increase urban agriculture ( as we ’ll see in a minute ) , urbanites will always depend on rural areas for some of their food — especially given that by 2050 , 70 percent of the world ’s population is expected to live in or near cities .
Conversely , rural areas with good farm potential will always be able to outproduce local or even regional demand , and will remain dependent on other markets .
“ One farmer in Oregon with a few hundred acres can grow more pears than the entire state of Oregon eats , ” says Scott Exo , executive director of the Portland - based Food Alliance and an expert in the business challenges of sustainability .
“ Attention to the geographical origins of food is great , but you have to understand its economic limits . ”
In short , as important as the eat - local model is , it ’s going to have to work within other , much larger geographic systems — especially as these geographic mismatches are only getting larger .
Asia and Africa , which are rapidly overdrawing water tables , soils , and other assets essential to food production , will increasingly depend on fertile regions such as the American Midwest , whose superb soils and favorable climate can easily generate exportable surpluses — even without heavy doses of pesticides and fertilizer .
Put another way , if sustainability means food security for everyone , and not just for affluent nations , trading food over long distances is here to stay .
Yes , this pragmatism presents us with a potentially slippery slope :
On the question of trade , for example , we obviously need to rethink such practices as air freighting raspberries from Mexico or salmon from Chile .
And sustainability will also require a new trade model that is less vulnerable to the predatory speculation ( and protectionism ) that helped fuel last year ’s price spikes in rice and other grains .
As the New Yorker ‘s James Surowiecki points out , the marketization of agriculture has made the food system more efficient , but also more fragile .
Restoring stability and fairness will require more state regulation — and investment .
But the risks of pragmatism must be weighed against the risk of perfectionism .
We ca n’t wait for the perfect solution to emerge ; we need to start transforming the food system today — most probably with hybrid models , like Fleming ’s or Liebman ’s , that take the best of both alternative and mainstream technologies and acknowledge not only the complexity of true sustainability but the practical reality that the perfect is often the enemy of the good .
And as David Swenson , an Iowa State economist , notes , the alternative food sector already operates with a certain looseness to its standards .
Most organic farmers , for example , know that the legacy of conventional farming means that “ it is virtually impossible to keep certain nonorganic substances out of the production processes , including modified genes . ”
In practical terms , he says , organic is already “ mostly organic . ”
The challenge is finding some new standard that formally reflects this reality .
As this more pragmatic system emerges , it ’s a good bet that many of our romantic notions about alternative food production will be cast off .
The vision of a nation of small farms , for example , will give way to farms of multiple scales — small farms , but also massive agricultural operations that can produce bulk commodities like grain at the lowest possible cost .
Jettisoned , too , will be the postcard image of the small farm with its neat rows of crops , vegetables , and livestock as constraints on space and resources necessitate new and quite unfamiliar designs .
Proponents of vertical farms , for example , envision enormous glass - walled skyscrapers filled with vegetables , fruits , poultry , and aquaculture .
Towering as high as 30 stories , and based on soilless farming , these space - age facilities would epitomize efficiency and sustainability :
Water would be recycled , as would nutrients .
The closed environment would eliminate the need for pesticides .
Better still , the year - round , 24 - hour growing season would boost yields anywhere from 6 to 30 times those of conventional dirt farms .
Dickson Despommier , a Columbia University public health and microbiology professor who has championed vertical farming , claims that a single city block could feed 50,000 people .
Of course , Despommier ’s skyscraper farm would cost $ 200 million to build , and skeptics question whether even a highly productive vertical farm could be profitable enough to afford pricey urban real estate .
But more modest variants are already being rolled out — smaller vertical farms , as well as urban polyculture systems , such as Growing Power , a Milwaukee - based farm that houses more than 20,000 fruit and vegetable plants , aquaculture tanks , chickens , goats , ducks , and bees , all in a space twice the size of a supermarket .
And in the San Francisco area , Keith Agoada is launching Sky Vegetables , which partners with grocery stores to build rooftop hydroponic farms that can produce everything from lettuce to strawberries that are then sold in the stores below .
Like vertical farming , Agoada ’s model reduces transportation , distribution , and warehousing costs — but requires a much smaller investment , since the stores already have the land .
His plan is in the embryonic stage , but the potential here is massive :
The nation ’s grocery chains have about 32,500 acres of potential “ farmland ” ; a single Wal - Mart supercenter sits under more than four acres of rooftop — enough , according to Agoada , to produce 5.7 tons of wheat a year .
The upsides , Agoada believes , will win over even those foodies squeamish at the prospect of partnering with box stores .
in the end , winning over skeptical consumers wo n’t be enough .
Given the reality of what consumers can and ca n’t do , market liberalizers ’ enduring fantasy — that the collective power of tens of millions of conscientious shoppers will force suppliers to correct their bad practices — has been replaced by a grimmer understanding :
Until we can make the market see all the costs of unsustainable farming , and until we learn how to temper its obsessive focus on ever greater efficiencies , market - driven sustainability will fail .
This reality became evident last August , after Whole Foods recalled ground beef due to an E. coli scare .
The problem was that Whole Foods ’ supplier , Coleman Natural Beef , processed its meat at Nebraska Beef , a large , low - cost plant infamous for health violations ( including a 5 - million - pound beef recall in July for E. coli ) .
In essence , Whole Foods sought to create a new value — sustainability — without changing the supply chain .
If we ’re going to ask the market to pull in a new direction , we ’ll need to give it new rules and incentives .
That means our broader food standards , but it also means money — a massive increase in food research .
( Today , the fraction of the federal research budget spent on anything remotely resembling alternative agriculture is less than 1 percent — and most of that is sucked up by the organic sector . )
And , yes , it means more farm subsidies :
The reason federal farm subsidies are regarded as anti-sustainability is mainly because they support the wrong kind of farming .
But if we want the right kind of farming , we ’re going to have to support those farmers willing to risk trying a new model .
For example , one reason farmers prefer labor - saving monoculture is that it frees them to take an off - farm job , which for many is the only way to get health insurance .
Thus , the simplest way to encourage sustainable farming might be offering a subsidy for affordable health care .
We ’ll also need potent new incentives on the demand side of the equation .
Sustainable food products make up only about 2 percent of our food supply in no small part because consumer demand is soft .
Yes , some will pay extra for organic or local food .
But for most consumers , the costs quickly exceed the tangible benefits — especially as food prices have climbed .
Given that we ’re not seeing spontaneous consumer demand ( even after decades of consumer education by advocacy groups ) , we must create it via government procurement programs .
Federal agencies and food programs are among the biggest purchasers of food in the world .
If they did n’t buy solely from the lowest - cost bidder , as they ’re now required to , but could instead source from local or organic producers , or farmers practicing polyculture , this massive new customer would remake American agriculture in a heartbeat .
“ If someone like the Department of Defense or even the VA hospitals changed how they purchased , it would be huge , ” says Ferd Hoefner , policy director for the Sustainable Agriculture Coalition .
But would it be sufficient ?
Or does sustainable food simply cost too much to be feasible ?
After all , industrial food is cheap not only because of the efficiencies of scale and technologies , but also because the industrial system is so good at ignoring , or externalizing , costs such as ecological degradation or poor nutrition or underpaid labor .
According to the Union of Concerned Scientists , the hidden costs of conventional meat production alone are huge — each year , salmonella outbreaks cost an estimated $ 2.5 billion ; properly cleaning up manure leaks would cost at least $ 4 billion .
If our food system reinternalizes such costs — say , by shifting from feedlots to a less concentrated free - range model — food prices will rise .
Grass - fed cattle can take twice as long to reach slaughter weight as corn-fed cattle and require more pastureland at a time when pastureland is in short supply — which is why grass - fed beef costs about 30 percent more than conventional beef .
Does that matter ?
Most Americans could afford to spend more for their food — or could afford to eat less of the resource - intensive foods .
It ’s no coincidence that Americans , who spend less than a dime of every dollar on food — the least in the world — also consume about 200 pounds of meat per capita each year — the most in the world .
But in many other parts of the world , spending more on food or cutting back on meat are n’t practical or ethical options ; nor are investing in vertical farms , store - top produce , or many of the other more Earth - friendly but more capital - intensive farming technologies .
As Iowa State ’s Liebman notes , the resources for sustainable farming — not only adequate soil and water , but access to capital , technology , and market — are n’t distributed fairly or evenly , which means the chances for “ finding solutions in Iowa are probably a lot higher than in the Sahel . ”
This disparity underlines what ultimately may be the most critical question about the future of food .
We may be certain that the existing food system is broken .
We may also be confident that we can develop a more sustainable replacement .
What we ’re still waiting to find out is whether sustainability is something we ’ll all benefit from , or whether it , too , will go to the highest bidder .
The U.S. attorney in Los Angeles sent a confidential memo to prosecutors last week ordering them to stop filing charges against medical marijuana dispensaries , then abruptly lifted the ban on Friday , according to sources familiar with the developments .
U.S. Atty .
Thomas P. O’Brien declined comment on what prompted him to issue the directive or to later rescind it .
O’Brien ’s decision to temporarily halt the prosecutions came two days after remarks by Atty .
Gen. Eric Holder , who seemed to imply at a Washington , D.C. , press conference that medical marijuana prosecutions would not be a priority for the Justice Department under President Obama .
A Justice Department official said Friday that the attorney general did not direct O’Brien or any other U.S. attorney to alter policies regarding the prosecution of such cases .

O’Brien ’s initial order was delivered in a memo by Christine Ewell , head of the U.S. attorney ’s criminal division , according to three sources who read the document , which was distributed by e-mail on Feb. 27 .
In addition to being told to stop filing new cases , prosecutors were instructed to refrain from issuing subpoenas or applying for search warrants in pending cases , said the sources , who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter .
In fact , a few hours after the memo was circulated , Ewell sent out another e-mail admonishing prosecutors not to discuss the contents of the memo with anyone outside the U.S. attorney ’s office , the sources said .
Another e-mail came out Friday instructing prosecutors to resume work on medical marijuana cases .
Despite the reversal , news of the temporary ban is likely to spark interest amid the ongoing national debate over medical marijuana .
Thirteen states , including California , allow for the cultivation , use and sale of doctor - prescribed medical marijuana under certain conditions , according to the Marijuana Policy Project , an organization that supports the legalization of the drug .
Federal law , which trumps those of the states , bans the drug altogether .
As a result , operators of dispensaries in California and elsewhere who maintain they were operating under state law have been raided by the Drug Enforcement Administration and charged under federal drug laws .

Such prosecutions have been controversial , with patients and supporters of the dispensaries complaining that operators embraced by their own communities were unfairly targeted .
Thom Mrozek , a spokesman for O’Brien , has said that prosecutors target people they consider egregious offenders , such as those accused of selling drugs to minors or proprietors with past drug convictions .
One high - profile case went to trial in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles last summer .
Charles Lynch , who sought and received the blessing of elected officials in Morro Bay before opening a dispensary in that Central Coast community in 2006 , was charged with distributing more than 100 kilos of marijuana .
At trial , prosecutors portrayed Lynch , 47 , as a common drug dealer who sold dope to minors and toted around a backpack stuffed with cash .
Lynch and his lawyers hoped to mount a defense based on the assertion that he was providing a legitimate service to cancer patients and other severely ill people .
But they were limited in doing so because the U.S. Supreme Court has concluded that because federal law trumps those of the states , why drugs are being distributed is irrelevant .

Jurors convicted Lynch on five counts , but the jury forewoman said it was not easy to do so .
“ We all felt Mr. Lynch intended well , ” Kitty Meese said after the verdict in August .
“ It was a tough decision for all of us because the state law and the federal law are at odds . ”
Lynch , who is to be sentenced later this month , is facing a mandatory minimum of five years in federal prison .
His case has become something of a cause celebre among medical marijuana advocates .
Holder was asked about medical marijuana at a Feb. 25 press conference after the arrests of more than 50 alleged members of Mexico ’s Sinaloa drug cartel .
Specifically , he was asked whether the DEA would continue raiding medical marijuana dispensaries under Obama ’s administration .
Advertisement
He did not answer the question directly but said : “ What the President said during [ the ] campaign . . . is now American policy . ”
Obama was asked about the topic numerous times during the campaign and responded with varying levels of specificity .
Generally speaking , the campaign ’s position was that DEA raids would not be a high priority in states with their own medical marijuana laws on the books .
“ The president believes that federal resources should not be used to circumvent state laws , and as he continues to appoint senior leadership to fill out the ranks of the federal government , he expects them to review their policies with that in mind , ” Nick Shapiro , a White House spokesman , told the Washington Times last month .
Shapiro declined to elaborate on Friday .
Alex Capron , a professor of law and medicine at USC , said the debate about medical marijuana centers on whether “ it is something that is part of the doctor - patient relationship or something where the authorities have an obligation to protect the community from a dangerous drug . ”

He added that he was n’t surprised that O’Brien would want to deliberate over his office ’s policy on such a matter in private .

WASHINGTON  Outlining a far - reaching proposal on Thursday to rebuild the nation ’s broken system of financial regulation , the Treasury secretary , Timothy F. Geithner , fired the opening salvo in what is likely to be a marathon battle .
“ Our system failed in fundamental ways , ” Mr. Geithner told the House Financial Services Committee .
“ To address this will require comprehensive reform .
Not modest repairs at the margin , but new rules of the game . ”
On the surface , both the lawmakers who listened to the Treasury secretary and the financial industry ’s lobbying groups made it sound as if they completely agreed with Mr. Geithner ’s call for what he described as “ better , smarter tougher regulation . ”
But in fact industry groups are already mobilizing to block restrictions they oppose and win new protections they have wanted for years .
Even though Mr. Geithner carefully avoided specific details , laying out mostly broad principles for overhauling the system , financial industry groups are identifying issues they plan to pursue and lining up well - connected lobbyists and publicists to help make their cases .
First for the good news : Pakistan is not about to explode .
The Islamic militants are not going to take power tomorrow ; the nuclear weapons are not about to be trafficked to al - Qaida ; the army is not about to send the Afghan Taliban to invade India ; a civil war is unlikely .
The bad news is that Pakistan poses us questions that are much more profound than those we would face if this nation of 170 m , the world 's second biggest Muslim state , were simply a failed state .
If Pakistan collapsed , we would be faced by a serious security challenge .
But the resilience of Pakistan and the nation 's continuing collective refusal to do what the west would like it to together pose questions with implications far beyond simple security concerns .
They are about our ability to influence events in far - off places , our capacity to analyse and understand the behaviour and perceived interests of other nations and cultures , about our ability to deal with difference , about how we see the world .
Pakistan has very grave problems .
In the last two years , I have reported on bloody ethnic and political riots , on violent demonstrations , from the front line of a vicious war against radical Islamic insurgents .
I spent a day with Benazir Bhutto a week before she was assassinated and covered the series of murderous attacks committed at home and abroad by militant groups based in Pakistan with shadowy connections to its security services .
There is an economic crisis and social problems - illiteracy , domestic violence , drug addiction - of grotesque proportions .
Osama bin Laden is probably on Pakistani soil .
For many developing nations , all this would signal the state 's total disintegration .
This partly explains why Pakistan 's collapse is so often predicted .
The nation 's meltdown was forecast when its eastern half seceded to become Bangladesh in 1971 , during the violence that preceded General Zia ul - Haq 's coup in 1977 , when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan , when Zia was killed in 1988 , during the horrific sectarian violence of the early Nineties , through sundry ethnic insurgencies , after 9/11 , after the 2007 death of Bhutto and now after yet another political crisis .
These predictions have been consistently proved wrong .
The most recent will be too .
Yesterday , tempers were already calming .
Some of the perpetual international hysteria is stoked by the Pakistanis themselves .
Successive governments have perfected the art of negotiating by pointing a gun to their own heads .
They know that their nation 's strategic importance guarantees the financial life support they need from the international community .
More broadly , our understanding of Pakistan is skewed .
This is in part due to centuries of historical baggage .
Though few would quote Emile Zola on contemporary France , Winston Churchill , who as a young man fought on the North - West Frontier , is regularly cited to explain today 's insurgency .
This legacy also includes stereotypes of " Mad Mullahs " running amok , an image fuelled by television footage that highlights ranting demonstrators from Pakistan 's Islamist parties though they have never won more than 14 % in an election .
For many Britons , Pakistan represents " the other " - chaotic , distant , exotic , dirty , hot , fanatical and threatening .
Yet at the same time , Pakistan seems very familiar .
There is the English language , cricket , kebabs and curries and figures such as Imran Khan .
There are a million - odd Britons of Pakistani - descent who over four decades have largely integrated far better in the UK than often suggested .
It is the tension between these two largely imaginary Pakistans that leads to such strong reactions in Britain .
We see the country as plunged in a struggle between the frighteningly foreign and the familiar , between fanaticism and western democracy , values , our vision of the world and how it should be ordered .
Yet while we are fretting about Pakistan 's imminent disintegration , we are blind to the really important change .
Recent years have seen the consolidation of a new Pakistani identity between these two extremes .
It is nationalist , conservative in religious and social terms and much more aggressive in asserting what are seen , rightly or wrongly , as local " Pakistani " interests .
It is a mix of patriotic chauvinism and moderate Islamism that is currently heavily informed by a distorted view of the world sadly all too familiar across the entire Muslim world .
This means that for many Pakistanis , the west is rapacious and hostile .
Admiration for the British and desire for holidays in London have been replaced by a view of the UK as " America 's poodle " and dreams of Dubai or Malaysia .
The 9/11 attacks are seen , even by senior army officers , as a put - up job by Mossad , the CIA or both .
The Indians , the old enemy , are seen as running riot in Afghanistan where the Taliban are " freedom fighters " .
AQ Khan , the nuclear scientist seen as a bomb - selling criminal by the West , is a hero .
Democracy is seen as the best system , but only if democracy results in governments that take decisions that reflect the sentiments of most Pakistanis , not just those of the Anglophone , westernised elite among whom western policy - makers , politicians and journalists tend to chose their interlocutors .
This view of the world is most common among the new , urban middle classes in Pakistan , much larger after a decade of fast and uneven economic growth .
It is this class that provides the bulk of the country 's military officers and bureaucrats .
This in part explains the Pakistani security establishment 's dogged support for elements within the Taliban .
The infamous ISI spy agency is largely staffed by soldiers and the army is a reflection of society .
For the ISI , as for many Pakistanis , supporting certain insurgent factions in Afghanistan is seen as the rational choice .
If this trend continues , it poses us problems rather different from those posed by a failed state .
Instead , you have a nuclear armed nation with a large population that is increasingly vocal and which sees the world very differently from us .
We face a related problem in Afghanistan where we are still hoping to build the state we want the Afghans to want , rather than the state that they actually want .
Ask many
Afghans which state they hope their own will resemble in a few decades and the answer is " Iran " .
Dozens of interviews with senior western generals , diplomats and officials in Kabul last week have shown me how deeply the years of conflict and " nation - building " have dented confidence in our ability to transplant western values .
Our interest in Afghanistan has been reduced to preventing it from becoming a platform for threats to the west .
In Afghanistan , as in Iraq , the west has glimpsed the limits to its power and to the supposedly universal attraction of its values .
The west 's dreams of a comfortable post - Cold War era have been rudely shaken .
We have been forced reluctantly to accept the independence and influence of China and Russia .
These are countries that we recognise as difficult international actors pursuing agendas popular with substantial proportions of their citizens .
Other countries , particularly those less troubled than Pakistan or Afghanistan , are likely soon to join that list .
This poses a critical challenge in foreign policy .
Worrying about the imminent collapse of Pakistan is not going to help us find answers to the really difficult questions that Pakistan poses .

Enjoy !
New action figures for the Doctor Who Classic line have been announced !
These figures are awesome , but sadly they are only going to be available in the United States as a San Diego Comic Con exclusive .
There will be some available for purchase online around the same time , but I expect they will sell out immediately .
Hopefully they ’ll release some version of the characters through the normal Doctor Who Classics line that is more widely available .
You can read further information at Outpost Gallifrey .
And if you live in the U.K. , you can preorder these figures now from Forbidden Planet International .
My thanks to the Voice of the Red Skull for giving me a heads - up about these figures .
First Doctor & Black Dalek – Black & White
Product descriptions from Forbidden Planet International :
This is the first appearance of the first Doctor , William Hartnell as part of Character Options classic figure series .
It was Hartnell who brought the Doctor to our screens in that very first broadcast on 23rd November 1963 .
At the time the show was shown in black and white and this very limited ‘ variant edition ’ of the figures stick to a black and white color scheme .
The Dalek is from the ‘’ Dalek Invasion of Earth ’ ( Dec 1964 ) storyline and varies most conspicuously from later versions by the double neck banding and the energy dish collecting aerial on their rear .
The Black Dalek was designated by rank as the ‘ Supreme Controller ’ .
First Doctor & Black Dalek – Color
The color used on these figures are authenticated by the many existing ‘ behind the scene ’ shots .
Second Doctor & Telos Cyberman – Black & White
This is the first appearance of the second Doctor , Patrick Troughton as part of Character Options classic figure series .
Troughton was the first actor to experience the Doctor ’s regeneration in the Cybermen storyline ‘ The Tenth Planet ’ first broadcast on 29th October 1966 . .
At the time the show was shown in black and white and this very limited ‘ variant edition ’ of the figures stick to a black and white color scheme .
The Cyberman is the version which appears , discovered in the cyber - tombs of the planet Telos , in the episode ‘ The Tomb of the Cybermen ’ ( Sept 1967 ) .
Second Doctor & Telos Cyberman – Color
Sixth Doctor In Real Time Blue Coat
This alternative costume was most visibly used in the BBC webcast ‘ Real Time ’ ( having previously appeared on a few book and audio book covers ) .
It varies vastly from the gaudy coat of many colors normally worn by Colin Baker ’s sixth Doctor whilst retaining some design elements including the dandy ’s tie and question mark shirt collar .
For many fans this has become almost the preferred costume with it ’s more muted , less frivolous , colourways .
These figures are SO cool !
I really hope some variant of them becomes available through the normal “ Doctor Who Classics ” line of figures .
I must have a Troughton figure !!!
And though they were built for utilitarian purposes , barns became objects of beauty to artists and architects .
European architects of the early 20th century became enamored with the spare construction of American barns , said Sandy Isenstadt , a professor of modern architecture at Yale .
“ To them , barns and silos represented exactly the sort of strict functional thinking , without concern for aesthetics , that a new architecture might be founded upon , ” he said .
“ So they saw such buildings as beautiful  a beauty that descends from attention to function rather than from concern for appearance . ”
Wendell Minor , an artist who lives in Washington , Conn. , and has used many of Connecticut ’s barns in his illustrations  including one in a United States Postal Service postcard series  compares barns to lighthouses .
“ They have the same strong visual elements , ” he said .
“ People are nostalgic for them in the same way they are for lighthouses . ”
Most people recognize that barns are worth saving because they give the state part of its appeal , preservationists say .
Kent Gilyard , 68 , a barn restorer who owns two 19th - century barns in Litchfield , said there is something about them that just makes people feel good .
“ Maybe it reminds them of a simpler time , even though farming was n’t simple , ” he said .
The grant project , funded through the Connecticut General Assembly , is intended to help property owners understand that “ barns and outbuildings do not necessarily have to be torn down , ” said Mr. Levine .

Mr. Averill , a ninth - generation farmer , operates his apple orchard on land that his ancestors bought from the Indians in 1746 .
Even though he spent his childhood milking cows and building forts out of hay bales , he said , he sometimes wonders whether building a new barn would not be easier than fixing an old one .
One side of his barn buckles out , possibly the result of a shifting stone foundation , he said .
What happened before the Big Bang ?

It shows stars in the Globular Star cluster NGC 6397 , which is one of the closest to us , about 8500 light years from the Earth .

The term Big Bang has several layers of meaning .
What most astronomers mean when they refer to a Big Bang theory of the Universe is the idea that the Universe is expanding , as Edwin Hubble first discovered in the 1920s — distant galaxy clusters are moving away from one another with ever increasing speed .
This implies that in the past things in the Universe were closer together , the Universe was more compressed , hotter and denser , and that in the future it will become even less hot and dense .
[ Puzzled by the idea of an expanding Universe ?
See the box below for Barrow 's explanation . ]
But within this picture there are all sorts of options .
One is that as you go back into the past , following the Universe to earlier and earlier times when it was hotter and denser , you reach some special time when , if you believe your equations , density and temperature were infinite .
Einstein 's theory of gravity gives you a way of calculating when this infinite state occurred : only 13.7 billion years ago .
This is very striking , because you can walk around places in Scandinavia and Scotland and pick up rocks that are 3 billion years old .
We believe that the whole solar system is only about 4.6 billion years old .
So we 're apparently very close to what seems to be the beginning of everything .
The expanding Universe Many people think of the expansion of the Universe like an explosion , so it must have a centre and there must be an edge .
If we see everything expanding around us in the Universe , does n't this mean that we 're at its centre ?
But there is no centre of the Universe and there is no edge of expansion .
The easy case to visualise is that of an infinite Universe .
Let 's think of a two - dimensional Universe , a rubber sheet that goes on infinitely in each direction .
If this infinite sheet was being stretched , then no matter where you stood on it , you 'd see everything expanding away from you .
You could draw a circle around yourself which describes the edge of your observable universe — the radius of that circle would be the distance that light has been able to travel since the sheet started expanding .
We call that our horizon .
It 's not that there is no sheet beyond the boundary of that circle , it 's just that we can't see it yet .
But what if the Universe is finite ?
If you pick up a flat piece of paper , it seems obvious that there has to be a centre and an edge .
But the Universe is all there is .
It 's not an explosion and it's not expanding into something .
So a two - dimensional Universe can't be flat like a piece of paper .
But it can be like the surface of a sphere .
It 's finite — if you wanted to paint that surface you 'd need only a finite amount of paint — but if you were an ant walking around on it , you 'd never run into an edge .
So a curved surface can be finite but have no edge .
This is how we should think of a finite expanding Universe .
If we inflate a balloon marked with crosses , all the crosses move away from each other as the balloon expands .
If you were sitting on the balloon , you 'd see all the crosses moving away from you .
The centre of the expansion does not lie on the balloon .
And this is where scientists start to worry .
A prediction of something infinite is often a sign that the theory you are using to make that prediction has reached the limits of its applicability .
For example , imagine you are an aerodynamicist wanting to predict the speed of an air flow .
If your model is very simple , for example if it ignores the friction of the air , then it might predict that something changes infinitely quickly in a finite time .
But no aerodynamicist would believe that this is what really happens .
They would take that prediction as an indication that you have to go back to square one and make your model a little bit better , for example by introducing the friction of air .
When you then solve the equations you will find that things change very , very quickly , but not infinitely quickly .
So what cosmologists are working very keenly on today is a possible extension of Einstein 's theory of gravity , one which includes quantum theory , which can give a more accurate description of the apparent beginning of the Universe .
Nobody agrees on exactly how to do this : it 's right on the edge of current research .
Some theories predict that the Universe does n't have a beginning at all , but that if you follow it backward in time , it eventually bounces , almost like a ball , into a previous state in which it was contracting .
The Universe may behave cyclically — contracting , expanding and contracting again — or it may be that it bounced into expansion only once and will keep on expanding forever .
Another possibility is that the Universe began in some rather uninteresting stationary state , and then started to expand due to the effect of quantum fluctuations .
In that scenario , the expansion has a beginning , but the Universe itself does n't necessarily have one .
The inflationary universe
There are also much more exotic possibilities which have come to light in the last ten years , and they are usually associated with the idea of a multiverse .
Our Universe might be one of many possible universes .
Or , more specifically , our part of the Universe might be behaving differently to other parts of the Universe .
Imagine a Universe which is expanding in different ways in different places .
In some places it 's rather cool , like the part that we live in , but elsewhere it may be much hotter .
In some parts it may be collapsing , rather than expanding .
If the Universe is infinite , there is no end to the amount of variation possible .
Inflation predicts that the whole part of the Universe that is visible to us today ( about 3 × 1027 cm in radius ) has expanded from a region that was once small enough for light signals to travel across it ( 3 × 10 - 25 cm at a time of 1035 seconds ) .
If inflation did not occur , then the rate of expansion is too slow for this to happen .
The visible part of the Universe would then have expanded from a region that is too large for light signals to create similar properties in different parts of the visible Universe today , as observed .
This type of scenario has emerged from a theory called the inflationary universe , which explains rather well many of the properties that we observe our visible part of the Universe to have .
The theory requires that in the past , the very , very distant past , there was a short period of time when the expansion of the Universe accelerated .
This results in a rate of expansion very close to the one we see today , and it also makes rather definite predictions about the little fluctuations and differences in density and temperature we should observe today , some of which turned into galaxies and stars .
We can test this theory using satellite observations and it has survived all the tests that we have set it so far : there is very good agreement between observation and theory .
This graph shows the good agreement of predictions of the inflation theory and observations .
The magnitude of temperature variations in the background radiation from the early Universe is plotted vertically against the multipole moment ( related to the angular separation in the sky — we go from large separations to small ones as we go from left to right along the axis .
The highest peak is near one degree ) .
The solid line represents the prediction of the simplest inflationary model and the data points are from satellites and ground - based experiments .
Feeling dizzy ?
Why not listen to this interview in our podcast
But there is an extension to the inflation theory that is much more controversial .
It says that the early burst of accelerated expansion should have affected different parts of the Universe in different ways .
If we could see far enough into the Universe , we would eventually see regions of different density , with different structure to what we see in our own neighbourhood ( and our neighbourhood is around 14 billion light years in size ) , that resulted from the accelerated expansion of our part of the early Universe .
The bubble multiverse
The next aspect of the inflation theory , which was discovered by cosmologists , is that the early surge of expansion can become self - perpetuating in each piece of the Universe .
So a region will surge , and within it there will be another little piece that suddenly surges again .
It is like a foam of bubbles where each bubble creates more bubbles that expand too .
You should think of each bubble in the foam as being rather like the whole of our visible part of our Universe today .
If we could see outside of our bubble , we would see into another bubble in the foam where conditions are different .
An inflating bubble multiverse .
One rather shocking thing about this bubble making is that the whole process need not have a beginning or an end .
In fact , the equations that describe it predict that it does n't have an end , and almost certainly does n't have a beginning .
But each individual bubble , like the one we 're in , does have a beginning , and it may also have an end .
Suddenly the question of whether the Universe has a beginning has a slightly more complicated answer .
It is a bit like the life time of the human race : each individual has a particular finite life time , but the age of the race as a whole is much greater .
So the new possibility that has emerged is that the Universe may become very different if we look at it on a large enough scale , and that its history is very complicated .
Before the apparent beginning of our part of the Universe , there would have been a quantum " foam " which was missing our bubble , but had many others that may have been very different in structure .
I believe that the inflationary universe is a theory that contains a large part of the truth , because its predictions fit our observations extremely well .
So we have some confidence that our bit of the Universe underwent this surge in expansion .
Our bubble
This computer simulation illustrates the self - perpetuating nature of inflation .
The formation of a hill in the beginning of the simulation illustrates the onset of inflation .
After a while , individual peaks form on top of the first hill , and later themselves grow further peaks , and so on , illustrating how inflating bubbles form inside inflating bubbles .
Simulation courtesy Andrei Linde .
The theory of the bubble Universe predicts that inflated bubbles may be very different from each other , and there are only some bubbles that we could possibly exist in .
For example , those that only last for a second are no good : we can only be in a rather long - lived bubble , which lasts for at least ten billion years and so gets really big .
This is because there needs to be time for stars to form , and for stars to provide elements like carbon , nitrogen and oxygen in order to enable such a complex thing as life to evolve .
We have to be in a big , rather old , and cold bubble .
There is an interesting unsolved problem , which is to try and work out the probability that you get bubbles with particular characteristics .
What 's the likelihood that you get a big , old bubble of the sort you need for life ?
Is it fantastically improbable , is it really fairly probable , or just in between ?
This is one of these problems that we hope will soon be solved .
It 's really a mathematical problem to formulate probability in this cosmological situation .
As a cosmologist , what would Barrow himself like to know about the Universe ?
A few years ago we found out that today the expansion of the Universe is accelerating .
This is how it would have behaved during the early surge of inflation .
It 's almost as if the Universe is inflating again .
The current surge of acceleration began around 4.5 billion years ago , coincidentally at a similar time to when the solar system formed .
It was lucky it did n't begin to accelerate much earlier , or there would n't be any stars or galaxies because they cannot condense out of the expanding Universe once it starts to accelerate : matter is separating too fast for gravity to pull it back into lumps .
So the big mysteries are why the Universe 's expansion began to accelerate at that time , and what is the form of energy , known as dark energy , which is responsible for the acceleration .
It 's a form of energy that has a repulsive gravitational effect .
This is clearly happening in the Universe today , but we have no idea of the exact identity of this dark energy , and why it 's come into play late in the history of the Universe .
If it is always going to be around , then the Universe 's expansion will keep accelerating forever .
The Universe will never collapse back to a big crunch .
The Universe will just keep getting cooler , and more and more boring , and everything will eventually die out .
So identifying this dark energy is a rather crucial point in our understanding of the future of the Universe .
It 's a huge gap in our understanding because 72 % of the energy in the Universe is dark energy .
Of the rest , 4 % is ordinary matter , the stuff that we are made of , and that shining stars are made of .
The remaining 24 % is what 's called dark matter : this consists of stars that do n't shine in the dark , and possibly elementary particles like neutrinos .
Dark matter is a puzzle , but not a mystery like dark energy .
We hope that the Large Hadron Collider at CERN will help us identify the particles that make up the dark matter , but we have no good ideas about the dark energy .
Other bubbles
Another interesting question is how we could ever test whether all the other bubbles exist .
We can't see them because they 're beyond the visible horizon of the Universe 14 billion light years away .
This is a philosophical question , almost like a science - fiction scenario .
Since we can't see the other bubbles , should we allow them to be part of our picture of the Universe at all ?
In the 1930s there was a great debate about whether the philosophy of science should be based upon verification : you make a prediction and then you test by experiment if you can verify it and the theory .
This approach soon went out of favour : if your theory predicts that all apples are green , and you only find green apples , then this does n't prove that your theory is correct .
There may be some other explanation , rather different from your theory , for why apples all seem to be green , or you may not have run into red apples yet .
Philosophers like Karl Popper instead focused on falsification .
You falsify your theory , if you find a red apple ; then you can definitely rule it out , and maybe you can rule out lots of other theories too .
We can't verify the existence of other bubbles , but it may still be possible to falsify the theory .
If there are other bubbles , then there might be a particular observable feature , which is the same in each .
Then , if you did n't observe this feature in our bubble , the theory would be falsified .
So although we can't see the other bubbles , it 's still conceivable that we could test our theory , because it might say things about all bubbles .
That may be the best that we can hope for .

[ Python - Dev ] Challenge : Please break this !
( was : Reviving restricted mode )
Hey all ,
As an attempt to convince everyone of the merits of my functions - based approach to security , I 've come up with a simple challenge .
I 've attached it as safelite .
py
The challenge is simple : * Open a fresh Python interpreter * Do : >>> from safelite import FileReader *
You can use FileReader to read files on your filesystem *
Now find a way to * write * to the filesystem from your interpreter
Please note that the aim of this is n't to protect Python against crashes / segfaults or exhaustion of resources attacks , so those do n't count .
I 'm keen to know your experiences even if you do n't manage to write to the filesystem -- and especially if you do !
Dinner and drinks on me for an evening -- when you are next in London or I am in your town -- to the first person who manages to break safelite .py and write to the filesystem .
Good luck and thanks ! =) >
If you block __closure__ and __globals__ on function objects you will get a > semblance of a private namespace .
That way you might ( I have not thought > this one through like securing the interpreter for embedding ) be able to get > what you need to safely pass in Python code through the globals of the code > being executed .
Brett , this is exactly what I do .
You also need to restrict func_code .
The patch is simply for closing the other loopholes : type.__subclasses__ , GeneratorType.gi_frame and gi_code .
All possible in a patch of 6 lines of code thanks to Python 's existing restricted framework in the interpreter .
Please review and accept =) * http://codereview.appspot.com/20051 * http://codereview.appspot.com/21051

They ’re bigger , they ’re bolder , and soon they ’ll be covering up large swaths of some of your favorite Web pages .
The Online Publishers Assn. on Tuesday released several new in - your - face advertising formats designed to be both more obtrusive and interactive .
Twenty - seven top Internet publishers -- including the New York Times , CNN , CBS Interactive , ESPN and the Wall Street Journal -- say they ’ll try the supersize ads in an attempt to get the attention of Web surfers who have learned to ignore banners .
The websites , which collectively reach two - thirds of the U.S. Internet audience , must walk a fine line so they do n’t bug visitors so much that they stop returning .
Advertisement
“ Studies show we ignore banner ads , ” said Jose Castillo , a new media consultant in Johnson City , Tenn .
“ Making them bigger and more intrusive wo n’t work .
We will tune those out as well . ”
The new formats represent an effort to boost an ad market that has grown dramatically in recent years but is suffering in the slumping economy .
Research firm EMarketer Inc. predicts that the Internet is the only advertising segment that will grow in 2009 .
But most of that growth will be in Web search , while spending on so - called display ads is expected to fall .
EMarketer said in November that U.S. online ad spending would reach $ 23.6 billion in 2008 and $ 25.7 billion this year , but senior analyst David Hallerman said those figures would be revised downward soon .
Advertisement
To some extent , the inherent nature of advertising is to annoy people enough so that they pay attention .
“ Advertising rarely does n’t irritate , ” Hallerman said .
But what Google Inc. and other search firms discovered is that people do n’t mind ads as much when the marketing message is related to what they ’re already doing online , such as searching for something .
J.D. Lasica , president of Socialmedia.biz , a consulting company in Pleasanton , Calif. , said publishers needed to be innovative in more than just the size and shape of the ads .
“ All of these news publications are in a tough spot because the print publications are dwindling away .
So they have to figure out how to make money in the new medium , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think the answer is in - your - face ads . ”
Advertisement
The publishers say they think the new formats will provide a canvas on which advertisers can be more creative .
And they certainly do n’t intend to turn off Web surfers .
“ The visitor says whether they want to see the whole ad , ” said Pam Horan , president of the Online Publishers Assn .
“ If the consumer wants to engage , it will open to double the page .
Everything will be user - initiated . ”
The three new types of ads are the “ fixed panel , ” which looks like part of the page but scrolls up and down as a user does ; the “ XXL box , ” in which users can turn pages within the ad ; and the “ pushdown , ” which opens to display a larger ad .
The formats could pump some life into the market , publishers and advertisers said .
Advertisement
“ A large - scale intrusive format is absolutely necessary in today ’s market , ” said Adam Kleinberg , chief executive of Traction , a San Francisco ad agency .
“ With the economy and the move to digital , the marketers are demanding a return on investment in every campaign . ”
Some Time Inc. sites , including People.com and CNNMoney.com , have already experimented with the ads and found them to be successful , said Fran Hauser , president of digital operations for the company ’s style and entertainment group .
People can respond to a poll , watch a video or play a game right inside some of the ads .
The participating publishers agreed to offer at least one of the formats by July 1 .
The Los Angeles Times is n’t a part of the group .
But it , too , is experimenting with ads that grab attention by , for example , taking over parts of the computer screen and allowing visitors to watch movie trailers or look up showtimes inside the ad .

I wrote a few weeks back about how your bailout money was being used for mergers and acquisitions to line bankers ’ pockets instead of for making loans to desperate homeowners .
After receiving $ 25 billion in bailout funds , Citigroup attempted to buy Chevy Chase Bank despite the fact it was near collapse .
Luckily this deal was scuppered as Capital One has now acquired Chevy Chase , just as the Wachovia deal was canceled when Wells Fargo stepped in .
You might think we dodged a bullet then … until you read the deal terms for Capital One .
Yet again , bailout money is being used , not to help out the man on the street , but to save executives at poorly run institutions .
I have bolded the relevant parts .
Capital One Financial Corp. has reached an agreement to buy Bethesda , Md. - based Chevy Chase Bank for $ 520 million in cash and stock , boosting its presence in the Washington area and gaining a larger deposit base at a time when access to cheap funding is needed to withstand the economic crisis .
Capital One , of McLean , Va. , was among several institutions to look at closely held Chevy Chase , which has $ 15.5 billion in assets and 244 branches in the Washington market .
New York - based Citigroup Inc. was interested at one point but backed out amid larger troubles with its own stock .
Others that looked at the bank were New York - based J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. , SunTrust Banks Inc. of Atlanta and Winston Salem , N.C. - based BB &T Corp. , according to people familiar with the process .
Capital
One received $ 3.56 billion in capital from the federal government this year as part of an industry rescue package run by the Treasury Department .
But the bank did n’t need that capital to complete the Chevy Chase transaction , according to a person close to the company .
Capital
One has stayed away from mortgages in this decade , which helps explain its resilience .
But analysts are still concerned about its exposure to credit - card lending as consumer delinquencies rise .
More deposits give Capital
One a cheap financing source amid the credit crunch , and with Chevy Chase it would have a total of $ 109 billion in deposits .
Capital
One expects cumulative losses on Chevy Chase ’s $ 11.8 billion loan portfolio to be $ 1.75 billion , according to a person familiar with the situation .
Chevy Chase has $ 4.15 billion in adjustable - rate mortgages known as option ARMs that have come under particular strain during the housing meltdown .
The bank ’s profits fell 69 % in the third quarter , to $ 5.9 million .
A company that made its name as a marketer of no - fee credit cards , Capital One became a regional bank in 2005 and 2006 through acquisitions of Hibernia Corp. and North Fork Bancorp .
It now has 739 branches .
Chevy Chase will give the company a combined 983 branches .
So , Capital One gets $ 3.56 billion in bailout money and buys a bank for $ 520 million ( with cash proceeds of only $ 445 million ) .
Sounds like a freebie to me .
And would n’t you be willing to bet that Capital One will not be increasing ts lending .
This seems to be a pattern : Wells Fargo gets Wachovia on the cheap after getting bailout money .
PNC gets NCC for next to nothing after receiving bailout money .
We were warned big banks would become nationalized predators .
And they have .
What ’s in your wallet ?
For Capital
One , it ’s free money from the U.S. Bailout Gravy Train .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Troubled mortgage giant Fannie Mae planned to pay four top executives retention bonuses ranging from $ 470,000 to $ 611,000 , according to a February SEC filing .
A view of Fannie Mae headquarters is seen on July 14 , 2008 , in Washington .
Executive vice presidents Kenneth Bacon , David Hisey , Michael Williams and Thomas Lund will be receiving bonuses of close to half a million dollars each .
Bacon supervises community development for the company , Hisey is its deputy chief financial officer , Williams is its COO and Lund oversees the single - family mortgage business .
By contrast , Fannie Mae CFO
David Johnson received no bonus on top of his salary of $ 625,000 , while CEO Herb Allison received no compensation or bonuses in 2008 or 2009 .
A spokesman for Fannie Mae deferred comment on the bonuses to the Federal Housing Finance Agency .
The bonuses were necessary to keep Fannie 's most experienced executives working to reverse the effects of the mortgage crisis , FHFA Director James B. Lockhart told CNN .
" As the previous senior management teams left , it would have been catastrophic to lose the next layers down and other highly experienced employees , " Lockhart said in a statement .
" Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased 73 percent of all mortgages originated last year and are the key players in the Making Home Affordable plan designed to help millions of homeowners .
Many employees have received significant pay reductions , with no bonuses for 2008 performance and all past stock grants are virtually worthless .
This retention program is pay for specific efforts underway now to meet national goals , " he said .
On Tuesday , two key senators announced a plan to impose a hefty tax on retention bonuses paid to executives of companies that received federal bailout money or in which the United States has at least a 50 percent equity interest -- including Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and AIG .
" Millions of Americans are losing their jobs .
Millions .
And to some degree they 're losing their jobs because of actions taken by some of these firms , " said Sen .
Max Baucus , a Montana Democrat and Senate Finance Committee chairman .
" At the same time , they 're giving themselves bonuses .
I mean , give me a break .
What are these people thinking ?
That 's part of the problem .
They 're not thinking . "
Fannie and Freddie serve a crucial role in keeping the housing market liquid , giving banks and lenders the ability to sell the loans they make in order to have the funds to make additional loans to consumers .
But the companies , trying to meet the competing interests of the greater market and their shareholders , began to buy up risky subprime loans , which were generally made without income verification .
When the housing bubble burst last year , the firms began rapidly losing money and eventually became unsustainable without government intervention .
CNN 's Emily Anderson , Ted Barrett and CNNMoney.com 's David Goldman contributed to this report .
All About Fannie Mae • Freddie Mac Holdings • Max Baucus
Enough with the show trials already .
Enough with the Treasury Select Committee and its peacock chairman , John McFall , with his gritty questions that never quite elicit anything we did n't know already .
And more than enough of those lawyer - scripted , without - prejudice public apologies : the guilty men are never actually going to prostrate themselves and say : " Yes , as a matter of fact you 're right , chairman .
I was unqualified to run a bank , and my judgement became utterly warped by the size of my bonuses , so now I 'm personally responsible for billions of losses .
Sorry . "
We have been distracted from the fact that the Government is exhausted of new ideas as to how to get us out of this mess .
But before examining that , let us consider a simple list of warnings to watch for next time round .
The first signal is , of course , a boom in bankers ' pay .
Research from New York University has shown how it soared in relation to other professions in the 1920s , the mid-1980s and in spades in the present decade , each time offering a perfect indicator of the crash to come .
We need banks themselves to accept that if they pay grossly more than comparable professional work – making millionaires of middle managers and deluding directors into thinking themselves on a par with great entrepreneurs – then things will inevitably go to the bad .
Unsound trading decisions will be taken , huge strategic risks will be ignored , shareholders ' and clients ' interests will be endangered , and off we go to perdition once more .

Second , beware of banks not run by bankers .
In the line - up of former HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland chiefs in front of chairman McFall this week – Lord Stevenson and Andy Hornby , alongside Sir Tom McKillop and Sir Fred Goodwin – not one had significant hands - on experience of the small - scale lending decisions and day - to - day customer interface that are the bedrock of the seasoned banker 's professional formation .
At Northern Rock , we should remember , Adam Applegarth was a marketing man with no banking qualifications , and his chairman , Dr Matt Ridley , was an expert on Charles Darwin .
Lifelong , branch - trained managers are not immune to errors – they made plenty in the 1980s – but they are an innately cautious breed who are unlikely to go haywire on the spectacular scale of the current bust .
Third , beware of excessive sophistication .
Securitisation of mortgages was , when first invented , a useful way of increasing liquidity in the US home loan market .
But it became so over - elaborated that it almost wrecked the global financial system .
Likewise , derivative instruments were devised to help farmers and manufacturers protect themselves against future risks , but the complexity of modern derivative trading turned them into what Warren Buffett called " weapons of financial mass destruction " .
Next , watch for over - priced mergers , a sure sign that the top of the cycle has been reached – or just passed .
RBS's £ 50bn consortium takeover of ABN Amro , desperately outbidding Barclays , will go down as one of the worst misjudgements in financial history .
And if it 's true that Lloyds TSB had an opportunity to back out of the HBOS merger , but chose to stay in because it offered a " once in a lifetime " opportunity to grab more market share , then the £ 10bn loss revealed last Friday puts that deal in a similar category of folly .
Finally , watch out for obfuscation and self - delusion .
The annual reports of RBS , HBOS , Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley before they collapsed were models of corporate correctness which gave no hint of the horrors hidden on and off their balance sheets .
Bradford & Bingley 's should become a set text for business - school students : up to their eyeballs in toxic buy - to - let lending , the directors confirmed " they are satisfied that the company has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future " and gave far more space to diversity analysis and green toilet - flushing systems .
Five simple warning signals for the next financial crisis .
But to get to the next one , we have to extract ourselves from this one .
How on earth do we get there ?
In the short term , the Government and the Bank of England have the biggest role to play through liquidity and insurance schemes for bank lending , the implied promise of further capital support from taxpayers , and the prospect of near - zero interest rates and new - minted cash pumped into the system .
As the Bank 's Governor said last week , these measures will work positively – but we have to be patient .
If President Obama 's fiscal stimulus package begins to stabilise the US economy and housing market , that will help .
If , later this year , UK homebuyers begin to feel that house prices are affordable and unlikely to fall much further , that will help too .
Only when banks can draw a line under the property crash and put a final figure on what it has cost them will they begin to move forward again .
When they do so , our five key points should be framed in their boardrooms .
Do n't let pay scales run out of control .
Promote your shrewdest lifelong bankers to the highest levels , and do n't override their opinions .
If your young thrusters invent new lines of business you do n't understand , just tell them to stop .
If anyone offers you a global mega - merger , show them the door .
Finally , make sure the risks you take are crystal clear to shareholders , customers , regulators – and most important , yourselves .
That way , we might not have to go through all this again – at least , not in this lifetime .

In candy world , circus peanut is a riddle wrapped in marshmallow inside orange shell BRYAN , Ohio  Steve Kerr pulls apart the freshly made circus peanut and presses his thumbs into its spongy , orange center .
Not too moist or too rigid — just right .
" It 's all about feel , " he says .
He is n't tempted to taste it though .
" I 'm not a big fan , " admits Kerr , vice president of operations for Spangler Candy , one of the few remaining makers of circus peanuts .
The marshmallow confection is as controversial as it gets when it comes to candy .
What makes the circus peanut so intriguing and sparks debate among candy connoisseurs is that the treat is a mystery on many levels .
" People can't wrap their brains around why it 's sweet and get really confused by the flavor , " says Beth Kimmerle , author of Candy : The Sweet History .
Though they 're orange and look like a peanut , they taste like banana .
And they are chewier than a traditional marshmallow .
Even those who like circus peanuts can't agree whether they 're better soft and fresh or stale and hard after sitting out for a week .
" Break out a bag anywhere and you 'll get a debate going , " Kimmerle says .
She prefers them factory fresh and once served slices at a cocktail party where guests were adding them to crackers and prosciutto .
Most love 'em or hate 'em .
" It 's right up there with black licorice , " Kimmerle says .
Circus peanuts have become a cult item much like Peeps — the marshmallow chicks and bunnies , says Steve Almond , a self - described candy addict who wrote Candyfreak , a memoir that chronicles candy making in America .
He calls them " a mixture of fascination and disgust .
It 's a completely baffling candy . "
No one knows how circus peanuts got their shape and name or how they long they 've been around .
One theory is that they originated with the traveling circuses where vendors sold salted peanuts and candy .
By all accounts , circus peanuts date to the 1800s when they were a seasonal treat and one of the original penny candies .
" There are few candies that actually have survived as long as circus peanuts , " says Jon Prince , owner of wholesale candy retailer www.candyfavorites.com.
" It 's not so much candy as it's Americana . "
Spangler , which is celebrating its 100th anniversary and is best known for Dum - Dum lollipops and candy canes , has been producing circus peanuts since the 1930s in northwest Ohio .
The candy is the most difficult of the company 's products to make , Kerr says , because " you 've got all these variables coming together . "
There 's little room for error when it comes to cooking temperatures and ingredients — mainly sugar , gelatin , corn syrup and artificial flavor .
The toughest part is getting just the right moisture .
Too much will leave a thin , crusty layer on the outside .
Too dry and they 'll cave inward .
Bill Fenter , who has made circus peanuts for 23 years , scurries between mixers checking the temperature gauges and adding ingredients .
" I eat them once in a while , " he says .
" One or two .
That 's about enough for me . "
The mixture is squirted into starch molds that pull out the moisture and shape the peanut .
Next , the candy crystalizes in temperature - controlled rooms for about 24 hours .
Spangler makes about 32,000 pounds per day .
Most is sold in bulk to wholesalers and repackaged .
The company also sells its own brand in retail stores .
It makes varieties that are heart - shaped for Valentine 's Day and bunnies , chicks , and eggs for Easter .
A few years back , it discontinued a holiday - themed line because not many people would eat marshmallow Santas and Christmas trees .
Next Easter , the company will team with Disney on a nationwide distribution of Winnie the Pooh , Piglet , Eeyore and Tigger candies .
They 'll come in cotton candy , cherry , banana and lemon flavors .
The hope is it will attract more children to eat what is " an old person 's candy , " says Kirk Vashaw , Spangler 's vice president of contract businesses .
Circus peanuts are about 5 % of Spangler 's business .
The privately run company does not release overall sales figures .
Still , circus peanut sales were up last year and have increased 10 % this year , Vashaw says .
Not bad — and yet another mystery — considering candy sales have been flat lately .
" We 're a little perplexed why it 's going up , " he says .
" The circus peanut is such an enigma .
It 's hard to tell what 's going to happen to it . "
Dallas - based Brach 's Confections and Melster Candies in Cambridge , Wis. , are the other two leading makers of circus peanuts .
Sales at Melster have been on the rise in recent years despite circus peanuts ' " bad rap , " says Andy Telatnik , a spokesman for Impact Confections , which owns Melster .
" Anything that 's survived 200 years is pretty good . "
The traditional orange , peanut - shaped version remains the best - seller by far .
A lot of that has to do with nostalgia .
Candy shop owner Pam Linseman says customers looking for a reminder of their childhood will often find their way to a bag of circus peanuts at her store , I Want Candy in Portsmouth , N.H. " You ca n't be a candy store without circus peanuts , " she says .

How do you visualise all the modules in your project ?
What happens when you project has tens of thousands of modules ?
Does it look like this ?
Is the module namespace art ?
There ’s a lot of Haskell code in the world now .
1125 packages on Hackage , made up of thousands of modules , with hundreds of thousands of import dependencies between them .
Some of those packages have hundreds of modules .
For fun , I wanted to visualise that module namespace .
That is , in one image see all the Haskell modules I could potentially use : a panoramic view of the Haskell landscape .
In this post I ’m going to :
show Iavor Diatchki’s graphmod tool for visualising module dependencies
develop a new tool , cabalgraph , for visualising the module namespace by converting .cabal files into . dot files
look at lots of pretty examples
visualize the entire core and 3rd party Haskell library set in a single view
You ’ll learn how to use cabalgraph and graphmod to visualise imports and namespaces , and get to see some quite cool pictures of a thousand libraries in single namespace image .
( Composite image courtesy infosthetics.com who picked up the early version of this post .
Thanks guys ! )
Visualising by Category
Previously , I looked at comprehending Hackage through its category metadata straight from the Hackage library set .
Here , font size is indicated by word size , as we view the 50 or so semantic categories used by the 1k +
Haskell packages :
Which does a reasonable job of conveying the breadth of the areas we ’ve libraries and tools for .
Does n’t do much to convey the sheer number of packages now though .
The Haskell Module System
Haskell modules are pretty straight forward .
You pick a hierarchical name , like System .IO .
MMap , for you module name , hopefully using one of the standard top level allocated names .
There are various rough guides to the namespace to try to keep things sensible .
Once you ’ve chosen a module name , the module itself lives in a file path of the same form .
So concrete file in this case would be System / IO / MMap.hs .
Others can then use my module – once it is packaged up with cabal – by importing the original name .
All fairly straight forward .
Modules may import each other mutually recursively too , which is fun .
Graphing Imports
At work we ’ve sometimes the need to quickly convey how Haskell modules depend on each other , when trying to describe how a system works to other developers , or for verification and requirements purposes .
To help with this in the context of Haskell , my colleague Iavor Diatchki , wrote graphmod , a nice way to view the module import graph of your project .
Here , import statements correspond to edges , and modules are nodes .
It ’s easy to use ( here , piping the .dot output of graphmod into graphviz to render ) :
graphmod *.hs */*.hs | dot - Tpng | xv -
Running graphmod on the xmonad core results in :
And an alternate rendering :
For small graphs , this does a pretty good job of summarising the import dependencies of the project quickly .
Useful for summarising quickly how your project works internally .
Two new tools : lscabal and cabalgraph
My goal here though was to visualise the entire Haskell module namespace .
We have some nice technology at our disposal to do this :
a single central library and tool repository , Hackage
each package has a required declarative metadata file listing its interface ( i.e. we do n’t need to install it to find out what API it exports )
a library for parsing .cabal files
So all I have to do is glue these together with a script to grab .cabal files from the network , parse them , then render them in . dot format .
An hour later we have a new tool , cabalgraph .
Given a list of any of : a directory with a .cabal file inside it ; the path to a .cabal file ; or the URL of a .cabal file , it will parse all those .cabal files , extract the module names , and then render the combined set as a graph in dot format .
( Yes , a Haskell app that does network stuff , text transformation , parsing , blah blah made by gluing libraries together ! ) .
While I was here , I also put together lscabal , for just listing the exported modules from a cabal package .
Looking at lscabal first .
Just running it against a project on the command line :
$ lscabal ~/ dons/src/xmonad XMonad XMonad .
Main XMonad .
Core XMonad .
Config XMonad .
Layout XMonad.ManageHook XMonad .
Operations XMonad .
StackSet
Or viewing a remote package :
$ lscabal http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/uvector/0.1.0.3/uvector.cabal Data.Array .
Vector
Or some union of these ( for example , the mixed local and remote dependencies of a project ) :
$ lscabal http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/uvector/0.1.0.3/uvector.cabal
~/dons/src/bytestring Data.Array .
Vector Data.ByteString Data.ByteString .Char8 Data.ByteString .
Unsafe Data.ByteString .
Internal Data.ByteString .Lazy Data.ByteString .Lazy .
Char8 Data.ByteString .Lazy .
Internal Data.ByteString .
Fusion
Useful if you want to know how many , or what , modules a bunch of packages are providing .
As a side note , I quite like the command line API that uniformly hands urls and filepaths intermixed .
Good mashup stuff on the command line .
Maybe there ’s a new library waiting there …
Visualising the Namespace
We can now view the module hierarchy exported by projects , and sets of projects , graphically .
In each case , I ’ll pipe output into dot or one of its variants .
For example :
$ cabalgraph ~/ dons / src/xmonad | circo - Tpng | xv -
Results in :
And as a classic tree :
The module namespace carries a lot less information than the full import dependency graph , so we should be able to view larger projects without getting too overwhelmed .
Here ’s a graph of the various bytestring libraries , combined ( and squashed horizontally ) ( here ’s the original widescreen version ) :
So there ’s a bit of a culture that ’s built up around the bytestring library .
Big Graphs : Getting a bit artsy
Here ’s a rather cool image of the xmonad extensions library ( all the extra layouts , and buttons and tweaks ) .
The xmonad core ( visualized above ) is just one tiny circle with all this surrounding code built on top :
xmonadcontrib is very well regulated , and growing smoothly .
Here ’s a rendering of the darcs module namespace :
And a graph of most of the libraries that I ’ve written :
Here is the Haskell core library namespace ( aka the standard libraries ) .
Note how sparsely connected the core “ axiomatic ” libraries are :
The Haskell Universe
And without further ado , here it is : the complete Haskell namespace ( every open source Haskell module available via Hackage or the core libraries ( the vast majority of public and open Haskell code in existence ) ) :
It ’s kind of beautiful .
You see the big parts of the namespace ( like “ Data ” , “ System ” , “ Control ” and “ Text ” ) have lots of modules under their control , so much so that the modules become a fuzzy cloud of black .
Then there are smaller parts of the namespace , until we ’re just looking at single , freestanding modules not connected to any other part of the namespace .
So much code .
Here ’s an alternative rendering using the “ force directed ” spring algorithm dot provides .
The individual modules are a bit more distinct now :
It ’s almost like a star chart .
Here ’s another rendering , using “ neato ” mode .
It emphasises the more massive parts of the namespace a bit more :
This one is like looking down on the namespace from above .
A topological map almost , where you can see the big peaks of the namespace .
The final image is perhaps the most revealing .
Here you see the big parts of the namespace , and each individual project hanging off as tiny sprouts .
Vaguely biological looking :
You can try rendering this graph yourself using these . dot files constructed with cabalgraph , and some .svg files for the big images ( rather then rendering big .pngs for them ) .
The general process I used here was cabalgraph to construct the big dot files , then graphivz to generate various renderings , with inkscape and gimp at the end to get them into a .png format .
Hope you enjoyed all that .
Since the president announced on Friday that he'd be sending an additional 4,000 troops to Afghanistan , I 've heard quite a bit of far - right undermining of the commander - in - chief while our soldiers are in harm 's way .
Just some reminders of what I thought was the rule regarding this behavior :
" The only ideas that they espouse are ways to undermine the troops in harm 's way and undermine their commander in chief while they 're at war .
Your candidates have no idea how to keep this economy strong . "
— Sean Hannity , 10/18/06
" He ’s the Commander - in - Chief .
And what I find frankly repugnant about you and some of your fellow Democrats – you have undermined our president ... "
— Sean Hannity , 03/19/06
" You know , Norman , those comments while we are at war , while troops are in harm 's way , while he is the commander in chief , do you not see the outrage in that ? "
— Sean Hannity , 11/12/07
" I have had it with members of your party undermining our troops , undermining a commander in chief while we are at war ... "
— Sean Hannity , 11/05
" You do n't criticize the Commander - in - Chief in the middle of a firefight .
That could be construed as putting U.S. forces in jeopardy and undermining morale . "
— Bill O'Reilly , 04/04
" Can we do it without distorting their legacies and pandering to anti-American elites worldwide and using their deaths to embarrass and undermine our commander in chief ? "
— Michelle Malkin , 11/23/05
" On the other hand , if Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrat Congress are successful in undermining the commander - in - chief ... "
— Tom DeLay , 04/11/07
" And furthermore , one of the fundamental principles we have in America is that the president is the commander in chief of the armed forces and attempts to undermine the commander in chief during time of war amounts to treason . "
— Pat Robertson , 12/07/05
I hasten to note that criticizing the president during wartime is fine .
Hypocrisy , on the other hand , is n't .
You either unequivocally support the president in wartime or you do n't .
You can't have it both ways , wingnuts .

See how to create a virtual eye
YOUR avatar ’s eyes could soon be the windows to your virtual soul with the development of a new animation technique that creates lifelike eyes in minutes .
To create a more realistic model of the eye , Guillaume Francois from the University of Rennes 1 in France took two identical digital photographs of an eye .
From one of the photographs , he used software to remove the effect of the cornea , the transparent layer on top of the iris , on the light entering the eye .
The software then used the image of the eye …
Michael Atkinson thinks computer games are different .
The South Australian Attorney General presented his arguments against an R18 + classification for video games to the Gamespot video gaming web site .
His arguments can be divided into those in favour of censorship generally , and those that argue that computer games are special , and need to have a higher level of censorship than other media .
His argument for the different status of games as compared to film is essentially that because the experience of playing a computer game is more interactive , it is more harmful to view the same material by virtue of it being a game .
He offers no evidence to support this assertion , other than noting that his children sometimes get very involved in games they play .
He associates R18 + with perverted sex , criminal activity , and extreme violence , but ignores that many award winning , widely acclaimed and viewed films are rated R18 + .
Computer games are , as shown by many studies and accepted even by Atkinson , now consumed by more adults than children .
And adults have the right to consume material intended for adults .
He also ignores that games have been refused classification in Australia for reasons that have nothing to do with sex or violence , and depict only non-violent crime ( graffiti tagging , in the case of Mark Ecko 's Getting Up , refused classification in 2006 ) , a level of censorship that might rightly be regarded as ridiculous if applied to film in Australia , and certainly is not applied to our most widely available media such as free to air television .
Of course , he knows he is being misleading here -- later in his letter he lists the reasons for classification , and among them are coarse language and " ( controversial ) themes . "
The argument that only a small number of games are affected , because only a small number have been rejected for classification , is no argument at all .
What it demonstrates is the chilling effect of censorship laws .
Games that are unlikely to be approved in Australia are cut before being presented to the board , or never presented to the board at all .
The real danger of censorship is the works that do not get made at all , or that are made but never presented to the Australian public .
Mr Atkinson states that " In cinemas , the age of moviegoers can be regulated , and at the video store people must provide ID to hire R18 + videos .
Once electronic games are in the home , access to them cannot be policed and the games are easily accessible to children . "
He seems completely oblivious to the existence of R18 + DVDs , which of course can be freely purchased by adults and taken to their homes .
And ignoring the obvious idea that , should an R18 + category for games be introduced , stores that sell games can check ID , just as news agents that sell R18 + magazines do , and just as the same video stores that provide most of the game rental market already do .
Of course R18 + film material is available within a format that comes into the home — and of course , families do find ways to police such material .
It is easier to control the use of computer games ( that require a specific console to play , most often ) than it is to control the viewing of DVDs .
The policing of R18 + games presents far less of an issue than the policing of R18 + DVDs , which is generally unproblematic .
And that Atkinson presents something so easily dismissed as a serious argument at all can be explained only by either a deep ignorance of something as basic as DVD purchase , or contempt to voters understanding of the issues .
A similarly poor argument is Atkinson pointing out that many quality games enjoyed by adults would not merit an R18 + rating .
This is of course true , but irrelevant .
Simply because I may enjoy a film aimed at a general audience , does not mean I may not also want to view films aimed exclusively at adults , and the same applies to games .
The existence of Pixar films , enjoyable by both children and adults , is not a justification to ban the R18 + films of Quentin Tarantino — but Atkinson contends that , when it comes to the computer game equivalents , it should be .
Atkinson also tries to use the existence of classification for advertising , films , and books as a justification for the classification of computer games , but this is a deceptive argument .
He is the one arguing that games are different — if games were classified in the same way as films , they would have an R18 + rating as films do .
But the most revealing aspect of his argument is that he frequently refers to " children or vulnerable adults " .
He is using the argument that he is protecting children , by making his poor arguments about access to games in the home , but it is clear that even he does not really swallow this argument as justification for his policy .
He knows that to justify his position , he must justify censoring adults .
" Vulnerable " adults are as much a target of his censorship efforts as children , and by talking of " vulnerable " adults , he seeks to censor all adults by appeal to a hypothetical weakest among us .
And this is how the call to censorship always goes , to justify taking away our rights by claiming to protect the weakest .
Atkinson does not even bother to deny that he seeks to restrict adult liberty , he only claims to believe the sacrifice of our rights is justified by the desire to protect these hypothetical weakest of us .
Mr Atkinson claims support from other State Attorneys - General , yet he is the sole one holding back the public release of a paper on the issue , a paper that Victorian Attorney - General Rob Hulls said made " persuasive arguments " for an adults only game classification .
Perhaps he is not the only one , but he certainly does not seem to have the broad support of his colleagues .
And the only group that supports him that he is prepared to name is Young Media Australia , an organisation that supports appropriate media for children -- which makes it clear that supporters of Atkinson 's view are those that share his contention that adult consumption of computer games should be determined by what is appropriate for children , not what is appropriate for adults .
Finally , it is worth noting that Mr Atkinson refers to the Office of Film and Literature Classication , a body that no longer exists as such , the Classification Board being incorporated into the Attorney Generals Dept in 2006 .
There is no excuse for mistakes about the basic details of the system by an Attorney General making decisions about its future .
Media Release19 March 2009
InternetNZ has reviewed the 50 - odd submissions on the Telecommunications Carriers � Forum Internet Code of Practice and finds overwhelming support for repeal of Section 92A of the Copyright Act.
Executive Director Keith Davidson says � The depth of analysis and the volume and quality of the submissions shows that the fight against 92A is not , as has been suggested by certain people , an hysterical response or something being hyped up by naive or ignorant people .
�� There are well reasoned legal and technical arguments confirming that 92A is poorly drafted law and should be repealed .
The Code produced by the TCF Working Party is a valiant attempt to make the best of a bad situation but cannot overcome the problems created by the faulty legislation .
In particular , feedback in the submissions highlights serious reservations within the legal fraternity .
�Further , InternetNZ reiterates that cutting off people�s Internet is a disproportionate response to issues of copyright infringement and that the approach is discredited worldwide .
�Section 92A should never have been brought in by the previous Government , and this Government should not hesitate to repeal it , � says Davidson .
InternetNZ , like many other stakeholders and concerned groups and citizens , is ready to enter further consultation on appropriate legislation in respect to copyright and dealing with repeat copyright infringement .
�We support a first principles review of the Copyright Act to take account of the digital age , with full public and stakeholder consultation , � says Davidson .
For further information contact : Keith DavidsonExecutive DirectorInternetNZ021 377 587exe.dir@internetnz.net.nz --------------Here are selected quotes from the submissions , which can be found atAuckland District Law Society :
The definition of ISPs is so broad it can include ordinary businesses with websites and whose employees use the Internet � there is potential for serious disruption to a large number of ordinary New Zealanders , well beyond those individual consumers whose Internet connection may be terminated �Auckland District Law Society :
� We consider this provision to be out of step with the remaining provisions , sections 92B - 92E , which reflect the internationally accepted approach that there should be safe harbour provisions for ISPs �Judge David Harvey : �section 92A is unnecessary and gives rise to a situation where a person may be deprived of rights under a contract without proper legal process .
If it had been Parliament�s intention to provide for a process whereby contract termination should take place , Parliament should have provided such process by legislation after proper consultation with all interested parties .
�New Zealand Vice - Chancellors Committee Negotiating Team : �both staff and students of a university are reliant on information technology , access to the Internet and its intranets to undertake teaching and research .
Termination of staff and students � accounts would have serious downstream consequences for those persons and for a university , which already has in place disciplinary procedures for both staff and students who breach the law and university policies .
�Google : � Section 92A puts users � procedural and fundamental rights at risk , by threatening to terminate users �
Internet access based on mere allegations and reverse the burden of proof onto a user to establish there was no infringement .
In Google�s experience , there are serious issues regarding the improper use and inaccuracy of copyright notices by rights holders .
�ALGIM ( Association of Local Government Information Management ) : �ALGIM is concerned about the cost of compliance with the Act in terms of investigating allegations .
Creative Freedom Foundation : � On our website we have a petition against Section 92A that has 18,243 signatures of which 9084 are artists .
�Matt Vickers , Business Analyst and Developer : � At my place of work we conduct work for clients that have users logging in on a daily basis : newspapers , banks , government sites .
To deny them access to this information is wrong , as it is , especially for the younger generation , the primary mode of access .
We are also finding that the government is putting more content online and wanting to conduct less support through call centres .
Again , a law like 92A is counter - productive to this .
�George Gordon : � The EU parliament , one of the biggest economic powerhouses on the planet has flatly rejected the idea as well � the argument that S92a is necessary to fulfill requirements with our trading partner thus falls flat on its face .
�ISP Association of New Zealand : � We have grave concerns around the disruptive impact of this on us as ISPs and particularly on our business customers , at a time when we should be focusing on building the digital economy , not tearing it down .
New Zealand Society of Authors : � The NZSA ( PEN NZ INC ) feels that both S92A and The Draft ISP Copyright Code of Practice need further development and clarification and this must involve creators and copyright holders . �
For months , the opponents of Operation Cast Lead – the assault on Gaza that killed 1,434 Palestinians – have been told we are " dupes for Islamic fundamentalists " , or even anti-Semitic .
The defenders of Israel 's war claimed you could only believe the reports that Israeli troops were deliberately firing on civilians , scrawling " death to Arabs " on the walls , and trashing olive groves , or using the chemical weapon white phosphorus that burns to the bone , if you were infected with the old European virus of Jew - hatred .
Now the very people who fought that war have confirmed we were simply describing reality .
One Israeli Defence
Force squad leader says of the orders he was given to target civilians : " I call it murder . "
As he put it : " In the end the directive was to go into a house , switch on loudspeakers and tell them ' you have five minutes to run away and whoever does n't will be killed ' . "
In a crowded civilian city , there are all sorts of people who cannot run away : the elderly , the disabled , the pregnant , the terrified .
This soldier was told to kill them .
He is not alone .
Anybody who has reported from the Occupied Territories has witnessed a culture of racist contempt for ordinary Palestinian civilians .
They are treated as suspects simply for walking around their own home towns , or trying to sell their own produce .
This is not a few bad apples : it is endemic to the nature of occupation , blockade and repeated assault .

Yet there is a swelling movement of young Israelis who are speaking out – and refusing to kill on occupied land .
It 's a strikingly brave move in a country that is drifting to the right .
Ehud Olmert , Israel 's out - going Prime Minister , has publicly bragged that Israel 's response to attack " will naturally be disproportionate " , just as he boasted about the 2007 war in Lebanon : " Half of Lebanon was destroyed – is that a loss ? "
None of this had to happen .
On the eve of the attack , Ephraim Halevy , the former head of Mossad , said that the way to stop rocket attacks on Israel was to draw Hamas , the elected Palestinian government , into negotiation and compromise – but " Israel , for reasons of its own , did not want to turn the ceasefire into the start of a diplomatic process with Hamas " .
Instead , Israel launched an attack on civilians of which her own soldiers are ashamed .

Back when oil was shooting up over $ 100 a barrel , I suggested that the coming global recession would cause oil prices to crash in a " head fake " which would create an illusion of plentiful oil .
Here 's the chart ( apologies to longtime readers who 've seen it too many times already )
And here 's a few recent entries on the topic :
Oil : One Last Head - Fake ?
( May 9 , 2008 )
Checking
In on Oil's Head - Fake ( September 18 , 2008 )
The End of Leverage ( December 13 , 2008 )
What I want to expore today is the confluence of debt and energy .
What we 're seeing now is governments around the world borrowing and spending several trillion dollars in fiscal stimulus ; the U.S. alone has staked several trillion dollars in borrowed money on rehabilitating its crippled financial sector and is now set to spend another $ 800 billion on direct goosing of the economy .
European and Asian nations have announced their own stimulus packages , and all but China 's will be financed by the sale of government IOUs / bonds -- in essence , borrowing the money from those with surplus capital looking for " safe haven . "
( And with tax revenues dropping in China , perhaps even that government will soon be borrowing to support deficit spending . )
But as China 's economy craters ( and with official statistics ginned up , who can tell what 's really happening there ) and the oil exporting nations ' gusher of profits vanishes , then just who has the trillions of dollars in surplus to fund this mighty paroxym of panicky government borrowing ?
The most reliable buyers of U.S. debt / bonds were the exporting Asian nations ( Japan and China ) and the oil exporters ( Saudi Arabia and Gulf oil states ) .
Now that oil has fallen drastically , the oil exporters are finding they face not wellsprings of endless billions of excess capital to invest but billions in deficit spending .
As noted here many times , demographics are a tightening vise in all the Gulf oil states : their population is booming , as is their welfare - state spending , even as their revenues crash .
Even worse , the need to fund their welfare states will draw funding from whatever they planned to invest in their oil infrastructure / future production capacity -- and for most oil exporters , even those sums were too paltry to maintain current production , never mind boost supply .
This is the real killer effect of the head - fake : investment in future production capacity will drop to zero as the ruling elites spend every dime on suppressing their restive , welfare - dependent populaces .
So when demand does pick up again ( let 's say in 2011 - 2012 , if not sooner ) then supply will be far more constrained than it is today .
Recall that it takes years of stupendous investment to extract more oil from any source ; the cheap , easy - to - get stuff is already gone .
Even the Saudis are spending tens of billions of dollars to maintain production .
How long can these nations ( including Iran and Venezuela ) continue their welfare spending / subsidies if oil keeps falling in price ?
No one knows , but the clock is definitely ticking .
The one thing we know for sure is that their excess capital which once bought U.S. bonds is gone .
The same is true of China : now that nation must redirect its surplus capital into its own domestic economy / welfare spending .
Put this together and here 's what is taking shape :
1 . The tremendous fiscal goosing by all governments will create a temporary floor under oil 's relentless decline .
Spend a couple trillion dollars and you will certainly create some demand for oil which would otherwise not exist .
2 . Thus we can anticipate a rally in oil / natural gas prices , and the illusion that the " head - fake " decline is over .
Once the stimulus spending has run its course , however , then demand will fall again and oil will resume its head - fake fall -- perhaps all the way down to test its 1998 lows around $ 12 / barrel .
3 . Oil will stabilize in price , but at a price too low for oil exporters to support both their welfare states and investment in their oil infrastructure .
They will of political necessity choose welfare spending thus allowing their oil production to fall into irreversible decline .
4 . As governments from Japan to Germany borrow heavily to fund their desperate fiscal goosing , they are tapping not an endless supply of money but the last few feet of muddy water at the bottom of a fast - drying well .
The big global surpluses of capital sloshing around the globe looking for a nice fat return are over .
Everywhere assets are depreciating / falling in value , payrolls and profits are declining , and with the popping of global asset bubbles , nothing is even remotely in place to change those trends .
5 . Thus at some point the voracious appetite of governments to sell debt / bonds to raise cash to spend will run headlong into the stone wall of declining supply of surplus capital .
It all comes down to supply and demand .
We speak of the Fed " printing money " but as others have shown , the governments do n't actually print money and spend it : they create lending via fractional reserve banking , but the fiscal stimulus funds are borrowed in the bond market .
Once there 's not enough supply of capital to buy all the bonds being hawked all over the world , then the prices of those bonds will have to rise to draw funds out of other investments .
It is thus easy to anticipate yields doubling and then tripling as governments compete for scarce capital .
( And rising yields equal rising interest rates . ) there simply is n't enough surplus capital to fund new mortgage debt , new corporate debt , new local government bonds and the fantastic sums being borrowed by central governments .
6 . In the big picture , the global economy is squandering the last cheap oil to fund fiscal stimulus of economies based on cheap , abundant oil instead of spending those borrowed trillions on a less - oil dependent energy infrastructure .
The net result of that global mal - investment will be an eventual resurgence of demand for oil which is far higher than available production / supply .
Once the " head - fake " is over , then this mismatch of supply and demand will sent oil prices soaring to heights few anticipate now --$ 300 / barrel seems entirely plausible -- and make supply unpredictable .

Thought you might be interested in some reports from the front lines .
First off , I have learned that the number of " extreme " poaching offenses in the state during 2008 increased over prior years .
We have discussed this before in our correspondence and our prediction that the economic downturn will increase impacts on ecosystems seems to be materializing .
Regarding crime , a funny thing happened to me this past holiday weekend .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
An eruption of a poorly understood kind of genetic change set humans apart from great apes , and also sets chimps , gorillas and orangutans apart from monkeys , researchers reported on Wednesday .
Right before the great apes branched off from other apes and monkeys 10 million years ago , their DNA began to make explosive changes -- not classic mutations , but another change known as copy number variation , University of Washington geneticist Evan Eichler and colleagues found .
These changes in DNA sequences may help explain what makes humans -- and other apes -- unique , they report in the journal Nature .
“ These are really like volcanoes in the genome , blowing out pieces of DNA , ” Eichler said in a statement .
Eichler , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute researcher , and his team analyzed the DNA of a human , a chimpanzee and an orangutan , as well as of a macaque monkey .
Looking at species known to be at various distances on the evolutionary tree can act as a kind of time machine to track changes over millennia .
As expected , they found humans and chimps were very close in terms of overall sequence .
The main differences lie in copy number variations -- repeats of the same genetic sequence over and over , deletions of the sequence , or even instances in which a sequence runs backward .
Among humans , these variations have been associated with diseases ranging from AIDS to autism .
They may also underlie the differences between species , Eichler said .
The analysis suggested that in the ancestral branch of primates leading to humans and the African great apes , the number of these duplications began to increase at the same time that the more classic genetic mutations were slowing down .
Humans and chimps , in particular , tend to have extra copies of these sequences , they reported .
“ There ’s a big burst of activity that happens where genomes are suddenly rearranged and changed , ” Eichler said .
“ There is the possibility that these genes might be important for language or for aspects of cognition , though much more work has to be done before we ’ll be able to say that for sure . ”

Facebook Oversight Board to launch in October
Posted
Facebook 's long - delayed independent Oversight Board plans to launch in mid-late October , just before the November U.S. presidential election , although a board member said he did not know whether it would hear cases related to the contest .
Conway G. Gittens has more .
As for what brought on the much - played rant , Bale said the day 's shooting was particularly intense : " I put so much into what I do and care so much about it and sometimes the enthusiasm just goes awry .
" I 'm embarrassed by it .
I ask everybody to sit down and ask themselves , have they ever had a bad day and have they ever lost their temper and really regretted it immensely . "
Not that he does n't understand the public 's insatiable desire to hear — and mock and remix — the audio .
" Feel free to make fun of me at my expense ; I deserve it completely . "
Bale , who could easily have chosen any worldwide media to deliver his mea culpa , said he selected KROQ because had been listening to the morning show 's mockery and incessant playing of his rant all week .
" I spoke with you guys a few years back ; you seem like good guys and I wanted to talk with you about it , " he said , before adding that the DJs ' take on his rant made him laugh .
" Believe me , this is no punk . "
Kevin and Bean , meanwhile , had a slightly more humbling take on why they were chosen .
" You can talk to a guy who tries to high - five a blind dude or you can talk to Kevin and Bean ; those are your options in the morning , " they said .
( For those doubting the validity of the scoop , Bale 's rep Jennifer Allen has confirmed that it was the actor , and not the station 's dead - on Bale impersonator , Ralph Garman . )
As for any residual hard feelings between Bale and D.P. Shane Hurlbut , the object of his on - set rant , the actor said it ceased being an issue shortly after the outburst .
" We have resolved this completely ... I have no intention of getting anyone fired .
There is no problem whatsoever . "

There has always been dignity in servitude , but in today ’s world where everybody is racing to become their own boss , …
Orson Welles said film - making was the biggest electric train set a boy ever had .
He was wrong .
A new high - speed train line would be , if the boy or girl grew up to engineer it .
But in Britain , the train set is broken and has been packed away in the attic .
We 're not proud of industry and we certainly do n't want our kids to grow up to be engineers .
It 's a tragedy .
It never used to be this way .
We need to rediscover the power of engineering , its impact and contribution .
It can stimulate young minds and it can stimulate the economy .
Let 's start with the makers , breakers and remakers - children .
Children are mini-engineers and it's their rite of passage to pull anything mechanical apart to get at the guts .
As a child , I pored over Eagle magazine cut- aways that delved into the workings of everything from Bloodhound missiles to offshore oil rigs .
Rather than the aesthetic , it was the innards that intrigued and inspired .
The inventions all seemed to herald a brave new world of British prosperity that never transpired , at least not in its engineering guise .
Instead , we became obsessed with the surface ( but more of that later ) .
So the young are innately curious about how and why things work .
Yet what happens between childhood and adulthood ?
We stamp it out of them .
Engineering gets stigmatised and we encourage our kids to become " professionals " - lawyers , accountants , doctors .
Unlike in France or Germany , engineers are a bit of a nonentity here .
Engineering is almost a dirty word .
We 're told it 's " old industry " and that we are a " post - industrial nation " .
Part of the problem is that engineers are not accorded the status they deserve .
We celebrate designers and architects , but forget the clever people who turn the theory into reality .
The Millau bridge in France was designed by Norman Foster , but it was French engineer Michel Virlogeux who made it work .
A magnificent achievement , but whose name do people remember ?
In 2005 , Ellen MacArthur became the fastest person to sail round the globe , but little was made of Nigel Irens , who engineered her trimaran .
And the snobbery extends to education .
Design and technology is struggling to shake off a dreary image and is lumbered with a perception that it is secondary to so - called academic subjects .
Those who study it love it .
But half of the UK 's potential engineering stars are already out of the running by not even taking D&T as a GCSE .
This negativity pervades government and big business .
Engineers are n't trusted with money .
I could n't get anyone to finance my ideas and I could only get a loan by using my house as security .
But who understands a product better than the people behind it ?
Successful manufacturing is born of pioneering engineers and inventors .
Look at Japan 's Akio Morita at Sony and Soichiro Honda .
Both companies are finding current conditions tough , but you cannot ignore their spirit of inventiveness .
The problems come when the moneymen take the reins instead .
Take the British car industry .
In the 1950s , half of the world 's cars were manufactured in Britain .
But beginning with the formation of the British Motor Corporation , the car industry 's emphasis on invention gradually bowed to commercial pressure and government intervention .
In a desperate effort to balance the books , the industry was soon ground down by internal rivalries , lacklustre designs and labour disputes .
Good invention was forgotten .
Today , besides the recently appointed science minister Lord Drayson , engineers are not represented in the highest levels of British government .
In contrast , Hu Jintao , the Chinese president , graduated in hydraulic engineering from Beijing 's Tsinghua University , and Wen Jiabao , the Chinese prime minister , is a postgraduate engineer .
China produces 14 times as many engineers as we do .
While we will struggle to compete with growing industrial economies on the speed and efficiency of assembly lines , we can compete through ideas and technology .
To do this we need bright engineers .
But there are n't enough .
Just 4 % of undergraduates read engineering and fewer still actually end up in the profession .
This is worrying .
Making things is still the future .
Manufacturing accounts for half of our exports .
But we import more than we export to the total of around £ 8bn a month .
That 's more than £ 90bn a year in the red .
Unlike the US , we do n't have a huge internal economy we can rely on to help support us in this difficult time .
The UK can't afford to be protectionist - we 've always been exporters .
The trouble is that we 're running out of things to sell .
Besides the commercial world , the importance of engineering to us as a society cannot be underplayed .
Last year , the first British tidal turbine was connected to the national grid , producing enough power for 1,000 homes .
The UK accounts for half of Europe 's tidal power and it's been estimated that tidal energy could provide a fifth of British energy needs .
These initiatives are what we need to excite and inspire people .
If the government backed these large infrastructure projects , as in France , their importance would be recognised , helping to restore engineering 's contribution to our economy and society .
I worry that for all the rhetoric about addressing attitudes to science and industry , the action is not dramatic enough to shake the UK out of its apathy .
President Obama has got it right with his " smart grid " project , an electricity network that will use information technology to link the US to renewable sources of energy .
Not only will this create jobs and stimulate the US engineering , but in the long run it will save billions on the national electricity bill and cut the country 's carbon footprint .
Meanwhile , in the UK , projects get caught up in planning regulations , never to see the light of day .
We need to rediscover that fascination with that train set of our childhood .
We 've built our modern economy on the service sector , loans , banking and the dotcom bubble .
Now that 's collapsed , we should seek to base it on something long term with solid foundations .
If we do n't , we risk losing an already weakened position for good .
Making money from money should be replaced with making money from making .

Israel 's next prime minister , Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu , has said his incoming government will be a " partner for peace " with the Palestinians .
He said he would negotiate with the Palestinian Authority , a change of tack after being critical of previous talks .
Correspondents say the right - winger is trying to temper his image as an opponent of the peace process .
Palestinian officials said Mr Netanyahu must back the idea of a Palestinian state to be considered a partner .
The incoming prime minister , who previously led Israel from 1996 to 1999 , is also coming under international pressure to publicly support a two - state solution .
Obama factor Mr Netanyahu was speaking at an economic conference in Jerusalem , one day after broadening what had been a narrow right - wing and far - right coalition to include the centre - left Labour party .
He said his previously - stated intention to shore up the Palestinian economy would not be a substitute for peace talks .
An Israeli government that refuses the two - state solution will not be a partner to us
Saeb Erekat
Palestinian negotiator
Tough dealing ahead for Netanyahu Profile : Benjamin Netanyahu
Send us your comments " Peace : It 's not the last goal .
It 's a common and enduring goal for all Israelis and all Israeli governments - mine included .
" This means I will negotiate with the Palestinian Authority for peace , " he said .
" I think that the Palestinians should understand that they have in our government a partner for peace , for security and for rapid economic development of the Palestinian economy , " he added .
But Mr Netanyahu gave no hint of whether or not he would support the creation of an independent Palestinian state .
Palestinian negotiators have been urging him to back the plan , embraced by international mediators , including US President Barack Obama , and more moderate Israeli leaders .
In a televised news conference on Tuesday , US President Barack Obama - who also backs Palestinian statehood - said peace efforts would not get " easier " with a Netanyahu government , but were " just as necessary " .
Reacting to Mr Netanyahu 's comments , senior Palestinian officials were sceptical , but said the incoming prime minister would be judged on his actions .
" As far as we 're concerned an Israeli government that refuses the two - state solution and continues the settlement , will not be a partner to us , " senior negotiator Saeb Erekat told the BBC .
He said the new Israeli government must be obliged to sign up to past agreements , in the same way that the Palestinian Authority was forced to after the militant Hamas movement won its legislative elections in 2006 .
Labour division Mr Netanyahu's path to government was confirmed on Tuesday when Labour leader Ehud Barak agreed to join a coalition government with the Likud party .
But the defence minister 's decision provoked an angry reaction from some members within the leftist party , historic opponents of Likud .
Several Labour lawmakers have said they oppose the move and would not support Mr Barak on the issue .
Labour lawmaker Sheli Yachimovich said she would struggle to vote for a government including Avigdor Leiberman , leader of the far - right Yisrael Beiteinu party .
" I assume I 'll find a middle way ... and simply wo n't participate in the vote , " she said .
Fellow Knesset member Ophir Paz - Pines was even more scathing , declaring that former Labour prime ministers would be " turning in their graves " .
But Mr Barak 's deputy as defence minister , Matan Vilnai , told Israel Radio there was " no doubt " Labour would pull Mr Netanyahu 's government towards the centre .

The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced that the set of eligible collateral for loans extended by the Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility ( TALF ) is being expanded to include four additional categories of asset - backed securities ( ABS ) :
ABS backed by mortgage servicing advances
ABS backed by loans or leases relating to business equipment
ABS backed by leases of vehicle fleets
ABS backed by floorplan loans
Mortgage servicing advances are loans extended by residential mortgage servicers to cover payments missed by homeowners .
Accepting ABS backed by mortgage servicing advances should improve the servicers ' ability to work with homeowners to prevent avoidable foreclosures .
The additional new ABS categories complement the consumer and small business loan categories that were already eligible -- ABS backed by auto loans ( including auto floorplan loans ) , credit cards loans , student loans , and SBA - guaranteed small business loans .
The new categories of collateral will be eligible for the April TALF funding .
Additional details on the April funding will be released on March 24 .
Subscriptions for the April funding will be accepted on April 7 , and those loans will settle on April 14 .
The subscription period for the first TALF funding ends today .
The requested loans will settle on March 25 .
The Board authorized the TALF on November 24 , 2008 , under section 13 ( 3 ) of the Federal Reserve Act .
Under the TALF , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York extends three - year loans secured by AAA - rated ABS backed by newly and recently originated loans .
On February 10 , 2009 , the Board announced that it is prepared to undertake a significant expansion of the TALF .
Today 's announcement marks the first step in that expansion ; a number of other asset classes are under review .
A new term sheet and a revised frequently - asked - questions document are attached .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- British troops began their formal withdrawal from southern Iraq Tuesday , " marking the beginning of the end of the UK 's six - year combat mission in Iraq , " the Ministry of Defence announced .
The remaining 4,000 or so British troops in the sector will leave by summer , a ministry spokesman told CNN .
The spokesman declined to be named in line with MoD policy .
" You wo n't now see hundreds of troops coming out of Iraq every day , ( but ) this is the start of the end for British forces -- a period that will take until the end of July , " the spokesman said .

At worst , Hillary Transue thought she might get a stern lecture when she appeared before a judge for building a spoof MySpace page mocking the assistant principal at her high school in Wilkes - Barre , Pa .
She was a stellar student who had never been in trouble , and the page stated clearly at the bottom that it was just a joke .
Instead , the judge sentenced her to three months at a juvenile detention center on a charge of harassment .
She was handcuffed and taken away as her stunned parents stood by .
" I felt like I had been thrown into some surreal sort of nightmare , " said Hillary , 17 , who was sentenced in 2007 .
" All I wanted to know was how this could be fair and why the judge would do such a thing . "
The answers became a bit clearer on Thursday as the judge , Mark A. Ciavarella Jr. , and a colleague , Michael T. Conahan , appeared in federal court in Scranton , Pa. , to plead guilty to wire fraud and income tax fraud for taking more than $ 2.6 million in kickbacks to send teenagers to two privately run youth detention centers run by PA Child Care and a sister company , Western PA Child Care .
While prosecutors say that Judge Conahan , 56 , secured contracts for the two centers to house juvenile offenders , Judge Ciavarella , 58 , was the one who carried out the sentencing to keep the centers filled .
" In my entire career , I 've never heard of anything remotely approaching this , " said Senior Judge Arthur E. Grim , who was appointed by the State Supreme Court this week to determine what should be done with the estimated 5,000 juveniles who have been sentenced by Judge Ciavarella since the scheme started in 2003 .
Many of them were first - time offenders and some remain in detention .
The case has shocked Luzerne County , an area in northeastern Pennsylvania that has been battered by a loss of industrial jobs and the closing of most of its anthracite coal mines .
And it raised concerns about whether juveniles should be required to have counsel either before or during their appearances in court and whether juvenile courts should be open to the public or child advocates .
If the court agrees to the plea agreement , both judges will serve 87 months in federal prison and resign from the bench and bar .
They are expected to be sentenced in the next several months .
Lawyers for both men declined to comment .
Since state law forbids retirement benefits to judges convicted of a felony while in office , the judges would also lose their pensions .
With Judge Conahan serving as president judge in control of the budget and Judge Ciavarella overseeing the juvenile courts , they set the kickback scheme in motion in December 2002 , the authorities said .
They shut down the county - run juvenile detention center , arguing that it was in poor condition , the authorities said , and maintained that the county had no choice but to send detained juveniles to the newly built private detention centers .
Prosecutors say the judges tried to conceal the kickbacks as payments to a company they control in Florida .
Though he pleaded guilty to the charges Thursday , Judge Ciavarella has denied sentencing juveniles who did not deserve it or sending them to the detention centers in a quid pro quo with the centers .

But Assistant United States Attorney Gordon A. Zubrod said after the hearing that the government continues to charge a quid pro quo .
" We 're not negotiating that , no , " Mr. Zubrod said .
" We 're not backing off . "
No charges have been filed against executives of the detention centers .
Prosecutors said the investigation into the case was continuing .
For years , youth advocacy groups complained that Judge Ciavarella was unusually harsh .
He sent a quarter of his juvenile defendants to detention centers from 2002 to 2006 , compared with a state rate of 1 in 10 .
He also routinely ignored requests for leniency made by prosecutors and probation officers .
" The juvenile system , by design , is intended to be a less punitive system than the adult system , and yet here were scores of children with very minor infractions having their lives ruined , " said Marsha Levick , a lawyer with the Philadelphia - based Juvenile Law Center .
" There was a culture of intimidation surrounding this judge and no one was willing to speak up about the sentences he was handing down . "
Last year , the Juvenile Law Center , which had raised concerns about Judge Ciavarella in the past , filed a motion to the State Supreme Court about more than 500 juveniles who had appeared before the judge without representation .
The court originally rejected the petition , but recently reversed that decision .
The United States Supreme Court ruled in 1967 that children have a constitutional right to counsel .
But in Pennsylvania , as in 20 other states , children can waive counsel , and about half of the children that Judge Ciavarella sentenced had chosen to do so .
Only Illinois , New Mexico and North Carolina require juveniles to have representation when they appear before judges .
Clay Yeager , the former director of the Office of Juvenile Justice in Pennsylvania , said typical juvenile proceedings are kept closed to the public to protect the privacy of children .
" But they are kept open to probation officers , district attorneys , and public defenders , all of whom are sworn to protect the interests of children , " he said .
" It 's pretty clear those people did n't do their jobs . "
On Thursday in Federal District Court in Scranton , more than 80 people packed every available seat in the courtroom .
At one point , as Assistant United States Attorney William S. Houser explained to Judge Edwin M. Kosik that the government was willing to reach a plea agreement with the men because the case involved " complex charges that could have resulted in years of litigation , " one man sitting in the audience said " bull " loud enough to be heard in the courtroom .
One of the parents at the hearing was Susan Mishanski of Hanover Township .
Her son , Kevin , now 18 , was sentenced to 90 days in a detention facility last year in a simple assault case that everyone had told her would result in probation , since Kevin had never been in trouble and the boy he hit had only a black eye .
" It 's horrible to have your child taken away in shackles right in front of you when you think you 're going home with him , " she said .
" It was nice to see them sitting on the other side of the bench . "
Nevertheless , Edward M. Liddy , the chief executive of A.I.G. , explained to investors last week that “ the vast majority ” of taxpayer funds “ have passed through A.I.G. to other financial institutions ” as the company unwound deals with its customers .
On Wall Street , those customers are known as “ counterparties , ” and Mr. Liddy would n’t provide details on who the counterparties were or how much they received .
But a person briefed on the deals said A.I.G. ’s former customers include Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch and two large French banks , Société Générale and Calyon .
All the banks declined to comment .
How much money has gone to counterparties since the company ’s collapse ?
The person briefed on the deals put the figure at around $ 50 billion .
Unfortunately , that is likely to rise .
According to its most recent financial statements , A.I.G. had $ 302 billion in credit insurance commitments at the end of 2008 .
Of course , the company is not going to have to make good on all that insurance : the underlying securities are not all going to zero .
But as the economy deteriorates , A.I.G. ’s insurance bets certainly become more perilous .
And because most of A.I.G. ’s swaps are known as the “ pay as you go type , ” collateral must be supplied when the underlying debt declines in value .
Swap arrangements made by other insurers require payments only if a default occurs .
So the meter is constantly running at A.I.G.
Just as quickly as taxpayer funds flow into the firm , chunks of it go right out the door to settle derivatives claims .
A.I.G.’s insurance commitment stood at “ only ” $ 302 billion in part because the government has already voided $ 62 billion of the protection A.I.G. had written on pools of especially toxic securities .
The underlying collateral on those contracts , valued at about $ 32 billion or so , now sits in a facility that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York oversees and which we , the taxpayers , own .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Despite suggestions that the economic recession might cause religiosity among Americans to increase , there has been no evident change over the past 15 months in either Americans ' self - reported church attendance or the importance of religion in their daily lives .
Forty - two percent on average have reported attending church every week or nearly every week during that time , and 65 % have reported that religion is important in their daily lives .
These results are based on an analysis of more than 425,000 interviews Gallup has conducted since January 2008 .
It is not an unreasonable conjecture that the current recession would cause Americans to increasingly turn to religion as a surcease from their economic or personal sorrow .
But that does not appear to be the case .
Even as the percentage of Americans who are negative about the economy has increased , particularly from September through December of last year , there have been no significant changes in the percentages of Americans who say religion is important in their daily lives , or who report attending church weekly or almost every week .
No Change Among Partisan Groups
Although there have been week - to - week fluctuations on these measures among Democrats , independents , and Republicans , there has also been no systematic change in religious adherence evident among any of these partisan groups over the last 15 months .
In general , as is seen in the accompanying charts , Republicans are the most religious of the three partisan groups , and have remained so over the past year .
Independents are slightly more religious than Democrats , but the same relative patterns of religiosity among these groups have continued since January of last year .
Implications
The two questions reviewed in this analysis represent fairly general measures of religiosity .
Still , it would be expected that if there were an overall turn toward religion in these deeply troubled times , it would be reflected as an uptick in the average percentage of Americans saying religion is important and / or in self - reported church attendance .
Neither has happened .
These appear to be very steady indicators that have not been affected by the abrupt changes in the economic climate .
This is not to rule out the possibility that the recession has caused changes in the religiosity of Americans in ways that would not be captured in these measures .
For example , Americans could be praying more often .
Or those who are already religious ( as measured by these questions ) could be more intense in their religious commitment now .
But at least as far as self - reports of church attendance and religious importance go , Gallup finds no evidence of a recession - driven turn to religion .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 428,516 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted January 2008 through March 15 , 2009 , as part of Gallup Poll Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1 percentage point .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Israelis went to the polls Tuesday to elect a new parliament and prime minister .
By yesterday , despite high turnout and 99 % of the vote counted , nearly everything was clear except the actual winner .
Chalk that up to an electoral system based on proportional representation , which encourages smaller or one - issue parties to compete rather than merge with larger parties .
The result , this time , was that by early Wednesday morning two candidates could credibly claim to have won .

One year ago , Bear Stearns faced collapse when its short - term lenders stopped rolling over their loans to the investment bank .
The federal government and the FED stepped in .
They financed and brought about an acquisition by the JP Morgan Chase ( JPM ) bank .
The reason for this was systemic risk .
The FED feared that a Bear Stearns failure would cause the financial system to melt down when one party after another could not pay off on contracts .
JPM assured others that Bear would honor its contracts .
The chairman and chief executive officer of JPM said " Bear Stearns ’ clients and counterparties should feel secure that JPMorgan is guaranteeing Bear Stearns ’ counterparty risk .
We welcome their clients , counterparties , and employees to our firm , and we are glad to be their partner . "
Systemic risk is also the reason why the federal government and FED bailed out the AIG company .
That bailout is a debacle .
The government began by paying off in full a number of major banks that were AIG counterparties .
That was not enough .
The government is now into its fourth " plan . "
The cash infusions have risen to $ 180 billion with no end in sight .
Congress has finally got around to wondering publicly who got the money , although this has been known for months .
It is painfully clear that the federal government and the FED , who nurtured the financial catastrophe in the first place , have wasted and are still wasting trillions of dollars without solving the problem that they set out to solve , which is systemic risk .
One would hope that they will eventually realize that solving this problem is beyond their financial means and beyond their operational capacities .
It is no doubt too much to hope that they realize that their bailouts and programs are not only preventing the resolution of the systemic risk problem but also making it worse .
And it is beyond hope that they ever understand that the federal government and the FED are themselves responsible for the high degree of systemic risk of the financial and monetary system .
They built the system .
What is systemic risk anyway ?
See here and here for the conventional wisdom .
Invariably the example of a run on a bank will come up .
Bear Stearns was such a case .
The case of Long - Term Capital Management ( not aptly named ) in 1998 is cited as a recent example .
The idea is that when one bank ( or important company ) fails , it can not pay those whom it owes .
They may then fail to pay others whom they owe , so that they fail .
The others whom they owe may also then fail .
The systemic risk is a chain reaction of failures that disrupts the existing financial arrangements , known ominously as the system .
God forbid that anything should happen to the system , which is rather like the hallowed Union .
Systemic risk and bank failures will then be invoked to explain the Great Depression .
The misdirected attention will be on the bank failures , not on the fact that the Federal Reserve System ( System ! ) lay at the heart of the matter .
Let us look at this systemic risk just a trifle more deeply than our superficial rulers or superficial court lawyers , economists , and business moguls who can see no way out but to support the government and the FED .
Systemic risk is a function of the risks that an individual firm takes on .
A firm that lends to a Bear Stearns is actually supposed to investigate the credit - worthiness of Bear .
It is not supposed to put all of its eggs in one Bear basket .
A firm that obtains a credit default guarantee from AIG is actually supposed to check up on AIG and find out if that guarantee means anything or whether it ’s just an empty promise .
But if there is a great big sugar daddy or two in the background who are known to bail out an LCTM or to supply bank reserves when a bank gets short or to bail out an entire economy in recession or to work with other countries to save currencies and entire weak banking systems that are going under , and if these sugar daddies insure bank deposits and have a too - big - to - fail policy and coddle a select group of government bond dealers and wink at large bank consolidations and encourage financial leverage and allow off - balance - sheet irregularities , then the lending guards and the contracting guards will come down .
The precautions will be relaxed .
The individual firms will take on more risk and the systemic risk will rise .
Even without federal government and central - banking sugar daddies , it is more than possible that booms will engender undue confidence .
It is more than possible , it is factual , that banks will issue too many credits or too many questionable credits and create an unsustainable boom .
It is very likely that firms will take on too much leverage .
It is likely that too much debt will be issued against collateral values that are being maintained by bubble prices that are unsustainable .
Systemic risk will not disappear even with the government and the FED removed as would - be guarantors against all ills .
But firms who must operate in a private economy will be pulled up short very fast when they undertake excessive risks .
If history does not teach and theory does not teach , then failure is the teacher .
There can not be a market system or a profit - and - loss system without losers .
The winners will be those who learn how to navigate the uncertainties and who learn how to assess the risks of their counterparties in financial dealings .
Systemic risk is mitigated when individual firms mitigate their own risks .
It is not mitigated when those risks are centralized in a few large firms with a government backup .
That creates systemic risk .
Decentralization and risk - avoidance mitigate systemic risk .
Both of those are encouraged in money , capital , and banking markets not controlled and regulated by the federal government and the FED .
The systemic risk of counterparties and the systemic risk of unknown valuations of assets held by financial firms are no closer to resolution today than a year ago .
See here .
We now have new and enhanced systemic risks .
They include the risk of the FED ’s balance sheet , currency risk , and government bond default risk .
There is actually an enhanced risk of wealth destruction due to the programs being broached by the Obama government that promise a stagnant , over - taxed , and inefficient economy .
A drop of stock prices of 75 — 90 percent is not out of the question .
The way to have stemmed the follow - on value destruction engineered by the federal government and the FED and to have lanced the existing financial boil was to have let Bear Stearns and AIG fail .
The same holds true today for all those fine firms that the federal government has decided to aid , like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
They are black holes one and all .
Failure was the answer then and it is the answer now .
Failure resolves the risks .
The counterparties take their losses .
If some go under , they go under .
No one knows who has the losses and how far they go .
No one actually knows if there will be a chain reaction .
This includes the government .
That is why failure is needed to clear up the situation .
Government cannot identify the systemic elements much less know what to do about them .
Those elements are buried on the balance sheets of firms all over the world .
Failure is the only known method to clear up the uncertainties .
The failed firms may then re-organize and re-capitalize .
Warren Buffet observed
“ It ’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who ’s been swimming naked . ”
Failure allows investors to learn what the loans are actually worth that are now being held by banks .
Failure allows investors to sift the good banks from the bad banks , or they start brand new banks .
They , not the government , decide who should get funding and who should not .
Failure chastens those who fail and those who do not fail .
It reduces the element of moral hazard .
It gives society a chance to learn and remember valuable lessons .
The lesson today is that the appropriate remedy for a financial firm that has failed is to let it fail .
There have been chain reactions in the past in which a series of failures occurred .
We survived .
Business slowdowns occurred .
They were inevitable as a consequence of the prior boom ’s excesses .
There is no viable theory and no evidence that government action has mitigated this sequence of events .
There is good theory and evidence that government actions has made matters worse .
In the 1930s , the NRA ( found unconstitutional ) created immense confusion .
The Wagner Act raised wages and contributed to the 1937 drop in business as did various regulations of the newly - formed SEC .
We have a year of government and FED action behind us now , and we can see plainly that their costly actions have not only failed , but that they have raised the odds of new and greater failures .
The same was true in the 1930s , but that truth was submerged so that government could justify its greater power and control .
Failure is the only and correct remedy to bring down the systemic risk and to allow a healthy set of financial institutions to arise .
Social learning is not easy .
If we do not learn from appropriate theory , then failure itself must teach us .
But large - scale financial and economic catastrophes do not occur often .
Every 60 — 80 years , as in 1873 and 1929 and 2007 , we get one .
During and afterwards , we debate what happened and why it happened .
The media and airwaves are filled with confusing and often wrong answers .
Congress enacts measures that make matters worse .
The political system encourages wrong answers and it seeks out and supports those economists who parrot the false theories that justify the biases of the ruling politicians .
The political system impedes social learning .
That system claims to be saving the economic system , but it is only vastly increasing the systemic risk .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
The relative cost of owning versus renting is swinging back in favor of homeownership in some U.S. markets , buoyed by several quarters of sharp declines in home prices .
At the height of the housing boom , as home prices surged , demand for rentals started to rise as the gap between owning and renting widened significantly .
Even after the housing market soured , apartment demand grew as former homeowners became renters , allowing landlords to push healthy rent increases .
Now , ...
It travels with me , shrunken , stained , unwanted .
I try to get rid of it , but no one will take AJ55758031 .
They hold it to the light , tug at its edges , hand it back with whispered disgust .
“ Not this one , mister , ” they say as I fold it away .
It was years ago in Baghdad , after the morning mortar rounds thudded over the marshes on the Tigris , that the $ 100 bill smeared with blood came into my possession .
Saad Khalaf knocked on the door and stepped into my room ; he was healing , a big man with a little - boy smile and milky - colored scars on his face , like squiggles on a map .
He was with a friend whose English was better than his .
Advertisement
“ He wants to ask you something , ” said the friend , who held out what I was about to inherit .
“ It ’s no good .
Saad had it in his pocket when the bomb exploded .
You see this , it ’s Saad ’s blood .
He tried to wash it , but it would n’t come out , and now it ’s stained and not the same size as other ones .
Can you give him a new one and take this one ?
Maybe you can find a place in another country that will accept it . ”
I examined it and glanced at Saad .
It ’s hard for a man to ask another man for a favor .
Saad had been a wedding photographer , but after the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq the mood for betrothal waned .
The Times hired him as a photographer and driver , and on New Year ’s Eve 2003 , he was sitting with colleagues at a restaurant when a suicide bomber drove a car through the back wall .
Saad almost died .
He spent weeks recovering , and when he was on his feet again , he noticed that part of his salary -- a $ 100 bill -- was stiff and dark .
The money - changers would n’t take it ; shop owners brushed it aside .
They craved the clean and the crisp .
War zones are marred , messy places , but the currency that moves them must shine with a freshness that says “ you can believe in this . ”
I took the bill and gave Saad a new one .
He exhaled relief and left my room .
The bill has stayed folded in my pocket or in an envelope I keep with travel cash .
Nobody wants blood money .
Nations spend billions of dollars to wage war , but a $ 100 bill smudged with a man ’s blood makes the superstitious queasy .
The note is my companion , a reminder , like a curled picture that resurfaces from the back of a forgotten drawer , of the cost of conflict and the price of moving on .
Iknow the bill intimately : Series 1996 , signed by then -Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin .
Its path most likely wound from a bank in Jordan across nine hours of dangerous desert to a safe in Baghdad , where it was divvied for payroll and one day tucked into Saad ’s pocket .
The paper is coarse from scrubbing and the taint of blood is richest between Benjamin Franklin ’s left eye and a border of pretty calligraphy .

The bill has traveled with me across the Middle East , from Tunis to Dubai , from Damascus to Beirut , through deserts , cities and seasides , a disfigured ghost , appearing and reappearing .
And all the while I ’ve heard : “ Not this one , mister . ”
It accompanies me on my visits to Iraq .
It was there when I met a holy man who washed bullet - ripped bodies with rose water , when I sipped tea with a prayer caller in a mosque surrounded by gunmen , heard mothers wail , watched the dead drop into coffins and fathers curse the dirt of graves .
It was there when I trailed Humvees along blast walls painted in colors to help Iraqis forget that life should be something better than running from exploding marketplaces and hiding in the lantern light .
It was poolside when I floated beneath a moon at a Baghdad hotel , my ears submerged , helicopters tracing overhead like black beetles , the thumps of explosions vibrating in the water around me .
It was there in those sleepless hours when I pulled back the curtain and watched through a taped window as a sandstorm draped the city and kept the mortars silent .
Even when I tried to sneak the note into small stacks of healthy bills , hoping a thumb would flick so quickly that it would n’t be noticed , I watched as the money - changer , whose eyes were sharper than a crow ’s , set Saad ’s bill apart .

“ What ’s this ? ”
“ Blood . ”
“ Take it back , man . ”
It was with me in Jerusalem during the Gaza siege in January when I watched a new president take over in Washington as the old one lifted away in the winter chill .
Advertisement
There are promises to draw down U.S. troops in Iraq by 2010 .
Saddam Hussein seems a vision from a distant dream , shaking his fists from balconies as armies gathered .
Iraq is better , on the mend .
Or so it seems on many days .
Saad has a wife and a family , his scars are like faraway constellations , barely seen .
A fragile page turned .
But I remember climbing the mountains of northern Iraq ; snow on the ridges , starlight above .
Kurdish fighters ate sheep by a campfire , joking the way nervous men do , and then they grabbed their cold guns , and descended into the valley to look for the enemy , their footsteps softening , a gruff communion of souls so beautifully balanced between joy and death .
And the little girl lying in a hospital bed with a bullet in her brain .
Her head was swelling , hour by hour , a pale balloon with shrinking eyes .
The hospital did n’t have the tools to operate ; by nightfall she was dead .
Just like the bearded militant , his muddy clothes cut away in a candlelit mosque , his blood spreading over the stone floor , his warriors weeping around him until dawn .

The images go on and on ; others are yet to be collected , but they are out there .
The $ 100 bill will stay with me , never buying anything , but reminding me of stories told in a country at war .

And while he said he was personally opposed to gay marriage , he came out forcefully against a Constitutional amendment banning it — as the Republican Party platform recommends for both gay marriage and abortion .
“ Just as a general principle , I do n’t like mucking around with the Constitution .
I ’m sorry , I just do n’t , ” he told the magazine .
Oh , it ’s even worse .
I just read the GQ interview with Steele that this comes from .
It sure sounds to me like Steele would open to letting states legalize gay marriage if they so choose .
In any case , he ’s clearly opposed to the constitutional amendment banning gay marriage , even though it ’s a key plank in the party platform and one of the top two priorities for the religious right .
GQ : So you think it ’s a state issue ?
STEELE : Absolutely .
Just as a general principle , I do n’t like mucking around with the Constitution .
I ’m sorry , I just do n’t .
I think , you know , in a pluralistic , dynamic society as the one that we have , every five years you can have a constitutional convention about something , you know ?
I do n’t think we should be , you know , dancing around and trying to amend it every time I ’ve got a social issue or a political issue or a business issue that I want to get addressed .
Having said that , I think that the states are the best laboratory , the best place for those decisions to be made , because they will then reflect the majority of the community in which the issue is raised .
And that ’s exactly what a republic is all about .
That was n’t just a statement of opposition to the amendment , it was kind of a rant against the amendment .
I mean , I ’m impressed as hell that he ’s coming out with all of these quite decent pronouncements , but he is such toast .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits jumped to a 26 - year high last week , according to government data on Thursday that pointed to a rapid deterioration in the economy .
U.S. non-farm productivity rose in the fourth quarter , data showed on Thursday , as companies reduced working hours to cope with a worsening economic climate .
KEY POINTS :
JOBLESS CLAIMS : * The number of people staying on the benefit rolls hit a record high in the week ended January 24 , showing the weak labor market has yet to hit bottom .
*
The department said initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits rose 35,000 to a seasonally adjusted 626,000 in the week ended January 31 , the highest since the week ending October 30 , 1982 . *
The prior week ’s number was revised up to 591,000 from 588,000 .
* Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast 585,000 new claims . *
The number of people staying on the benefits roll after drawing an initial week of aid surged by 20,000 to a record 4.788 million in the week ended January 24 , the latest week for which the data is available , from 4.768 million the previous week .
*
The four - week moving average for new claims , considered to be a better gauge of underlying trends as it irons out week - to - week volatility , rose to 582,250 , the highest reading since the week ending December 4 , 1982 .
NON - FARM PRODUCTIVITY
* The Labor Department said non-farm productivity rose at a 3.2 percent annual rate from the 1.5 percent increase in the third quarter , while output plunged 5.5 percent , falling at the fastest pace since the first quarter of 1982 .
* U.S. manufacturing continued to suffer , with productivity declining at a 3 percent pace after a record 3.3 percent decline in the third quarter .
* Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast productivity increasing at a 1.4 percent rate .
* Unit labor costs , a gauge of inflation and profit pressures closely watched by the Federal Reserve , were up 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter , the preliminary report showed , well below Wall Street ’s estimates for a 3 percent increase .
*
The number of hours worked dropped at an 8.4 percent annual rate during the fourth quarter , the lowest since the first quarter of 1975 .

“ We saw the stock market drop because of the jump in jobless claims and that gave some support to the Treasury market .
Jobless claims are still rising .
There ’s no sign of any stabilization yet in the labor market .
“ Companies are still trying to cut costs to bring them into line with their weak sales .
The fourth - quarter productivity numbers we saw show that they are moving in that direction .
Productivity was stronger than expected and unit labor costs rose less than expected .
It looks like there will be some more cost - cutting here in the first quarter . ”
BORIS SCHLOSSBERG , DIRECTOR , CURRENCY RESEARCH , GFT , NEW YORK :
“ It ’s pretty ugly .
Clearly risk is off the table .
And this has hurt the euro against the dollar because risk - aversion flows are going once again into the dollar .
This jobless report means the February jobs number could be really bad and goes to show that the economy is convulsing and contracting .
The economy clearly is in desperate need of a stimulus . ”
FRANK LESH , FUTURES ANALYST , BROKER , FUTUREPATH TRADING LLC ,
CHICAGO :
“ Not good .
It ’s a new high , and it took us down in the futures .
It ’s a negative .
There ’s some selling in the markets on it .
I think this is a precursor for tomorrow , and maybe tomorrow ’s numbers will be pushed up after people see this .
“ On the other hand , we ’re starting to get used to these awful numbers , so it does n’t have quite the shock value that it once had , but its not going to create any buying , that ’s for sure .
But largely I would say that it ’s been priced into the market by now . ”
LOU BRIEN , MARKET STRATEGIST , DRW TRADING GROUP , CHICAGO :
“ Treasuries obviously caught a bid off higher - than - expected weekly jobless claims but also the productivity numbers are net positive for the Treasury market as well .
These show higher productivity and lower unit labor costs .
All things being equal it should give the Treasury market a bid . ”
MARKET REACTION : STOCKS : U.S. equity index futures extend losses after initial jobless claims data .
BONDS : U.S. Treasury debt prices extend gains .
DOLLAR : U.S. dollar gains versus euro .
know
I had an epiphany this morning I had to get down and out there .
I 'm not advocating anything here , and I know some will see this as common sense while others will see it as paranoia .
Empower yourself , read it and judge how you feel .
I know there 's more to be said and looked at , so feel free to comment / suggest anything you feel should be added , changed , or re-evaluated .
Knowledge is power .
Always keep an open mind .
This is just what my research has turned up , and god( dess / whoever ) knows I 'm just one person with one point of view .
The Balancing Act.FACT : Big Business ( i.e. Corporations / wealthy individuals ) have a major effect on global affairs .
( all that money ! )
FACT : CFR ( Council on Foreign Relations ) Bilderberg , Trilateral Commission , and all levels of US .
Gov't show interlinking connections ( I.E . There is undeniable heavy corporate influence on the Gov't . )
FACT : The media , which is owned by ( is ) Corporate interests , is moderated by Gov't agencies that show heavy concentrations of people tied into corporate interest .
FACT : Most people in the United States watch T.V.
Here 's what I think is going on : Science has told us that there 's no proof either way of magic , the soul , miracles , or anything else supernatural or otherworldly .
No proof is the term they use , and it's a convenient loophole that allows an escape path if new evidence is found .
But as society grows and gets harder to govern , more and more maverick scientists are finding that there is in fact proof for psychic phenomena , magic , miracles , incorporeal energy and the like .
A point of interest is that the supernatural phenomena that are generally dismissed are those relating to personal empowerment , that is , the ability to stand up and effect the world around you on a greater scale than yourself , the ability to perform miracles and modify the unseen .
Who would benefit from a mass of people that believe they have no personal power ?
Those currently in power .
Who is currently in power ?
Many would say the biggest sway is held by Corporate , and yes , the big wigs do meet to discuss " secret " matters .
( Bilderberg , Trilateral , etc . ) So who watches Science for unbiased results ?
The UCS ( Union of Concerned Scientists ) whose reputed purpose is to keep corporate influences from effecting the progress of science or the release of data to the public .
Funny , since the UCS is greatly influenced by organizations like the CFR and long - standing corporate - linked families like the Rockefellers , The Rothschilds , and the Warburgs .
So essentially , the same people who would influence science negatively are entrusted with watching to make sure it does n't happen .
So what are we left with ?
There is still religion .
Mainstream America ( i.e. the bulk of the population ) claims to be Christian .
But if a person claims to be Christian and yet does not follow Christ 's teachings , does n't read the bible , does n't believe they have the power to preform miracles as Jesus did ( and Jesus said we all have the power to be like him ) indeed has no inkling of these ideas at all , then where does their " faith " come from ? •
Parents / relatives • Society as a whole • Church ( how many people who claim they are Christian go to Church ? ) •
The Media .
Assuming that Parents / Relatives and Society are given religion and faith through these four routes , that leaves Church and The Media as the two remaining major influences present .
Who controls the Media ?
Big Corporate .
Again , we come back to cost / benefit for those in power .
Church is a maverick variable – they are institutions not technically condoned by the bible that are effected by a conglomeration of Media programming and cater to the mainstream herd mentality ( in order to keep the donations up ) the latter of which is heavily effected by the Media .
This does not mean that Christianity or Christians are wrong or evil– True Christians , people who follow Christ 's teachings , read the bible and seek out unmodified biblical documents to compare and contrast in their own minds are empowered individuals .
They have choice , and they exercise it .
So why Christianity and not , say , Judaism , or maybe Islam ?
Simple .•
It 's widespread in the United States •
It 's naturally xenophobic ( i.e . One god before all others mentality ) •
People accept it without question when it 's doctrines are modified by people in power ( Priests , Dream of the Rood , Pope , King James , Presidents ) What we have here in the United States is less Christianity , however , than a hybridized form of quasi - faith that people cling to for the following reasons : •
It 's easy ( Everybody 's doing it . ) •
It 's the predominant religion of " Good Guys " in mainstream media today . •
It 's all inclusive ( Many people are Christian because they were " raised that way " . )
There is nothing in here about personal empowerment .
This new form of Christianity is in fact , anti-empowerment .
It teaches us that Christ was an amazing man , but does not empower us to become like him .
In fact , if you look closely , you will find that " Christian " has become more of a label than a religious bent– Science ( as it stands now ) predominantly discourages religion in all its forms , decrying anything " Miraculous " or " Magical " as false .
Considering the influence science has over the minds of people ( and the increasing correlation between a college education and a good job ) and the division in society as a whole between " Science " and " God " ( Rather like Republican and Democrat ) we end up with three ( predominantly ) groups of people .
Those who are effected solely by the media and this quasi religion ( and decry science ) , those who are effected solely by the doctrines of science ( and decry anything faith ) and the biggest group of the three , those who stand in the middle , unsure , unwilling to completely trust either .
None of these are empowered by their stance .
They are instead bitterly divided against one another , each of the extremes with their own overwhelming , compelling evidences ( where does this evidence ultimately come from ? ) rattling their cages on either side of the mainstream and scaring people into line .
And so , the mainstream is put into a finely tuned balancing act .
By keeping mainstream society balanced where it is between faith and atheism , the individual 's efficiency is increased .
People have a god and a belief system to cling to when things get tough ( i.e. through prayer ) though science has cast enough doubt upon it ( and the existence of god ) to reduce it to a simple comfort mechanism .
Sure , most people will say " I am Christian ! " and defend the notion to the death no matter how " sinful " their lifestyle is .
( this term is up for interpretation– many of the things that are considered sinful today were not so according to the teachings of Christ ) but in the end , few people actually follow the teachings of Christ or show any sort of real " belief " in their faith beyond simply claiming it ( it becomes a defense mechanism here – everybody 's doing it , and it 's safer to be part of the herd than apart from it )
So why the balancing act ?
Consider the fact that many philosophers have agreed that if it were absolutely proved that there is nothing " spiritual , " no soul , nothing , that we are simply meat and bone and when we die we will be no more in any state , then society would be ungovernable .
If this is your only life and then it 's totally done , nothing , no more , who would want to be stuck where they are ?
If there are no consequences ( except the physical – such as jail or death ) then why not just go out and steal what you need , kill whoever gets in your way , run naked in the streets , break every commandment ?
It becomes " Why die sooner ? " v.s. " Death comes anyway , have fun " very quickly .
So we have a god to keep the mainstream in check .
When police and legal institutions are n't enough , we have someone unescapable at the end of the road in the terrifying domain of death that will judge you and commit you to an eternity of hellfire if you do n't stand in line with everyone else .
Now I 'm not saying that there is n't such a god ( if you want to believe in him ) but I doubt his agenda ( and measure of a good human being ) is the same as Big Corporate's .
When these two ideas come together in the mainstream , we essentially end up with people confused and doubting that there is any sort of afterlife .
This leads to carefully restrained atheist tendencies ( i.e. impulsivity ) without the chaotic nature of those who " know " there is nothing judging them .
How does this manifest ?
Just look at what most people do their entire lives –
They go to work , then they party , they forget about anything than what 's right in front of them and just " go " until retirement ( and / or death ) claims them .
They do not reach out and try to effect things , they are not empowered , and as any empowered individual will tell you , no form of prayer or ritual works unless you whole - heartedlyit will .
Fresh off his stint as a war correspondent , Joe the Plumber will talk strategy with Hill Republicans .
Joe the Plumber advises GOP-ers
Fresh off his stint as a war correspondent in Gaza , Joe the Plumber is now doing political strategy with Republicans .
When GOP congressional aides gather Tuesday morning for a meeting of the Conservative Working Group , Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher – more commonly known as Joe the Plumber — will be their featured guest .
This group is an organization of conservative Capitol Hill staffers who meet regularly to chart GOP strategy for the week .

Wurzelbacher , who became a household name during the presidential election , will be focusing his talk on the proposed stimulus package .
He 's apparently not a fan of the economic rescue package , according to members of the group .
If nothing else , GOP aides are using the appearance to get staffers to attend the 9 a.m meeting .
“ In case you were n’t planning to attend CWG tomorrow morning , you might want to reconsider because Joe the Plumber will be joining us ! ” Kimberly Wallner , an aide to South Carolina Sen .
Jim DeMint , wrote in a message to her e-mail list this afternoon .
Last month , Wurzelbacher did a brief stint as a war reporter for the conservative web site pjtv.com .
In the UK women are encouraged to sip water during birth Women who drink too much water during labour are at greater than normal risk of a potentially dangerous condition , say scientists .
A Swedish study , published in the journal BJOG , revealed women who drank more than 2.5 litres during labour had a 25 % chance of hyponatraemia .
It can produce headaches , nausea and vomiting , or more severe problems if left unchecked .
UK midwives said women were encouraged to sip water , rather than drink lots .
In general , one can trust one 's natural body messages , and that we only need to drink more when we feel thirsty
Professor Philip Steer
Editor - in - Chief , BJOG Hyponatraemia results when an excess of water means that the levels of sodium in the bloodstream fall .
In the worst cases , it can cause swelling of the brain , or even coma , although none of the women in the study were affected to this extent .
The research involved 287 volunteers , who were allowed to drink freely during labour , with blood samples taken on admission to hospital , and again after the birth .
In total , 61 women drank more than 2.5 litres , and 16 of these were found to have hyponatraemia .
Dr Vibeke Moen , from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden , which led the research , said : " We conclude that hyponatraemia is not uncommon following labour , and is potentially harmful , but is also easily avoidable .
" Women should not be encouraged to drink excessively during labour , and the policy of liberal fluid administration should be questioned . "
She said that other results linking lower blood sodium levels with longer labours needed to be investigated , as the condition might be influencing the ability of the womb to contract .
Unhealthy habit Professor Philip Steer , the editor in chief of obstetrics and gynaecology journal BJOG , said : " At one time , a myth became prevalent that drinking lots of water each day was a healthy habit .
" However , recent research shows clearly that in general , one can trust one 's natural body messages , and that we only need to drink more when we feel thirsty . "
He said that doctors and midwives should keep a note of how much women drink in labour .
Gail Johnson , from the Royal College of Midwives , said that she was not aware of any trend among midwives to ask women to drink , even when not thirsty .
She said : " We 're not encouraging women to drink massive amounts of water , although perhaps we might suggest they take a sip to keep their mouths moist .
" One of the reasons is that the stomach does not empty as efficiently during labour , so drinking lots increases the risk of vomiting .
" The key thing is for the woman to listen to what her own body is telling her - many women would not want to drink much at all . "

Supreme Court strikes down Internet censorship law Nick Cargo
Published : Wednesday January 21 , 2009
Print This Email This
It took ten years , but free speech advocates are celebrating the demise of a controversial law they said violated the First and Fifth Amendments in its aims to " protect children . "
The American Civil Liberties Union announced Wednesday that the Supreme Court will not hear Mukasey v. ACLU , the Bush administration 's attempt to appeal federal court rulings against the Child Online Protection Act ( COPA ) , passed by Congress in 1998 after the fall of the 1996 Communications Decency Act .
" For over a decade the government has been trying to thwart freedom of speech on the Internet , and for years the courts have been finding the attempts unconstitutional , " said ACLU senior staff attorney and lead counsel Chris Hansen .
" It is not the role of the government to decide what people can see and do on the Internet .
Those are personal decisions that should be made by individuals and their families . "
Federal Judge Lowell A. Reed Jr. in Philadelphia struck the first blow to the law with an injunction in 1999 , the Third Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals upholding the decision in June 2000 .
The Supreme Court concurred in June 2004 , pending trial .
Judge Reed , in early 2007 , again ruled COPA unconstitutional , leading to Mukasey .
COPA , as codified , would have made it an offense punishable by a fine up to $ 50,000 and / or up to 6 months ' imprisonment for transmitting " any material that is harmful to minors " for commercial purposes on the World Wide Web if not put behind a safeguard such as a requirement for payment or a special access code .
Additional fines would have been levied for " intentionally " violating the law .
Material deemed " harmful to minors " under COPA included written , photographic , recorded and otherwise " communicated " material that , based on the average person 's interpretation of " contemporary community standards , " is " obscene " or " designed to appeal to , or is designed to pander to , the prurient interest . "
The law further reads that any material that " depicts , describes , or represents , in a manner patently offensive with respect to minors , an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact , an actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual act , or a lewd exhibition of the genitals or post - pubescent female breast , " that " taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political or scientific value for minors . "
Among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit , filed by the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation was novelist and activist Patricia Nell Warren of Wildcat Press .
" Wildcat 's position was this , " she said .
" [ These ] two bills were supposedly aimed at hard - core porn but they were so broadly written that they would be used to criminalize the commercial provision of all kinds of legitimate content to minors on the Internet , whether health information or literature .
And such laws definitely would be used by ultraconservatives to limit availability of LGBT content on the Web .
For this reason , we felt that it was important for us , as a gay - owned small press , to participate in these lawsuits .
The Philadelphia Gay News was also involved .
" The Supreme Court decision puts the onus where it belongs -- on parents , who have the right to use software filters to try keeping their minor kids from viewing material that they disapprove of . "
" The Court 's decision not to review COPA for a third time affirms what we have been saying all along , " ACLU Legal Director Steven R. Shapiro said .
" [ The ] government has no right to censor protected speech on the Internet , and it cannot reduce adults to hearing and seeing only speech that the government considers suitable for children . "
Reading “ Darwin ’s Sacred Cause ” February 8 , 2009
New York , N.Y .
It is well known that English naturalist Charles Darwin ( 1809 – 1882 ) had a particular abhorrence to slavery and even ( unusual in the 19th century ) an affinity for people of color .
From Darwin's Autobiography ( published 1887 ) everyone knows the story of how Darwin learned taxidermy as a student in Edinburgh paying for lessons from a black man skilled at stuffing birds , " and I used often to sit with him , for he was a very pleasant and intelligent man . "
Everyone as well knows about the big argument aboard the Beagle between Darwin and Captain Robert FitzRoy after FitzRoy had " defended and praised slavery , which I abominated . "
It is also widely known that Darwin's two grandfathers , Erasmus Darwin ( an early theorist of evolution ) and Josiah Wedgwood ( of pottery fame ) were active in the English anti-slavery movement .
( The Darwin and Wedgwood families became very close : Charles Darwin 's mother was a Wedgwood and so was his wife . )
In 1787 , Wedgwood had a medallion designed of an enchained black man with the inscription " Am I not a man and a brother ? " , which became the seal of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade .
Wedgwood distributed the medallions for free — including sending some to Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia — and they became a fashionable item for people to wear to signal their belief in the cause .
Dig a little further into Charles Darwin 's attitudes towards race and slavery , and you might find the illuminating essay " Charles Darwin : Slavery and the American Civil War " by Ralph Colp , Jr. ( Harvard Library Bulletin , Vol. XXVI , No. 4 , October 1978 ) .
During the Civil War , sympathies among the English were mostly with the South , partially because England was one of the beneficiaries of cheap slave - produced cotton , and partially because Southerners were perceived as more " civilized " than the Yankees ( despite the use of stolen labor to erect this " civilization " ) .
Particularly in his correspondence with American botonist Asa Gray , Darwin reveals a wish that " the North would proclaim a crusade against Slavery [ resulting in ] that greatest curse on Earth Slavery abolished . "
During the Civil War , Darwin only waivers in his pro-North sympathies when the North interferes with an English mailpacket ship , and it appears that England might join the South in the war , at which point Darwin 's English patriotism clashes with his Abolitionism .
More historical research might resurrect the matter of Edward Eyre , the governor of the British colony of Jamaica .
( In British colonies , slavery was theoretically ended in 1834 , but slaves were forced into an " apprenticeship " period and were n't entirely emancipated until 1838 . )
In 1865 , following an uprising of black peasants , Eyre had his troops burn over a thousand homes , execute 439 Jamaicans , and flog 600 more .
A political opponent , a mixed - race man named George William Gordon , was also hanged after a rigged court martial .
Eyre was exonerated by Parliament , but MP John Stuart Mill founded a Jamaica Committee to promote the prosecution of Eyre , and he got the support of Charles Lyell , Thomas H. Huxley , Herbert Spencer , and Charles Darwin .
Supporting the actions of Governor Eyre were Thomas Carlyle ( who will figure again in this blog entry ) , John Ruskin , Alfred Tennyson , Charles Kingsley , and — how sad is this ?
— Charles Dickens .
( See Bernard Semmel , The Governor Eyre Controversy , MacGibbon & Kee , 1962 , and Richard Reeves , John Stuart Mill : Victorian Firebrand , Atlantic Books , 2007 , p. 376-383 )
Despite this background , nothing quite prepared me for the overwhelming impact of the brilliant new book by the pre-eminent Darwin scholars Adrian Desmond and James Moore , Darwin 's Sacred Cause : How a Hatred of Slavery Shaped Darwin 's Views on Human Evolution ( Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , 2009 ) .
Read that subtitle again : Desmond and Moore are suggesting that not only was Darwin one of the most humanitarian scientists of the 19th century , but that his attitudes towards slavery and race actually drove and influenced his science !
The premise is audacious , yet this book uses Darwin 's journals , letters , and even notes he made in other author 's books to build a very solid case .
As they put it in the Introduction ,
Human evolution was n't his last piece in the evolution jigsaw ; it was the first .
From the very outset Darwin concerned himself with the unity of humankind .
This notion of ' brotherhood ' grounded his evolutionary enterprise .
It was there in his first musings on evolution in 1837 . ( p. xvi )
As joint authors of Darwin : The Life of a Tormented Evolutionist ( 1991 ) — highly regarded as the definitive Darwin biography until Janet Browne 's recent two - volume study , Charles Darwin : Voyaging ( 1995 ) and Charles Darwin : The Power of Place ( 2002 ) — Desmond and Moore know their subject and the source material extremely well .
They have given Charles Darwin a terrific present for his 200th birthday , and the rest of the world a must - read in this bicentennial year .
Darwin's Sacred Cause begins with the grandfathers , and in its opening chapters the book reveals itself to be just as much about British anti-slavery politics from the 1780s through the 1850s , a fascinating subject in its own right .
The most prominent agitator against slavery was Thomas Clarkson .
It was he who convinced William Wilberforce to take up the battle in Parliament , leading to the banning of the slave trade in the British dominions in 1807 .
( However , slavery still existed in British colonies , especially in the West Indies , with almost a third of a million slaves in Jamaica . )
Clarkson was partially funded by Josiah Wedgwood , even when others were n't entirely pleased with Clarkson 's radical turns .
With that start , opposition to slavery seemed ingrained in the Darwin and Wedgwood family genes .
Throughout Darwin's Sacred Cause we are constantly hearing from Charles Darwin's in - laws and cousins who continue to battle for the emancipation of slaves in British colonies ( and then turn their sights on America ) .
Throughout his life , Charles Darwin had a strong conviction that all the races of the world were bound in a unity of origin and a common descent .
In his voyage on the Beagle , Darwin witnessed slavery and the slave trade first hand , and the experience never left him .
When he received a letter from a family member about how Parliament might abolish slavery in the colonies during the 1833 session , he wrote back ( with characteristic misspellings ) :
I have watched how steadily the general feeling , as shown at elections , has been rising against Slavery . —
What a proud thing for England , if she is the first Europaean nation which utterly abolishes it . —
I was told before leaving England , that after living in Slave countries : all my opinions would be altered ; the only alteration I am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the Negros character .
— it is impossible to see a negro & not feel kindly towards him ... ( p. 87 )
This racial " unitarism " of Darwin was pretty much a minority view .
Most people — scientists and non-scientists alike — were " pluralists , " meaning that they believed the races were created or emerged separately , and even that the races represented separate species .
This was not an issue of science vs. religion .
Even among those who treated the book of Genesis as literal truth , there were unitarists who identified the source of all people with Adam and Eve , and pluralists who focused on the Curse of Ham , and noted how Ham 's son Canaan had become a " servant of servants " ( and by tradition this meant a black slave ) .
Others believed in a more benign separation of races concomitant with the origin of different languages in the Tower of Babel incident .
Captain FitzRoy of the Beagle later took up a Curse of Ham justification for slavery .
Such views grew increasingly common as demands peaked for the abolition of American slavery .
By 1838 religious tracts were already depicting the whole of Africa filled with Ham 's cursed descendents .
In the Southern Slave States , particularly , God 's favours and curses were seen as very unequal , and Noah 's descendants were ranked accordingly .
( p. 109-110 )
( The Curse of Ham has never really gone away ; " father of modern creationism " Henry M. Morris uses the Curse of Ham to explain the origin of races in The Beginning of the World : A Scientific Study of Genesis 1 - 11 in an edition printed as late as 1996 . )
In the mid-1840s , the American Baptist , Methodist , and Presbyterian churches all split into North and South factions over the issue of slavery , and two decades later Abraham Lincoln said what everyone already knew in his Second Inaugural Address ( March 4 , 1865 , six weeks before his assassination ) that " Both [ sides ] read the same Bible and pray to the same God , and each invokes His aid against the other . "
Science experienced a split as well .
The calm persuasive dignity of the three volumes of Charles Lyell 's Principles of Geology ( 1830 – 1833 ) did much to wean Victorian minds from Biblical chronology and to establish a long history of the Earth .
But there was still much confusion about where people and other living things came from .
In Lyell , they just seem to pop up and disappear in periodic epochs , a process that seemed to require a Creator .
Transmutation of species ( an early term for evolution ) was still a dreaded concept , and without transmutation to explain how species could change , scientists were almost forced to accept a pluralist explanation of race .
Regardless whether it came from religion or science , pluralism was a problem because pluralism provided the intellectual infrastructure for slavery .
If God had turned Canaan black and intended for him to be a " servant of servants , " then God had ordained slavery , and there were plenty of examples of slavery in the Bible .
If Genesis was a fairy tale but the Creator had nonetheless planted different species in different parts of the world , then justification of enslavement of one of these species by another was much less onerous .
Some histories of science create a streamlined view by eliminating entire people , theories , and concepts .
Darwin's Sacred Cause is not one of them .
We are instead plunged into the extremely chaotic , constantly shifting , sloppy and ideological scientific milieu of Great Britain ( and later America ) in the 1830s through 1860s , with a dizzying parade of scientists and crackpots difficult to keep straight without a scorecard .
Early on , one hero emerges :
He is James Cowles Prichard ( 1786 – 1848 ) , whose book Researches into the Physical History of Mankind described a single origin for the world 's people and their languages .
While others were exaggerating immutable differences between the species , Prichard was identifying similarities and adaptations through small - scale variations over long periods of time .
The collection of 30 black - and - white plates in Darwin 's Sacred Cause includes a gorgeous drawing from Prichard 's Researches of two Hottentots ( now known as the Khoikhoi of southwestern Africa ) that is very unlike the typical racist caricatures of most 19th century anthropological literature .
In Darwin's Sacred Cause , however , the villains outnumber the heroes , and they become more numerous and more vehement as the century advances .
As we all know , slavery in the United States did not gradually fade away as people became progressively enlightened about the true nature of the vile institution .
Quite the contrary :
As the pressure to end slavery from the North and from Europe became stronger , the South clung tighter to its slaves , and in the decades leading up to the Civil War , racist religion and racist science sky - rocketed to justify slavery .
The English intelligentsia frequently weighed in on the issues .
The fiercely Abolitionist journalist Harriet Martineau shows up frequently in Darwin 's Sacred Cause as a favorite family friend of the Darwin's and Wedgwood's .
At the opposite extreme is Thomas Carlyle , whose viciously racist rantings sickened many of the people who heard him speak , and still sickens the reader of this book over 150 years later .
Some of the scientists justifying slavery , such as Dr. Josiah Nott and George R. Gliddon , are discussed in Darwin 's Sacred Cause but otherwise lost in the backlots of history .
It is sad to see Charles Lyell in his trips to America succumb to the charms of the aristocratic and genteel South , form a distorted view of slavery , and later decide that the different races had sprung independently in different parts of the world .
Later on , the book 's true villain emerges as Louis Agassiz ( 1807 – 1873 ) , born in Switzerland but based at Harvard from 1847 on , who also adopted a separate - creation / separate - immutable - species theory of the world 's races .
( How many races were there ?
The number ranged from 2 to 63 .
Agassiz thought there were 8 . [ p. 375 ] )
It is Agassiz 's writings — and their joyful reception by the South in justifying slavery — that prompts Darwin to action to refute him , and in turn to inch closer and closer to disclosing his theory of Natural Selection to the world .
Darwin's Sacred Cause assumes a breathless pace as the reader approaches the end of the 1850's , with full prior knowledge that the end of the decade will bring both the publication of The Origin of Species in November 1859 , the election of Abraham Lincoln in November 1860 , and the secession of seven states prior to his inauguration in March 1861 .
By the 1850s , the debate about the unity or plurality of human races had " carried over into domestic - breed studies . "
For example , it was pretty much established that domesticated dogs and pigeons were bred from wilder animals .
But it was generally assumed that the many varieties of dogs and pigeons had come from separate origins .
If it could be shown that all domesticated pigeons derived from one wild species , then by extension , human races might also have arisen from one source as well .
" By the 1850s , the [ pigeon ] loft , the farm and the kitchen garden has become the battleground for good natualists and bad propagandists at loggerheads over human origins . " ( p. 244 )
Darwin loved data .
He read voraciously to extract data out of books that he otherwise considered completely wrong .
He used the full resources of the British Empire to gather data from around the world .
He formed deep friendships with correspondents who would respond to his queries with loads of data .
And he loved experimentation .
For example , it had always been assumed that seemingly related plants on different land - masses must be result of independent creations because seeds could not survive immersion in salt water .
Nobody had ever tested that hypothesis until Darwin did his own experiments , keeping seeds immersed in numerous smelly jars of salt water for weeks , then for months .
Most of the seeds survived the experience just fine , and some even sprouted better !
He wrote an article about his experiment for Gardeners ' Chronicle and reminded the readers
As such experiments might naturally appear childish to many , I may be permitted to premise that they have a direct bearing on a very interesting problem , which has lately , especially in America , attracted much attention , namely , whether the same organic being has been created at one point or on several on the face of our globe .
( p. 248 )
This is one of very many quotations that Desmond and Moore have dug up to show that even when Darwin was submerging seeds in salt water , he was thinking about the implications for the origins of race .
" There was no need for aboriginal species or aboriginal humans to be created over their entire range , for dispersal was viable , even across oceans . " ( p. 251 )
Darwin began accumulating so many livestock that he was listed as a " Farmer " in Bagshaw 's History , Gazetteer and Dictionary of Kent . ( p. 252 ) One of the most entertaining passages in Darwin 's Sacred Cause is his experiments in pigeon - breeding ( including joining two pigeon - breeding clubs ) , leading to his determination that all varieties of domestic pigeons that he had accumulated — which he said an ornithologist would see as " three good genera and about fifteen good species " — were actually members of the same species that had originated with the rock dove .
All the pigeon varieties were successfuly inter-breedable with fertile offspring — the most common test of species unity .
( This is why Origin of Species begins with a discussion of pigeons . )
In 1857 , the pluralists Josiah Nott and George R. Gliddon published a book Indigenous Races of the Earth in which they gave new names to the pluralists and unitarists .
Pluralists like themselves who believed in separate creations of similar species would now be known as Polygenists .
Those who believed in uniform origins became believers in Monogenesis , suggesting a very old - fashioned affection for Adam and Eve. ( p. 288-289 )
Although Darwin originally had much grander plans for it , Origin of Species did not discuss humans .
But every reader was able to extrapolate , and one review even began " Mr. Darwin boldly traces out the genealogy of man , and affirms that the monkey is his brother , and the horse his cousin , and the oyster his remote ancestor . " ( p. 328 ) Despite Darwin 's overall intent , some people insisted on extracting from Origin of Species only what they wanted to see , interpreting the " struggle for existence " described within its pages as a mandate for racial extermination .
( p. 337 )
Darwin would not specifically tackle the issue of race for another 12 years , in The Descent of Man , and Selection in Relation to Sex ( 1871 ) , the completion of which Desmond and Moore suggest was prompted by the Governor Eyre matter .
Race required a separate book because Darwin did not believe that most racial characteristics offered a survival benefit .
Hence , they did not come under the category of Natural Selection .
The second half of the mechanism of evolution was Sexual Selection — the way in which animals and humans choose mates .
Most racial characteristics develop simply because different population groups develop different standards of physical beauty .
To a certain extent , through the choice of mates , we govern our own evolution as a self - selecting " domesticated animal . " ( p. 359 )
The Descent of Man is not a perfect book .
It reveals plenty of prejudices and stereotypes that are normal for someone living in England in the middle of the 19th century , and it is even possible to extract some passages , mangle them a bit , and then " prove " that Darwin was a proponent of eugenics or something equally vile .
But this is not the whole picture .
The whole picture that emerges from Darwin 's Sacred Cause is a man who is extraordinarily decent and kind and driven to demonstrate the unity of all people of the world in one human race .
Very few other scientists of the 19th century come close to Darwin 's standards .
Darwin's Sacred Cause is a much - needed corrective to the recent creationist assault on Darwin and evolution from books such as From Darwin to Hitler : Evolutionary Ethics , Eugenics and Racism in Germany and Darwin 's Plantation : Evolution 's Racist Roots , and movies such as Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed .
Anybody who looks at Darwin 's life and work only to find facism and racism is simply dense , or ( more likely ) too full of their own bigotries to see reality .

In his 1962 commencement address at Yale -- where he observed that he now had “ the best of both worlds : a Harvard education and a Yale degree ” -- John Kennedy became the first president to openly defend the deficit spending his predecessors had pursued to counter economic downturns .
“ The great enemy of truth , ” he said , “ is not the lie — deliberate ,
contrived , and dishonest — but the myth — persistent , persuasive and unrealistic . ”
He argued that “ mythology distracts us everywhere — in government as in business , in politics as in economics , in foreign affairs as in domestic affairs . ”
The speech offered a preview of the transformative 1960s .
It has new relevance as a charter for our own time — when another young president , confronting an unprecedented range of crises , works to overcome myths as persistent as those that threatened
progress half a century ago .
One of the most stubborn is what Kennedy denounced at Yale — the notion that deficits are always evil and the balanced budget an inherent public good .
This myth is now constantly exploited by do - nothing opponents of Obama ’s recovery plan .
On Sunday , George Stephanopoulos read a viewer ’s complaint to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner : “ How do you justify printing money out of thin air ? ”
Is n’t the inevitable consequence “ hyperinflation ? ”
Geithner calmly rebuked the cliché by pointing to the Federal Reserve ’s capacity to counter inflation by raising interest rates once the economy is back on track .
After all , cutting spending now would accelerate , not reverse , the downturn , and trigger a spiral of declining federal revenues that could leave budget balancing out of reach no matter how deeply we cut .
This is elementary economics .
However , Republicans , who are either blinded by ideology or cynically clear - sighted about the political dividends of a prolonged recession , robotically call for deficit reduction anyway .
They propagate two contradictory myths — that deficit spending failed during the New Deal and , as Bush pollster Matthew Dowd alleges , that FDR ’s early gains against unemployment came after he slashed the federal budget .
In reality , Roosevelt increased spending overall by 40 percent from 1933 to 1934 , and the deficit by nearly a third .
In the first five years of the New Deal , the gross domestic product rose more than 40 percent .
The New Deal faltered not when FDR disdained conservative advice on deficits , but only when he briefly followed it .
After Roosevelt drastically cut the deficit in his 1937 budget , the economy promptly tanked .
When FDR reversed course , the economy turned around .
Barack Obama first confounded the anti-deficit mythology with the passage of the stimulus bill -- despite nearly unanimous Republican opposition .
It ’s likely that his budget , too , will pass largely intact as he skillfully deals with the “ moderate ” Democrats reflexively drawn to balanced budget mythology .
The final product will include health care reform as the President slays another myth — that this complex issue must be postponed in favor of a single - minded focus on the economy .
As New York Times columnist Paul Krugman — hardly an uncritical fan of the administration — points out , dealing with health care ’s soaring costs is essential to long - term economic recovery .
Congress will approve the Obama budget through a process known as “ reconciliation , ” which requires only majority support in the Senate .
Thus , it ca n’t be blocked by filibuster .
This likelihood has led to the propagation of a new myth : that it ’s unfair or unwise to enact a major initiative in this manner .
This claim is risibly transparent coming from the same Republicans who used reconciliation repeatedly during the Reagan and Bush years .
Their crocodile tears about Senate process are as opportunistic as their jeremiads about the national debt , which doubled as they rubber - stamped George W. Bush ’s reckless spending .
Mythology will succumb once more this week at the G - 20 summit in London .
Conservatives are already celebrating the anti-Obama outburst of Mirek Topolanek , the hitherto obscure Czech Prime Minister and temporary President of the European Union ( rendered even more temporary in his own country after his government lost a vote of confidence in the Czech Parliament ) .
He ’s a right - wing ideologue who denounced the Obama stimulus as “ the road to Hell ” — to the consternation of more sensible European colleagues .
In 1933 , FDR blew up a London economic summit that sought to set fixed currency exchange rates , a virtual return to the gold standard that would have hobbled his economic strategy .
This time , the British government agrees with the American approach and actually led the way during Bush ’s waning months .
Obama also retains his commanding popularity across Europe .
He will leave the G - 20 summit with his economic policy whole and with some measure of consensus , at least on financial reform .
He will
then visit Prague , where I predict he will receive an overwhelmingly positive reception .
It ’s amusing to watch unilateralist Republicans invoke European opinion to shore up their opposition to an American President .
But perceptive conservatives are also beginning to fret that Obama just might be succeeding .
George
Will has opined that economic recovery wo n’t be due to Obama ’s policy – a preemptive myth in the making .
Great presidents must combat myths , no matter how persistent .
FDR beat back his own yearning to return to a balanced budget .
JFK explicitly repudiated that enduring orthodoxy , thereby pointing the way to the prosperity of the 1960s .
Ronald Reagan , a self - proclaimed hard - liner , ultimately repudiated his long - held conviction that we could not make peace with the Soviets , and he defied the all - but - universal belief in the permanence of the Soviet Union .
Like them , Obama has chosen a path less traveled .
After fewer than 100 days , there is reason to believe he has marked a way forward for America and , very possibly , to his own greatness in the presidency .

This weekend is Warner 's first tentpole weekend of 2009 as Zack Synder ' 's Watchmen debuts nationwide .
From where we 're sitting it looks like a flop in the making .
Of course , nasty critics are n't helping .
Here 's the best of all that .
Anthony Lane , The New Yorker :
The bad news about “ Watchmen ” is that it grinds and squelches on for two and a half hours , like a major operation .
The good news is that you do n’t have to stay past the opening credit sequence — easily the highlight of the film .
A. O. Scott , The New York Times :
Dr. Manhattan ’s existence is busy and fairly melancholy , but I do envy him his ability to perceive every moment of past and future time as a part of a continuous present .
If I had that power , the 2 hours 40 minutes of Zack Snyder ’s grim and grisly excursion into comic - book mythology might not have felt quite so interminable .
( “ It will never end , ” says Dr. Manhattan .
“ Nothing ever ends . ”
No indeed . )
Mike Ward , Richmond.com :
You do n't need 12 - sided dice and a fictitious Canadian girlfriend to " get it , " but it certainly helps .
Justin Chang , Variety :
Yet the movie is ultimately undone by its own reverence ; there 's simply no room for these characters and stories to breathe of their own accord , and even the most fastidiously replicated scenes can feel glib and truncated .
As " Watchmen " lurches toward its apocalyptic ( and slightly altered ) finale , something happens that did n't happen in the novel : Wavering between seriousness and camp , and absent the cerebral tone that gave weight to some of the book 's headier ideas , the film seems to yield to the very superhero cliches it purports to subvert .
A. O. Scott , The New York Times :
Indeed , the ideal viewer — or reviewer , as the case may be — of the “ Watchmen ” movie would probably be a mid-’80s college sophomore with a smattering of Nietzsche , an extensive record collection and a comic - book nerd for a roommate .
The film ’s carefully preserved themes of apocalypse and decay might have proved powerfully unsettling to that anxious undergraduate sitting in his dorm room , listening to “ 99 Luftballons ” and waiting for the world to end or the Berlin Wall to come down .
The Hot Blog :
The problem with Watchmen is , in the end , that it is a bit of a big stiff bore for two acts with an improved , but mostly uninspired third act .
There is a moment , about 2 hours and 25 minutes in , when the movie shows us exactly what its promise was .
It is The Showdown Of The Film … which I will not spoil here .
But suffice it to say that it had strong character choices , little fat in paying homage to the book like it was the m - f’ing Bible passed down by God himself , and the book ’s perfect combination of narrative and ideology .
Lasted about 10 minutes .
Mr Jones said he relied on his sat nav system in his job as a driver
A car was left teetering on a cliff edge after the driver followed sat nav directions down a Pennine footpath .
Robert Jones continued to follow the instructions when they told him the narrow , steep path he was driving on in Todmorden , West Yorkshire , was a road .
Mr Jones , from Doncaster , South Yorkshire , only stopped when his BMW hit a fence above Gauxholme railway bridge on Sunday morning .
Police have charged Mr Jones with driving without due care and attention .
The 43 - year - old , who works as a driver , said he relied on his sat nav for his job .
He described Sunday 's incident , during a visit to friends in Todmorden , as " a nightmare " .
A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said : " Officers received a call at 11.18 am on Sunday March 22 reporting that a BMW was hanging off the edge of a cliff off Bacup Road .
" The driver was a 43 - year - old man from Doncaster .
He has been summonsed to court for driving without due care and attention . "
To begin reversing GM contamination will require ending the power biotech companies such as Monsanto exert over our government and through that , over our food .
HR 875 , was introduced by Rosa DeLauro whose husband Stanley Greenburg works for Monsanto .
The bill is monstrous on level after level - the power it would give to Monsanto , the criminalization of seed banking , the prison terms and confiscatory fines for farmers , the 24 hours GPS tracking of their animals , the easements on their property to allow for warrantless government entry , the stripping away of their property rights , the imposition by the filthy , greedy industrial side of anti-farming international " industrial " standards to independent farms - the only part of our food system that still works , the planned elimination of farmers through all these means .
The corporations want the land , they want more intensive industrialization , they want the end of normal animals so they can substitute patented genetically engineered ones they own , they want the end of normal seeds and thus of seed banking by farmers or individuals .
They want control over all seeds , animals , water , and land .
Our farmers are good stewards .
That is who is threatened by Rosa DeLauro 's bill ( and because of that , we all are ) .
At a time in this country when wise stewardship and the production of anything real - especially good food - is what is most needed , it is our best stewards whom Rosa DeLauro threatens , under the cruelly false name of " food safety . "
And now Monsanto wants its own employee , Michael Taylor back in government , this time to act with massive police power as a " food safety tsar " from inside the White House .
This is the man who forced genetically engineered rBGH on us ( unlabeled , and without warning ) when the Clintons placed him over " food safety " in the 90s .
HR 875 would give him immense power over what is done on every single farm in the country and massive police state power to wield over farmers and punishments to break them at will .
The following quotes show Monsanto and its biotech ilk are not " stewards " at all .
Their inhuman focus on profit has led to inhuman , insane , sickening products that require intense corruption of democracy and science institutes and media , to foist them on country after country which do n't want them .
It is our farmers who stand between us and this outrage which masquerades as science , as food , as normal business , as government .
And it is our farmers who need not only protecting but actual freeing from government intrusion , control and harm .
Vegetarians and vegans do not identify with farmers who raise animals but what is at stake here is critical for all of us .
" First they came for the Jews " is an apt reminder of what matters in standing with each other because the overwhelming bureaucratic burdens , the record requirements , the warrantless inspections , the end of farmers ' markets , the criminalization of seed banking , the ten years in prison for stepping out of line in any way -- this will next be applied not to animals breaking out of fence onto a neighbor 's farm , but for such things as not spraying pesticides on an organic farm to eradicate earthworms ( now listed as an invasive species ) because the government 's " food safety tsar " has deemed it necessary .
HR 875 is the beginning .
This time , it is about handing over control of our food supply to enhance profits of the chemical industry .
This time it is aimed with ferocity at farmers who keep animals .
Next time it will be totalitarian control .
Rosa DeLauro and Stanley Greenburg have a great deal to account for in attempting through a mislabeled bill with hidden intent to wipe out our farmers and harm all of us .
HR 875 gives Monsanto greater power and opens doors wider to the following ... GM and non-GM crops cannot coexist
I met Seed for cocktails and dinner one night last fall .
He talks about himself only reluctantly , but he ’s far more voluble when talking about what ’s in his bottles , and how history and fickle trade patterns have influenced what we drink .
Seed is the only person I ’ve heard use the phrase Hanseatic League since I was in high school .
That came up in a discussion of his Batavia Arrack , a pleasantly musty spirit distilled from sugarcane and red rice on the island of Java .
It first appeared in the U.S. around the time the Dutch and the English were tussling over Manhattan , but it had been largely unavailable since Prohibition .
Arrack is aromatic , with a roguish sensibility , and it ’s often called for in 19th - century punch recipes .
It ’s also the base spirit of something called Swedish Punsch , a smoky liqueur used in vintage cocktails like the Doctor and the Diki - Diki .
Seed and I also sampled his Hayman ’s Old Tom Gin , which some cocktail historians consider “ the missing link ” — the bridge between the sweeter Holland gin that launched the gin craze in the 18th century and the London Dry that typically goes in your martini today .
Old Tom is sweeter and more robust than London Dry — “ more botanically intense , ” Seed says — and it avoids the angular , medicinal aftertaste .
One of Seed ’s top sellers surprised me : Crème de Violette .
This is an ethereal lavender - hued liqueur , with the fleeting , elusive taste and aroma of spring violets , from which it ’s made .
When it comes to drink , Americans rarely clamor for subtlety , but the demand for violet liqueur suggests that the home bar may be following the trajectory of the kitchen pantry .
“ There ’s a growing sophistication in drink as there has been with food , ” Seed says .
Shelf space becomes scarcer , the invasive species begin to assert themselves , and cocktail life becomes more confounding .
The demand may also be driven by a latent curiosity about the celebrated Aviation cocktail , which first cropped up around 1916 , at the dawn of the age of flight .
The original recipe called for a touch of violet , but when the liqueur became impossible to procure , it was dropped from published recipes , and the Aviation became simply gin , lemon juice , and maraschino liqueur , with no hint of the azure sky that inspired it .
But now it ’s back , and getting attention in some tony precincts .
I enjoyed one recently at Arnaud ’s French 75 in New Orleans , a comfortably dusky bar of dark wood , quarter - size hexagonal floor tiles , and Edith Piaf in the background .
On the first sip it was a bright , refreshing elixir that recalled a spring evening , lifting me gently out of the confines of place .
By the second sip I was vowing to add Crème de Violette to my inventory .
And by the third I was damning Eric Seed for complicating my life .
Feminist icon , activist , and writer Gloria Steinem turned 75 Wednesday .
Happy Belated Birthday !
I would like to take a moment to celebrate .
She has been a role model in my life , and surely millions of others .
An exhaustive list of her contributions and achievements is beyond the scope of this article and can be found elsewhere .
Plus , I ’m hoping that you ’re already familiar with a few .
She ’s pretty outspoken .
( If not , at least read the damn Wikipedia article . )
Instead , I would like to present a clip from her Address to the Women of America , given in 1971 , in which she discussed much more than just gender .
It is considered to be one of the greatest speeches of the twentieth century .

Andrew C. Revkin/ The New York Times
On Tuesday , the final day of the Heartland Institute ’s conference examining whether global warming was ever a crisis , there was a fascinating moment in one session when the discussion shifted from questioning warming to assessing humanity ’s limited energy choices .
Climate debate aside , there appeared to be no skepticism at all about the need for an ambitious energy quest and burst of technological innovation — basically in line with the “ second industrial revolution ” called for by Energy Secretary Steven Chu , who was a target at other sessions for recent statements on climate risks .
The moment came during a session pairing up Don Easterbrook , an emeritus professor of geology at Western Washington University , and Michael Jungbauer , a state senator and water - resources specialist from Minnesota .
Stuart Isett for The New York Times
Much of what they said meshed with the overall theme of the meeting , which organizers said was aimed at proving that the recent consensus on dangerous human - caused global warming was shaped more by politics and passion than data .
Dr. Easterbrook spoke of his studies of solar activity and ocean cycles and his prediction that a decades - long global cooling spell was coming , deeper than the one in the middle of the 20th century .
[ UPDATE , 3/16 : Josh Willis of NASA rejects Dr. Easterbrook ’s arguments in a comment . ]
Mr. Jungbauer gave a talk and slide presentation that he said were aimed at providing ammunition for anyone in the policy arena seeking to counter visions of catastrophic global warming pushed by liberal campaigners .
“ Know your competitors ’ message , ” he said , flipping a slide with photos of prominent climate scientists and campaigners .
( Mr. Jungbauer has also been posting climate talks on YouTube . )
Dr. Easterbrook , in laying out the dangers of cold spells , noted that the world does n’t have sufficient energy sources to get through such a period , particularly with the human population heading toward 9 billion .
“ We want to reduce pollution , increase efficiency , decrease dependence on foreign oil , ” he said in a question and answer session .
“ The difficulty I see is greater demands and fewer resources . ”
Setting aside his short - term cooling projections , Dr. Easterbrook ’s assessment of looming risks related to energy appears to be substantially aligned with that of , for example , John Holdren , President Obama ’s nominee for science adviser ( whose confirmation is still being held up by one or more senators ) .
Keep in mind that their prescriptions for driving the needed change differ markedly .
But they share a vision of a stark energy gap , and the need for big changes in energy policy and technology .
Such moments of consensus are rarely visible given how the heated fight over climate and energy policy is mainly shaped , particularly in Washington , as a political tug of war .
While taking questions , Mr. Jungbauer , who commutes in a hybrid sedan or on a bicycle when he can , also agreed that without new energy policies and an aggressive push for better energy technologies , progress was in peril .
He said that the consensus on common goals on energy is often obscured by the rancorous fight over related climate and taxation policies .
“ There are extremists on both sides , ” Mr. Jungbauer said .
Extremists on the conservative side , he said , say there ’s no problem at all , while “ on the other side they say , ‘ we want to control your life ” by raising energy costs through a cap or tax .
So in the end , the epic struggle over global warming , at its root , remains a struggle over how to drive energy innovation .
How much change can be propelled from the top down , by pressing companies and consumers with rising costs for energy choices that come with emissions of greenhouse gases ?
How much can come from the bottom up , with policies and investments that invigorate innovation ?
Here ’s some useful related background on one approach to energy innovation .
Here ’s a defense of a carbon cap as a driver of change .
And here ’s a call - out to young people to join the innovation generation .
To stop the “ vampires ” supposedly chewing shrouds and spreading disease , grave - diggers put bricks in the mouths of plague victims ( Image : Matteo Borrini )
The dig site reveals a mass grave with the “ vampire ” indicated and , inset , a 3D model of the skeleton with brick “ ( Image : Matteo Borrini )
A SKELETON exhumed from a grave in Venice is being claimed as the first known example of the “ vampires ” widely referred to in contemporary documents .

Matteo Borrini of the University of Florence in Italy found the skeleton of a woman with a small brick in her mouth ( see right ) while excavating mass graves of plague victims from the Middle Ages on Lazzaretto Nuovo Island in Venice ( see second image here ) .
At the time the woman died , many people believed that the plague was spread by “ vampires ” which , rather than drinking people ’s blood , spread disease by chewing on their shrouds after dying .
Grave - diggers put bricks in the mouths of suspected vampires to stop them doing this , Borrini says .
The belief in vampires probably arose because blood is sometimes expelled from the mouths of the dead , causing the shroud to sink inwards and tear .
Borrini , who presented his findings at a meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences in Denver , Colorado , last week , claims this might be the first such vampire to have been forensically examined .
The skeleton was removed from a mass grave of victims of the Venetian plague of 1576 .
However , Peer Moore - Jansen of Wichita State University in Kansas says he has found similar skeletons in Poland and that while Borrini ’s finding is exciting , “ claiming it as the first vampire is a little ridiculous ” .
Borrini says his study details the earliest grave to show archaeological “ exorcism evidence against vampires ” .
Axelrod says Obama , Congress will come up with ' an appropriate approach ' to curbing excessive pay .
Axelrod hints pay limits not binding
David Axelrod , senior adviser to President Barack Obama , hinted in an interview on " Fox News Sunday " that the administration does not view the executive pay restrictions in the economic stimulus bill as binding .
Obama will sign the restrictions , which are stricter than those he announced less than two weeks ago , into law on Tuesday .
But Axelrod said the administration will work with Congress to come up with " an appropriate approach " to curb excessive pay packages on Wall Street .

" He 's announced his own guidelines for how we should restrict that , " Axelrod said of the president .
" In some ways , they 're tougher than the ones that the Senate passed .
They have a hard cap , for example , on compensation .
And in other ways , they differ . "
" So we 're going to work with them , ... with the Senate , to come up — and the House — to come up with an appropriate approach to this , " he continued .
" We all have the same goal .
We all have the same sentiment .
And we want to do something that 's workable , and we 'll work with them to get to that point . "
Asked if he is worried that the restrictions in the stimulus bill could be counterproductive , Axelrod noted that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers , Obama 's chief economic adviser , " had concerns about that . "
" And they expressed those concerns , " Axelrod said .
" But those concerns are at the margins , and the goal is one we share , " which he described as curbing " the spectacle of gaudy bonuses for executives at firms that are getting extraordinary assistance from American taxpayers . "
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs , asked about the bill 's pay restrictions on CBS 's " Face the Nation , " said that “ the president outlined very strong measures on exec compensation and bonuses to ensure that taxpayer money that ’s supposed to be used to get our financial systems stable in lending money again is n’t lining the pockets of some of the people that got us into this mess . ”
Host Bob Schieffer reminded Gibbs that the administration ’s pay cap plan was not nearly as strong and stringent as that in the bill .
“ I would say that many of the provisions that are in the bill are modeled after things that the president outlined in his plan , ” Gibbs replied .
“ We ’re looking forward to working with Congress to institute some of these regulations that will ensure that taxpayer money is n’t wasted , but we also have to make sure that it does n’t hurt smaller regional banks that want to participate in this program . ”
“ We think we can strike the right balance , ” Gibbs continued .
“ The president is very , very focused and wants to make sure that taxpayer money does not in any way go to excessive compensation or bonuses for CEOs that got us into this mess .
Asked if he ’s satisfied with the provision as it appears now , Gibbs answered , “ We will sign this bill into law on Tuesday . ”

Summers : White House Stimulus Action May Have Stabilized Consumer Spending
UPDATED 12:09 p.m. , below , with Q- and-A :
Larry Summers , President Obama 's top economic adviser , just concluded remarks to the Brookings Institution and said the president 's stimulus plan may be working .
" It is surely too early to gauge the broader economic impact of the president ’s program , " Summers says .
" But it is modestly encouraging that since it began to take shape , consumer spending in the U.S. , which was collapsing during the holiday season , appears , according to a number of indicators , to have stabilized . "
Summers added : " Already , [ the stimulus plan 's ] impact is being felt by cops and teachers who would have been laid off but whose jobs have been saved — it may retain14,000 teachers in New York alone .
It will , for most American workers , be felt in the coming weeks as withholding schedules are adjusted , in continuing unemployment insurance benefits and health benefits for hundreds - of - thousands of workers who already would have done without , and in contracting already underway with respect to tens - of - billions of dollars of infrastructure projects across the country . "
Q-and - A UPDATE :
-- Asked about the massive amount of federal debt being incurred by the stimulus plan and budget , Summers said : " If my speech was intended to persuade you of one thing , it 's that [ the crisis ] is not a set of economic processes that would simply and automatically fix themselves if you did n't act . "
He continued : " I track the markets very closely and my reading is that the central variable is whether we are successful in establishing confidence that the economy will recover and growth will be restored and we will have a sustainable expansion .
If we put that at risk in the name of some generalized concern about austerity , we would be doing the wrong thing by the economy and ironically , even doing the wrong thing by the markets . "
Further , he said : " If deflation sets in , if GDP collapses further , if the consequences of that [ impact ] even the insured parts of the financial system ; if that happens , the magnitude of the federal borrowing -- as large as it is today -- will be dwarfed ; it will be far , far larger . "
He concluded : " So I believe that the approach that the president is taking is the ultimately fiscally responsible approach because of the risks that it avoids and it contains .
Federal debt is being incurred in ways through its macro-economic and structural effects contributes to the process of economic recovery . "
-- Summers said that Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is handling the crisis " in a difficult and courageous way . "
He added : " The easy thing to to do would be to lay out a nine - point plan [ that has ] the illusion of specificity and sense of certainty about what the future would bring .
We saw that a half - dozen times from the previous administration ....
The right approach that Secretary Geithner has taken is based on deeds and not words . "
In his prepared remarks , Summers inveighed against economic bubbles .
" Bubble driven economic growth is problematic because of disruption and dislocation – affecting those who took part in the bubble ’s excesses and those who did not , " Summers 's remarks read .
" And , it is not entirely healthy even while it lasts . "
The key to limiting the boom - and - bust cycles of bubbles , Summers is saying , is smart regulation .
He proposes :
-- Regulatory agencies should never be placed in competition for the privilege of regulating particular financial institutions .
-- Globally , the United States must lead a leveling - up of regulatory standards , not as has happened all too often in the recent past , trying to win a race to the bottom .
--
No substantially interconnected institution or market on which the system depends should be free from rigorous public scrutiny .
-- Required levels of capital and liquidity must be set with a view toward protecting the system , even in very difficult times .
--
And there must be far more vigorous and serious efforts to discourage improper risk taking through transparency and accountability for errors .
The remainder of Summers 's speech is being spent promoting Obama 's economic recovery plans .
Summers gave a grim accounting of the past 18 months :
--
On a global basis , $ 50 trillion dollars in global wealth has been erased .
This includes $ 7 trillion dollars in U.S. stock market wealth which has vanished , and $ 6 trillion dollars in housing wealth that has been destroyed .
-- Inevitably , this has led to declining demand , with GDP and employment now shrinking at among the most rapid rates since the second World War .
-- 4.4 million jobs have already been lost and the unemployment rate now exceeds 8 percent .

After reports that CNBC was furious with Jim Cramer for not defending the network against Jon Stewart when he was on The Daily Show one week ago , Jim Cramer finally made a non-CNBC appearance on NBC ’s Today show where he played the role of the good company man .
Here is the video courtesy of ThinkProgress :
Advertisements
Wow , what a change in Jim “ The Company Man ” Cramer .
Did they take him in the back room at CNBC and have Rick Santelli work him over ?
Cramer in a minute and a half spoke the company line .
He said that it was n’t CNBC ’s fault , and that other entities like the government and the bad companies were responsible .
It is almost like Cramer was told what to say by his bosses at CNBC .
It also is n’t a surprise that he would make these statements on sister network NBC .
CNBC did play a role in this mess , but it was a sideline role .
Notice how Cramer went out of his way to defend the reporting of the network , which is a bit delusional if you actually watched CNBC during the last few years .
They never asked a tough question of a CEO in an interview .
Yes , they reported bad news , but CNBC has a habit of letting companies come on their network unchallenged and spin away concerns .
CNBC is what it is .
It is the business network .
It is always going to have a pro-business slant .
Cramer and the NBC family are essentially contending that Stewart did not know what he was talking about .
However , anyone who watched the interview could tell that The Daily Show host was well prepared .
The bigger problem for both CNBC and Cramer is that their images have taken a serious hit .
The aura of Jim Cramer the pit bull was destroyed .
This spin attempt is a week too late .
Cramer should have been everywhere last Friday morning instead of laying low .
NBC blew the handling of this one , and no amount of Jim Cramer uttering the company line is going to fix all the damage .
BANGALORE : Here���s a somewhat different perspective on the recession blues .
A man filed a plea in the high court recently , asking for the reduction of the maintenance payable to his separated wife .
Reason : recession and cut in pay .
Srinivas and Sapna ( name changed ) tied the knot when there was a boom in the market and the BSE was soaring skywards .
But within two years , things went wrong not only in their married life , but also with the economy .
They opted to separate a year before the recession hit .
A family court had then ordered the husband to pay Rs 15,000 a month maintenance .
Now with the economy in doldrums , Srinivas , a software engineer settled in Pune , approached the Karnataka high court seeking reduction of the maintenance amount .
He cited the recession and pay cut .
However , the single bench refused to interfere .
He then approached a division bench .
His counsel also told the court that Sapna had finished her MA in English , besides possessing a computer studies diploma and other qualifications .
So , she could fend for herself by getting a suitable job , he submitted .
However , this did not convince the judges .
They read out the reason for the separationmental cruelty .
The woman also said that she couldn���t hold on to jobs because of mental agony and the stigma of being deserted by her husband .
��
�She lives with her brothers and needs maintenance , ��� the bench said and dismissed the appeal .
Now that the iphone - dev team has unlocked the iPhone 3G they ’re moving onto jailbreaking the iPod Touch 2G .
While they have a fully working jailbreak , it ’s not yet in a user friendly format .

Foes of Mountaintop Removal Have No Ally in the White House
Barack Obama seems to be following a dirty legacy when it comes to his official energy policy , a policy that has left Appalachia with fewer mountaintops every year .
The price of oil per barrel fluctuated dramatically in the past year , and the U.S. ’s dependency on foreign crude has become less stable as tensions in the Middle East have escalated .
Over his long campaign , Obama laid out his strategy on how to deal with the crisis , which has been exacerbated by the war in Iraq and the potential confrontation with Iran , not to mention the oil speculator ’s dubious role in the money game .
But sadly Obama has been echoing old solutions to our new 21st century environmental troubles .
Mainly , where is our energy going to come from if oil supplies dwindle or prices skyrocket again ?
And how will this all affect the dire reality of climate change ?
President Obama supports an array of neoliberal strategies to deal with the country ’s volatile energy situation .
He is not opposed to the prospect of nuclear power , endorses capping - and - trading the coal industry ’s pollution output , and supports liquefied coal .
Well , that ’s a maybe on the latter .
“ Senator Obama supports … investing in technology that could make coal a clean - burning source of energy , ” Obama stated in an email sent out by his campaign in June 2007 .
“ However , unless and until this technology is perfected , Senator Obama will not support the development of any coal - to - liquid fuels unless they emit at least 20 percent less life - cycle carbon than conventional fuels . ”
You did not just read a lofty proclamation from the new White House change agent , but a well - crafted rationale meant to appease the environmental movement .
Meanwhile , back in his Senate days , Obama ’s record relays a much different position on the issue .
It was only six months before the aforementioned email that Republican Senator Jim Bunning and Obama introduced the Coal - to - Liquid Fuel Promotion Act of 2007 .
The bill , introduced in January 2007 , was referred to the Senate committee on finance and would have amended the Energy Policy Act of 2005 as well as the Energy Policy and Conservation
Act to evaluate the feasibility of including coal - to - oil fuels in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and provide incentives for research and plant construction .
Shortly after the introduction of the bill , Tommy Vietor , Obama ’s spokesman , defended the senator ’s proposal , “ Illinois basin coal has more untapped energy potential than the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait combined .
Senator Obama believes it is crucial that we invest in technologies to use these resources to reduce our dependence on foreign oil . ”
It was at the onset of the Nazi era that coal - to - liquid technology came to the forefront of modern energy science .
In the latter part of the 1920s , German researchers Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch developed the initial processes to liquify the dark rock into fuel .
The procedure was utilized throughout World War II by both Germany and Japan .
In fact , coal - to - liquid technology largely fueled Hitler ’s bloody campaigns throughout Europe , as Germany had few petroleum reserves but held vast amounts of coal deposits throughout the country .
Not too unlike the United States ’ fossil fuel conundrum of today .
By 1930 , Fischer and Tropsch had applied for several U.S. patents , yet it was n’t until earlier last summer that the first U.S. coal - to - liquid plant was set for construction in West Virginia .
But while liquid coal may help replace petroleum based fossil fuels , it is certainly not an answer to global warming .
“ The total emissions rate for oil and gas fuels is about 27 pounds of carbon dioxide per gallon , counting both production and use , ” states the Natural Resource Defense Council .
“ [ T ] he estimated total emissions from coal - derived fuel is more like 50 pounds of carbon dioxide per gallon — nearly twice as much . ”
Has Obama had a change of heart , or has he just flip - flopped around like a suffocating trout for political leverage ?
The answer to that question may reside along the nuanced path we are getting all too used to seeing President Obama traverse these days .
As his presidential campaign website read in late October 2008 :
“ Obama will significantly increase the resources devoted to the commercialization and deployment of low - carbon coal technologies .
Obama will consider whatever policy tools are necessary , including standards that ban new traditional coal facilities , to ensure that we move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology . ”
The apartheid government of South Africa was the first to use liquid coal for motor vehicles , and it seems , despite the “ low carbon coal ” rhetoric , that Obama may be poised to carry on the dirty legacy of liquid coal .
The move from foreign oil to locally mined coal , “ low carbon ” or otherwise ( no coal energy has zero carbon emissions ) , would only change the dynamics of the U.S. ’s massive energy consumption , not its habits , which is at the heart of our current energy woes .
Plus the coal has to come from somewhere .
As a result of our consumptive lifestyles , the mountaintops of the Appalachia region , from Tennessee up to the heart of West Virginia , are being ravaged by the coal industry — an industry that cares little about the welfare of people or the land that it is adversely affecting with its industrial mining operations .
The concept of “ clean coal ” is nothing more than unabashed greenwashing .
The debris from the mining pits , often 500 feet deep , produce toxic waste that is then dumped in nearby valleys , polluting rivers and poisoning local communities downstream .
No state or federal agencies are tracking the cumulative effect of the aptly named “ mountaintop removal , ” where entire peaks are being blown apart , only to expose tiny seams of the precious black rock .
There has been little to no oversight of the wholesale destruction of these mountains and Obama has not addressed the ruin in any of their bullet point policy papers on “ clean coal . ”
Any new coal burning technology , whether it be liquidification or otherwise , would surely rely on the continuation of such brutal methods of extraction , and carbon output would still be significant .
And it is not just the burning of coal that is damaging to the environment .
On December 22 , 2008 , a coal slurry impoundment at the Tennessee Valley Authority ’s Kingston coal fired power plant in Harriman , Tennessee spilled more than 500 million gallons of toxic coal ash into the Tennessee River .
The epic spill was over 40 times bigger than the Exxon Valdez in Alaska .
Approximately 525 million gallons of black coal ash flowed into tributaries of the Tennessee River – the water supply for Chattanooga and millions of people living downstream in Alabama and Kentucky .
The true adverse effects of the spill are still not known .
The fight in West Virginia to stop mountaintop removal has been heating up in the past few weeks as 13 radical environmentalists , led my veteran activist , Mike Roselle , protested by chaining themselves to bulldozers at the Massey Energy Corp. site in Raleigh County on February 3 .
The group was arrested and cited for trespassing on private property .
“ Trespassing is certainly a serious offense , but destroying a mountain is more serious , ” Roselle said of the arrests .
“ I am going to be here until this issue is resolved .
This is a serious environmental crisis that we face [ today ] . ”
During his confirmation hearings , U.S. Secretary of the Interior , Ken Salazar , was asked about how the Obama administration would handle US coal production .
“ The fact of the matter is it powers much of America and there are lots of jobs it creates , ” said Salazar , who is no foe of the mining industry .
“ The challenge is how we create clean coal .
I believe that we will move forward with the funding of some of those demonstration projects so we can find ways to burn coal that do n’t contribute to climate change . ”
And so the rhetoric spins .
President Obama may receive high marks from the League of Conservation Voters and be touted by the Sierra Club for being marginally better than his predecessor on the environment , but when it comes to his position on the U.S. ’s coal extracting future , the president ’s position is not only wrong , it is absolutely disastrous .
For millions of years , green plants have employed photosynthesis to capture energy from sunlight and convert it into electrochemical energy .
A goal of scientists has been to develop an artificial version of photosynthesis that can be used to produce liquid fuels from carbon dioxide and water .
Researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( Berkeley Lab ) have now taken a critical step towards this goal with the discovery that nano - sized crystals of cobalt oxide can effectively carry out the critical photosynthetic reaction of splitting water molecules .
“ Photooxidation of water molecules into oxygen , electrons and protons ( hydrogen ions ) is one of the two essential half reactions of an artifical photosynthesis system - it provides the electrons needed to reduce carbon dioxide to a fuel , ” said Heinz Frei , a chemist with Berkeley Lab ’s Physical Biosciences Division , who conducted this research with his postdoctoral fellow Feng Jiao .
“ Effective photooxidation requires a catalyst that is both efficient in its use of solar photons and fast enough to keep up with solar flux in order to avoid wasting those photons .
Clusters of cobalt oxide nanocrystals are sufficiently efficient and fast , and are also robust ( last a long time ) and abundant .
They perfectly fit the bill . ”
Frei and Jiao have reported the results of their study in the journal Angewandte Chemie .
This research was performed through the Helios Solar Energy Research Center ( Helios SERC ) , a scientific program at Berkeley Lab under the direction of Paul Alivisatos , which is aimed at developing fuels from sunlight .
Frei serves as deputy director of Helios SERC .
Artificial photosynthesis for the production of liquid fuels offers the promise of a renewable and carbon - neutral source of transportation energy , meaning it would not contribute to the global warming that results from the burning of oil and coal .
The idea is to improve upon the process that has long - served green plants and certain bacteria by integrating into a single platform light - harvesting systems that can capture solar photons and catalytic systems that can oxidize water - in other words , an artificial leaf .
“ To take advantage of the flexibility and precision by which light absorption , charge transport and catalytic properties can be controlled by discrete inorganic molecular structures , we have been working with polynuclear metal oxide nanoclusters in silica , ” Frei said .
“ In earlier work , we found that iridium oxide was efficient and fast enough to do the job , but iridium is the least abundant metal on earth and not suitable for use on a very large scale .
We needed a metal that was equally effective but far more abundant . ”
Green plants perform the photooxidation of water molecules within a complex of proteins called Photosystem II , in which manganese - containing enzymes serve as the catalyst .
Manganese - based organometallic complexes modeled off Photosystem II have shown some promise as photocatalysts for water oxidation but some suffer from being water insoluble and none are very robust .

In looking for purely inorganic catalysts that would dissolve in water and would be far more robust than biomimetic materials , Frei and Jiao turned to cobalt oxide , a highly abundant material that is an an important industrial catalyst .
When Frei and Jiao tested micron - sized particles of cobalt oxide , they found the particles were inefficient and not nearly fast enough to serve as photocatalysts .
However , when they nano - sized the particles it was another story .
“ The yield for clusters of cobalt oxide ( Co 3 O 4 ) nano - sized crystals was about 1,600 times higher than for micron - sized particles , ” said Frei , “ and the turnover frequency ( speed ) was about 1,140 oxygen molecules per second per cluster , which is commensurate with solar flux at ground level ( approximately 1,000 Watts per square meter ) . ”
Frei and Jiao used mesoporous silica as their scaffold , growing their cobalt nanocrystals within the naturally parallel nanoscale channels of the silica via a technique known as “ wet impregnation . ”
The best performers were rod-shaped crystals measuring 8 nanometers in diameter and 50 nanometers in length , which were interconnected by short bridges to form bundled clusters .
The bundles were shaped like a sphere with a diameter of 35 nanometers .
While the catalytic efficiency of the cobalt metal itself was important , Frei said the major factor behind the enhanced efficiency and speed of the bundles was their size .
“ We suspect that the comparatively very large internal area of these 35 nanometer bundles ( where catalysis takes place ) was the main factor behind their increased efficiency , ” he said , “ because when we produced larger bundles ( 65 nanometer diameters ) , the internal area was reduced and the bundles lost much of that efficiency gain . ”
Frei and Jiao will be conducting further studies to gain a better understanding of why their cobalt oxide nanocrystal clusters are such efficient and high - speed photocatalysts and also looking into other metal oxide catalysts .
The next big step , however , will be to integrate the water oxidation half reaction with the carbon dioxide reduction step in an artificial leaf type system .
“ The efficiency , speed and size of our cobalt oxide nanocrystal clusters are comparable to Photosystem II , ” said Frei .
“ When you factor in the abundance of cobalt oxide , the stability of the nanoclusters under use , the modest overpotential and mild pH and temperature conditions , we believe we have a promising catalytic component for developing a viable integrated solar fuel conversion system .
This is the next important challenge in the field of artificial photosynthesis for fuel production . ”

Talk show host and conservative icon Rush Limbaugh recently ignited a firestorm of criticism for expressing his desire that Barack Obama should fail .
Democrats , and even some Republicans , suggested that he had put aside his patriotism to wish for an economic collapse that would result in political advantage for conservatives .
However , if you believe as I , and apparently Rush , that Obama ’s plans will prevent recovery , then wishing that they fail to become actual policy is the right thing to do .
The problem is that since Mr. Limbaugh has a history of partisanship , and since he did not forcefully criticize the Bush Administration for similar ( if slightly more modest ) plans , many cannot see past the messenger to recognize the truth in the message .
I am certain that if Obama and the Pelosi / Reid Congress succeed in fully implementing their agenda , there is no chance the U.S. economy will recover its position as world ’s leading economy .
Instead , America will start down the road that has condemned so many nations to economic mediocrity .
By continuing and magnifying the Bush stimulus and bailout policies , the economic rebalancing that is so vital to a sustainable recovery cannot occur .
Limbaugh merely said what members of the loyal opposition would say if they were true to their supposed philosophy .
But since so many Republicans supported the Bush bailouts and stimulus packages , it would be too blatantly hypocritical to reverse course now .
In truth , for all his talk of change Obama has merely continued and expanded the failed policies of Bush .
The one aspect of Obama ’s agenda that has galvanized Republican criticism is higher taxes on the rich .
While I also abhor tax increases , the spending increases supported by both parties are far more damaging to the economy .
In fact , I actually support Obama ’s decision to eliminate the " carried interest " tax advantages that had so unequally benefitted hedge fund managers .
If I had my way the income tax would be abolished completely , but as long as we have one it is not fair for hedge fund managers to pay lower marginal taxes than the guys who shine their thousand dollar shoes .
The arguments that higher tax rates will discourage hard work and initiative are true across the entire income spectrum .
It makes no sense politically to single out the mega - wealthy for special treatment .
The sad truth is that Republicans are spending their dwindling political capital on a non-issue .
Most hedge funds relied on leveraged borrowing to produce oversized returns .
Now that the debt markets are essentially closed , there is not much " carried interest " income left to tax .
The bigger issue is that few Republicans are making any serious effort to oppose the staggering deficits that will guarantee huge future tax increases and runaway inflation for everyone , rich and poor .
By simply clinging to tax cuts as their single economic miracle cure , Republicans risk further marginalization .
The president claims that his constituency is Main Street , not Wall Street .
But for all the scorn heaped on the " fat cats , " we must remember that it took two to tango .
Sure , Wall Street loaned out too much money , but it was Main Street that borrowed it .
Average Americans used the windfall for the biggest shopping binge in world history .
As a result our entire economy has been transformed from one based on savings and production to one based on borrowing and consumption .
Now that this false paradigm has been exposed , the transition back to economic viability will be painful .
Jobs must be lost in the service sector so that labor can be reallocated towards goods production .
Asset prices , for both stocks and real estate , must decline to levels appropriate for current circumstances .
In addition , the dollar ’s exchange rate must fall to reflect our weakened competitive position .
However , by postponing these adjustments we merely assure an even more painful transition in the future , especially for the average Americans whose interests our new president claims to champion .
But by then Obama will have his coveted second term .
Rush is right on this one : Obama ’s agenda must fail now , lest we wander too long down the road to destitution .

USSC To Review Convictions Of The “ Cuban Five "
Outpouring Of Support Worldwide Urging The U.S. Supreme Court To Review The Convictions Of The “ Cuban Five ”
In a previously unheard of twelve separate briefs , array of supporters worldwide – including ten Nobel Prize winners who have championed human rights ( including East Timor President Jose Ramos - Horta and Irish peacemaker Máiread Corrigan Maguire ) ; the Mexican Senate ; and Mary Robinson , the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and former President of Ireland – today filed amicus curiae ( “ friend of the court ” ) briefs imploring the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Miami convictions of five Cuban government agents , the so - called “ Cuban Five . ”
Those participants in the briefs were joined by hundreds of parliamentarians from the European Parliament and other parliaments around the world , including two former Presidents and three current Vice - Presidents of the European Parliament , as well as numerous U.S. and foreign bar associations and human rights organizations .
This is the largest number of amicus briefs ever to have urged Supreme Court to review a criminal conviction .
This extraordinary support for the Cuban Five ’s case arises from widespread concern in the United States and around the world that their trial was conducted in an atmosphere tainted by prejudice against agents of the Cuban government and fear of retaliation , which amici say prevented the jury from fairly evaluating the charges against the Five .
Among others , the United Nations Human Rights Commission has condemned the Miami trial of the Cuban agents , marking the first and only time in history that that body has condemned a U.S. judicial proceeding .
Citing a “ climate of bias and prejudice ” in Miami , the Commission ’s Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions concluded that the “ trial did not take place in the climate of objectivity and impartiality that is required to conform to the standards of a fair trial . ”
The amicus briefs filed today ask the Supreme Court to review the fairness of trying the Cuban agents to a Miami jury .
“ The trial and conviction of the Cuban 5 is a national embarrassment , ” explained Michael Ratner , President of the Center for Constitutional Rights , which represented the Nobelists in filing their amicus brief .
“ Our clients , ten Nobel Prize winners , acclaimed for their efforts to advance human rights , believe the trial was an international embarrassment as well .
This was a trial that should have never occurred in Miami .
There was no way a jury from that Miami , with is history of violence and intimidation against the Cuban government , could have reached a verdict free from retaliation by the anti-Castro community . ”
Several of the amicus briefs filed by U.S. organizations also ask the Supreme Court to review the prosecution ’s striking African - Americans from the jury .
The prosecutor used seven of nine “ peremptory challenges ” ( where no explanation need be given to strike a juror ) to strike black jurors .
The Court of Appeals ruled that no inquiry need be made into the prosecutor ’s motives because three other black jurors , a minority on the 12 - person jury , were seated .
Amici maintain that this is allows prosecutors to mask their manipulation of the racial make - up of a jury .
The U.S. government ’s brief in opposition is presently due April 6 .
The Court is likely to decide whether to grant review before its summer recess in June .
The amicus briefs , along with a complete list of the amici , will be posted on SCOTUSblog ( www.scotusblog.com) as electronic copies become available today .
Additional background on the case :
The United States indicted the five Cubans in Miami in 1998 .
The indictment focused on the charge that they were unregistered Cuban agents and had infiltrated various anti-Castro organizations in South Florida .
One of the Five , Gerardo Hernandez , was also charged with conspiracy to commit murder for providing information to Havana on flights in which the anti-Castro group Brothers to the Rescue would routinely invade Cuba airspace .
On February 24 , 1996 , two BTTR planes were destroyed after both Cuban and American officials had repeatedly warned the Miami - based group to cease its illegal incursions into Cuban territory .
Cuba maintains that it shot the planes down in its territory ; the U.S. has maintained that the shootdown occurred a few miles into international airspace , after the planes entered and exited Cuban airspace .
The Cuban Five requested that the trial judge move the trial out of Miami , which is home to a massive Cuban - American exile community that , beyond its ordinary hostility towards the Castro regime , had been whipped into a frenzy of anti-Castro sentiment by the Elian Gonzales debacle that took place just as the Cuban Five ’s trial got underway .
Judge Lenard refused that request to move the trial to a new venue some thirty miles away , and a Miami jury convicted Hernandez and the others of all charges .
Judge Lenard imposed the maximum available sentences on the Five , including life imprisonment for Hernandez .
On appeal , a three - judge panel of the federal Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the convictions and ordered a new trial because , the court held , a “ perfect storm ” of community prejudice and pre-trial publicity , exacerbated by the federal prosecutor ’s inflammatory statements to the jury , deprived Hernandez and the other Cubans of a fair trial .
The entire Court of Appeals , however , vacated the panel ’s decision , finding no error in the government trying the case to a Miami jury .
It returned the case to a panel to evaluate the remaining issues in the appeal .
In another key ruling , two of the three judges on the panel refused to reverse the Miami jury ’s conviction of Hernandez .
Judge Kravitch dissented , finding that there was no evidence at all that Hernandez knew there would be a shootdown , let alone an unlawful shootdown in international airspace .

First off , let me say that mark - to - market did not cause the economic crisis despite what some bank CEOs may tell you .
A series of risky investments and lending money to borrowers with no prospect of ever repaying their loans brought us to our present situation .
So with that cleared up , letÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s look at some of the discussion around current bank valuations and the question of mark - to - market accounting .
Mark - to - market Ã¢â‚¬â€œ also known as the fair value rule Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is an accounting regulation that requires companies to assign a value to both their assets and their debts each quarter based on current market prices .
This rule was implemented to ensure that companies provide a true representation of their financial standing so that regulators and investors can accurately determine the viability and profitability of each publically - traded company .
While the goal of this rule is to eliminate Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ creative accountingÃ¢â‚
¬Â , the concept of mark - to - market has been exploited in the past , perhaps most famously by Enron .
Enron specialized in energy futures and created a series of new securities including long - term gas futures contracts which often traded without a quoted market price .
This permitted Enron to develop their own Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ discretionaryÃ¢â‚
¬Â pricing model for derivatives to arrive at marked - to - market pricing .
Given such wide latitude to set their own market prices , and knowing what we do now about the Enron culture , it is hardly surprising that these prices were a bit inflated Ã¢â‚¬â€œ more like mark - to - make believe really Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ and this allowed Enron to show a series of massive profits .
Naturally , these artificial prices could only be sustained for so long before crashing , which Enron did in spectacular fashion .
This is why it is somewhat alarming to hear bank execs and even some politicians suggesting that the mark - to - market should be abandoned to Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ help reviveÃ¢â ‚
¬
Â the banking system .
The banks claim that the mark - to - market rule will force them to report massive losses on their balance sheets for assets that have lost most of their value , but which the banks have no intention to sell at this time .
They feel that these Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ paper lossesÃ¢â‚
¬
Â should not be counted against them until the assets are actually sold .
Apparently , the banks still believe that all these aptly - named toxic assets will someday regain their value , at which point investors will be lined - up to buy and everything will return to normal again .
Right Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as appealing as this delusional bit of thinking may be to the banks , millions of private investors have seen these Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ paper lossesÃ¢â‚
¬
Â tear their own portfolios to shreds so IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m thinking there is not a lot of support for the banks on this question right now .
However , on one front , an argument could be made for easing the fair market rules Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for the time being at least .
Now do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t read this as me being soft on the banks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for reporting purposes as described above , I say fair value all the way , but for regulatory purposes , perhaps we should examine the question more closely .
ThatÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s because , when providing valuations for disclosure or reporting , no additional action is required on the part of investors or the public in general , but for regulatory assessments , the losses could have important implications .
If banks marked assets to market prices when determining capitalization levels , there is little doubt that the losses would cause many of the large banks to fall short of the minimum regulated targets .
These banks would then be forced to find investors willing to provide enough capital to bring their reserve funds up to acceptable levels , but given the lack of credit within the system Ã¢â‚¬â€œ matched only by the lack of trust the banks have for each other right now Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ it seems likely that the taxpayer would ultimately have to provide the funds .
Secondly , doing away with capitalization level requirements could actually lend more credibility to the ongoing bank stress tests Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ which quite frankly , are already suffering from a credibility shortfall .
The purpose of the stress tests is to determine how much capital each of the major banks needs to remain solvent should the economy follow the scenario predicted by the Treasury Department Ã¢â‚¬â€œ could this not serve as the regulatory check on bank solvency ?
Make the banks complete their quarterly report using mark - to - market accounting to ensure full transparency and disclosure but use the findings of the stress test to confirm capitalization needs .
The Financial Account Standards Board ( FASB ) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the private sector organization responsible for establishing US accounting standards Ã¢â‚¬â€œ has scheduled a vote on April 2nd to look at the possibility of easing mark - to - market requirements .
No doubt , the banks would like to see fair value suspended across the board for both reporting and capitalization assessments , but this seems unwarranted with the stress tests due for the end of April .
It is not yet clear which way the FASB is leaning , but the idea of the status quo for reporting , while easing the regulatory side of the issue , may be worthy of consideration .

When I flew home from Washington , DC after a business trip last week , the TSA agent asked to test my laptop .
I politely asked what they were testing for .
It was just routine she told me .
And she ’s right , it has become routine , a much too routine standard operating procedure designed to make us believe that the usurping of our privacy and human rights is normal and necessary if we are to be secure and free .
Most insidious are the toys marketed to preschool and elementary school age children that exploit the war on terror mantra .
Playmobil has several toys that fit that bill , including Playmobil Security Checkpoint ( for ages 4 - 7 ) and Playmobil Police Checkpoint ( for ages 10 and up ) .
The obvious irony is that we are not secure and free if government agents have a right to violate our privacy and deny our rights without cause .
I considered protesting but I figured that the best outcome of that would be missing my flight , the worst case being detained incommunicado in an undisclosed location .
The likelihood of a plausible explanation for this sudden interest in my laptop was undoubtedly nil .
In otherwords , whatcha gonna do and TSA knows that .
My youngest son barely has a memory of when you could get on a plane without having to take off your shoes first .
He was in 4th grade on Sept. 11 , 2001 and within days his school was decked out in American flags and “ I Support President Bush ” signs appeared everywhere .
For him this is normal , the way things are supposed to be .
And that is no accident .
What is particularly disturbing about the normalizing of this notion that it is unpatriotic to question measures that supposedly defend us from acts of terror is the use of entertainment to hawk the message .
In addition to the Disney - owned ABC ’s Homeland Security reality show , there is now a Homeland Security television channel on the internet that bills itself as ,
( T) he world ’s first online , on - demand television network dedicated to homeland security and global development .
HSTV is a 24/7 interactive television channel dedicated to producing broadcast - quality video programs on all aspects of homeland security and the role of global development in fighting terrorism .
HSTV is also dedicated to facilitating rapid awareness of new technologies and services , and assisting in the transfer of those technology solutions to the government and critical infrastructure marketplace .
And the U.S. military has spared no expense giving kids every opportunity to play sanitized military video games that helpfully provide links to military recruiting sites .
In addition to video games such as “ America ’s Army “ , the Army recently opening the $ 12 million U.S. Army Experience Center at the Franklin Mills shopping center outside of Philadelphia where kids can play sanitized military video games . ”
The Philadelphia center lures recruits with a separate room for prospective soldiers to “ fire ” from a real Humvee on enemy encampments projected on a 15 - foot - high ( 4.5 - meter - high ) battleground scenario that also has deafening sound effects .
In another room , those inclined to attack from above can join helicopter raids in which enemy soldiers emerge from hide - outs to be felled by automatic gunfire rattling from a simulator modeled on an Apache or Blackhawk helicopter .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Most insidious however are the toys marketed to preschool and elementary school age children that exploit the war on terror mantra .
Playmobil has several toys that fit that bill , including Playmobil Security Checkpoint ( for ages 4 - 7 ) and Playmobil Police Checkpoint ( for ages 10 and up ) .
The only thing that gives one hope are the product reviews on Amazon where you can buy these propaganda for profit gems .
Here is one of the reviews of the Security Checkpoint toy :
Finally a toy that gets our kids used to living in a police state .
Benjamin Franklin said that those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety , deserve neither Liberty nor Safety .
But then again , he lived in France for awhile , so what did he know about anything .
Before this toy came out I was afraid my son would not know how to cope with the new reality of American life ; how to prepare him to the future , I was wondering .
Boy am I relieved ; so many lessons learned !
Now he knows that :
1 ) Some people can make a decent living treating others like cattle , and the best part : the cattle is paying their salaries .
2 ) You only have the rights that the government gives you ; you can move around the country only if you comply with government regulations , no matter how frivolous they might be .
No liquid you say ?
except if in a ziplock bag ?
Check .
Lighter ok because the cigarette lobby fought the no-lighter rule ?
Swell .
All passengers searched but cargo mostly un-scrutinized ?
No problem .
3 ) You should always bow to people in uniforms , even though they might be in this job because they could not qualify for police work ( because of the rap sheet or the drug abuse ) .
Unfortunately , this toy comes short in a few areas : 1 ) It does not show that if you ’re rich , you do n’t have to wait in line for hours .
If you can travel first class , you get your own fast - track screening .
Too bad the terr’ists have plenty of Saudi and Pakistani cash and can easily travel first class should they want to .
They should have included another screening set in the box .
2 ) It does not come with the 300 tired - looking playmobils you would need to show the passengers waiting in line behind the screening area .
However , it does some things very well : for instance , the screening apparatus is not actually functional .
This represents faithfully the actual TSA system , which , every time it is tested or audited , fails to catch anything ( weapons , even bombs ) .
So , thank you Playmobil .
I hope they will expand their product offering and give us more toys that can help our children prepare for the new reality of a much safer America ; specifically , I am eagerly waiting for the Staline - style Guantanamo American gulag set , the North - Korean - style CIA water - boarding set , the KGB - style NSA phone - tapping set .
Some people will whine about the loss of their civil liberties , but my son knows that the North - Korean are some of the safest people in the world .
They had virtually no fear of terrorists .
Quite honestly after falling out of my chair laughing at a whole slew of reviews in that vein , I began to think that never mind that I was reading this on Amazon , perhaps these were spoofs .
However queries to both Playmobil and Amazon confirmed that both products , sadly , are for real .
As difficult as it sometimes seemed to raise sons during the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Power Ranger years , clearly teaching children the difference between right and wrong has become far more challenging as the toys and games pitched at them become blatant police state propaganda .

TOKYO , ( CNN ) -- Japan is mobilizing its missile defense system , and U.S. Navy ships are deploying to the Sea of Japan , as North Korea prepares to launch a rocket that is expected next month , officials said .
Japan 's move , aimed at shooting down debris from the launch that might fall into its territory , is notable for a country with a pacifist constitution .
The U.S. ships are capable of shooting down ballistic missiles , a Navy spokesman said .
North Korea says it will launch a commercial satellite on top of a rocket sometime between April 4 and April 8 .
But other governments fear the North Koreans will actually put a long - range missile on top of the rocket .
The United States and Japan have been stepping up pressure on North Korea , hoping to head off the launch .
Watch why the U.S. is ' very concerned ' »
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexei Borodavkin on Friday also urged North Korea to not launch the rocket , Russia 's Interfax news agency reported .
Japan 's military has two - pronged orders : to move destroyers carrying air - to - sea missiles to the Sea of Japan , which separates Japan and North Korea , and to send land - to - air missiles to northern Japan .
However , the probability of a missile successfully hitting a moving target without a known trajectory -- as in the case of debris -- is very low , Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshitada Konoike said earlier this week .
If North Korea launches , the United States may have as little as five minutes to decide whether it is a threat and , if necessary , try to shoot it down .
Watch more about the rising tensions »
The U.S. ships that are being moved to the Sea of Japan are " prepared to track a launch or more , if afforded , " according to a U.S. Navy official who could not be named because of the sensitivity of the information .
The United States generally has a number of Aegis - capable ships in the Sea of Japan because of the threat posed by North Korea to launch missiles .
The ships monitor the region and are designed to track and , if need be , shoot down ballistic missiles .

The USS Hopper , a destroyer with the Aegis radar system aboard , was scheduled for a port call in Japan in coming days .
But the port call was canceled and the ship will remain in the Sea of Japan ahead of the launch , the official said .
Two other U.S. Navy Aegis - capable destroyers , the USS Chaffee and USS McCain , were leaving the port in Sasebo , Japan , and were heading to South Korea for a ceremony in coming days , according to the U.S. Navy official with direct knowledge of the operations .
The U.S. Navy just wrapped up military exercises with the South Korean military , bringing a number of its ships into the region .

Bisexual men might have their “ hyper - heterosexual ” female relatives to thank for their orientation .
Previous work has suggested that genes influencing sexual orientation in men also make women more likely to reproduce .
Andrea Camperio Ciani and colleagues at the University of Padua , Italy , showed that the female relatives of homosexual men tend to have more children , suggesting that genes on the X chromosome are responsible .
Now the team have shown that the same is true for bisexuality .
“ It helps to answer a perplexing question – how can there be ‘ gay genes ’ given that gay sex does n’t lead to procreation ? ” says Dean Hamer of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Maryland , who was not involved in the work .
“ The answer is remarkably simple : the same gene that causes men to like men also causes women to like men , and as a result to have more children . ”
Sexual attraction
The researchers asked 239 men to fill out questionnaires about their families and their past sexual experiences .
On the basis of their answers , the men were classified as heterosexual , bisexual or homosexual .
The results showed that the maternal aunts , grandmothers and mothers of both bisexual men and homosexuals had more children than those of heterosexual men .

Camperio Ciani emphasises that , rather than being a “ gay gene ” , this unidentified genetic factor is likely to promote sexual attraction to men in both men and women .
This would influence a woman ’s attitude rather than actually increasing her fertility , making her likely to have more children .
Simon LeVay , a neuroscientist and writer based in West Hollywood , California , describes this as a sort of “ hyper - heterosexuality ” and explains how it would help to ensure that homosexual behaviour was passed on through the generations .
“ The positive effect of an X - linked gene on female fecundity tends to outweigh the negative effect of the gene on male fecundity . ”
According to Camperio Ciani and colleagues , the same genetic factor appearing to be present in both bisexual and homosexual men provides further support for the idea that sexuality is determined by a complex mix of genes and experience .
“ We understand that the genetic component has to interact with something to produce different phenotypes , ” says Camperio Ciani .
“ Genetics is not determining the sexual orientation , it ’s only influencing it . ”

Tonal anomalies in Vernal Crater , Arabia Terra ( top image , red arrows ) are seen as spring - like mounds similar to those spotted in Dalhousie , Australia ( bottom image ) .
Mounds on Mars that could be from ancient hot springs are described in a new study , aftersetting the astrobiology community abuzz last spring .
Hydrothermalsprings on Earth , like those in Yellowstone National Park , harbor whatscientists figure are the closest relatives to the original organisms thatlived on our planet .
Finding these features on Mars ( or any other planet ) couldhave big implications for the questionof extraterrestrial life .
Mars hasmany features that suggest the planet was once warmer and wetter .
At the least , the ancient vents ?
if that 's what they are ?
would make great places to lookfor signs of past life .
The featuresfound on Mars , imaged on the edge of the Arabia Terra region by NASA 's MarsReconnaissance Orbiter 's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRISE ) , have " proved to be a very close match " to hydrothermal springs onEarth , said study co-author Carlton Allen , of NASA 's Johnson Space Center in Houston .
Thefindings , announced today , are detailed in the new issue of the journal Astrobiology , and were presentedlast April .
The shapesof the mounds and the channels that flow away from them are similar to thoseseen in the hot spring areas of Yellowstone , Allen told SPACE.com today .
They are situated in a deep crater with steep slope and could have been fed byunderground water sources on ancient Mars , which is thought to have beenconsiderably wetter than its present - day incarnation , he added .
But Allenand his co-author Dorothy Oehler , also of Johnson Space Center , can't confirm forsure the features ' provenance because they do n't know what they 're made of .
" Thething that we do n't have is compositional data , " Allen said .
The areasaround hot springs on Earth have particular mineral make - ups , and findingsimilar signatures on Mars would likely clinch the finding .
MRO 's CRISMinstrument could detect this signature except for one problem : Mars ' ubiquitouslayer of dust .
" There 'sjust enough dust to obscure the spectral features , " Allen said .
" Sowe are stymied as far as getting compositions on these particularfeatures . "
But ifsimilar mounds could be found in less dust - covered areas , spectra could betaken and the long - standing question of whether Mars once harbored hot springs ( and by extension , possibly life ) could be answered .
" Peoplehave been looking for evidence of spring on Mars for an awfully longtime , " Allen said .
Spectralfeatures that could have been produced by hot springs have been found on Mars , such as by the Spirit rover in the Columbia Hills , but no obvious correspondingsources have been found .
Allen hopesthat the features he and Oehler found will serve as " a template " forothers to search images of Mars .
He and Oehler conducted such a search ofthousands of images this summer , but did n't turn up any more features .
They seem " to be a fairly rare phenomena , " Allen said .
Though there is thepossibility that they once covered the surface , but were subsequently coveredup or destroyed by erosion and volcanism , he said .
Last night I wrote about the Obama Administration ’s housing bail out .
But , I hate to say , there ’s more to tell you – and it ’s actually worse .
In addition to the giveaways to mortgage holders , we also have to consider the federal government effectively offering to give a credit default swap ( CDS , remember those ? ) to the banks .
If one of the lucky homeowners that get a loan modification defaults on their mortgage because home prices fall again in the future , the federal government will make good to the bank for them .
There are some differences between this and a real CDS , though – the banks wo n’t have to pay a premium for the insurance .
The federal government is selling CDS for $ 0 .
Nice .
We taxpayers are putting up $ 10 billion for this piece .
Then there are the plans to “ Support Low Mortgage Rates by Strengthening Confidence in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . ”
There ’s that word again : confidence .
In a con game , the con man is n’t the one who is confident ; he is the one who gives you confidence .
You are so confident that you are making a good decision that you give him all your money to be part of his scheme .
If you still have any questions about confidence schemes , watch “ The Music Man ” again .
The Treasury nationalized Fannie and Freddie ( F&F ) last year – they are now owned by the federal government .
If you need more “ confidence ” than that in the strength of F& F then you should consider moving to another country .
Under the assumption that “ too big to fail ” makes sense , the new Bailout plan is increasing the size of F& F ’s mortgage portfolios by $ 50 billion – along with corresponding increases in their allowable debt outstanding .
This part of the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan will cost $ 200 billion , an amount that goes beyond the $ 2.5 trillion cost of the Financial Stability Plan and the $ 700 billion in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act / TARP and the $ 800 billion Stimulus Plan .
The new $ 200 billion in funding , according to the Treasury ’s plan , is being made under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act .
If you can remember back that far , the Housing and Economic Recovery Act was signed into law by the former and largely unmissed resident of the White House back in July 2008 to clean up the subprime mortgage crisis before any of the other bailout money was committed to clean up the subprime mortgage crisis .
This legislation established the HOPE for Homeowners
Act of 2008 which spent $ 300 billion to ( 1 ) insure refinanced loans for distressed borrowers , ( 2 ) reduce principle balances and interest charges to avoid foreclosure , ( 3 ) provide confidence in mortgage markets with greater transparency for home values , ( 4 ) be used for homeowners and not home flippers or speculators ( 5 ) increase the budget at the Federal Housing Administration so they can monitor that all this happens , ( 6 ) end when the housing market is stabilized and ( 7 ) provide banks with more ways and means to stop foreclosing on delinquent homeowners .
Three million homes were foreclosed last year despite this legislation or any of the other bills that passed before and after it .
Each new bill carries with it an increase in the limit on the national debt .
The most recent Stimulus Package increased it from $ 11.315 trillion to $ 12.104 trillion effective February 17 , 2009 .
The actual debt is currently at $ 10.8 trillion and rising .
With only $ 1.3 trillion between the actual debt and the limit , Timmy Geithner ’s pals back at the Federal Reserve will have to keep the printing presses running overtime .
The “ new ” Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan is just a rehash of every old financial sector bailout plan .
The definition of insanity , according to a quote attributed to Albert Einstein , is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results .

On March 2 , the Pew Center on the States , a Washington , D.C. –based think tank , released a report on the staggering growth of the American correctional system .
Entitled One in 31 : The Long Reach of American Corrections , the report noted that “ sentencing and release laws passed in the 1980s and 1990s put so many more people behind bars that last year the incarcerated population reached 2.3 million and , for the first time , one in 100 adults was in prison or jail . ”
It also cited the tremendous increase in the number of people on probation or parole , such that “ combined with those in prison and jail , a stunning 1 in every 31 adults , or 3.2 percent , is under some form of correctional control . ”
Why is this relevant to Canada ?
“ We only need to go south of the border and see a nation that enacted mandatory minimums related to drug offences from the mid-1980s on , ” criminologist Susan Boyd told the Georgia Straight .
“ It did n’t reduce violence and drug use .
So here we are saying , ” ˜We ’re going to do this . ’ ”
Boyd — an associate professor at UVic and research fellow at the Centre for Addictions Research of B.C. — was referring to the reintroduction in Parliament by the Conservative government of a bill that proposes mandatory minimum jail sentences for drug offenders .
If passed into law , Bill C - 15 would , among its other provisions , throw people caught with one marijuana plant into the slammer for a minimum of six months .
If growing a single plant is done on a property that belongs to another person or in an area where it may present a hazard to children , minimum jail time is nine months .
Worse , the bill seeks to increase the maximum penalty for this particular offence to 14 years .
Vancouver ’s so - called Prince of Pot , Marc Emery , who is fighting extradition on charges of selling marijuana seeds to American growers , is a potential U.S. prison statistic .
Emery was handing out leaflets condemning drug prohibition , along with his wife , Jodie , on the south side of the city when the Straight asked him about Bill C - 15 .
“ Anything that puts more people in jail for drugs is going to fill prisons , ” he said .
“ It ’s a very expensive and failed policy that will only bring us more misery . ”
The Pew Center on the States report pointed out that many states in the U.S. “ appear to have reached a ” ˜tipping point ’ where additional incarceration will have little if any effect on crime ” .
In Washington state , which shares a border with B.C. , the report stated , “ from 1980 to 2001 , the benefit - to - cost ratio for drug offenders plummeted from $ 9.22 to $ 0.37 .
“ That is , for every one dollar invested in new prison beds for drug offenders , state taxpayers get only 37 cents in averted crime , ” it noted .
“ An updated analysis from 2006 found that incarceration of offenders convicted of violent offenses remained a positive net benefit , while property and drug offenders offered negative returns . ”
Conservative Abbotsford MP
Ed Fast deflected criticism that mandatory jail times have n’t worked in the U.S .
“ First of all , on the issue of deterrence there ’s contradicting evidence , ” Fast told the Straight .
“ I do n’t base my support for the legislation on the deterrent effect .
I base it on the prophylactic effect of the legislation .
Prophylactic means taking repeat , violent offenders out of our communities for longer periods of time . ”
Bill C - 15 is a reincarnation of Bill C - 26 , which the Conservatives introduced in November 2007 .
In February 2008 , a few months after Bill C - 26 was tabled in Parliament , Boyd started sending Prime Minister Stephen Harper a weekly letter in an attempt to educate the Conservative leader about harm reduction and drug regulation .
Boyd did this for a year , and she sent her 52nd and final letter in early February this year .
Bill C - 15 was introduced on February 27 , a day after the Conservatives filed Bill C - 14 , which toughens penalties for gang - associated violent activities .
As an educator , Boyd has this to say about mentoring Harper : “ The prime minister gets a failing grade on drug policy . ”

( This is n’t a full blog post , but a note of a few things about implementing game grids in Haskell ) .
A [ [ Cell ] ] structure seems to make sense for a lot of boards .
In fact , even the problems I ’m looking at might be approached simply indexing into row then col each time you want to access a list .
However it feels inelegant , and some of the things I want to do ( looking at lines of game pieces in a given direction N/ S / E/W ) would be more elegant if I can simply traverse the grid in an arbitrary direction .
morrow remembered there had been a discussion on haskell - cafe about grids (+ +) recently .
It seems to be mainly about infinite grids , but has lots of interesting stuff to absorb .
paolino remembered that comonads were useful in grid representation .
I do n’t understand what they are but google finds
http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/12/evaluating-cellular-automata-is.html which looks interesting .
I think I want a zipper , but did n’t know how it would work on [ [ Cell ] ] .
Saizan clarified : “ if Zipper [ ] a is the zipper for [ a ] , then the one for [ [ a ] ] is Zipper [ ] ( Zipper [ ] a ) , and depending on which layer you use the next / previous operations you move in one dimension or the other ” .
This is n’t quite true though , as when you move up / down by rows , you have to somehow remember the columnwise index .
( Saizan referred to fmap ’ing operations to keep the columns in sync , which is , I think , a more higher - order way of doing the same thing :-)
dolio posted an ADT representation of a grid .
I do n’t understand that at all yet , but it is pretty …
He also wrote a Traversable instance ( this would appear to be a generic way to expose functions to move around in your arbitrary datastructure )
I decided to try to fold a [ [ Cell ] ] into a Cell { value=x , down=d , right=r }.
This took me several hours last night , during which I cursed my feeble brain , and the fact that mutable references would have made the task trivial in other languages .
( However , mutable references would make the grid useless for many useful things , like keeping intermediate copies of grid state ) .
My no - doubt crappy code is on github ( I ’ll come back to it in more detail later )
While I ’m whining about haskell being “ too hard ” I should mention that I ’ve got bogged down in representing grids ( for games or spreadsheet ) in Java , Perl , and Javascript too , so I think it may be more a case of my brain being feeble .
That or I ’m just overcomplicating things …
( As I remember it , the OO representation of grids is simpler to get started with but then I get bogged down with issues of multiple inheritance etc. )
Comments and suggestions welcome , I should write a full post on this soon .
Mexico's efforts to get to grips with spiralling drug crime and corruption suffered a blow at the weekend when one of the country 's top police officers resigned amid allegations that drugs cartels had infiltrated his department .
Gerardo Garay , the head of Mexico 's military - style federal police force , stepped down to head off suspicion that he was working for a major drugs cartel .
" I am resigning because the bloody fight against organised crime makes it our duty to strengthen institutions , which means it is essential to eliminate any shadows of doubt regarding me , " Garay told a press conference .
" I will put myself at the disposal of the judicial authorities . "
He denied any wrong in the federal police force , and an official statement from the chief prosecutor 's office at the weekend indicated he is not under investigation .
But the decision is the latest episode in the government 's desperate battle to control the drug gangs who have been infiltrating Mexico 's security forces as one prong of their strategy within an increasingly no -holds - barred organised crime war .
Press reports have linked one of Garay 's closest lieutenants to the Sinaloa cartel , which is a major protagonist in the drug wars .
On Saturday the daily newspaper Reformer said the federal police had effectively " sold " control of the customs operations at Mexico City 's international airport to the gang .
So - called " narco banners " have also recently accused Garay of protecting Sinaloa - associated drug lords .
Narco banners are propaganda messages purporting to be from different trafficking organisation that usually seek to discredit a rival gang , and are often hung from pedestrian bridges over major roads .
Mexico 's deepening drugs crisis started four years ago as a fairly straightforward , if brutal , competition between different gangs .
They are fighting for control of routes for trafficking cocaine from Colombia , as well as a growing domestic users market .
Then a military - led crackdown launched by President Felipe Calderon in December 2006 both complicated who was fighting who , and triggered a dramatic escalation of the violence .
Execution - style murders have risen to close to 4,000 so far this year , including dozens of decapitations as well as a growing number of civilian victims with no obvious association with either drug trafficking or the security forces .
Some analysts believe the cartels have also increased the amount of effort and funds dedicated to corrupting the authorities .
This is not the first time the federal police have been under suspicion .
Garay took over as acting commissioner of the force six months ago , after his predecessor was killed by a hired assassin outside his parents ' home in Mexico City .
The gunman not only knew the supposedly secret movements of the police chief ; he also had a key to the external door .
Most Alzheimer ’s disease ( AD ) is sporadic , i.e. , not the result of inheritance .
Familial AD is relatively quite rare , but by studying heritable AD we ’ve learned a disproportionately large amount about the genetic risk factors that predispose an individual to contract the disease .
One of the major risk factors for AD is mutation in the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) gene .
Mutant APP is more likely to be proteolytically cleaved into the β - amyloid ( Aβ ) form , which generates the amyloid fibrils and plaques that characterize AD pathology .
Production of the toxic protein form is , genetically , speaking , a gain of function — so these APP mutations cause dominant inheritance of familial AD , i.e. , a patient only needs one copy of the gene in order to have a very high risk of early - onset AD , and they ’re 50 % likely to pass this phenotype on to their children .
A newly discovered mutation , however , turns that inheritance pattern on its head .
The A673V mutation in APP is associated with AD , but the inheritance pattern is recessive , i.e. , a patient needs two mutant alleles in order to acquire the disease risk .
In combination with wildtype allele , A673V does n’t cause AD .
Furthermore , the presence of the mutant protein prevents the wildtype protein from forming amyloid fibrils , even under very favorable in vitro conditions .
Di Fede et al. :
A Recessive Mutation in the APP Gene with Dominant - Negative Effect on Amyloidogenesis β- Amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) mutations cause familial Alzheimer ’s disease with nearly complete penetrance .
We found an APP mutation [ alanine - 673 valine - 673 ( A673V ) ] that causes disease only in the homozygous state , whereas heterozygous carriers were unaffected , consistent with a recessive Mendelian trait of inheritance .
The A673V mutation affected APP processing , resulting in enhanced β- amyloid ( Aβ ) production and formation of amyloid fibrils in vitro .
Co-incubation of mutated and wild - type peptides conferred instability on Aβ aggregates and inhibited amyloidogenesis and neurotoxicity .
The highly amyloidogenic effect of the A673V mutation in the homozygous state and its anti-amyloidogenic effect in the heterozygous state account for the autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance and have implications for genetic screening and the potential treatment of Alzheimer ’s disease .
The basis of this effect is unknown — why would an amyloidogenic peptide fail to form fibrils simply because a non-amyloidogenic peptide is present ?
It ’s tempting to speculate that is has to do with some aspect of the way in which Aβ proteins assemble into oligomers .
Crystals form only from assemblies of like objects ; by analogy , perhaps there are flavors of APP that can only form oligomers with their own kind — oligomers that are disrupted by the presence of other similar , but non-identical , monomers .
At present we ’ve got very little information to inform hypothesis building : amyloid fibrils are poor subjects for the standard techniques of structural biology , so their molecular details — and any clue about how this unusual mutant behaves — remain a mystery .
One experiment I ’m dying to see :
Do the A673V mutant proteins prevent other APP mutant proteins ( the ones associated with the dominant form of familial AD ) from forming fibrils ?

We live in a time in which advances in computer technology are creating exciting new opportunities for thousands of people who experience debilitating paralysis from disease and injury each year .
No longer does physical disability have to mean a life of isolation and despair .
Today , even the most severely disabled of us are using computers equipped with assistive technology to communicate with the people we encounter in our daily lives , stay connected with family and friends , manage our personal affairs , work , create , and attend school .
When I was diagnosed with ALS it never occurred to me to surrender to a life devoid of productivity , happiness , and quality .
So I did n't .
I adapted .
When I could no longer walk , I used a chair .
When my arms became so weak that I could no longer work as a professional musician I wrote and with the help of friends , self published a music instruction book .
When I could no longer operate a keyboard I wrote with speech recognition software .
Eventually , I lost the ability to speak and started using my current system which involves a small infrared sensor that clips to my glasses and responds to tiny facial movements .
Two years ago I discovered digital art and with it came a new passion .
I realize that there are limits to what I can accomplish artistically yet I persevere and continue to learn .
While my drawings may appear simplistic to some I believe in the universal truth that less is more and that much can be said with a few simple lines .
To truly live a life of quality , however , it is not enough to achieve personal success and happiness .
I have been blessed with good insurance , a steady income , and people who love and support me .
Others are less fortunate .
I believe it is important to offer a helping hand to those in need .
It is my hope that this is reflected in my art and how I live .
If I have helped others who find themselves in a seemingly hopeless situation realize that disability does not mean inability and that a life of quality is within reach then I have achieved success .

The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality , Justice and Healing has called on the US administration to end federal funding for abstinence - only programmess and commit to comprehensive sexuality education in the nation 's public schools .
" We urge you to help bring an end to sex education programmes that fail our young people , and to renew our national commitment to education that honors truth , respects diverse values , and prepares our young people to lead healthy and productive lives , " the Rev Debra W. Haffner , director of the Religious Institute , said in a letter to President Obama .
The Religious Institute also announced that more than 925 ordained clergy and national religious leaders have endorsed its Open Letter to Religious Leaders about Sex Education , urging policy makers , school officials and educators to provide comprehensive sexuality education that complements the guidance young people receive from their parents and faith communities .
The Open Letter states in part : " Young people need help in order to develop their capacity for moral discernment and a freely informed conscience .
Education that respects and empowers young people has more integrity than education based on incomplete information , fear , and shame .
Programs that teach abstinence exclusively and withhold information about pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease prevention fail our young people . "
The signatories of the Open Letter are part of a growing movement in the US religious community .
A majority of mainline Protestant clergy support comprehensive sex education programmes in public schools , according to a national survey released last week by Public Religion Research .
At least 10 faith traditions and the National Council of Churches of Christ have policies supporting sexuality education in schools .
And more than 15 denominations and faith - based organizations are part of the National Coalition to Support Sexuality Education .
The federal government has invested more than US $ 1.5 billion in grant programmes supporting abstinence - only education programmes , despite growing evidence of the ineffectiveness of these programs .
In 2007 , an evaluation funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services showed that youth enrolled in abstinence - only education programmes were no more likely than other youth to delay sexual initiation , have fewer sexual partners or abstain entirely from sex .
" As religious leaders , we believe there are strong moral foundations for giving our young people the information they need to make responsible decisions about their sexuality , " Ms Haffner said .
" Education that is age - appropriate , accurate and truthful is the best way to assure that teenagers will make moral and healthy decisions . "
The Open Letter to Religious Leaders about Sex Education , list of signatories and the Religious Institute 's letter to President Obama are all available on the Religious Institute 's website , www.religiousinstitute.org.
The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality , Justice , and Healing , based in Westport , CT , is a nonprofit , multifaith organization dedicated to advocating for sexual health , education and justice in faith communities and society .
More than 4,400 clergy , seminary presidents and deans , theologians , scholars and religious leaders representing more than 50 faith traditions are part of the Religious Institute 's national network .

The project investigates the practical and theoretical impact of extending Haskell 's type system with numeric expressions ( representing sizes , or ranges , or costs , for example ) and constraints capturing richer safety properties than are currently managed by static typing .
It has three strands : ( 1 ) to investigate type inference with numeric constraints , ( 2 ) to investigate new programming structures , patterns , and techniques which exploit numeric indexing , and ( 3 ) to study the performance benefits derivable from richer guarantees .
A bright student could bring significant benefits to developers using Haskell , a language with increasing industrial traction — not least at Microsoft .

In troubled economic times , it 's often hard to convince the government to fund space science .
Heck , at least those much - studied fruit flies live on our planet .
But there 's one field of research that the public should be happy to support : keeping the Earth from being pummeled by asteroids .
And there is no shortage of ideas for how to do this .
Earlier this month , a skyscraper - sized asteroid passed within 50,000 miles of Earth — a galactic hair 's breadth separating the planet from an impact like one that flattened 800 square miles of Siberian tundra in 1908 .
Then there 's an asteroid spotted in 2004 and called Apophis .
Astronomers originally thought it might hit Earth in 2029 .
Then they decided that it could n't .
Finally they moved back the clock to 2036 .
The uncertainty is understandable , but not exactly reassuring .
And even if Apophis misses , some other rock big enough to put a serious dent in Earth and everything living here will take dead aim for us someday .
It 's just a matter of time .
Some researchers put the odds of a civilization - wrecker at one in the next 300,000 years , others at 1 in 10 for the next century .
But when our luck finally runs out , humanity will have something even more useful : guns .
As described in the scheduled proceedings of the upcoming first International Academy of Astronautics Planetary Defense conference , engineers have come up with plenty of ways to nudge an Earth - bound asteroid off - course , or failing that , obliterate it from its existence .
Here are some of their ideas .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF6mcywk0mQ
Direct nuclear explosions .
As immortalized in the movie Armageddon , we could blow an asteroid out of the sky like so much interplanetary skeet .
But there 's a catch :
The pieces could still hit Earth , and we might not have enough firepower to do serious damage .
It 's a last - minute , last - ditch option .
Nearby nuclear explosions .
Rather than blowing it up , a nuclear explosion could reroute a space rock 's trajectory clear of Earth .
This would need to be done decades before the asteroid reached us .
They are , after all , not easy to steer .
But models suggest it could work .
Laser sublimation .
Several spacecraft could use machines that direct beams of concentrated sunlight to the surface of an appropriately icy asteroid .
As it heats up , it 'll spew a plume of debris and change course .
Of course , anyone who 's ever tried to set a ball of paper aflame with a magnifying glass knows it 's not easy .
Now imagine that the ball was rotating and traveling faster than sound .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0FTByUifR4*Electric propulsion .*
To adjust course , land a spacecraft on an asteroid , fire up some rockets and push off .
It 's a potentially powerful approach , but controlling that push on a spinning rock will be difficult .
Gravity tractor ( pictured above ) .
Every object exerts a gravitational pull , including a single spacecraft .
Merely by hovering above the asteroid , it could pull the rock off course .
The approach could even be tried with the asteroid belt - exploring Dawn spacecraft , scheduled to finish its tasks by 2015 .
This is potentially much easier than electric propulsion , but not quite as powerful .
Solar sails .
Installing a photon - catching sail on an asteroid would be even harder than landing a ship , but it would certainly be prettier .
None of these approaches will work unless people see the asteroid in time to plan for it .
Under NASA 's Near Earth Objects program , six U.S. observatories
" search every clear night for these kinds of objects .
They are tracked , cataloged and stored , " said Steve Chesley , an astronomer at NASA 's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory .
" NASA 's goal is to find 90 percent of those that are one kilometer across and larger .
We 're at 82 percent right now , and we 've only been aggressively searching at current levels for eight to 10
years .
Those ones just have n't flown into view . "
Chesley declined to comment on the program 's budgetary status , but other astronomers have called for an expansion of its shoestring $ 4.1
million budget .
Congress asked NASA in 2005 to increase its survey efforts , but then - agency director Michael Griffin refused to divert the estimated $ 1 billion needed for an overhaul away from other projects .
" A survey is n't something you can do just once and close the book and walk away .
Even if you 've discovered an asteroid , you can only predict out so far ... a couple hundred years into the future at most .
The asteroids need to continue to be observed , "
said Chesley .
" Without early discovery , there are no options .
All the deflection technology in the world will not save you if you have n't discovered the asteroid before it comes to you . "

A couple months ago , Jeff mentioned to me that he was thinking of putting together the Ultimate Drinking Mixtape in time for St. Patrickâ€™s Day .
I got so excited that I persuaded him to immediately open the floor to suggestions from the Popdose writers .
And the song requests flowed in .
As the resident souse of the Popdose staff , I felt it was my responsibility to filter through the ideas that emerged and weave them together into something slightly more coherent than the drunken rantings
Iâ€™d occasionally find typed out on my computer during the extensive beta - testing process .
Later , during gamma- testing , the songs started to find their ways into groups .
Finally , when I reached the delta - testing phase , things had been organized into chapters that celebrate the many different aspects of that delightful elixir that can lift or lower our spirits , make us in turn beautiful or ugly , and loosen or tangle our tongues with equal abandon .
Here ’s the full tape – 116 minutes of pure malt goodness , with some wonderful words of wisdom sprinkled in . Â
Just add liquor .

2/2 UPDATE : ESPN will remove the ad , embedded below , from its site and post a statement , its Associate Director of Diversity , Stephanie Turner , told GLAAD 's Sports Media program Monday afternoon . ( PageOneQ )
2/1 : ESPN has released a new commercial advertising a website that is being billed as the destination for information on the NBA .
The site provides information on their ' NBA on ESPN RV Tour ' a promotion for ABC and ESPN and scheduling for upcoming basketball games .
They have released this new commercial in which Shaquille O'Neal finds the homo insinuation of a " fist kiss " to be " weird & disgusting . "
He goes on to make fun of the suggestion , in an effeminate voice .
Networks like ESPN , ABC , and stars like Shaquille O'Neal should be held to a higher standard .
Millions of young people look to these shows , and celebrities as role models and for their guidelines .
Commercials like these perpetuate fear of homosexuality and continue a condemnation of gayness and gender expression .
Voice your concern by calling on ESPN / ABC to remove this offensive commercial immediately .

Link of the day - Blind Spots : Why Smart People Do Dumb Things
At least once a year , Jean Mozolic used to take herself on vacation , traveling alone to places like Peru and India .
Divorced from her husband of 16 years since 1991 , Mozolic had gotten used to spending time on her own .
But recently , to save money and focus on working , she 's had to stop her trips completely .
Even so , Mozolic recently signed up on the dating site Chemistry.com , which costs her $ 49.95 a month .
" I 've been on my own for a long , long time .
And trust me , I truly enjoyed it .
I really did , " said Mozolic , who lives in Wrentham and runs a technical consulting business .
" I 've just gotten to a point where I want to share some new experiences with somebody .
I 'm at a point where I want somebody in my life . "
Mozolic said she would rather spend the money to find someone to travel with than save it and continue to travel alone .
And at 56 , she admitted she does n't know how else to meet someone .
Millions of singles are suddenly jumping on the online dating bandwagon , despite the fact they may not be able to afford to go on as many actual dates these days - or expensive ones , anyway .
Online matchmaking services - even those requiring fees to join - have seen an unprecedented increase in memberships in the past three months .
Some of the increase is due to the annual rituals of making New Year 's resolutions and thinking about Valentine 's Day , but experts are attributing most of the rise to the recession itself .
People seek companionship during times of crisis , and stress is more bearable when there 's a special someone in your life .
Some people may even be thinking that it 's easier to pay the bills when there are two people footing them .
Match.com , which now boasts 15 million members , recently had the best fourth - quarter earnings in its 14 - year history , said Mandy Ginsberg , senior vice president .
In December alone , member registration jumped 22 percent , which she described as an unusually large increase .
Match is n't the only love company thriving :
In November , eHarmony saw a 20 percent increase in users , the biggest spike in its history .
Ginsberg attributes the gains to multiple factors , including new features on Match.com , such as a news feed modeled after Facebook and the " Daily 5 , " which offers users five new matches a day , as well as a newfound comfort in looking for love online .
But her main theory has to do with how people behave in a lousy economy .
" People are anxious .
They 're not going out as much .
They 're not spending as much money out on bars [ and ] restaurants , " she said .
" So they want someone to find to kind of help them weather the storm . "
Joe Tracy , founder of Online Dating Magazine , said people are often too busy with work to think about relationships .
But with unemployment rates at the highest they 've been in 17 years , people suddenly have a lot of time to ponder their singlehood and what to do about it .
" Economic downturns usually call people to reprioritize their goals in life , and relationships usually move up on that list , " he said .
" That need for someone tends to go higher when things are n't going as well . "
January is typically the best month for online dating services , he said , but this year the bump in membership started around October - months before the New Year 's and Valentine 's Day rushes could kick in .
Though they might worry about losing their jobs , people still splurge on their personal happiness and well - being in times of financial crisis , said Dr. James Houran , a psychologist who developed programs assessing long - term compatibility for the dating site True.com .
Houran said looking for love online can relieve stress , making the cost seem worthwhile .
" While online dating certainly is n't a form of entertainment or escapism , [ users ] see it as a crucial part of life , a critical component that they 're not willing to let go , " said Houran , who writes a column for Online Dating Magazine .
Rachel Miller , a 22 - year - old Belmont resident , had to move in with her aunt and uncle after being laid off .
Now she works as a nanny for their three children , and also part - time at Starbucks on the weekends .
" I 've really had to scale back on a lot of things .
I do n't drive that much , I do n't go out that much , of course I work at home , " she said .
" I just do n't get out of the house much , and my social life is almost completely dead . "
In the hopes of making some connections , Miller joined Chemistry.com , which claims more than 5 million members .
" It was at the point where I scaled back enough that I had a little bit of money to work with , " Miller said .
Despite the sense of security that paid sites can bring - as many users assume the fee will weed out less serious users - some people prefer to save money by signing up on free sites , like Match.com 's new project , Downtoearth.com , Canadian - based PlentyofFish.com , or OkCupid.com .
Linus Minsk , 46 , of Waltham joined OkCupid recently .
He said he was unsuccessful in getting a date through Match and eHarmony , and has since become unemployed .
" In the past when I have spent money to join , there 's no guarantee you 're going to meet anybody , " he said .
" And I did n't meet anybody . "
After a crisis such as the loss of a job , people tend to search for a significant other , said April Braswell , a personal dating coach .
In the six months or so following 9/11 , she said , marriage rates spiked significantly .
Yet Braswell does n't think this rush to the Internet in the hopes of getting matched is entirely healthy , as people are looking to fill a gap in their life that has nothing to do with love .
" In terms of dating and wanting to be coupled up , we 're thinking that will reassure us about everything that just got really unstable because of the economic crisis , " she said .
" And in a way it can't , because it does not affect our 401 ( k ) , it does not affect our IRA . "
Nevertheless , Jean Mozolic said she will continue to look for a travel buddy on paid dating sites , simply because it 's the best option she 's found yet .
" I was n't meeting anybody the way I was doing it , " she said , " which was sitting at home , waiting for my knight in shining armor to knock on my door . "

Man Charged With Killing Hawk To Help Squirrel
( CNN ) --
A man who faked his drowning death nearly 20 years ago off a Florida beach was found out by North Carolina police who stopped him for a traffic violation , authorities said Thursday .
Bennie
Wint told police he faked his drowning death in Daytona Beach , Florida , in 1989 .
Bennie
Wint left behind a grieving fiancee and a daughter from a previous marriage .
Over the past two decades , he acquired a common - law wife and another child in Marshall , North Carolina .
Wint told police he faked his death in Daytona Beach , Florida , because he was " paranoid " about his narcotics - related activity at the time , Weaverville , North Carolina , police Sgt. Stacy Wyatt told CNN .
When pulled over in Weaverville on Saturday because of malfunctioning lights on his license plate , the man said his name was James Sweet , Wyatt said .
But when Wyatt ran the name through official databases , he was unable to find any information .
" I found it suspicious and believed it to be a false name , " Wyatt said .
He arrested the man on suspicion of driving without a license and giving false information , both misdemeanor offenses , and booked him under the name " John Doe . "
But " John Doe " finally opened up to Wyatt , admitting he was really Bennie Wint and had been on the run since 1989 .
Watch how reports of his death were premature »
Wint returned a call Thursday from CNN and asked what an interview with him would be " worth to you . "
Told that CNN does not pay for interviews , he responded , " Unless you want to pay for it , do n't come up here .
You are wasting your time .
There are ' no trespassing ' signs on my property . "
He then hung up .
According to police reports ,
Wint was on a trip to Daytona Beach with his then - fiancee , Patricia Hollingsworth .
She told police they were engaged and had discussed getting married while on the trip .
But it was not to be .
On September 25 , 1989 , Hollingsworth told beach patrol officials that Wint disappeared while swimming .
" We spent a bunch of time looking for him , " said Volusia County Beach Patrol Capt .
Scott Petersohn , who was on the beach patrol at the time , although he did not respond to the call .
" We used helicopters , boats and boatloads of lifeguards . "
Hollingsworth , then 37 , told officials
Wint entered the ocean about 4 p.m. and swam past the breakers before she lost sight of him , according to the incident report .
The report notes Hollingsworth was " very upset " and that after contacting officials , she " began to run north and south in the area , " looking for Wint .
Members of the beach patrol , however , thought the supposed drowning was suspicious .
" It is very rare to drown offshore and not wash back in onto the shore , " Petersohn said .
In addition , he said , the lifeguard on the beach told officials he did not see anyone swimming in the area .
Wyatt submitted Wint 's fingerprints to the FBI for identification and , while waiting for the results , searched the Internet for information on a Bennie Wint .
" I found a daughter that was looking for him , " Wyatt said .
The woman posted information about her father in 2007 , saying he went missing under suspicious circumstances .
Wyatt contacted the now - 23 - year - old woman , who said she was 4 when her father disappeared .
Wint has been released from jail and has not been charged in relation to the 1989 incident .
It was not known whether he contacted his daughter .
Wyatt said
Wint now has a common - law wife , a child and a business selling NASCAR items .
The night he was arrested , Wyatt said , his wife was " distraught " upon learning his true identity .
Wyatt said
Wint told him he was involved in narcotics in the 1970s and ' 80s , and " he ran out of paranoia , thinking people were out to get him . "
He said he went from Daytona Beach to Ozark , Alabama .
CNN 's attempts to contact Hollingsworth were unsuccessful , and it was unclear whether she knows
Wint is alive .
Petersohn said he is attempting to find the lifeguard on duty at Daytona Beach the day Wint disappeared to tell him the truth about the supposed drowning .
" For 20 years , that man that works for us thinks he might have missed something in the ocean , " Petersohn said .
" I 'm glad the guy 's alive .
I really am . ...
It 's unfortunate the way it went down at the time , people looking for a body that was n't out there . "

First post , time to say thanks and hello to Croozeus crew !
I spent some hours during the last days thinking about interesting themes and how to add value to Croozeus .
In my opinion ( after some months following Python discussion board at Nokia ) the topic “ Network Programming ” is frequently misunderstood and I decided to publish a serie of posts coverting this subject ( one or two per week ) .
In fact , with a little bit closer focus , better to say “ Network programming for PyS60 ” .
The following mind map may give you an idea of what I am planning :
So , stay with Croozeus in this new journey !
Suggestions are welcome !

In warp - speed modern America , time has become one of our most precious resources .
We manage it , and we expend it carefully .
Ironic , then , that a resource as precious as seconds , minutes and hours is so poorly understood and so routinely misestimated by modern humans -- by 15 % to 25 % in either direction , depending on the individual and the acuity of his or her time perception .
But understanding our ability to perceive time -- and to use time to make sense of our world -- is one of the newest and most sweeping frontiers of neuroscience .
Says UCLA neuroscientist Dean Buonomano : “ In order to understand the nature of the human mind , we must unravel the mystery of how the brain tells time , in both normal and pathological states . ”
Against that backdrop , the temporally challenged have become more scientifically relevant than ever .
Neuroscientists have come to recognize that patients with devastating brain disorders such as Parkinson ’s and Huntington ’s diseases greatly underestimate the passage of time .
Poor timing is a hallmark in several psychiatric conditions , including schizophrenia , autism and attention deficit disorder .
Many of about 5,500 soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with traumatic brain injury will find that faulty timing is one of the invisible wounds that follow them into civilian life .
And researchers have confirmed that as we reach senior status , our internal clock grows increasingly unreliable .
But to treat these disorders and to understand how we sense time ’s passage , researchers say they must stand back and see the brain as a complex network of circuits , some interlocking , some whirring away independently .
This “ network ” approach to brain science “ is a much more complicated problem ” than asking what tasks are performed in individual regions of the brain , says Catalin Buhusi , a computer scientist - turned - brain scientist who now researches time perception at the Medical University of South Carolina .
Decisions , decisions
We use our grasp of long spans of time -- from hours to weeks -- to apportion our energies :
Shall I surf the Internet aimlessly , or knuckle down and finish that report due tomorrow ?
Rats rewarded on a regular time schedule will grow more attentive and motivated to learn as treat - time draws near , Buhusi notes .
Students , he observes , show the same pattern , both in hourlong experimental situations and in their approach to the academic year :
They tend to party and socialize for the first several weeks of a semester and , in the weeks before finals , grow ever more attentive to schoolwork .
This sense of time is probably evolution ’s way , Buhusi says , of ensuring we mete out our attention and energy efficiently , rather than expending too much too soon and falling short at the end .
And it explains why open - ended challenges -- whether it is a mother - in - law ’s visit , a research paper with no deadline or imprisonment in Guantanamo -- can be deeply disorienting .
At the other end of the time spectrum is the elusive -- but tiny -- stretch of time we call “ now . ”
For most people , researchers have come to define the optimal “ now ” -- give or take a second or two -- about 2 1/ 2 seconds long , basically a human ’s typical span of unconscious attention .
Those whose “ now ” interval is much shorter than 2 1 / 2 seconds are readily distracted and thus unlikely to stay on task long enough to make full sense of their surroundings and respond appropriately .
If “ now ” is much longer than that , people ’s powers of attention may be too rigid to shift when necessary to keep up with changes in their surroundings .
The “ now ” interval may help explain why attention might be the most important -- and most fragile -- part of our internal clocks .
We see , move and react in tiny increments of this unconscious “ now ” : Motorists make constant calculations of time to avoid collisions .
Athletes use split - second estimates of time to connect with an incoming ball .
Planting a kiss in the right place requires a precise coordination of movement and time estimation .
The person with an off - kilter sense of the “ now ” will have problems with timing .
Time , interrupted
In a healthy human brain , researchers believe that every second we are conscious , a circuit involving three distinct regions of the brain -- the cerebellum , basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex -- is essentially checking and cross-checking incoming information and its time stamp .
In real time , that circuit builds a logical sequence of events out of information coming from different sources at different speeds .
From our earliest days , this circuit helps us to infer relationships of cause and effect , to make sense of the world and to learn .
A baby bats at a dangling toy clown , feels its soft covering hit her hand and , less than a second later , hears it jingle :
By correctly perceiving the order of those events and the tiny space of time between them , she learns that her action caused the clown to swing and jingle .
And in so doing , she learns she can do it again .
When this sense of time is disrupted -- as in several illnesses now under study -- the world can become a chaotic jumble of seemingly unrelated events , or of effects attributed to the wrong cause .
Chronically taken by surprise in an illogical world , a patient with what ’s increasingly known as a “ temporal disorder ” might respond with irrational anger or fear .
Or he may feel helpless to understand how his actions affect things and people around him , and lapse into apathy .
David Eagleman , a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas , suggests that such dysfunctions of timing may underlie what he calls the “ fragmented cognition of schizophrenia . ”
Schizophrenic patients , Eagleman says , are recognized as having spotty powers of time estimation -- sometimes too fast , sometimes too slow .
Patients with traumatic brain injury , including thousands of service members who have suffered concussions from bomb blasts in Iraq and Afghanistan , may also yield important clues to the brain ’s timing mechanisms , and what happens when they ’re disrupted .
“ These patients can see , move , hear ; all their sensory systems are intact , but they ca n’t interact ” in expected ways , says Dr. Jamshid Ghajar , a Cornell University neurosurgeon and time - perception researcher who directs the Brain Trauma Foundation .
“ They regularly tell you , ‘ I feel out of sync . ’
They ’re telling you they ca n’t synchronize when they ’re trying to interact . ”
In short , their timing is “ off , ” possibly because their injury has affected the bundle of time they unconsciously define as “ now . ”
Ghajar says that getting time right allows the healthy brain to project a few steps ahead of events happening around us , and to begin setting up to react even before it ’s necessary .
Whether volleying a tennis ball , answering a question or responding to a gesture , this anticipation allows us to respond smoothly to our world .
For many brain injury patients , such effortless interaction is subtly and painfully missing .
These victims of brain injury may seem awkward , lazy , agitated or slow .
But Ghajar thinks many of these patients have sustained damage somewhere in the brain ’s timing circuits .
The weak link
“ You can explain a lot of pathologies , ” including schizophrenia , autism and ADHD , as problems of time perception , Ghajar says .
These patients may start with faulty perception at the level of a few seconds and below , he says .
“ But if things start going off - track within that time frame , they ’re going to stay off - track through longer spans of time . ”
That may be one explanation for what happens to Parkinson ’s and Huntington ’s disease patients .
These patients , whose neurological disorders progressively disrupt motor control , routinely misestimate the passage of time -- both at very short intervals and at spans lasting several minutes .
In both diseases , the brain chemical dopamine becomes progressively less available , or effective , in the basal ganglia ’s mid-brain neighborhood .
But give a Parkinson ’s patient his medicine , which mimics the effect of dopamine , “ and his sense of time is restored dramatically -- within minutes , ” marvels brain scientist Buhusi .
Such bits of medical arcana suggest to some researchers that the basal ganglia might be the weak link in the internal clocks of these patients .
But the weak link could as easily be flagging attention , others say .
The Parkinson ’s drug L - Dopa also has the effect of goosing activity in these patients ’ prefrontal cortices , sharpening their attention .
“ We ’ve learned a lot from Parkinson ’s disease patients .
But we clearly have n’t got it all , ” Buhusi says .
As the link between time perception and health has grown more visible , the study of time is no longer the sole province of philosophers , physicists and poets .
“ There is no National Time Institute , ” says Richard Ivry , a noted time - perception researcher at UC Berkeley .
But as philanthropies and funders such as the National Institute of Mental Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs gain interest , time perception may cease to be what Ivry calls “ the stepchild of the sensory system ” that it has traditionally been in brain - science circles .
Time ’s time , in short , may be now .

PRINCETON , NJ --
For the first time in Gallup 's 25 - year history of asking Americans about the trade - off between environmental protection and economic growth , a majority of Americans say economic growth should be given the priority , even if the environment suffers to some extent .
Gallup first asked Americans about this trade - off in 1984 , at which time over 60 % chose the environmental option .
Support for the environment was particularly high in 1990 - 1991 , and in the late 1990s and 2000 , when the dot - com boom perhaps made economic growth more of a foregone conclusion .
The percentage of Americans choosing the environment slipped below 50 % in 2003 and 2004 , but was still higher than the percentage choosing the economy .
Sentiments have moved up and down over the last several years , but this year , the percentage of Americans choosing the environment fell all the way to 42 % , while the percentage choosing the economy jumped to 51 % .
The reason for this shift in priorities almost certainly has to do with the current economic recession .
The findings reflect many recent Gallup results showing how primary the economy is in Americans ' minds , and help document the fact of life that in times of economic stress , the public can be persuaded to put off or ignore environmental concerns if need be in order to rejuvenate the economy .
The Economy Versus Energy
Although the importance of energy as a policy concern in Americans ' minds has moderated since last summer 's high gas prices , a different trade - off question shows that Americans are more inclined now than in past years to favor giving the priority to energy production over the environment .
The question , which Gallup has used in this format since 2001 , asks Americans whether they favor protection of the environment at the risk of limiting energy supplies , or favor the development of U.S. energy supplies at the risk of harming the environment .
Respondents this year are essentially equally likely to choose the environmental option as they are to choose the energy production option , marking -- albeit by just one or two percentage points -- the highest percentage choosing energy and the lowest percentage choosing the environment in the nine years of asking the question .
There are , predictably , significant partisan differences in the responses to these trade - off questions .
As can be seen in the accompanying graph , only 50 % of Democrats , who typically have been the most environmentally oriented in their policy positions , opt for the environmental protection position -- just six points higher than the percentage of Democrats choosing economic growth .
( Republicans and independents are more likely to choose economic growth . )
This finding suggests that the economic crisis may present a real philosophical dilemma to those who ordinarily are strongly supportive of environmental protection , but who may back off in the face of the perceived need to restore economic growth .
The partisan spread is somewhat larger for the trade - off question dealing with energy and the environment .
Republicans and Democrats are almost perfect mirror images of each other in response to this question , with two - thirds of Republicans opting for energy over the protection of the environment , while two - thirds of Democrats hold the opposite view .
Bottom Line
There is little question that the current economic crisis poses a significant challenge for the environmental movement in this country .
Previous Gallup research has shown that concern about global warming has diminished this year , and the research reviewed here shows clearly that Americans are more willing than ever to forgo protection of the environment if needed in order to ensure economic growth or the production of energy .
With the economy as bad as it has been in recent memory , Americans ' preferences have swung even more strongly in the direction of the economy over the environment .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,012 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted March 5 - 8 , 2009 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
It 's been barely a month since Meg Whitman declared that she was running for governor of California , and the skewers are already out .
The state 's press has cast her as a political novice .
Late - night comics are loving this notion of eBay 's former CEO in charge of America 's largest state .
" Well , that makes sense , " said Jay Leno .
" I mean , the state 's broke .
If we 're going to start selling stuff , who better to be governor than the head of eBay ? "
Many businesspeople , as well as most of her friends , think she 's crazy to want to be governor at a time of crisis .
Yahoo ( YHOO , Fortune 500 ) CEO Carol Bartz says that when Whitman recently came to her office seeking support , " I asked her , ' Why in the world would you want to do this ? '
I probably asked her that question 10 different ways . "
Flash back to day one of Meg Whitman 2.0 .
We are sitting in her tidy living room in Atherton , Calif. , on a rain - soaked morning in late February , at 24 hours and counting before she is due to give the first campaign speech of her life .
Whitman , who left eBay ( EBAY , Fortune 500 ) a year ago after a decade in the job , seems unfazed by the trouble all around her .
Besides waking up this morning to find a giant oak tree toppled in her front yard ( it missed her white picket fence by inches ) , there 's the daunting reality of California .
" We have the fourth - highest unemployment rate in the country .
We 're 48th of 50 states in K - 12 education , " Whitman says , spewing stats and sound bites as if she 's rehearsing for her first political debate .
" Other states are stealing California 's jobs , " she says .
" California is failing .
I refuse to sit by and watch it happen . "
Whitman 's living room - for now her campaign office - is the starting block of what is certain to be one ( no , make that two ! ) of the most dramatic reinvention efforts in a long while .
One reinvention is California , which is more critical to the recovery of the U.S. economy than any other state .
Twelve percent of Americans live here .
Ten percent of Fortune 500 companies have headquarters here .
California 's GDP , at $ 1.8 trillion , makes it the eighth - largest economy in the world .
In the past year more people have lost jobs here than in any other state .
More homes have gone into foreclosure .
More banks have failed .
And as Whitman notes , businesses are moving out at an alarming rate , most often citing excessive regulation and intolerable taxes .
For top earners , California 's taxes are the highest in the U.S.
And to what end ?
California 's credit rating is the lowest in the nation .
The other reinvention is the businesswoman who wants to be CEO of the state .
Meg Whitman , 52 , was n't born in California - she 's from New York 's Long Island , and went to Princeton and to Harvard Business School .
But she has spent almost half her adult life here .
She worked for Disney in strategic planning in the ' 80s , moved back East , and then returned in 1998 to become CEO of a tiny e-commerce startup .
With her big - business knowledge base ( from stints at Bain & Co. , Procter & Gamble , and Hasbro ) , she built eBay from 30 employees and $ 4.7 million in revenue to 15,000 employees and almost $ 8 billion in revenue .
Her experience growing a large organization and coming to know some of the company 's 300 million registered users - 12 million in California alone - fortified her belief that " less government is simply better , " she says .
She 's appalled that California has nearly doubled state spending during the decade through 2008 .
And she abhors the new budget that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a fellow Republican and a tarnished model of reinvention himself , muscled through the Democrat - controlled legislature a few weeks ago .
A deal had to get done because California was broke and overdue on $ 2.8 billion in taxpayer refunds and payments to state contractors .
But the new budget that Schwarzenegger signed imposes $ 12.5 billion in tax increases and $ 5.4 billion in additional borrowing , along with $ 15.7 billion in spending cuts .
The tax hike is terrible for California 's future , Whitman contends .
" The budget is being balanced on the backs of middle - class families that are already stretched to the limit . "
Insisting that she " ca n't accept the logic coming out of Sacramento these days , " she has hammered together a platform that centers on shrinking the state bureaucracy and holding the line on taxes .
Her slogan : " A new California . "
Big move for a political novice
What dirt are they going to dig up ? "
That 's one of many questions that Whitman 's friends are firing at her .
The best " dirt " on Meg Whitman seems to be that in the past decade , she voted in elections less than half the time .
There is " absolutely no excuse for it , " she has been saying in her campaign speeches , but when I ask her about her voting record , she lobs an excuse my way : " I was head down , building eBay , with two teenage sons and a neurosurgeon husband , and traveling half the time , " she says .
In a state with a long history of business celebrities vying to be governor and blowing up - Northwest Airlines ' Al Checchi and financier Bill Simon , among others - Whitman is a relatively uncontroversial candidate , married to a doctor for 29 years , and with two sons at Princeton .
Her background makes her fair game for needling , of course .
One blogger on the Huffington Post jibed that she named her sons Prioritize and Skill Set .
( Actually , their names are Griff and Will . )
There are , though , valid reasons to question Whitman 's fitness to run California .
Her business stardom has nothing to do with turnarounds - which is what being CEO of this sorry state is all about .
Although Whitman was Fortune 's Most Powerful Woman in Business in 2004 and 2005 ( and eBay has christened its San Jose headquarters Whitman Campus ) , there 's no denying that her performance as CEO sputtered in her last three years there .
The company 's growth hit a wall .
Profits fell .
The stock , as high as $ 59 in late 2004 , now trades around $ 12 a share .
" She did acknowledge that she left a bit of a mess at eBay , " says Bartz , talking of Whitman 's recent visit .
" But you know , every CEO who has left their job recently has left a bit of a mess , because of internal or external circumstances . "
Whitman had no interest in a political career until the fall of 2006 , when Mitt Romney , her boss at Bain in the early ' 80s , invited her to breakfast in Silicon Valley and asked her to help him run for President .
Whitman became one of Romney 's finance co-chairs and helped him raise $ 12 million in California , out of $ 72 million he raised nationwide .
She also coached him on team building and , as he says , " making my message more clear . "
John McCain , who knew Whitman from their time as allies fighting against Internet taxation , admired her levelheaded effectiveness .
" She almost got Mitt elected , " he says , only half - jokingly .
When Romney dropped out of the presidential race , McCain asked Whitman to co-chair his national campaign .
She advised the Arizona senator on technology and economic issues - both fateful gaps for McCain .
Whitman was on his list of possible running mates - though not on his shortlist - before he chose Alaska 's governor , Sarah Palin .
The person who urged her to run for governor was Romney , whose father is believed to have been the only Fortune 500 chief ever to serve as a governor .
George Romney was governor of Michigan for six years during the '60s , after he turned around American Motors .
Says Mitt : " I told Meg , ' Most people in the private sector think life is too short to get involved , but if we just leave it to the politicians , we will have lost a lot . ' "
As she watched the California economy 's " devastating downward spiral , " Whitman says , she became convinced that " it 's time to run California like a business . "
While corporate America is out of favor at the moment , a lot of important people agree with Whitman , especially her friends in business .
Among her finance co-chairs : Cisco ( CSCO , Fortune 500 ) CEO John Chambers , Activision Blizzard chief Bobby Kotick , Sun Microsystems ( JAVA , Fortune 500 ) chairman Scott McNealy , and Yahoo's Bartz .
That power base will help Whitman raise money and gather support in advance of the June 2010 primary .
She is likely to face Tom Campbell , a former congressman , but the fiercer competition will come from Steve Poizner , California 's insurance commissioner , who sold his Silicon Valley startup , SnapTrak , to Qualcomm for $ 1 billion almost a decade ago .
Both candidates , like Whitman , are well regarded , smart , not particularly charismatic fiscal conservatives with moderate social views .
( She 's pro-choice and anti-gay - marriage but supports gay civil unions . )
Poizner , a Stanford - educated engineer , says , " If voters are looking to rebrand the state , she 's a very attractive candidate .
But if voters are looking to rebuild the state , they 'll turn to me . "
As for Schwarzenegger , he took office in 2003 after voters recalled Gov. Gray Davis and won reelection in 2006 , but he can't run in 2010 because of term limits .
His public - approval ratings have tumbled to 38 % as he 's lost favor mainly with his own Republican Party .
The flailing GOP is n't likely to help Whitman if she makes it past the primary ( California 's voters are 31 % Republican , 44 % Democrat ) .
The general election would involve Democratic heavyweights in an era when the party 's brand is riding high .
The rival nominee could be San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom , Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , or attorney general Jerry Brown , an energetic campaigner who was governor from 1975 to 1983 .
Brown displays a mix of ridicule and respect when he describes candidate Meg 's positioning this way : " ' I ran a business .
I can buy my campaign .
I have zero experience in government .
I want to take on the most difficult state government job in America .
Therefore , make me governor . '
That 's her campaign . "
Whitman is eager to fight what will probably be the most expensive governor 's race in history .
When I mention that I 've heard that her campaign might cost $ 150 million to $ 200 million , she does n't bristle .
And when I ask whether she 's willing to spend , say , $ 50 million of her own money , she nods and replies enthusiastically , " It 's conceivable ! "
Brown is amused but also a bit intimidated by the newcomer 's challenge : " I would not underestimate her , " he says .
" Fifty million ?
That 's a lot ! "
Changing her image , while staying true to herself
" This feels like a startup . "
Whitman is in what 's known in political lingo as HMU - hair and makeup - inside San Jose 's Tech Museum of Innovation .
She is standing before a semicircle of a dozen young staffers and thanking them for helping her pull off her first campaign speech with hardly a hitch .
This initial week of campaigning reminds her of her first week at eBay , in 1998 .
" I called the phone company to set up the phone lines , " she tells the group .
" I bought cubicles and furniture because we only had lawn chairs .
I wrote the marketing plan myself . "
Whitman the candidate has had to rethink a lot of things , including her identity .
In a 2004 story , I quoted the tag line she gave herself : " She 's frumpy , but she delivers . "
When I remind her of that quote , she laughs and says that now she has friends helping her buy new clothes .
" Nordstrom , Neiman Marcus , Talbots ... " she says , ticking off the stores where she has shopped lately .
" You know the last time I bought a suit ? " she asks .
" For eBay 's IPO .
That was Sept. 24 , 1998 . "
These days she carries a big black Prada tote , but she 'd rather be viewed as a populist than a billionaire , which she says she still is , despite the market meltdown .
( She has sold a lot of eBay stock but still owns almost 2 % of the company , worth $ 253 million . )
Inside her hotel room at the Irvine Marriott , right before a lunchtime speech , I ask her to tell me the label of her new pink silk suit .
" No , I won't , " she says .
You really wo n't tell me ?
" Absolutely not ! " Definitely not Talbots .
Whitman is , she admits , worried about losing her authenticity .
Her campaign guide is a 2006 book called " Politics Lost , " by Time columnist Joe Klein .
It 's about what can happen when political consultants and strategists try to turn candidates into something they are not .
( See Joe Klein 's advice to Whitman . )
From Klein 's book , Whitman embraced the idea that every candidate needs a " better angel , " a person to keep her true to herself .
Her better angel is her husband , Griff Harsh .
They met 35 years ago at a party at Harvard , where he was a senior and she was a 17 - year - old freshman visiting from Princeton .
Though they hardly talked that evening - he's an introvert , while " she 's always been a people person , " he says - she liked him enough to stay in touch and invite him to her sister 's wedding , near Harvard , two years later .
( Quite a power play . )
It was their first date , and he forgot to show up .
Well , actually he arrived at the wedding around midnight , as the band was packing up .
He apologized profusely , and she gave him another chance .
They 've been married for three decades now and have balanced their careers all the way .
When she was at Disney , near Los Angeles , he commuted weekly to his work in San Francisco .
She would n't have left Disney , except that he got an offer to be head of the brain tumor program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston .
He took the job and she moved with him .
She was at Hasbro , overseeing Teletubbies and Mr. Potato Head , when a headhunter called her and told her about a tiny business that had started by trading Pez dispensers on the Internet .
" I told him , I 'm absolutely not uprooting my family . "
She did , though , and now she 's ready to uproot again .
But why vie for the top job in the state when she 's just now learning politics ?
" There 's no training program for the job , " she replies .
" What matters is experience .
I 've successfully balanced budgets , run large organizations , and created jobs my entire business career .
And the next governor is going to have to do those things really , really well . "
Only a Bain - trained ex-CEO would figure out how she wants to govern by visiting governors across the U.S.
That 's what Whitman has been doing , seeking best practices from standout Republican leaders .
To talk job creation , which she says is the key lever to lift the economy , she went to see the Texas governor , Rick Perry , last October .
" More than half of all the new jobs created in the U.S. in 2008 were in Texas , " Whitman says , noting that Houston has become a magnet for " green " jobs .
" If you can get taxes right and regulation right , you can create jobs . "
She has set a goal to create 2 million new jobs in California in four years .
California dreamin ' , her critics say .
The Sacramento
Bee accused her of " pie - in - the - sky promises " and argued that the state added only 250,000 jobs annually in good times .
Poizner , too , says , " I 'm an entrepreneur , and I like stretch goals , but I 've seen no evidence at all that that 's achievable . "
Says Whitman , who worked with economists at Stanford to come up with her target : " We 'll do it by streamlining regulations , restructuring and cutting taxes , spending less and spending smarter . "
To talk education , which accounts for half of California 's $ 100 billion annual budget , she visited former Florida governor Jeb Bush .
They had met only once before , but he was flattered to spend a day with her and roll out his PowerPoint show .
" I just liked her overall style of having the humility to seek answers , " he says .
Bush explained to her how Florida boosted reading - test scores so dramatically that the lowest - income Hispanic student , on average , now outperforms the average California student .
Bush told her about expanding charter schools , grading all schools , literally A through F , and rewarding them monetarily for good performance .
Whitman wants to import some of the Florida reforms .
Meanwhile , she 's aiming to slash the state 's workforce at least 10 % and expenses an additional $ 15 billion .
For budget - cutting expertise , she turned to her mentor Romney , who was governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007 .
He told her she 'd need to scrutinize spending - " literally line by line , thousands of lines , and ask , ' Why are we doing this ? ' " he recalls .
" You have to peel the onion . "
Whitman contends that she 'll have more political will to delve in and make cuts than the current governor does .
" Being CEO of the state is not a popularity contest , " she says - an obvious dig at Schwarzenegger and a warning to the unions .
" In the real world business leaders cut expenses until the company is healthy again , " she says .
A grand gamble
Her record at eBay gives clues to the kind of governor Meg Whitman would be .
She was famously hands - on .
" If we had a 911 , which is what we called a site outage or other emergency , " says OpenTable CEO Jeff Jordan , who ran eBay North America and then PayPal , " it was all hands on deck , and you were n't going to sleep till you were done . "
Whitman consistently met ever - rising quarterly profit expectations until 2006 .
" Meg used to say , ' Last time I looked , the long term is made up of quarters , ' " says Rajiv Dutta , eBay 's former CFO who went on to head PayPal .
( Recently retired , Dutta , a Democrat , is another campaign finance co-chairman . )
When Whitman tried to be a visionary , she sometimes scored ( buying PayPal ) and other times did n't :
She took a $ 1.4 billion write - down on Skype , acquired for $ 3.1 billion .
" Did we pay too much ?
Yes , " she says , while insisting that eBay is better off owning Skype .
Clearly outdone by Amazon ( AMZN , Fortune 500 ) and Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) , eBay is undergoing its own reinvention by Whitman 's successor , John Donahoe .
Analysts speculate that he may sell the Internet telephony service .
No question , her latest career move is Whitman 's grandest gamble yet .
In the governor 's race , the one person who would probably beat her and anyone else who enters is Dianne Feinstein , the U.S. senator who has broad popularity across California .
But Feinstein , ever formidable at 75 , recently moved up to chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee .
Though she has long wanted to be governor , most people think Feinstein would be crazy to give up her powerful position in Washington .
Of course , politics everywhere is more unpredictable than ever .
" If you go back to 2006 , " Whitman notes , " everybody thought Hillary Clinton was going to be the Democratic nominee and Rudy Giuliani the Republican nominee .
Barack Obama was the huge long shot . "
The fact that Obama beat her man , John McCain , 61 % to 37 % in California does n't sink Whitman 's chances now , at least one veteran campaigner says .
" You 're right that I lost badly in California , " says McCain , adding , " California voters are notoriously independent .
Voters judge candidates on their individual qualifications .
It works greatly to her advantage . "
Another advantage is something that she did n't learn at Bain or Disney or Procter & Gamble or eBay .
P&G CEO A.G. Lafley , on whose board Whitman served , says that she has " the one essential element " that most CEOs do n't have : " the passion for public service . "
Even her early doubters are coming to believe it .
" At first I thought maybe it was just a case of ' I 've been a successful CEO , and this is my next venture , ' " says Yahoo's Bartz .
" But she totally convinced me .
She does have a passion to make a difference .
I think this passion may be greater than the passion she had to be CEO . "
She will need it .
Just 596 days till Election Day , and so much work to do .

You Don't Tug On Superman 's Cape ...
First , Define the Problem

light beam
Then Design the Solution
Here 's the Wind - up ...
... And the Pitch :
__________Those of you of a certain age will know exactly the song that was running through my head as I was listening to Jim 's mouse - catching story .
Jim Croce is famous for the original , but the link is to an excellent cover by Fretkillr .
To be fair , the little guy was just trying to stay warm .
Only he had no idea that his nocturnal habits coincided pretty closely with those of a night - owl engineer .
Especially one that already was consumed by the technical challenges of intertwining the new breed of remotes into the communication between camera and flashes .
Were it me , I probably would have just used a typical mouse trap .
Or maybe a .410 guage .
High nine for effectiveness , but low sixes on the PETA approval scale .
Jim , being an engineer , is driven to far more elegant solutions .
Which is also why you do n't see me designing cutting edge radio remotes , either .
Using a( correction : sound ) trigger and a set of motor - driven wireless TTL flashes with PW Flexes , Jim set the bait and waited .
Time after time , the mouse pulled off the heist before finally recording himself onto film ( or , pixels . )
Note the typical engineer 's approach to bait -- just throw in some of everything and see what happens .
Remember , one of the cool things about the Flex / Mini is that it can crank wireless TTL at full speed -- up to 8 FPS .
The pre-exposure communication burtsts do not have to happen , as the PW 's hijack the communication between the camera and flashes .
Which is exactly made the above , 6 - shot sequence possible .
Jim just composited it into one frame for reference .
Next , Jim set out to actually catch the mouse , " rather than just feed it , " as he told me .
And may I say that I love the walk - the - plank design of Jim 's trap .
It is humane ( more so than mine woulda been ) simple and it is darn - near foolproof .
And now that Jim had established the beam - tripper / wireless TTL sequence , he knew he could catch the little guycatch him in a photo , too . •
Mouse smells peanut butter .
( Forget cheese -- they have a serious jones for peanut butter . ) •
Mouse sees peanut butter out on nice , wide , safe ledge . •
Nice , wide ledge is in fact balanced to supportthe peanut butter . •
Mouse heads for peanut butter , tips ledge . •
Ledge has conductive tape that starts the camera - firing sequence when it begins to tip .
( Sorta like a low - tech version of the light beam device . ) •
Mouse ( hopefully ) drops into large , kitchen trash can -- with wireless TTL flashes going off the entire time at full continuous speed .
Schwing .
My favorite part :
The little guy 's toes , stretching out to grab something -- anything -- on the way down .
( Click the pic for bigger version . )
And yes , the peanut butter did fall down into the trash can with him .
Coulda been worse , right ?
Five minutes later , cue the bone - crunching sound of a garbage disposal .
Problem solved .
Kidding !
Actually , in addition to being a crack engineer Jim 's pretty much of a softy , too .
Which is why his worthy adversary is spending the remainder of the winter in this brand new condo , before being let out into the wild come spring .
Come to think of it , the mouse got cheese , raisins , cashews , peanuts and peanut butter , Not to mention a warm house with three squares a day through winter .
Not such a bad deal , considering ...
Detective ' forced alleged gang - rape victim to have sex in police station '
Timothy Jones , who resigned from North Wales Police in April last year , denies all three rape charges
A detective forced a woman to perform a sex act and then raped her while on duty in his own police station , it has been alleged .
The woman , a heroin addict , had been called to the station to be told that a complaint that she had been gang - raped by three men would not be investigated any further .
But it was alleged that Timothy Michael Jones , at the time a trainee detective with North Wales Police based at St Asaph Police Station , took her to a side room .
Prosecutor Robin Spencer QC claimed at Mold Crown Court that Jones asked if he could have a private word with a family support worker who had accompanied her .
He put the complainant in a side room , then returned and told her he could not believe that she had taken the complaint so far , adding ‘ how do you think anyone would believe you , ’ it was alleged .
He called the woman a smack - head and a whore .
She was shocked and scared and he pushed her against a wall and started to molest her , it is claimed .
Jones then told her to get on to her knees and forced her to perform a sex act , saying ‘ I heard that is what you are good at . ’
When she said she was not going to do it , he allegedly told her : ‘ You are , you know you are . ’
Mr Spencer said that the officer then said ‘ Let 's finish this off ’ , pulled off her underwear and had intercourse with her on the floor .
It was alleged that Jones had not believed her original allegation that she was raped by three men but Mr Spencer said that her dress had not been sent off for forensic examination .
Jones later claimed that was because a superintendent had said it was not worth the cost involved , but that was not the case , claimed Mr Spencer .
Jones , who faces two rape charges following the allegation in the police station in August 2006 , is also charged with raping another woman between March and July 2007 at her home .
She had made a complaint to the police , he visited her bedsit and it was alleged that he had asked her to remove her bra .
But he was back a week later and when she was taking a shower , he burst into the bathroom and raped her , it is alleged .
Jones , of Morley Road in Rhyl , who resigned from North Wales Police in April last year ahead of disciplinary procedures , denies all three rape charges and says that they did not happen .
Mr Spencer told the jury that in March of last year the defendant , a married man , had been cleared of a sexual offence against a woman he had met fleetingly in the police station .
But in his own evidence in that trial he had told the jury that he had been to her home while off duty , they had kissed and that she had performed a sex act on him , said Mr Spencer .
He had said in his trial that he was ashamed and embarrassed , was not proud of it , and knew that it was wrong on all levels , as a husband , father and police officer .
Following that complaint police checked his mobile phone , contacted women he had rung , and the two women made the rape complaints .
There were also allegations that he had behaved in a sexually inappropriate way towards other women .
Mr Spencer told the jury today that it was an unusual case and he started his opening to them by saying that ‘ truth is sometimes stranger than fiction ’ .
Both rape complainants were vulnerable women whose complaints of crime the defendant was supposed to be investigating , he said .
Both women were vulnerable and feared that they would not be believed , he said .
‘ The two women did not know each other .
‘ The complaints of rape were made entirely independent of each other , ’ said Mr Spencer .
At first the jury may wonder whether the allegations could possibly be true , he said .
‘ But taken together , and in conjunction with behaviour of a sexual nature towards other women he had come across in the course of his duty , a very disturbing picture emerges , ’ he said .
‘ The prosecution say that the inescapable conclusion , sadly , is that the defendant grossly breached the trust which is the hallmark of the relationship between the police and the public and that he committed very serious offences . ’
The trial , before a jury of six men and six women , is proceeding before Judge Dafydd Hughes .
It is expected to last two weeks .
( CNN ) -- Smugglers carrying a boatload of migrants forced their passengers to jump overboard in deep water off the coast of Yemen , causing up to 17 to drown , the United Nations said Tuesday .
The 52 Somali and Ethiopian passengers in one of seven boats crossing the Gulf of Aden were made to jump after the smugglers spotted police and refused to sail closer to shore , the U.N 's refugee agency UNHCR said in a statement .
It said 35 people made it to land , six drowned and 11 others were missing presumed dead .
Almost 10,000 people have made the perilous journey across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen this year .
Forty - seven people have died , with 23 bodies buried and 24 missing at sea , the UNHCR said .
Last year , more than 50,000 people crossed the gulf into Yemen .
Many are fleeing the war in Somalia , but recent months have seen an increase in the number of refugees from Ethiopia .
Yemen is a common destination for Somalis fleeing economic hardship and war because of its proximity .
It is also an attractive location because Somalis receive automatic refugee status in the fellow Muslim country .
But according an article in the Yemen Post newspaper last year , the country is just a stopping point for most of the refugees , who then travel on to the wealthier Persian Gulf states , Europe or the United States .
In 2008 , Yemen 's coast guard stepped up patrols of its coastline to deter the smugglers .
Some of the boats seized by Yemen 's coast guard are given to Somali fishermen who suffered losses in the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami .
As part of a $ 19 million operation , UNHCR operates shelters and reception centers for the refugees in Yemen and has increased its efforts to discourage people from making the illegal sea crossing .
It has also sponsored training programs for coast guard personnel and other officials .
The plight of the refugees has been overshadowed by the dozens of pirate attacks off Somalia 's coast that have grabbed international headlines in recent months , according to the aid group Doctors Without Borders .
" A lot of attention has been paid lately to tackling the issue of piracy in the waters off the Horn of Africa , " the organization 's Yemen mission leader Francis Coteur said in November .
" Unfortunately , little attention is paid to the drama of the refugees crossing the same waters in horrific conditions .
Much more needs to be done to address this issue . "
If users like holidays they will get ads about holidays Google has entered the sometimes controversial arena of behaviour - based advertising .
It has launched a system that will serve up ads to web users based on their previous online activities .
The search giant is offering users the chance to see and edit their profiles and it will also offer them the choice to opt out of the service .
But privacy campaigners are outraged by the move , with Privacy International calling for a parliamentary enquiry .
Keen travellers
The trial service launches on YouTube and Google from 11 March but advertisers will not be able to display advertisements until April .
Initially a handful of advertisers will be invited to take part .
The system uses a cookie - a small piece of text that lives inside a web browser - to track users as they visit different websites that show ads through its AdSense program .
Users will be assigned to categories based on the content of the pages they visit .
" If a user is a keen traveller and visits lots of travel sites , Google could show them more travel - related ads , " the search giant said in a statement .
" We believe that ads are a valuable source of information that can connect people to products , services and ideas that interest them .
By making ads more relevant and improving the connection between advertisers and our users , we can create more value , " it said .
But Simon Davies , head of Privacy International , has his doubts .
" Google might well hype their targeting system as a boon to pet owners , but the reality is that the service will track just about everything you do and everything you 're interested in , no matter how personal or sensitive .
Google refuted this claim .
" Google will not associate sensitive interest categories with your cookie - such as those based on race , religion , sexual orientation , health , or sensitive financial categories - and will not use these categories when showing you interest - based ads , " said a Google spokesman .
Mr Davies thinks it needs to do more .
" Yet again Google has developed and launched a major initiative without any consultation with its users .
And yet again Google will walk into a privacy minefield , " he said .
He called for a parliamentary inquiry about the search giant 's dominance in the market .
Stephen Carter , minister for communications and technology , faced questions about whether Google was becoming too powerful during a parliamentary select committee meeting this week .
In reply , he said : " We should n't criticise a company for being successful .
It is a young business which has launched a series of applications that are highly attractive to user and both advertisers and users have flocked to its platform . "
Opt out
There is a big shift towards behavioural - based advertising Some privacy campaigners believe Google should have offered its advertising service on an opt - in rather than an opt - out basis .
" The cookie does n't show up any personally identifiable information so that is why we think opt - out is the right way to go , " said a Google spokesman .
Information on YouTube , such as the videos people have been watching , will " be factored into " the system , said the spokesman .
The plans have received a thumbs - up from the UK's Information Commissioner 's Office .
" We recently met with Google to discuss their interest - based advertising product .
Transparency and choice are important elements when addressing any consumer concerns about privacy and the monitoring of browser activity , " it said in a statement .
" In light of this , we are pleased that the preference manager feature allows users a high level of control over how their information is used and that the method by which users can choose to opt out is saved permanently . "
Jupiter analyst Rebecca Jennings thinks the move was inevitable following Google 's acquisition of advertising technology company DoubleClick last year .
She thinks consumers could welcome the new system .
" Generally we find consumers are far less concerned about this than people think they should be .
Often they want to see well targeted rather than random adverts , " she said .
The online advertising industry is keen to push behavioural ads and , at the beginning of March , the UK - based Internet Advertising Bureau ( IAB ) published a code of practice that Google signed up to .
For privacy campaigners the code did not go far enough because it did not recommend that users be allowed to opt in to such services rather than opt out .
According to Forrester Research , 26 % of European online advertisers used behaviour - based advertising during 2008 .
The IAB estimates that it could generate an income of £ 200 m in the UK annually .
UK internet service provider BT is about to launch its own form of behaviour - based advertising , based on a system designed by US firm Phorm .

Economic Depression 2009 ?
Whilst the great inflation / deflation debate continues ( its deflation that wins , the inflationistas are being misled by the Fed 's actions with its bail out facilities ) we need to look at some startling new facts and projections that have appeared in the public arena .
My worry , as you can gather from the title of this article , is that we face a global depression that cannot be avoided even if the events discussed below favour the results that the Central Banks et al seek .
Events are moving to a point were attempts to disguise the effects of certain outcomes can no longer be hidden .
The Federal Reserve .
" The Federal Reserve on Tuesday announced the extension through October 30 , 2009 , of its existing liquidity programs that were scheduled to expire on April 30 , 2009 .
The Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) took these actions in light of continuing substantial strains in many financial markets .
The Board of Governors approved the extension through October 30 of the Asset - Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility ( AMLF ) , the Commercial Paper Funding Facility ( CPFF ) , the Money Market Investor Funding Facility ( MMIFF ) , the Primary Dealer Credit Facility ( PDCF ) , and the Term Securities Lending Facility ( TSLF ) .
The FOMC also took action to extend the TSLF , which is established under the joint authority of the Board and the FOMC .
In addition , to address continued pressures in global U.S. dollar funding markets , the temporary reciprocal currency arrangements ( swap lines ) between the Federal Reserve and other central banks have been extended to October 30 .
This extension currently applies to the swap lines between the Federal Reserve and each of the following central banks : the Reserve Bank of Australia , the Banco Central do Brasil , the Bank of Canada , Danmarks Nationalbank , the Bank of England , the European Central Bank , the Bank of Korea , the Banco de Mexico , the Reserve Bank of New Zealand , the Norges Bank , the Monetary Authority of Singapore , the Sveriges Riksbank , and the Swiss National Bank .
The Bank of Japan will consider the extension at its next Monetary Policy Meeting .
The Federal Reserve action to extend the swap lines was taken by the Federal Open Market Committee .
The current expiration date for the Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility ( TALF ) remains December 31 , 2009 .
Other Federal Reserve liquidity facilities , such as the Term Auction Facility ( TAF ) , do not have a fixed expiration date .
The AMLF provides loans to depository institutions to purchase asset - backed commercial paper from money market mutual funds .
The CPFF provides a liquidity backstop to U.S. issuers of commercial paper .
The MMIFF supports a private - sector initiative to provide liquidity to U.S. money market investors .
The PDCF provides discount window loans to primary dealers .
Under the TSLF , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York auctions term loans of Treasury securities to primary dealers .
The TALF will support the issuance of asset - backed securities collateralized by student loans , auto loans , credit card loans , and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration .
Under the TAF , Reserve Banks auction term discount window loans to depository institutions . "
Regular readers will know that the extension comes as no surprise to me and I expect further extensions to happen for sometime to come .
Clearly the supposed purpose of all these schemes , to recapitalise Banks ( and just about anything else ) and allow the credit markets functionality to return to a state of " normality " has failed .
The extension reflects the Fed 's position as lender / borrower of last resort , rather than any ongoing success in achieving the aims they were designed for .
Fear not readers for the Fed is readying itself for the next stage of the battle to defeat deflation , as the Chairman so presciently foresaw :
" However , a principal message of my talk today is that a central bank whose accustomed policy rate has been forced down to zero has most definitely not run out of ammunition .
As I will discuss , a central bank , either alone or in cooperation with other parts of the government , retains considerable power to expand aggregate demand and economic activity even when its accustomed policy rate is at zero .
U.S. dollars have value only to the extent that they are strictly limited in supply .
But the U.S. government has a technology , called a printing press ( or , today , its electronic equivalent ) , that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost .
By increasing the number of U.S. dollars in circulation , or even by credibly threatening to do so , the U.S. government can also reduce the value of a dollar in terms of goods and services , which is equivalent to raising the prices in dollars of those goods and services .
We conclude that , under a paper - money system , a determined government can always generate higher spending and hence positive inflation .
Of course , the U.S. government is not going to print money and distribute it willy - nilly ( although as we will see later , there are practical policies that approximate this behavior ) .
Normally , money is injected into the economy through asset purchases by the Federal Reserve .
To stimulate aggregate spending when short - term interest rates have reached zero , the Fed must expand the scale of its asset purchases or , possibly , expand the menu of assets that it buys .
Alternatively , the Fed could find other ways of injecting money into the system -- for example , by making low - interest - rate loans to banks or cooperating with the fiscal authorities .
So what then might the Fed do if its target interest rate , the overnight federal funds rate , fell to zero ?
One relatively straightforward extension of current procedures would be to try to stimulate spending by lowering rates further out along the Treasury term structure -- that is , rates on government bonds of longer maturities .
There are at least two ways of bringing down longer - term rates , which are complementary and could be employed separately or in combination .
One approach , similar to an action taken in the past couple of years by the Bank of Japan , would be for the Fed to commit to holding the overnight rate at zero for some specified period .
Because long - term interest rates represent averages of current and expected future short - term rates , plus a term premium , a commitment to keep short - term rates at zero for some time -- if it were credible - - would induce a decline in longer - term rates .
A more direct method , which I personally prefer , would be for the Fed to begin announcing explicit ceilings for yields on longer - maturity Treasury debt ( say , bonds maturing within the next two years ) .
The Fed could enforce these interest - rate ceilings by committing to make unlimited purchases of securities up to two years from maturity at prices consistent with the targeted yields .
If this program were successful , not only would yields on medium - term Treasury securities fall , but ( because of links operating through expectations of future interest rates ) yields on longer - term public and private debt ( such as mortgages ) would likely fall as well .
Lower rates over the maturity spectrum of public and private securities should strengthen aggregate demand in the usual ways and thus help to end deflation .
Of course , if operating in relatively short - dated Treasury debt proved insufficient , the Fed could also attempt to cap yields of Treasury securities at still longer maturities , say three to six years .
Yet another option would be for the Fed to use its existing authority to operate in the markets for agency debt ( for example , mortgage - backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae , the Government National Mortgage Association ) . "
Quotes from " Deflation : Making Sure " It " Does n't Happen Here " Ben Bernanke November 2002 .
( Red highlights mine )
Within the next few days we will see the ideas in this speech , now set up as a theory , tried in actual market conditions .
Its success or failure will set the future direction of the global economy .
The enabling agent to allow this test to go ahead is :
The US Treasury :
Washington , DC - Treasury is announcing the following changes to the issuance calendar : A new monthly 7 - year note , with the first auction occurring in February 2009 .
A regular reopening of the quarterly 30 - year bond in the month following the initial new offering , with the first reopening occurring in March 2009 .
Details of the February Refunding
We are offering $ 67 billion of Treasury securities to refund approximately $ 36.3 billion of privately held securities maturing or called on February 15 and to raise approximately $ 30.7 billion .
The securities are : A new 3 - year note in the amount of $ 32 billion , maturing February 15 , 2012 ; A new 10 - year note in the amount of $ 21 billion , maturing February 15 , 2019 ; A new 30 - year bond in the amount of $ 14 billion , maturing February 15 , 2039 .
During the last several months , changes in economic conditions , financial markets , and fiscal policy , as well as a decline in nonmarketable debt issuance have contributed to an increase in Treasury 's marketable borrowing needs .
Treasury has responded to the increase in marketable borrowing requirements by raising issuance sizes of regular weekly and monthly bills , increasing the frequency and issuance sizes of cash management bills , increasing the issuance sizes of nominal coupon security offerings , and adjusting the securities offering calendar , including adding monthly 3 - year notes , a second reopening of 10 - year notes , and introducing newly issued 30 - year bonds on a quarterly basis .
Introduction of a monthly 7 - year note : Treasury is announcing the addition of a monthly new - issue 7 - year note .
The monthly 7 - year notes will have an end - of - month settlement along with the 2 - year and 5 - year notes .
The first auction of the 7 - year notes will occur on Thursday , February 26 , 2009 Introduction of a regular 30 - year bond reopening : Treasury is announcing the addition of a regular reopening of the 30 - year bond in the month following the initial quarterly offering .
This will result in eight 30 - year bond auctions a year .
The first auction of the reopening of 30 - year bonds will occur on Thursday , March 12 , 2009
Below is a copy of the tentative Treasury issuance schedule through to the end of March , showing the future pattern :
With the increase of debt issuance upward pressure will be exerted upon yields .
This counter - acts the Feds attempts to keep both short term rates and those further out along the curve at a level the Fed perceives as conducive to encouraging credit markets to allow the flow of funds to re-start .
The real test of course is whether buyers turn up at the auctions .
A failure will force the Fed to enact its statement from the last FOMC minutes :
" The Committee also is prepared to purchase longer - term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets . "
To control rates the will have to step up to the plate and bid at prices that keep yields within its targeted band .
We do n't know exactly what the boundaries of the band are but we can look at recent yield levels to garner some idea from previous support and resistance levels :
Courtesy of StockCharts.com
Bond yields are in a move higher as you would expect , bond buyers know what the increase in market supply will do to prices if no one ( in essence foreign buyers ) turns up for the auctions and bond yields are acting accordingly as long positions are closed .
The Fed will end up reacting to the results of the auctions ; if buyers insist on higher yields ( by setting lower prices ) the Fed will step in and start buying across the curve , indeed if they are looking at the yields across the curve now they may well be feeling some concern that the plan to hold rates at low levels may already be under attack .
If the Fed fails to react to higher yields or failed auctions ( when not enough bids are received to cover the issuance ) bond markets will take fright as the Feds credibility to back up the words from the FOMC minutes is destroyed .
Without a buyer of last resort supporting the market then a bout of panic selling , even dumping could take place .
In some ways this would suit the Fed as it would begin its intervention at a lower price level and if the policy is successful the balance sheet would benefit from appreciating prices as yields fall back .
Why do I think Fed intervention is inevitable ?
IMF
The ability of Foreign Central Banks to buy US issued debt has been a function of increasing dollar flows taken in payment for exports to the US and re-circulated back ( to stop domestic inflation ) by buying US debt .
As the IMF says " Global output and trade plummeted in the final months of 2008 " .
The requirement to re-circulate dollars back into US debt will also be severely curtailed just at the time when the US wishes to raise debt issuance .
The need for the re-circulation of dollars is not going to increase anytime soon :
Indeed a further contraction of " available " dollars , produced in exchange for goods imported into the US , is more likely that the chart above suggests .
The IMF has a tendency to be optimistic in its views .
To enable the US Treasury to issue new and increasing amounts of debt in an environment of decreasing need , when world trade has almost halved , leaves the Fed no alternative but to put its words into action .
If however the Fed decides not to deploy the printing presses and its unconventional policies then the result will be as the IMF states :
" Downside risks continue to dominate , as the scale and scope of the current financial crisis have taken the global economy into uncharted waters .
The main risk is that unless stronger financial strains and uncertainties are forcefully addressed , the pernicious feedback loop between real activity and financial markets will intensify , leading to even more toxic effects on global growth .
In addition , the risks of deflation are rising in a number of advanced economies , while emerging economies ' corporate sectors could be badly damaged by continued limited access to external financing .
Furthermore , while fiscal policy is providing important short - term support , the sharp increase in the issuance of public debt could prompt an adverse market reaction , unless governments clarify their strategy to ensure long - term sustainability . "
In the IMF paper , " Gauging Risks for Deflation " the work of Kumar and others is reproduced , showing the overall vulnerability to deflation for the world :
The IMF have the risk indicator flattening off in 2009 , again this seems optimistic considering that the downside risks are much , much greater than any possible upside to the current situation .
As it happens , the IMF do have an important caveat to the indicator , which may :
" underestimate the risks today relative to those for earlier episodes , as it does not consider house prices .
In 2002/03 , housing markets were very strong , with low interest rates boosting prices and construction , helping pull the global economy out of its weak patch .
Also , the indicator does not do full justice to the credit crisis because it does not consider quantitative indicators of financial conditions other than bank credit , which is being buoyed by temporary forces .
Spreads on bonds , for example , are much wider today than during 2002 - 03 in advanced economies and have reached levels similar to those prevailing in 2002 - 03 in emerging economies . "
Of more concern is the IMF risk assessments for the G3 ( US , Eurozone & Japan ) based on the Global Projection Model .
This agrees with my interpretation of GB Eggertsson 's work , available here .
I quote from the IMF paper :
" This section proposes to analyze deflation vulnerability with the help of the IMF staff 's Global Projection Model ( GPM ) , which explicitly considers the implications of the zero interest floor ( ZIF ) for monetary policy .
The most intractable deflation problem occurs when policy interest rates reach the ZIF for a prolonged period of time because if a zero interest rate fails to close the output gap , downward pressure on prices is reinforced .
Unless other policies are implemented to raise aggregate demand , this could result in a downward deflationary spiral .
The model incorporates three country models , for the United States , the euro area , and Japan ( the G - 3 ) ; and it covers output and unemployment , the rate of inflation , the exchange rate , and , with a modified Taylor rule , the monetary policy interest rate .
26 . Figure 4 shows the current World Economic Outlook ( WEO ) baseline outlook ( black line ) and GPM - based fan charts for the G - 3 economies ( see also IMF , 2009a ) .
To sum up , the WEO baseline projection , in itself , does not contain an unduly serious deflation problem .
However , the GPM - based fan charts reveal a significant probability of much more negative deflationary outcomes , and hence a deeper and more prolonged recession in the G3 . "
As a cautionary note I would mention Japan in the early '00s often presented future inflation and GDP charts with an upside bias , that bias was not fulfilled until 2006 and even then the rise was weaker than earlier projections suggested .
However the risk of inflation in the G3 even using the IMF projections is low and remains low for some time .
Unless inflation fulfills the upper percentile sustained projection of 2 - 2.5 % I think the Fed will continue the Zero Interest Rate and Quantitative ( Credit ? )
Easing policies .
I see nothing that supports a hyperinflationary environment in the G3 in the medium term .
If the IMF red projection line ( mid 50th percentile ) is accurate , inflation , growth and price levels will not engender a credible expectation of future inflation and monetary and fiscal stimulus will fail .
That failure will lead to a period of extended deflationary forces acting upon the global economy .
The initiation of increased debt issuance by the US Treasury begins next week .
Any sign of weakness in the Fed 's response to low prices or failure at the auctions will cause major disruption in the bond market .
However such disruption should be short term as long as the Fed responds vigorously to put right its previous inaction .
Even if the Fed is successful and keeps interest rates along the curve artificially low , there is no guarantee that the expected result of increased inflation expectations will occur in the future .
Without the future threat of inflation business and consumer spending patterns will remain " tight " and a continuing hoarding of cash and cash like assets will remain attractive , even in an environment where real interest rates are negative .
Only when a point is reached when cash , held as an asset , shows a depreciation will it become viable to swap cash for other assets that will give a higher return .
This is why many schemes are failing , the dollar has become an asset in its own right :
Coutesy of StockCharts.com
Looking at the chart , is it just me or is the Dollar waiting for news ?
Some have put forward an idea that US taxes should be cut for Businesses who wish to repatriate overseas profits , allowing an injection of cash into the US domestic economy .
However with the main theme of investing already focused on highly liquid uptrends ( see US Treasuries until recently ) the increase in demand for Dollars as profits are converted from other currencies would cause further appreciation of the Dollar .
This would make the hoarding of cash more attractive and negate the attempts to loosen the flow of funds .
Indeed the suggestion of such a repatriation , especially from the US Treasury , would cause longs to take positions prior to the event occuring , pre-emptively causing the uptrend to strengthen , encouraging an acceleration of savings .
Thus such a scheme would encourage the very conditions that the Fed and US Treasury are attempting to thwart .
Until economic conditions are conducive to the deployment of savings to allow profitable investment then the hoarding of cash and cash like assets will continue .
I very strongly suspect we will have to live through a global depression before such economic conditions appear .

MEXICO CITY , March 23 ( Reuters ) - Mexico on Monday offered multiple rewards of up to $ 2 million for information leading to the capture of the country 's drug kingpins , including Mexico 's most - wanted man , Joaquin " Shorty " Guzman .
Mexico published a list of more than 30 men the government says are leading the country 's five main cartels , including 's Guzman 's powerful Pacific - coast Sinaloa gang and the Gulf cartel in northeastern Mexico , whose feared Zeta hitmen are known for beheading rivals .
Mexico's President Felipe Calderon has made controlling rampant drug violence his administration 's top priority and has sent 45,000 troops across the country to break up the gangs .
Last week , soldiers captured two capos , but despite a string of arrests and historic drug busts , violence surged to a record 6,300 drug - related killings last year .
Washington fears the drug war is spilling over into the United States .
The conflict is also scaring off tourists and investment along Mexico 's border just as the global economic crisis drags the country into recession .

The primary goal of this project is to define a portable and efficient C programming interface ( API ) to determine the call - chain of a program .
The API additionally provides the means to manipulate the preserved ( callee - saved ) state of each call - frame and to resume execution at any point in the call - chain ( non-local goto ) .
The API supports both local ( same - process ) and remote ( across - process ) operation .
As such , the API is useful in a number of applications .
Some examples include :
exception handling
The libunwind API makes it trivial to implement the stack - manipulation aspects of exception handling .
debuggers
The libunwind API makes it trivial for debuggers to generate the call - chain ( backtrace ) of the threads in a running program .
introspection
It is often useful for a running thread to determine its call - chain .
For example , this is useful to display error messages ( to show how the error came about ) and for performance monitoring / analysis .

With libunwind , it is possible to implement an extremely efficient version of setjmp ( ) .

Preventing foreclosures has become a top priority of politicians , economists and regulators .
In fact , allowing foreclosures to happen has merit as a free - market solution to the crisis .
If the intent is to help homeowners , then foreclosure is undoubtedly the best solution .
Household balance sheets have been destroyed by taking on too much debt via the purchase of inflated assets .
With so little savings , a household with negative equity almost implies negative net worth .
Walking away from the mortgage immediately repairs the balance sheet .
Credit may be damaged , but homeowners can rebuild it .
And by renting something they can afford , instead of the McMansion they cannot , homeowners are most likely to have some money left over each month that they can save toward a down payment on a house they can eventually afford .
If the intent is to help the credit markets , then foreclosure is undoubtedly the best solution .
The securitization model has proven to be flawed .
Slicing loans horizontally into tranches created asset classes that have conflicting interests in a dissolution strategy of the same underlying asset .
The holder of a senior tranche would be agreeable to modification , since his position is secured ; the holder of a junior tranche would essentially be wiped out .
The lower tranches are worthless but are still legally an encumbrance , hindering any type of sale or work - out effort .
Consider a property that sold for $ 500,000 at the peak , financed with a $ 400,000 first lien and an $ 80,000 second lien , which is now worth $ 300,000 .
The second lien is worthless , but the lien will remain as a cloud which complicates any modification effort by the senior lien holder .
There is no incentive for the junior lien holder to voluntarily agree to a modification .
Foreclosure would be the best and finite action .
It wipes the slate clean .
Add a daily mushroom portion to your diet
But when combined with drinking green tea regularly , the risk is cut by 9 per cent , it is claimed .
Scientists found that women who ate at least 10g – around a third of an ounce – of fresh mushrooms daily were 64 per cent less likely to develop a potentially fatal tumour .
Dried mushrooms had a slightly less protective effect , reducing the risk by around half .
Experts at the University of Western Australia in Perth analysed the eating habits of more than 2,000 women in China , half of whom had suffered breast cancer .
The researchers concluded : “ Higher intake of mushrooms decreased cancer risk in both pre- and post - menopausal Chinese women . ”
It is important to remember there is no one particular ‘ super ’ food that will protect you from cancer .
Dr Julie Sharp , Cancer Research UK
Some evidence suggests mushrooms act in a similar way to breast cancer drugs called aromatase inhibitors which block the body ’s production of the cancer - feeding hormone oestrogen .
Previous research uncovered the re mark able health benefits of green tea , including reversing endothelial dysfunction – a sign of arteries clogging – in smokers .
Studies have found that drinking a cup a day can keep the heart healthy by opening up the arteries .
It is thought green tea offers cancer - fighting benefits because it is not fermented before drying like the more popular black variety .
Fermentation is believed to reduce the content of flavonoids , which are beneficial antioxidants , by up to 90 per cent .
Dr Julie Sharp , Cancer Research UK ’s senior science information manager , said : “ Both green tea and mushrooms have previously been reported to lower cancer risk .
While this study adds to the evidence , more research is needed to confirm these observations and find out if they are relevant to UK women .
“ It is important to remember there is no one particular ‘ super ’ food that will protect you from cancer .
Large scientific studies have proven that the best way to reduce your risk of many cancers is to eat a healthy , balanced diet . ”
The latest findings were published in the International Journal of Cancer .
Laboratory tests on animals show that fungi have anti-tumour properties and can stimulate the immune system ’s defences .
Last month scientists in California began a trial to see if taking a mushroom extract twice a day for a month helps breast cancer survivors remain free of the disease .
More than 46,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK each year and it kills 12,400 .
A common question that I hear from developers is “ What is the market share of Firefox ? ” ( or , more recently , “ What is the market share of Firefox 2 ? ” ) .
There are a couple answers but generally you should n’t care about the results .
How do you determine the global market share of a browser ?
It ’s hard to give a proper answer to this – there are so many factors that go in to determining an exact global market share .
How do you track users ?
If you ’re tracking web sites , which web sites do you track ?
No matter how you look at it , it ’s hard to pin these down .
The Mozilla Metrics team has been blogging recently , discussing different ways in which market share can be evaluated .
In a recent post breaking down the various metric services they looked at some of the most popular ones , analyzing their quality of data .
One of the services that we make a lot of use of to get a decent global view of browser market share is Net Applications .
Their data comes from a wide selection of sources and tracks over 160 million users .
Data for Feb. 2009 .
When someone is wondering what the global market share numbers look like , I generally point them at the Net Applications data .
How do you determine the market share of a specific browser version ?
Again , Net Applications comes through well .
They provide a data breakdown of browsers by version that works well .
This helps to answer the question that I ’ve seen recently : “ What is the market share of Firefox 2 ? ”
Data for Feb. 2009 .
Thankfully the Mozilla Metrics team released a country - by - country breakdown looking at some of the locations where users are slowest to upgrade .
Why you should n’t care about these numbers .
The above global market share numbers should only matter to two groups of people : Browser vendors ( it ’s nice for them to be able to know how many people are using their applications ) and generic tool developers ( creators of libraries that could be used by any number of people in any locale ) .
The problem is that most people do n’t fall into either of these categories .
Instead , most developers should be monitoring one statistic :
What is the browser share for my web site .
In order to make smart decisions about what browsers to support for your web applications you need to , first , get an accurate picture of what your users are using – any other determination will simply be incorrect and will give you a skewed sense of importance .
I talked about this balancing process last year , asking developers to balance the amount of work required to support a browser with the raw number of users that the browser provides .
I also talked about this balancing process in my recent talk at Yahoo ! :
The DOM is a Mess .
In fact , when determining what browsers to support for the jQuery library we use a mix of market share and intuition .
We immediately support the major browsers – their current version , their previous version , and their next version .
Additionally we extend support to older browser versions that still have significant market share ( such as IE 6 ) .
It ’s important to note that the above data has absolutely no relation to the actual visitors to the jQuery.com web site .
Developers tend to present a very skewed view of which browsers are the most popular :
( Visitor breakdown to jQuery.com , by browser , taken on March 29th 2009 . )
Well , someone had to do it , and I think I ’m the first .
I ’ve archived my first two years of twittering to a hardback book .
( For those of you who do n’t get Twitter , and those who are just bored by it ’s sudden , seeming ubiquity : move along .
Nothing to see here . )
→ The full photoset is here .
I wanted to test Lulu ‘s capacity for hardback books , to continue experimenting with the literary cornucopia machine , and to see if you could make a traditional diary / journal in retrospect .
And you can , and it ’s quite nice ( apart from some weird kerning issues ) .
No , most of it does n’t mean anything , certainly not to anyone else , but it makes physical a very real time and effort .
( It ’s a seriously good way of practicing your InDesign scripting skills too , all you book design nerds and Start - with - XMLers . )
When Twitter is inevitably replaced by something else , I do n’t want to lose all those incidentals , the casual asides , the remarks and responses .
That ’s all really .
This seems like a nice way to do it , and I ’ll probably do it again in a couple of years time .
And yes , I ’ll make one from your tweets , if you ask nicely and pay me a lot of money .
Update :
Here ’s the very hacky , very simple script I used to get all my tweets , as several people have requested .
Use at your own risk .
There ’s almost certainly a better way .
According to the Detroit News , the Environmental Protection Agency has taken a likely step towards stricter emissions standards , as it has asked the White House Office of Management and Budget to declare greenhouse gas a public danger .
California , along with several other states , is looking to enact tough new CO2 laws that will drastically limit the emissions of new cars and trucks .
Automakers are against the idea , as they argue that the technology is n't currently available in large scale to meet the proposed targets , let alone while the industry is cash poor .
The Obama administration wants Congress to take swift action to regulate CO2 emissions , a move that could cost automakers ranging from Ford and GM to Honda and Toyota billions of dollars .
U.S. Chamber of Commerce Vice President William Kovacs says the California plan " could damage automakers . "
Kovacs points out that GM and Chrysler are already receiving federal loans to stay afloat , the sunshine state wants to " put more holes " into the sinking ships .
If California does win the right to demand stricter CO2 standards , it will be interesting to see if the regulations involve pollutants outside the auto industry .
In 2006 , cars , trucks , and big rigs only account for 24 % of our nation 's greenhouse pollution and 4 % of the world 's overall .

Democrat introduces bill to end mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses John Byrne
Published : Thursday March 19 , 2009
Print This Email This A California Democrat has introduced a bill in Congress that would end the practice of judges being forced to impose mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders .
The Major Drug Trafficking Prosecution
Act of 2009 ( bill text ) aims to repeal federal guidelines that force judges ' hands in drug cases , and give power back to judges to determine sentences based on other elements of the case , not simply the weight of the drugs involved .
" This legislation will refocus federal prosecutorial resources on major drug traffickers and eliminate racial disparities created by the mandatory minimum sentences for power and crack cocaine , " said Rep. Maxine Waters ( D - CA ) , who authored the bill ( her floor statement is available here ) .
African Americans make up 12 percent of the US population and 14 percent of drug users , but account for 30 percent of the federal prison population for drug users , according to a statistic presented in the bill .
" In the 1980s , Congress passed two Anti-Drug Abuse Acts with the goal that federal prosecutors would go after major drug traffickers at the top of the food chain , instead of low - level drug offenders at the bottom , " Waters continued .
" Lengthy mandatory minimum sentences were passed for most drug crimes .
These mandatory terms are based solely on the weight and the drug involved , and , with very few exceptions , the courts cannot sentence below them . "
" Twenty years later , " she added , " mandatory drug sentences have utterly failed to achieve Congress ' goals . "
TalkLeft , a progressive legal blog , praised the measure , and noted that it would also send small drug cases from federal to state courts .
The blog highlighted a number of findings presented in the legislation .
* Since the enactment of mandatory minimum sentencing for drug users , the Federal Bureau of Prisons budget increased from $ 220 million in 1986 to $ 5.4 billion in 2008 .
* Low - level and mid-level drug offenders can be adequately prosecuted by the States and punished or supervised in treatment as appropriate .
* One consequence of the improper focus of Federal cocaine prosecutions has been that the overwhelming majority of low - level offenders subject to the heightened crack cocaine penalties are black and according to the Report to Congress only 8.8 percent of Federal crack cocaine convictions were imposed on whites , while 81.8 percent and 8.4 percent were imposed on blacks and Hispanics , respectively
* African Americans comprise 12 percent of the US population and 14 percent of drug users , but 30 percent of all Federal drug convictions .
* According to the Justice Department , the time spent in prison does not affect recidivism rates .
Waters ' bill has 15 cosponsors , all of them Democrats .
Few high - profile Democrats have signed on -- the sponsors do not include House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) or House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , Jr. ( D - MI ) .
There is no companion bill presently active in the Senate .
The bill would first have to go to the Judiciary Committee before being reviewed by the full House .

A Teacher 's Guide promises curriculum " designed to reinforce skills across the curriculum in math , language arts , citizenship , and music . "
The language arts component is apparently covered by making up a new word to describe people who copy songs without a label 's permission .
One worksheet , specifically aimed at children in grades 3 - 5 explains " They are songlifters , people who take songs without paying for them .
Sometimes songlifters copy music from other people ’s CDs .
Sometimes they use the Internet to download music from other people ’s computers .
Either way , songlifting is like shoplifting , and that means it ’s wrong . "
In the math portion , kids are instructed to interview their family and friends to add up the number of times they 've either songlifted themselves , or assisted in others ' songlifting activities by allowing them to copy music .
Citizenship apparently refers to learning the list of people supposedly deprived of their liveliehoods by songlifting .
They include agents and music publishers .
Notably missing is any mention of fair use .
Instead one worksheet warns " It is illegal for anyone to make a copy of that recording without permission from the people who created it . "
The number of American workers filing new jobless benefit claims unexpectedly jumped above 600,000 last week to a fresh 26 - year high , signaling that the nation ’s recession is widening and deepening .
Separately , U.S. productivity growth -- a measure of how much workers produce per hour of labor -- more than doubled between the July - through - September quarter and the final three months of the year .
But instead of seeing the data as evidence of improvement , analysts said the jump from an annual average of 1.5 % to 3.2 % was yet another sign of trouble .
In essence , companies reacted to the economy ’s sharp contraction by cutting workers at a faster pace than output , making it appear that those who remained on the job were growing more efficient .
The latest economic soundings bode ill for today ’s January jobs report , which many forecasters now say could show a monthly loss of 500,000 or more positions .

Since September , the economy has shed nearly 2 million jobs , according to government statistics , and most forecasters predict that the losses will keep growing in the coming months .
Continuing jobless claims -- those lasting more than a single week -- hit a record - high 4.79 million , the latest Labor Department report showed , indicating that those who lose jobs are having an increasingly difficult time replacing them .
The government has been keeping claims data since 1967 .
Initial claims climbed 35,000 to a seasonally adjusted 626,000 during the week that ended Jan. 31 , substantially more than the 2,000 or so that many economists had predicted and a level unseen since October 1982 .
The government ’s latest productivity report , which includes labor - cost statistics , showed that workers are seeing almost no increase in earnings , which may be good news for controlling inflation but bad news for living standards .

Unit labor costs edged up at only a 1.8 % annual rate , which demonstrates that the recession and weakening labor market are leaving workers with little bargaining power .
Output by non-farm businesses dropped at a 5.5 % rate during the fourth quarter , the most since 1982 .
However , hours worked plunged at an even steeper 8.4 % pace , the biggest drop since 1975 .

Do n't Know Much About History : Everything You Need to Know About American History but Never Learned .
Barack Obama says he expects a " difficult few days "
The EU and Canada have warned that a clause in the US economic recovery package could promote protectionism .
The " Buy American " clause seeks to ensure that only US iron , steel and manufactured goods are used in construction work funded by the bill .
The EU ambassador in Washington said that if approved , the measure would set a " dangerous precedent " .
The $ 800 bn ( £ 567bn ) rescue plan package is under discussion in the US Senate this week .
Meanwhile , President Barack Obama is expected to name Republican Senator Judd Gregg as commerce secretary .
Mr Gregg would be the second member of the Republicans in Mr Obama 's cabinet .
The president 's first choice for the post , New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson , withdrew following questions about his links to big business .
' Dangerous precedent '
The BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington says Mr Obama will hope that Mr Gregg 's nomination can help him secure approval for the stimulus package .
It is unlikely that the package , which has already been approved by the House of Representatives , will be able to pass the Senate without Republican support .
If we have a series of protectionist measures introduced , then the possibility of real global leadership is put at risk
John Bruton
EU ambassador to Washington
Dire warnings about protectionism The White House has said it is reviewing the " Buy American " part of the stimulus bill , although Vice President Joe Biden said last week that it was legitimate to have some portion of Buy American in the final measure .
Mr Obama 's signals as a presidential candidate on the campaign trail last year that he could rip up the North America free trade agreement were seen as a political gesture to win round the sceptical white working class vote , says our Washington correspondent .
Perhaps that has become more important with the economic crisis , but it leaves one wondering where the Obama administration really stands on free trade , he adds .
EU Ambassador John Bruton said that if passed , the measure could sap global public confidence .
" If we have a series of protectionist measures introduced , then the possibility of real global leadership is put at risk , " he said .
" We regard this legislation as setting a very dangerous precedent at a time when the world is facing a global economic crisis . "
' Retaliatory risk '
In a letter to Senate leaders , the Canadian ambassador in Washington , Michael Wilson , said that if " Buy American " was in the final legislation , it would set a negative precedent with global repercussions .
" The United States will lose the moral authority to pressure others not to introduce protectionist policies , " he wrote .
Canadian International Trade Minister Stockwell Day said Canada hoped to be exempted from any such measure , which he warned could lead to a global depression .
" These protectionist measures , in a time of recession , only make things worse , " he told broadcaster CBC .
" It can only trigger retaliatory action and we do n't want to go there . "
There is also opposition from some senior US Republicans who say the measure could start trade wars .
Mr Obama has urged the US Congress not to delay his stimulus plan over modest differences .
He said on Monday that he was expecting a " difficult next few days " as the Senate debated the package .
He also warned that more US banks are likely to fail as the full extent of their losses in the economic crisis becomes clear .
The Democrat leader in the Senate , Harry Reid , has said he hopes the stimulus can be approved by the end of the week .

EconLog Book Club : For a New Liberty , Chapter 2 By Bryan Caplan
Summary
In this chapter ( “ Property and Exchange ” ) , Rothbard introduces the “ non-aggression axiom , ” also often known as the “ non-initiation of force axiom . ”
The intuition is simple enough :
No one has the right to start using physical violence or the threat thereof against another person or his property .
This is one of the first moral rules we learn as children – the kid who punches first is in the wrong , and you mus n’t take stuff that does n’t belong to you .
The distinctive feature of the libertarian position , Rothbard explains , is that it applies the same moral standard to government :
In contrast to all other thinkers , left , right , or in - between , the libertarian refuses to give the State the moral sanction to commit actions that almost everyone agrees would be immoral , illegal , and criminal if committed by any person or group in society .
The libertarian , in short , insists on applying the general moral law to everyone , and makes no special exemp tions for any person or group .
But if we look at the State naked , as it were , we see that it is universally allowed , and even encouraged , to commit all the acts which even non-libertarians concede are reprehensible crimes .
The State habitually commits mass murder , which it calls “ war , ” or sometimes “ suppression of subversion ” ; the State engages in enslave ment into its military forces , which it calls “ conscription ” ; and it lives and has its being in the practice of forcible theft , which it calls “ taxation . ”
The libertarian insists that whether or not such practices are supported by the majority of the population is not germane to their nature : that , regardless of popular sanction , War is Mass Murder , Conscription is Slavery , and Taxation is Robbery .
The libertarian , in short , is almost completely the child in the fable , pointing out insistently that the emperor has no clothes .
Rothbard then discusses attempts to justify the non-aggression axiom .
He quickly disposes of the utilitarian rationale , then presents his own natural rights story .
Aside from some hand - waving about “ the natural law of man ’s needs , ” he presents three alternative property theories ( libertarian self - ownership , some sort of “ natural slave ” story , and “ participatory communism ” ) , and argues that the first is by far the most plausible .
Next , Mr Libertarian highlights the important problem of initial acquisition :
Some libertarians attempt to resolve the problem by asserting that whoever the existing government decrees has the property title should be considered the just owner of the property .
At this point , we have not yet delved deeply into the nature of government , but the anomaly here should be glaring enough : it is surely odd to find a group eternally suspicious of virtually any and all functions of government suddenly leaving it to government to define and apply the precious concept of property , the base and groundwork of the entire social order .
This leads directly to a review / defense of Locke ’s theory of initial acquisition , and a simple derivation of free exchange :
If your own a thing , it follows that you ’ve got a right to give it away , either gratis or in return for something else .
The chapter ends by explaining how libertarian property rights theory can be used to put vaguer notions of “ human rights ” on a more solid footing .
In a libertarian framework , you do n’t need to balance a “ right of free speech ” against the “ public interest . ”
The person who shouts “ fire ” in a crowded theater is guilty of trespass if he ’s a customer , and fraud if he ’s the owner .
Critical Comments
As an ethical intuitionist , my main complaint about Rothbard ’s defense of libertarian rights is his obscurantism about what ’s “ natural . ”
Natural law theory rests on the insight that we live in a world of more than one –in fact , a vast number–of entities , and that each entity has distinct and specific properties , a distinct “ nature , ” which can be investigated by man ’s reason , by his sense perception and mental faculties .
Copper has a distinct nature and behaves in a certain way , and so do iron , salt , etc .
The species man , therefore , has a specifiable nature , as does the world around him and the ways of interaction between them …
Violent interference with a man ’s learning and choices is therefore profoundly “ antihuman ” ; it violates the natural law of man ’s needs .
I object that anything that people do is ipso facto “ natural , ” so there ’s no way you ’re going to get moral precepts out of this .
But in any case , all this talk violates the fundamental rule of philosophical reasoning ( indeed , all reasoning ) :
You do n’t use the obscure to argue for the obvious .
It ’s silly to say , “ Murder violates man ’s nature , so murder is wrong , ” when you can just say , “ Murder is wrong . ”
Rothbard ’s at his strongest when he points out that governments habitually perform actions which almost everyone would admit were wrong if they were committed by a private individual .
This , in my view , is real moral reasoning – instead of arguing for the obvious ( murder is wrong because blah blah blah ) , he ’s arguing from the obvious ( murder is wrong , so it ’s wrong when government does it , too ) .
His three property rights scenarios also have some probative value , since they help clarify moral intuitions , but of course ignore an infinity of hybrid scenarios .
Rothbard also deserves credit for emphasizing the need for an extra-governmental standard of just property acquisition .
One of the main highlights of this chapter , for me , is Rothbard ’s take on shouting “ fire ” in a crowded building .
It ’s easy to take this reduction for granted , but it was a revelation when I first read it .
The deep insight underlying this example is that property rights are , like Legos , incredibly flexible building blocks with which you can create almost any structure you can imagine : Marriages , corporations , malls , blogs , non-smoking sections , Facebook , you name it .
Finally , Rothbard ’s casual use of the term “ absolute ” is silly .
If my right of
self - ownership is “ absolute , ” are n’t you violating my rights merely by
breathing on me ?
And in any case , exceptionless rights go beyond the common sense morality that libertarianism builds upon .
Yes , it ’s almost always wrong to throw the first punch or take someone ’s stuff , but if you ca n’t think of plausible counter - examples , you are n’t trying hard enough .
P.S. Since I teach Monday nights , I ’m moving discussion of all future chapters to Tuesdays .
CLEVELAND —
The public - private partnership for the convention center and medical mart proposed for downtown Cleveland is structured like this :
The public sector would pay for it , and the private sector would own and operate it , with little public oversight .
That arrangement -- a government - funded , privately owned and run convention center -- apparently is unlike any other in the country , some experts say .
And it raises a point that the county and its private - sector partners at Merchandise Mart Properties Inc. have largely left unaddressed : Just how would that benefit taxpayers ?
Said convention - center analyst and industry advocate Doug Ducate : " There 's a real question as to why you 'd want to do that . "
The partners have given no indication they will answer that question today , either , when they offer the first detailed public update on the project since 2005 , when it was no more than an idea embodied in an MMPI slide show .
But officials from MMPI and the county will present some details of their plans for a big new complex proposed to open around 2012 on the site of the existing Cleveland Convention Center , under Malls B and C .
They will first brief a Cleveland City Council committee at 10 a.m .
Four hours later , they will host a public forum at Cleveland Public Library 's Louis Stokes Auditorium downtown .
They pledged to explain the advantages that location has over rival sites at Tower City Center and in the Flats .
They may also elaborate on the technical reasoning behind MMPI 's conclusion that the project can rise on the " floating " underground foundation of the old convention facility .
MMPI issued a news release Wednesday evening reiterating that it is excited about the mall location .
That location allows the developer to incorporate Public Auditorium with a new exhibition hall and " iconic " medical - mart showplace for permanent vendor exhibits , said spokeswoman Sophia Weiss .
The company noted the location is within a seven - minute walk of most downtown hotels , along with restaurants , pro-sports venues , the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , the Great Lakes Science Center and the transportation hub at Public Square .
" The Medical Mart and Convention Center will revitalize this area and bring hundreds of thousands of people to Cleveland each year , one show at a time , " the statement said .
What the officials are less likely to explain in detail today is the unconventional ownership and financing for the facility .
MMPI President Christopher Kennedy said last week that the company wants to " disclose everything . "
Yet both the county and MMPI have refused to discuss anything about how nearly $ 1 billion in taxpayer money will flow to , or through , a private firm , or what public oversight and governance the county will have .
All of that is still being negotiated , both sides say , and they will not talk about it until the deals that bind the public money and the private enterprise are sealed .
But a memorandum of understanding the two sides signed nearly a year ago lays out the general guidelines .
Among them :
The county will pay for almost all the construction costs , which were last publicly projected to be around $ 425 million , by issuing 20 - year taxable revenue bonds .
The county will then give the facilities to MMPI to own and operate .
MMPI will lease the complex to the county for $ 40 million a year , which will come from a quarter - cent sales - tax increase that commissioners imposed in 2007 .
MMPI will use the lease payments to pay off the bonds .
The county in turn will sublease the buildings back to MMPI .
The company wo n't pay the county any rent or cut of the operating proceeds but instead will promise to cover all operating costs of running a " first - class facility , " eat any losses and keep any profits .
The county will pay MMPI to run it -- $ 6 million in each of the first three years and $ 5 million for each of the next 17 years .
The memorandum 's wording indicates that performance bonuses could eventually push that number to $ 8 million , but county officials and MMPI wo n't comment .
Also , neither will identify the source for that money .
County hotel taxes now pay Cleveland about $ 6.5 million a year toward the cost of running the Cleveland Convention Center .
The memorandum gives the county virtually no governance power , rights or leverage when it comes to the complex 's operations , policies or profits once the facility is built .
It allows only for the county , every five years , " to exercise remedies to be agreed upon in the lease / sublease agreement " if MMPI does n't book enough business .
Heywood Sanders , a convention - industry analyst and critic , has had a copy of the memorandum since the county commissioners and MMPI signed it 11 months ago .
He says it lays out a structure that , from the public 's standpoint , is " very uncommon and raises a great many questions . "
" I have been struck from the moment I first saw this how limited the oversight seems to be and how modest the performance incentives are , " Sanders said Wednesday .
Ducate , the president of the pro-industry Center for Exhibition Industry Research in Dallas , usually finds himself disputing Sanders ' conclusions .
Not this one .
" It 's kind of a puzzling thing , " Ducate said Wednesday .
" There certainly are convention centers that are publicly financed and owned and are privately managed .
But I 'm not aware of any publicly financed centers that have been transferred from public ownership to private ownership and operations . "
The memorandum implies that the ownership and its lease / sublease tangle has to do with satisfying Internal Revenue Service codes that apply to real - estate investment trusts such as the one that owns MMPI , which is called Vornado Realty Trust .
Mark Falanga , MMPI 's senior vice president , did not respond this week to e-mailed questions about ownership or financing issues that his company is still negotiating .
But last week , he made a case for having MMPI in control of all elements of a three - pronged approach to making Cleveland the world 's dominant hub for medical - field trade shows .
MMPI developed that concept and enlisted the county 's backing , not the other way around , he noted .
To work , the concept demands seamless interconnectedness -- physical and operational -- the medical mart 's permanent medical - product showrooms , the main convention hall 's trade - show center and a conference center full of auditoriums and meeting rooms .
" If you focus on one component of this facility and not all three , " Falanga said , " you really wo n't make it work . "
Summary of Findings
As many newspapers struggle to stay economically viable , fewer than half of Americans ( 43 % ) say that losing their local newspaper would hurt civic life in their community “ a lot . ”
Even fewer ( 33 % ) say they would personally miss reading the local newspaper a lot if it were no longer available .
Not unexpectedly , those who get local news regularly from newspapers are much more likely than those who read less often to see the potential shutdown of a local paper as a significant loss .
More than half of regular newspaper readers ( 56 % ) say that if the local newspaper they read most often no longer published – either in print or online – it would hurt the civic life of the community a lot ; an almost identical percentage ( 55 % ) says they would personally miss reading the paper a lot if it were no longer available .
The latest weekly News Interest Index , conducted March 6 - 9 by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , finds that the public is continuing to pay close attention to news about the economic crisis and President Obama ’s agenda .
About a quarter ( 26 % ) say the unveiling of Obama ’s plan to set aside $ 630 billion toward overhauling the U.S. health care system was the story they followed most closely last week .
Nearly one - in - five ( 18 % each ) say their top story was the rising unemployment rate or the major drops in the stock market .
The economic crisis continued to dominate news coverage as well .
When combining the ongoing story lines , crisis coverage accounted for 43 % of the total newshole , according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism ( PEJ ) .
The political skirmish over Rush Limbaugh ’s role in the Republican Party accounted for 8 % of the newshole , making it the second most reported story of the week .
But the GOP story appears to have registered less with the public ; only 4 % say it was the story they followed most closely .
Newspapers ’ Struggles
With media coverage of newspaper company bankruptcy filings , threats to close papers , actual shut downs and continuing job cuts , the public is aware of the financial problems .
More than half ( 53 % ) say they have heard “ a lot ” about the problems facing newspapers , while 31 % say they have heard “ a little . ”
Only 15 % say they have heard nothing at all .
When it comes to local news , more people say they get that news from local television stations than any other source .
About two - thirds ( 68 % ) say they regularly get local news from television reports or television station websites , 48 % say they regularly get news from local newspapers in print or online , 34 % say they get local news regularly from radio and 31 % say they get their local news , more generally , from the internet .
Newspapers have long struggled to attract younger readers .
A recent analysis of newspaper readership by Pew Research found that just 27 % of Generation Y – those born in 1977 or later – read a newspaper the previous day .
That compares with 55 % of those in the Silent or Greatest Generations , born prior to 1946 .
( For more , see “ Newspapers Face a Challenging Calculus , ” Feb. 26 , 2009 Commentary . )
Not unexpectedly , far fewer young people than older Americans say they would miss their local newspaper a lot if it were to close .
Less than a quarter of those younger than 40 ( 23 % ) say they would miss the local newspaper they read most often a lot if it were to go out of business or shut down .
That compares with 33 % of those ages 40 to 64 and 55 % of those 65 and older .
However , many more of those younger than 40 ( 41 % ) say the shutdown of their local newspaper would hurt the civic life in their community a lot .
About the same proportion of those ages 40 to 64 ( 42 % ) express that view , as do 51 % of those 65 and older .
Democrats and independents are more likely to say their communities would be hurt by the loss of the local newspaper than Republicans .
About half of Democrats ( 49 % ) and 47 % of independents say civic life would be hurt “ a lot ” if the newspaper shut down , compared with 33 % of Republicans .
Debating Local Newspaper ’s Role
Among those who say the loss of the local daily paper would hurt civic life a lot , three - in - ten say people rely on the paper to know what is going on in their community .
Another 18 % say , more generally , that people in their area read the paper .
Some 12 % note that their community has only one newspaper , while 10 % point to their own familiarity or enjoyment of the paper .
Another 6 % say the paper provides better or more in - depth coverage than does television news , and 6 % worry that jobs would be lost if the paper closed .
“ I think communities do n’t realize how dependent they are .
We learn more about ourselves when we learn about our neighbors , ’’ one respondent said .
“ A local newspaper gives a community the opportunity to grieve together ; an example is 9/11 .
It also lets us celebrate the good things — when our teams win , it ’s a big deal . ”
Many of those who say the closing of the local paper would n’t make much , if any , difference in their communities note that there are other news sources available or criticize the newspaper ’s quality .
About three - in - ten ( 29 % ) say there are other ways to get news , including television and radio news and the internet .
One - in - five say the quality of the newspaper is poor , while 5 % say it is biased .
One - in - ten say they do n’t read the paper and almost as many ( 9 % ) say they do n’t think other people read it either .
“ There are other forms of communication that are more important and easier to follow .
I either go to television or turn on the radio in my car , ” said one person who believes the closure of the local paper would make no difference to civic life .
Health Care Reform and Economy Dominate Public Interest
Economic stories continue to dominate public attention and media coverage as news about major drops in the stock market and the continuing loss of American jobs place stress on the U.S. economy .
The public ’s top story of the week , Obama ’s initial plans for overhauling the U.S. health care system , drew considerable public attention but received a smaller share of total press coverage compared with economic news overall .
Barack Obama ’s proposal for a $ 630 billion fund to reform the health care system attracted the very close attention of 41 % of Americans .
Interest in this was high despite the fact that news organizations devoted only 4 % of the total news coverage to this story , according to the PEJ analysis .
More Democrats than Republicans were very closely following the president ’s health care plans ( 49 % vs. 38 % ) .
Public interest in news about the rising unemployment rate has remained high and generally stable over the last five months .
Since early November , roughly four - in - ten Americans have reported following rising unemployment news very closely .
Last week , 42 % followed the story very closely and , for nearly two - in - ten ( 18 % ) , this was their top story of the week .
According to PEJ , the media devoted 5 % of newshole to unemployment .
More than a third ( 35 % ) paid very closely attention to recent major drops in the stock market and 18 % said this was the single news story they followed more closely than any other .
The media devoted 6 % of coverage to stock market stories .
A plurality of people ( 45 % ) with annual family incomes of $ 75,000 or more paid very close attention to the declining stock market last week , compared with 34 % of those with incomes between $ 30,000 and $ 75,000 , and 23 % of those with incomes of less $ 30,000 .
The debate over Rush Limbaugh ’s influence over the Republican Party and the verbal sparring between White House officials and Limbaugh himself generated a great deal of news coverage ( 8 % of total news ) .
The Limbaugh story received the greatest attention from cable news networks ( 17 % ) and radio outlets ( 15 % ) , according to PEJ .
Public interest , though , was less intense .
Just 15 % of Americans reported following news about Limbaugh very closely and 4 % said this was their top story of the week .
More Republicans ( 21 % ) than Democrats ( 11 % ) very closely followed news about Limbaugh ’s influence over the GOP .
Pluralities of both independents ( 47 % ) and Democrats ( 44 % ) reported following this story “ not at all closely . ”
An arrest warrant for the president of Sudan on charges of war crimes in the Darfur region did not register highly with the American public .
Nearly one - in - ten ( 9 % ) followed this story very closely and just 1 % listed this as their top story .
These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index , an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press .
The index , building on the Center ’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories , examines news interest as it relates to the news media ’s coverage .
The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s News Coverage Index , which monitors the news reported by major newspaper , television , radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis .
In the most recent week , data relating to news coverage were collected from March 2 - 8 , 2009 and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week were collected March 6 - 9 , 2009 from a nationally representative sample of 1,001 adults .
About the News Interest Index
The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public ’s interest in and reaction to major news events .
This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s News Coverage Index , an ongoing content analysis of the news .
The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media : newspapers , network television , cable television , radio and the internet .
Each week ( from Sunday through Friday ) PEJ compiles this data to identify the top stories for the week .
The News Interest Index survey collects data from Friday through Monday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week .
Results for the weekly surveys are based on telephone interviews among a nationwide sample of approximately 1,000 adults , 18 years of age or older , conducted under the direction of ORC ( Opinion Research Corporation ) .
For results based on the total sample , one can say with 95 % confidence that the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls , and that results based on subgroups will have larger margins of error .

Ricky Gervais has filmed a guest slot on the 40th anniversary edition of Sesame Street .
The episode does n't air until November in the US , but here are some outtakes of him singing a song called Set Your Piggies Free with Elmo .
The red monster does n't take too well to the comments about his pyjamas .
" It 's called acting , Mr Gervais .
Acting . "
That 's him told , then .
Our sleep may seem like “ switching off ” or being quite a steady state , when our mind and body remain dormant and our brain activity is ceased .
However , in the middle of the twentieth century it was discovered that every healthy sleep has its special architecture .
When we sleep , our mind goes through a sequence of 5 stages , which can be characterized by different brain wave patterns .
In 1953 , the invention of a device called the electroencephalograph helped the scientists discover two types of sleep :
1. REM ( rapid eye movement ) sleep , or dreaming stage , which can be characterized by increased brain activity and rapid movement of our eyes under the eyelids .
2. NREM ( non - REM ) sleep , when our brain activity slows down during sleep .
Adult people spend about 20 % of their sleep in REM phase , and infants spend about 50 % of their sleep in this phase .
This is the stage when we see the brightest and the most vivid dreams that our brain creates from the pieces of information we know and everything we see during our life .
NREM sleep lasts longer , and during this phase our body works for restoring our tissues and improving the work of all the body systems , recreating bones and muscles , etc .
The stages of our sleep include the following 5 phases :
Stage 1 . NREM or Slow Wave Sleep ( SWS ) .
It is a period of transition between wakefulness and sleep , so the sleep is very light and a person can be woken up easily .
The eye movements slow down .
On this stage some people experience sudden abrupt movements ( so called hypnic myoclonia ) , and some people may have a sensation of falling down .
Stage 2 . NREM or SWS .
This is the longest stage which lasts for about 50 % of the whole cycle .
In this phase we are still in quite light sleep .
At that , our body and mind get prepared for entering a deep sleep .
Our eye movements stop , the body temperature decreases , and our heart rate and brain activity slows down .
Stage 3 . NREM or SWS .
This stage is called deep slow - wave sleep .
On this stage , very slow brain waves ( delta - waves ) are generated .
It is quite hard to wake up a person during this stage .
There are no eye movements or muscle activities .
Stage 4 . NREM or SWS .
This is the second stage of deep sleep .
The brain goes on producing very slow delta - waves .
This stage usually lasts for about 30 minutes and possible sleepwalking or bedwetting occurs on this stage .
Stages 3 and 4 are the most important stages of our sleep , and if they do not last long enough , the whole sleep will be not satisfying .
Stage 5 . REM sleep .
The REM period lasts for about 15 minutes and can be characterized with shallow and rapid breathing , increased heart rate and blood pressure , fast movements of the eyes and certain muscle activity .
This is the stage when brain activity maximizes and the waves generated can be compared to the ones generated when a person is awake .
That is why dreaming occurs , and , if awoken during the REM sleep , a person can remember the dreams very clearly .
Those are the stages of human sleep cycles , which every person , who does not suffer from sleep disorders , experiences every night .
Since the whole cycle usually takes 80 - 90 minutes , during our night seep we go through 4 - 5 full cycles .
The length of the stages aso changes during the course of the night sleep : for example , the REM stages of the later cycles tend to last a little longer , sometimes even up to 40 - 50 minutes .
Therefore , the most vivid and exciting dreams usually come to our mind closer to the morning !
Budget deficit ' to hit a record £ 200 bn ' - making Britain one of the hardest hit economies in the world
Britain ’s budget deficit is heading for a record £ 200 billion after a sharp deterioration in public finances , experts warned last night .
The International Monetary Fund predicts borrowing will balloon to 11 per cent of national income due to a collapse in tax receipts and soaring spending on jobless benefits .
Its forecast is 40 per cent worse than Treasury predictions of a £ 118 billion
deficit for 2009 - 10 and the worst since official records began in the early 1960s .
Under fire : Chancellor Alistair Darling being grilled by the Treasury Select Committee about the financial crisis yesterday
The report came hours after official figures revealed the Treasury borrowed a record £ 9 billion in February - eight times as much as this time last year .
Meanwhile , the national debt soared to £ 717 billion , more than twice the level in 1997 .
Peter Spencer , chief economic adviser to the Ernst & Young ITEM Club , said : ' Public finances are continuing to deteriorate at an alarming rate .
And as the economy continues to shrink , the outlook is bleak . '
Chancellor Alistair Darling told the Commons Treasury Committee : ' The situation has deteriorated quite markedly , but if you look at our debt levels we are better placed than many other countries . '
But Shadow Chancellor George Osborne said : ' These dreadful figures show how Labour has given us the worst public finances in the developed world . '
Economists described the state of the government ’s books as ‘ dreadful ’ and predicted things will just get worse as the recession deepens .
Shadow Chancellor George Osborne called Labour 's figures ' dreadful '
Ultimately the vast swathes of government debt will have to be paid back through tax hikes and a draconian squeeze on public spending .
The IMF said the world economy will contract in 2009 for the first time since World War Two , with output shrinking by between 0.5 per cent and 1.0 per cent .
Britain will be one of the hardest hit economies in the world , with analysts at the Economist Intelligence Unit yesterday forecasting a 3.6 per cent contraction this year followed by a 1.1 per cent fall in output in 2010 .
Yesterday ’s figures revealed a near - 10 per cent plunge in tax revenues in February , with corporation tax receipts plummeting 11 per cent .
VAT takings dropped 8.3 per cent , in part thanks to Mr Darling ’s decision to introduce a temporary 2.5 point cut in the levy .
Government spending meanwhile jumped 6.5 per cent , in part thanks to the largest jump in jobless benefit claims since 1971 .
Appearing before MPs on the Treasury Select Committee , Mr Darling rejected calls to cap the pay of executives in the banks bailed out by the Government .
He said he was not prepared to follow the example of President Barack Obama who has imposed a £ 350,000 cap on the salaries of executives in banks which have received government cash .
He also said one of his priorities was to ensure that the Government secures a return for the billions it has pumped into propping up the banks .
‘ At some stage we have got to make sure we get our money back , ’ he said .
He also cautioned that a crack down on bonuses would have an unavoidable impact on the public finances because it would mean lower tax revenues .
' I expect the revenue from bonuses to fall although I to have to say that that is a double - edged thing , ' he said .
' It follows that if people are not paying bonuses then less is coming into the Revenue . ’
WASHINGTON  The American military has not properly tracked tens of thousands of weapons the Pentagon bought and shipped to Afghan security forces , leaving the arms at risk of being stolen or sold to militants , according to a federal report that is to be presented at a House panel hearing on Thursday .
American military officials failed to keep complete records on about 87,000 rifles , pistols , mortars and other weapons  about one - third of all light arms the United States sent to Afghan soldiers and police officers from December 2004 to June 2008 , auditors from the Government Accountability Office found .
Further , American military trainers kept no reliable records on 135,000 more weapons donated by 21 countries , including Hungary , Egypt , Slovenia and Romania .
The report , which will be presented at a hearing of a House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee , also found that Afghan security procedures were so inadequate that weapons supplied to Afghan forces were at “ serious risk of theft or loss . ”
A copy of the report about the Afghan forces was provided to The New York Times by a Congressional official who sought to underscore the seriousness of the issue before the hearing .
“ It ’s critical that we not have weapons bleeding out of the system into the hands of insurgents , ” said Representative John F. Tierney , a Massachusetts Democrat who leads the House committee ’s national security and foreign affairs subcommittee .
As Solidarity went to press , students at the University of East Anglia , Edinburgh University and Goldsmiths College in London had just gone into occupation in solidarity with Gaza — bringing the total number of colleges that have now occupied to 29 .
Koos Couvée reports from the meeting to coordinate the occupations called by the Stop the War Coalition on 7 February .
The meeting started with a number of high profile speakers .
Jeremy Corbyn praised the student movement rising again after years of apathy .
Students involved in the LSE and Manchester occupations spoke about the disgraceful attitude of NUS towards the movement , and the possiblity of it broadening out to cover other issues like anti-fascism and free education .
Lindsey German of the SWP made a predictable analogy between the situation in South Africa in the 1970s and Palestine now and spoke in favour of a boycott of Israel .
Tony Benn also spoke .
The general tone of the meeting was celebratory .
A bit of debate arose around the boycott issue , when a member of the Socialist Party argued a boycott would hurt the Israeli working class most , and inhibited united action for socialism in the Middle East .
The majority of the room was heavily in favour of a boycott .
This was the end of the debate , and it did not resurface .
Interestingly , the student charter that the StWC drew up for their local factions did not include the boycott demand .
After the reports back from the various occuopations , the final session again included a number of speakers — Chris Nineham from StWC and the SWP , George Galloway MP , and Rob Owen , NUS Executive member and SWP activist .
Nineham broadened the emphasis on Gaza to imperialism worldwide , and stressed the importance of the demos around the G20 and NATO .
Galloway tried to rally support for his Gaza aid convoy .
After the conference many delegates felt quite dissatisfied , despite the general tone of the meeting being constructive and celebratory .
It seemed to me that a lot of the socialist / libertarian / unaffiliated delegates wanted to network and share skills , which the conference did not cater for .
Apart from this there was the call from Revo / Workers Power for the “ radical coordination of student struggles ” .
Then of course there is Education Not for Sale ’s call for a new student union network alongside NUS ( a lot of frustration about the NUS was voiced in the meeting ) , and the planned meeting to discuss this idea on 7 March .
We joined forces and called for a meeting at ULU after the conference .
We were joined by 40 - 50 delegates , and the SWP turned up to it as well .
Because of the various intentions behind this spontaneous meeting its aims were quite unclear , but I think there were a number of elements to it .
People wanted to have a general discussion about this occupation movement and its relation to broader politics and student struggles .
Some people did not want to network and organise through the bureaucracy of the StWC , and were opposed to the creation of a national committee , something that was proposed and voted through on conference floor earlier .
Other questions were on how this movement related to NUS and could foster involvement in the “ new centre ” , as well as how it related to various existing broad left student initiatives .
SWP comrades tried to block this discussion , arguing for national coordination through the structures they control ( STW , the Another Education is Possible group ) .
The legitimacy of people in the room was questioned by Rob Owen , saying he did n't feel “ the meeting reflected the leadership of the occupations ” , which pissed a lot of delegates ( especially those who are on principle opposed to the idea of leadership ) right off .
By this time the SWP , except for Rob , had all walked out .
With numbers dwindling we decided to set a date for for a national meeting ( provisionally Saturday 18 April ) , and we agreed that our struggles should be linked up through the creation of an email list and regular meetings .
Whether the SWP is up for building for a new conference on April 18 remains to be seen .
By that time , the Nato and G20 demonstrations , as well as the 25 February demonstration for free education , will be behind us , and we will need a national network to continue our various struggles , especially over fees .

Imagine a vicious velociraptor like those in " Jurassic Park , " but only as big as a modern chicken .
That 's what Canadian researchers say they have found , the smallest meat - eating dinosaur yet discovered in North America .
This pint - sized cousin of velociraptor , weighing in at 4 - to - 5 pounds , " probably hunted and ate whatever it could for its size — insects , mammals , amphibians and maybe even baby dinosaurs , " according to Nicholas Longrich of the University of Calgary .
The creature lived 75 million years ago in the swamps and forests of southern Alberta , Longrich and colleague Philip J. Currie report in Tuesday 's edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
There has been plenty of evidence for large and medium - size dinosaurs in North America , but not small ones , Longrich said in a telephone interview .
Now researchers see there was a dinosaur filling that niche also .
The bones of the small raptor were discovered among fossils that had been collected a quarter - century ago and remained in a museum drawer , Longrich explained .
Similar small dinos have been uncovered in China in the last few years , and studying those helped the researchers identify this North American version .
" It was hard to tell because it was still encased in rock , " Longrich said .
" It is only because I had been studying the Chinese dinosaurs I could tell what it was . "
" Once we got it out of the rock it was a pretty nice specimen , " he added .
Like the velociraptor , the tiny raptor had claws .
At first the small claws were thought to come from juveniles , Longrich said .
" But when we studied the pelvis , we found the hip bones were fused , which would only have happened once the animal was fully grown . "
Previously the smallest carnivorous dinosaurs found in North America have been about the size of a wolf .
The creature has been named Hesperonychus elizabethae , after the late Canadian paleontologist Elizabeth " Betsy " Nicholls , who recovered the specimen .
Hesperonychus means " western claw , " a reference to the enlarged sickle - shaped claw on its second toe .
The find " emphasizes how little we actually know , and it raises the possibility that there are even smaller ones out there waiting to be found , " said Longrich .
Matthew Carrano , a paleontologist at the Smithsonian 's National Museum of Natural History , agreed .
" I think there 's increasing awareness among vertebrate paleontologists that we have overlooked a lot of small species of dinosaurs .
They are harder to find , but also the early history of our science had a lot to do with finding the big and impressive specimens , " said Carrano , who was not part of Longrich 's team .
" I would predict that the diversity of small dinosaurs will continue to go up in the coming years , all over the world , " Carrano said .

Russia has suspended plans to retaliate against a proposed U.S. missile shield by putting missiles along its European border , the country 's Interfax News Agency reported Wednesday .
The report , which quotes an unidentified Russian military source , said the move is a result of the policies of U.S. President Barack Obama .
" The implementation of these plans has been halted in connection with the fact that the new U.S. administration is not rushing through plans to deploy " its missile defence shield in eastern Europe , said the news agency , according to Reuters .
U.S. envoy to NATO , Kurt Volker , told Reuters the move would be a " very positive step . "
Russia 's military has n't confirmed the report .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev announced last year that Russia could place Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad , a western outpost located on the Baltic Sea between Poland and Lithuania .
Former U.S. president George W. Bush proposed stationing interceptor missiles in Poland , along with radar in the Czech Republic .
Obama has said the plans will be reviewed .
LONDON ( MarketWatch ) -- Shares in PartyGaming climbed almost 7 % Tuesday after the online gambling group said any settlement it pays to the U.S. Department of Justice is likely to be " significantly lower " than the $ 300 million that co-founder Anurag Dikshit is reportedly set to hand over .
The statement came after a report in the Financial Times that Dikshit has agreed to make the payment to U.S. authorities and plead guilty to a charge related to online betting ..
The newspaper said Dikshit is due to appear in a New York court Tuesday , where he will admit the offense and agree to cooperate with the Department of Justice .
The FT added that no plea bargain has been agreed , meaning Dikshit risks a jail sentence of two years , though he 's hoping to avoid imprisonment after going voluntarily to the Department of Justice .
PartyGaming ( PRTY ) began talks with U.S. authorities in 2007 with the aim of removing any uncertainty over its legal status .
The talks revolve around its operations prior to October 2006 , when it allowed U.S. customers to gamble on its Web sites .
" The company 's discussions with the Department of Justice have made good progress and it is currently negotiating the final terms of a possible settlement , " it said Tuesday .
" On the basis of the discussions to - date , PartyGaming expects any settlement with the Department of Justice to involve a payment by the company of an amount that is significantly lower than that reported to be paid by Mr Dikshit , " the statement continued .
" In addition , the company believes that any such settlement is unlikely to include a criminal plea on the part of the company or any director , " it added .
Shares in PartyGaming rose 13.9 % in afternoon London trading .
Other gambling companies involved in similar talks with the Department of Justice also rallied strongly , with 888 Holdings ( 888 ) adding 10.4 % and Sportingbet ( SBT ) jumping 14.8 % .
Deutsche Bank analyst Jon Tarasewicz said the developments should be taken positively for both PartyGaming and the sector as a whole as they provides clear evidence that the Department of Justice is prepared to reach settlements .
" We note that the company 's statement is more definitive about the likely outcome than previously , from which we would infer a high degree of confidence from the company , " Tarasewicz said .
He added that settlements with U.S. authorities will remove some of the uncertainty hanging over the company and could also be a catalyst for further consolidation involving PartyGaming .
The Dikshit case is the highest - profile prosecution so far in the long - running U.S. crackdown on online gambling .
The clampdown on Internet gambling began back in 2006 with the arrest of David Carruthers , then - CEO of BetOnSports.com , and the detention of former Sportingbet Chairman Peter Dicks .
See archived story .
That was followed by the introduction of new legislation that barred firms from receiving funds related to online gambling , and effectively forced PartyGaming , 888 Holdings and others to shut their U.S. - facing operations .

Italian researchers have developed a wheelchair that obeys mental signals sent to a computer , they said Friday .
The researchers at Milan 's Polytechnical Institute artificial intelligence and robotics laboratory took three years to develop the system , Professor Matteo Matteucci told AFP .
The user is connected to a computer with electrodes on his or her scalp , and sends a signal by concentrating for a few seconds on the name of the desired destination -- kitchen , bedroom , bathroom -- displayed on a screen .
The computer then guides the wheelchair to the selected room using a preset programme .
" We do n't read minds , but the brain signal that is sent , " Matteucci said .
The chair is equipped with two laser beams that can detect obstacles .
The Milan lab is already in contact with companies that could produce a commercial prototype aimed at quadriplegics , Matteucci said , adding that it could take between five and 10 years .
Such a wheelchair would cost only 10 percent more than a classic motorised wheelchair , according to the institute .
Research to develop the so - called Brain Computer Interface began in the early 1980s around the world .
Matteucci said a handful of other researchers were working on similar projects to his , including the Federal Polytechnic School in Lausanne , Switzerland .
" Eventually , a research consortium should be set up that will use all these projects as a basis for finding the best approach , " he said .
" We 've now started work on getting the chair to operate outdoors using a GPS , " Matteucci added .

Christian
Bale is easily our method actor of the week – his dedication to clown - beating even extends to his own clown mother , for God ’s sake .
But , in all of this possibly - illegal motherclown - beating kerfuffle , one question has stood out above all others – what makes a newly - minted megastar like Christian Bale start whaling on his mother and sister on the happiest day of his life ?
Turns out the reason might be cash .
According to reports today , Christian Bale kicked off after his sister asked him for £ 100,000 to help raise her three children .
Frankly we ’re disgusted – does n’t Christian Bale know that all children have the right to receive occasional gifts of more than the average British annual working wage that their mother has managed to guilt out of their moviestar uncle ?
Shame on you , Mr Bale .
Shame on you indeed .
One of the downsides to being famous is that your success tends to attract unwanted curiosity – people know that you ’re loaded and they want to take a little slice of your cash for themselves .
When this happens the best thing you can do is to retreat into the bosom of your family .
But if you ’re Christian Bale , and it ’s your family that ’s doing the begging , well then you ’re pretty much effed up the bum .
That ’s apparently the reason for Christian Bale ’s still - bemusing assault arrest this week .
For the newcomers among you , Christian Bale was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of assaulting his mother and sister right before the London premiere of The Dark Knight .
He denies the charges and his family denies calling the police .
Since then , Christian Bale has been bailed and the assault has been described as a strong verbal attack , possibly combined with a mild push .
At first the reason for this alleged attack was that Bale ’s mother was slagging off his wife , but now The Sun has spoken to a source who claims that Christian Bale got a bit shirty when his sister Sharon asked for £ 100,000 to help raise her kids :
“ Christian is a very wealthy young man and was asked to help his sister out financially .
He was asked to loan her £ 100,000 but he refused and that caused an almighty row .
During that row , the women claim , he assaulted them by pushing and shoving them …
They are both devastated that it has come to this but want him to be taught a lesson . ”
Yeah !
Jesus , Christian
Bale is such a bastard , is n’t he ?
He deserves to be taught a lesson – the lesson that you ’re supposed to financially bail out any of your relatives who appear to be either greedy or living beyond their means whenever they want just because you ’ve starred in a couple of films about a funny - voiced crimefighter in a gimp suit .
Sharon
Bale could hardly ask any other members of her family for support , could she ?
Her mother ’s a part - time clown – what kind of financial help could she possibly offer ?
Those kids need £ 100,000 , not a shipment of abnormally large shoes and a tiny spluttering car that keeps falling apart !
Still , not to worry – even though Christian Bale chose not to help his nieces and nephews out , they ’ll still get their cash one way or the other .
Probably from all the royalties from their forthcoming memoirs I Wear Rags Because My Uncle Is Stingy And Allegedly A Bit Violent .

An Illinois state lawmaker is proposing that gun owners be required to carry personal liability insurance of at least $ 1 million .
Rep. Kenneth Dunkin ’s bill seeks to amend the state ’s Firearm Owners Identification Card
Act to provides that any person who owns a firearm in the state maintain a $ 1 million or higher policy of liability insurance “ specifically covering any damages resulting from negligent or willful acts involving the use of such firearm while it is owned by such person . ”
A gun owner would be responsible after a firearm is lost or stolen until the loss or theft is reported to the police department or sheriff of the jurisdiction in which the owner resides .
Police would be empowered to pull the gun license of anyone who does not submit evidence of having the required insurance .
The measure is now in the House Rules Committee .
Karl Rove , Sarah Palin & Tim Griffin walk into a bar ...
By Shannyn Moore Stop me if you 've heard this before .
I just do n't think it 's funny .
I 'm always curious why people come to Alaska .
Born in Homer , I won the ovarian lottery , but my parent 's adventure to this great state is one that can entertain the crustiest of old timers .
" So , what brought you to Alaska ? " is a question few dare ask a stranger in a bar , but it always manages to conjure interesting stories while sitting around a fire with friends .
Strangers in Alaska bars , more often than not , have checkered pasts and damn near sneer at what they perceive as an intrusive question .
After receiving a curious email last week from a friend in New York , I am searching for the answer to that question for one such visitor .
Granted , in a year , Alaska has four times as many visitors as we have citizens .
Old bumper stickers asked , " If we call it ' tourist season ' can we shoot 'em ? "
The ' visitor ' who captured my interest is Tim Griffin .
In an interview last month published in a small Arkansas weekly , Mr. Griffin claimed to have come to Alaska " more than 20 times last year . "
Who is Tim Griffin ?
Why was he here ?
Prepare for less than savory answers .
From September 1995 to January 1997 , Griffin worked with Special Prosecutor David Barrett in his investigation of Henry Cisneros , former Secretary of HUD .
For two years after that , he was Senior Investigative Counsel for the House Committee on Government Reform .
During his time there , the committee was very active .
They issued 1,052 dead - end subpoenas to probe alleged misconduct by the Clinton Administration and the Democratic Party .
The cost to taxpayers ?
More than $ 35 million .
In September 1999 , he became Deputy Research Director for the RNC - special ops for George W. Bush 's campaign .
Griffin was a legal advisor working closely with Attorney Ben Ginsberg of Patton Boggs , LLP for the Bush - Cheney 2000 Florida Recount Team .
In a BBC documentary , " Digging the Dirt " , Griffin stood next to a sign reading " ON MY COMMAND -- UNLEASH HELL ( ON AL ) , " and stated , " We think of ourselves as the creators of the ammunition in a war , " he said .
" We make the bullets . " From March 2001 through June 2002 , he was Special Assistant to Assistant Attorney General Michael Chertoff .
In 2004 , Griffin was a key player and reunited with Attorney Ben Ginsberg in the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign against John Kerry .
Ginsberg resigned from his position with George W Bush 's re-election campaign after his Swift Boat involvement became public .
Griffin began serving as Special Assistant to the President and Deputy Director , Office of Political Affairs at the White House in April 2005 .
His duty was " organizing and coordinating political support for the confirmation of Judge John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court . "
For a year , beginning in September 2005 , Tim Griffin was on military leave from the White House .
He served as a prosecutor for Judge Advocate General ( better known as JAG ) and then went to Iraq .
He claimed to have prosecuted 40 cases .
Among those was a case allegedly against a soldier gone berserk on his commander .
Griffin claimed he put the soldier in the clink for 25 years .
The truth is , Griffin served only as assistant trial counsel to three cases that never went to trial .
Apparently , Tim Griffin 's tall tales were training for those he might later tell in Alaska over a beer in some local bar .
In 2006 , due to a little known provision in the USA PATRIOT Act , George W. Bush & Company fired a handful of US Attorneys and replaced them without Senate confirmation .
In December 2006 , US Attorney Bud Cummings was fired from his district in Northeast Arkansas and replaced with Tim Griffin .
In February 2007 , Paul McNaulty , Deputy Attorney General , testified Cummings was fired to make a place for Griffin at the urging of Karl Rove and Harriet Miers , further cementing Griffin 's cozy relationship with the Bush Administration .
On May 30 , 2007 , investigative journalist , BBC Correspondent and best selling author , Greg Palast , turned over 500 emails to House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers .
The emails were inadvertently sent to the wrong email address during the 2004 campaign .
Those wrongly addressed emails revealed the caging of over 70,000 voters in Florida .
The targets of registration scrubbing were Black soldiers and poor Black and Hispanic citizens .
Disenfranchising voters based on race has been a felony since the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .
Palast 's information had been published for nearly 2 years , but on the day it went to Washington , Tim Griffin resigned from his Rovian created job as US Attorney in Arkansas .
Except for short stints working for the presidential campaigns of Mike Huckabee and Fred Thompson , Tim Griffin was off the radar .
Until , of course , he showed up in Alaska , which brings me back to my question :
Why would Tim Griffin come to Alaska over 20 times last year ?
Attached to my email was a news article from the Northwest Arkansas News Source dated February 22 , 2009 .
NWANews :
What are you up to now ?
Griffin : I have two businesses .
Depending on the time of the year , I am about 50 - 50 law and public affairs .
I have the Griffin Law Firm .
I primarily represent businesses in federal litigation in Texas .
My public affairs company , I provide communications advice , how to develop a message that makes sense whether for corporate clients or political ones .
NWANews : Can you name a client or two ?
Griffin : I went to Alaska last year over 20 times .
Worked on a ballot initiative , which we defeated soundly .
NWANews : What was that ?
Griffin :
It was related to mining industry .
Wow !
So Karl Rove 's right hand man and special assistant to George W. Bush , under Congressional investigation for felony vote caging , got on a plane " over 20 times last year " to work against Ballot Proposition 4 , the Clean Water Initiative ?
That 's a pretty big gun to get on that many flights - even if they were first class seats .
Tim Griffin basically spent 40 days from May to August on planes going back and forth between Anchorage and Little Rock !
Ballot Initiative 4 was an attempt to regulate water quality standards in Alaska .
The Target : the proposed Pebble Mine - an open pit , sulfuric acid mine .
The Mission : to protect the Bristol Bay sockeye salmon run , the largest remaining wild salmon run in the world .
Alaskans Against the Mining Shutdown was the Political Action Committee created by the mining industry .
According to their reports , they paid Mercury Public Affairs of New York , $ 106,507.80 .
That payment included a website and all of Tim Griffin 's services and travel reimbursement .
The average price for a ticket from Little Rock to Anchorage was about $ 1000 and takes at least 12 hours .
Summer hotel rates are easily $ 200 a night .
After expenses , Tim Griffin was n't taking a golden salary .
If I were sitting next to Tim Griffin at a bar , I 'd have a lot of follow up questions to my initial inquiry of " So , what brought you to Alaska ? "
Like for instance : 1 . ) Who called you ?
With all of your White House and Karl Rove connections - WHO do you know in Alaska ?
2 . ) Did you develop any relationships with Alaskans while working on the Bush - Cheney Florida Recount Team in 2000 ?
Or the Swift Boat Smear Campaign for Truth against John Kerry ?
Or in any of your illegal electioneering activity ?
WHO do you know in Alaska ?
3 . ) Why would you waste your vote - caging and election - fixing talent on a ballot initiative in Alaska ?
WHO do you know in Alaska ?
4 . ) What else did you do up here ?
WHO do you know in Alaska ?
5 . ) Did you get to meet Sarah Palin ?
She came out against the initiative in a massive multimedia campaign after an anonymous " journalist " asked her how she would vote on Ballot Prop 4 !
Were you that " journalist " ?
WHO do you know in Alaska ?
6 . ) How many frequent flyer miles do you have ?
WHO do you know in Alaska ?
7 . ) Why did n't the opposition detect your presence ?
You 're kind of a big deal .
WHO do you know in Alaska ?
8 . ) With all of your credentials , you seem underpaid .
Did you work for free or was some other kind of payment involved ?
WHO do you know in Alaska ?
9 . ) When you were working as an " informal advisor " to Mike Huckabee , did you talk to Alaska Congressman Don Young , who chaired Huckabee 's exploratory campaign ?
WHO do you know in Alaska ?
10 . )
After learning of your other " bed-mates , " I can see how you would ignore Anglo American 's environmental track record .
Proven environmental terrorists who rape , pillage and plunder resources then leave the toxic clean - up to locals .
But you 're not local .
Again ...
WHO DO YOU KNOW IN ALASKA ?
Oh , so many questions .
Like I said ... you get at least an hour 's worth of conversation when you ask , " So , what brought you to Alaska ? "
Unless the person in the bar is that stranger with a nefarious background ... like Karl Rove Protégé , future felon vote - cager and election - fixer Tim Griffin .
I wonder who he knows in Alaska .
I wonder who picked up the bar tab .

" Hit list . "
So reads a newspaper headline shown in Fitna , a short film by Dutch MP Geert Wilders that correlates jihadist violence with Koranic decrees .
Accompanying the headline are photos of the " hit list " members : murdered moviemaker and provocateur Theo van Gogh , human rights activist and then - parliamentarian Ayaan Hirsi Ali , and Wilders himself .
With van Gogh long dead and Hirsi Ali having been run out of the Netherlands years ago , the final element of the trio is now being targeted — only this time it is the Dutch legal system doing the heavy lifting on Islamists ' behalf .
Last week , an appeals court instructed prosecutors to put Wilders on trial for his criticisms of the Islamic faith :
The three judges said that they had weighed Mr. Wilders ' " one - sided generalizations " against his right to free speech , and ruled that he had gone beyond the normal leeway granted to politicians .
" The Amsterdam appeals court has ordered the prosecution of member of parliament Geert Wilders for inciting hatred and discrimination , based on comments by him in various media on Muslims and their beliefs , " the court said in a statement .
That a citizen will be dragged before magistrates to be judged on his negative opinions about Islam and Islamists is disturbing enough .
More disturbing is that such instances are far from uncommon in this new century .
Among the most infamous examples :
In 2004 , two pastors were found guilty of violating hate speech laws of Australia 's Victoria state following remarks made during a seminar on Islam .
Journalist Oriana Fallaci spent the final months of her life preparing to go to trial for " defaming Islam " in Italy .
She succumbed to cancer in 2006 .
Due to her strident critiques of Islam and Muslims , actress Brigitte Bardot has been repeatedly convicted and fined for " inciting hatred , " most recently in June 2008 .
A Canadian tribunal heard a complaint that Ezra Levant had promoted hatred by reprinting the Danish Mohammed cartoons .
The charges were dropped last year .
Maclean's was cleared of official wrongdoing for running an excerpt from Mark Steyn 's controversial book America Alone .
Some have suggested that Wilders ' high - profile case could be a blessing in disguise by helping to shine light on the Islamist agenda in the West .
Perhaps .
But win or lose , one thing seems certain .
Wilders will not be the last citizen made to answer for speech that Islamists and multiculturalists alike yearn to silence .
The only question is : who 's next ?

Cases of domestic violence have halved in 12 years , Ms Smith claims
A register of people who have attacked their partners could help prevent other potential victims of domestic abuse , the government has said .
The creation of a database monitored by police is one of several plans to be unveiled by the Home Office on Monday .
In 2007 , 142 people died in UK attacks , including 38 men , and there are thought to be thousands of abuse cases a year .
In Scotland , ministers pledged £ 44 m to tackle the " scourge " of abuse as they marked International Women 's Day .
Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said : " Sadly , violence is part of too many women 's lives across the world .
' Unacceptable '
" On this day and throughout the year the Scottish Government is determined to tackle the scourge of violence against women and children . "
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has called for a national debate on the issue and has asked police to report back on the powers they need to get a grip on the problem .
The government is considering giving police powers to ban offenders from the family home for a fortnight .
Ms Smith said : " Violence against women and girls is unacceptable in any form .
" We 've already made real progress with domestic violence incidents more than halving in the past 12 years .
" But I want to start a national debate on what more we can do to prevent it and challenging attitudes which condone it . "
The proposals will be set out in a consultation document on reducing domestic violence .
It will also include ideas for tackling honour killings , female genital mutilation , and the sexualisation of young girls .
Economic Snapshot for February 11 , 2009
Federal contract jobs leave one - in - five in poverty
by Kathryn Edwards
The federal contract workforce — government workers paid with federal dollars but employed by private business — is swelling in size .
Although the number of directly employed federal workers has remained steady at 2.7 million since 2000,1 federal contract workers have grown from 1.4 million to 2.0 million .
2
The cause for this increase is the federal government ’s expanded outsourcing of its operations .
Federal contract spending — the money federal agencies pay to private businesses for goods and services — has increased 69 % ( to $ 415 billion ) between FY 2000 and FY 2006 ( the last year of available data ) .
3
This spending on outsourcing constituted 16 % of all federal outlays .
4
This is a troubling development .
An estimated 20 % of federal contract workers make a wage below the poverty threshold .
5
In addition , these workers are less likely to have some form of health care or retirement benefits .
In short , the United States essentially has two federal workforces : one to which the government is accountable , and one to which it is not .
Contracting is done under the mantra of greater efficiency , but much of this “ cost - saving ” comes from the willingness and ability of private contractors to push down wages and benefits .
In short , the government is spending more money than ever that encourages lower wage jobs .
For more information on this issue , see also the EPI Issue Brief , Outsourcing poverty : Federal contracting pushes down wages and benefits .
Notes
1. Employment , Hours , and Earning survey from the Current Employment Statistics of BLS , includes federal postal workers .
2 . The Federal government does not collect data on federal contract workers .
This number is an estimate using the General Services Administration ’s Federal Procurement Data System and the Employment Requirements Matrix from the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
3. Spending is in real terms , adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers Research Series ( CPI - URS ) .

The annual Geneva Motor
Show is a showcase event where concept car designers display their vision for the future .
Here ’s a look at 10 cars from the show that reveal a greener–and more expensive–future .
advertisement
advertisement
10 . ) Ford Iosis Max
What it is :
This hatchback concept is a teaser for the next Ford Focus , designed to gauge audience and press reaction to the design .
The look is inspired by Ford ’s edgy “ kinetic design ” language found on most of the company ’s European products .
How it will change driving :
Ford believes the increase in gas prices , and decrease in pocket change , will push more people into the compact segment , which is generally filled by cheap and uninspiring models ( or else really expensive ones , like the MINI Cooper ) .
Ford wants to change perceptions of what a small car can be by marketing a stylish car for a budget - minded audience .
9 . ) Rolls Royce 200EX
advertisement
What it is :
While most super premium automakers are going upmarket in an effort to woo the super - rich , Rolls Royce plans to rob the parts bin of its parent company BMW to build a “ Baby Rolls ” for the mass affluent .
It looks like the company has successfully hidden the smaller dimensions behind the massive grille of this 200EX concept .
How it will change driving : Buyers not wiped out by the recent market downturn but still in the market for a premium car will finally be able to own a Rolls Royce without selling a kidney .
8 . ) Magna Steyr Mila EV
What it is : Magna Steyr is an Austrian manufacturer and parts supplier better known for building cars for companies such as Mercedes , MINI and Audi .
This did n’t stop them from attempting to market their own flexible electric vehicle concept for any car makers looking to quickly and cheaply create an EV program .
How it will change driving : Despite early reports of their demise , the electric car is coming back .
Battery issues aside , electric cars are less complicated to build and companies like Magna Steyr may change the way cars are designed and built by offering a way to outsource much of the process .
advertisement
7. ) Infiniti Essence
What it is : Lexus will soon have four hybrids in their lineup .
Infiniti has none .
The Essence both hints at the company ’s future design direction and the possibilities hybrid technology offers for a sports car .
How it will change driving :
If the company produces the stunning coupe and keeps the twin - turbocharged V6 - con-electric motor setup it ’ll be the first such vehicle in mass production .
The prospect of V8 - power with V6 fuel economy in an attractive and sporty car certainly has its appeal to those who want to have their cake and eat it from an environmentally - friendly and biodegradable package , too .
6 . ) Rinspeed E2
advertisement
What it is : Based on the popular Fiat 500 sub - subcompact car , Swiss firm Rinspeed has added a novel form of green capability .
This stylish little machine offers two levels of power output depending on the driver ’s needs with the push of a button .
For slow city cruising the E2 can bet set to a slower and more efficient power setting .
Conversely , the driver can select a sportier mode for quicker and less efficient highway driving .
How it will change driving : Currently , only hybrids differentiate power output based on the type of driving .
And even those systems are automatic .
The availability of such a system in a gas engine will allow drivers to chose when they want to feed their inner-speed demon or inner-Al Gore .
5 . ) Mitsubishi iMiEV
What it is :
The coupe version of Mitsubishi ’s tiny iMiEV electric car , the Japanese company extended the range of its electric car by dropping some weight with an aluminum frame .
Mitsubishi also upped the ‘ fun quotient ’ by adding a brightly lit and quasi - techno interior .
How it will change driving : Eschewing the trend towards making electric cars seem like everything else on the road , Mitsubishi makes a strong argument for electric cars as hip gadgets .
advertisement
4. ) EDAG Light Car Open - Source
What it is : Built on a completely recyclable basalt fiber chassis , this electric car promises to revolutionize car - to - car communication by offering a rear window that acts as an LED display .
How it will change driving : Ignoring the tried - and - true middle finger wave , drivers have to either honk or tap their brakes to send a message to other drivers .
The Light Car allows the car to manually or automatically transmit information to those behind it .
This information includes traffic notices , pedestrian interference and changing lights .
The company wants to make the car “ open source ” so developers can create new applications for it .
Think of it as an iPhone car .
3 . ) Koenigsegg Quant
advertisement
What it is : Koenigsegg is famous for building cars as exotic as its Swedish name .
The oddly - named Quant is a full - scale model of a four - seat electric car theoretically capable of a top speed of 170 MPH and a 300 - mile range after only a 20 - minute charge .
How it will change driving : Everyone is waiting for the breakthrough that will allow electric cars to travel as far on a single charge as their fuel - chugging counterparts can on a full tank of gas .
If the Koenigsegg can live up to its own hype they ’ll finally dispatch of the notion that electric cars are more trouble than they ’re worth for a daily driver .
2 . ) Rinspeed iChange
What it is :
In addition to the E2 , Rinspeed brought out its iChange electric car concept for the Geneva crowds .
What makes this car different from other battery - powered offerings is the car ’s special ability to change from a single - passenger vehicle to an automobile capable of ferrying three people around .
How it will change driving :
There are few things as wasteful as a soccer mom driving to the mailbox in her empty , 7 - passenger SUV .
The iChange adjusts the body to form the most aerodynamic and , thereby , most efficient version of the car based on the number of passengers .
advertisement
1. ) Giugiaro Frazer - Nash Namir
What it is : Designed by famous Italian firm Giugiaro , this hybrid claims to be the fastest ever with a top speed of 187 MPH .
While this number is realistic given the two electric motors and sleek design , the 1,200 - mile range seems almost impossible without a tank for the small gas engine larger than the car itself .
How it will change driving : Assuming this is n’t just a wild dream , and it ’s a big assumption , the technology erases the biggest stumbling block for electric cars : range .
Another major issue with electric cars is price and it ’s hard not to believe this one will have a price to match its outrageous claims if it ever goes into production .

Protests demand end to medical pot shop raids
The Obama administration should halt federal raids of medical marijuana dispensaries , a long - sought turnaround from the policy of the Bush White House , protesters said Thursday .
The Drug Enforcement Administration raided four dispensaries in Los Angeles this week and seized 500 pounds of marijuana , bringing fresh attention to the rift between state and federal law on medical marijuana use .
President Obama said during the campaign he would not use the Justice Department , which oversees the DEA , to circumvent state laws .
Dozens of demonstrators gathered outside a downtown federal office building to call on the DEA to cease the raids , which also seized $ 10,000 in cash .
They chanted " Obama stop the raids " and " DEA go away . "
" Somebody forgot to tell them all the rules are changing , " said Don Duncan of Americans for Safe Access , an advocacy group that promotes medical marijuana use and research .
California is among the states that allow the sale of marijuana for medicinal purposes , but the federal government has not recognized those laws .
" Anyone possessing , distributing or cultivating marijuana for any reason is in violation of federal law , " said DEA spokeswoman Sarah Pullen .
But Obama has said he will change direction .
" I think the basic concept of using medical marijuana for the same purposes and with the same controls as other drugs prescribed by doctors , I think that 's entirely appropriate , " Obama told the Mail Tribune of Medford , Ore. , last March .
" I 'm not going to be using Justice Department resources to try to circumvent state laws on this issue . "
Pullen directed questions on medical marijuana policy to the Justice Department in Washington .
On Thursday , White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said " the president believes that federal resources should not be used to circumvent state laws . "
This week Apple threw the kitchen sink at its iPhone / Touch software stack ( details outlined here ) , removing most of the most irritating nuisances at a stroke .
It 's a stunning achievement .
So Apple now finds itself where everyone else in the mobile handset business wanted to be 15 years ago .
Large companies full of clever people devoted years of planning and expenditure to fail to get here .
If the iPhone continues to flourish ( see below for the many obstacles en route ) - then both rival manufacturers and the networks have to tear up some long established strategies .
For the established handset competition , if Apple takes the lucrative high end , that leaves them scrambling around for gimmicks in a cutthroat market that 's increasingly low margin .
For the networks , they 'll need to find devices that people actually want - or pray that Apple drops its carrier exclusivity policy and partners with any network that wants to sell its gear .
So how did someone with no track record in a notoriously difficult business find itself walking away with the laurels ?
What can explain this paradox ?
For Apple , coming late to the phone business has actually been a huge advantage .
The success of the iPhone is down not just to great engineering , but profiting from several years of desperate and outright stupid behaviour by the mobile phone networks , who set the terms for the manufacturers .
The received wisdom of the industry - that you had to know the wiles of the mobile networks to succeed - turned out to be completely mistaken .
And to explain this we find another paradox , which looks like this .
The mobile phone business is actually the most " customer friendly " or " customer responsive " in the world .
This might seem a strange thing to say .
Have a read of Brendon McLean 's splendid rant from two years ago -
Why we hate the modern mobile phone , for a summary of customer unfriendly business .
But it 's true .
That 's because the customer is n't you or me , or the billion and a half other phone users in the world .
Phone manufacturers have only 800 customers , of which only around 200 really matter : these are the gentlemen from the networks .
And one of these stroppy customers can demand changes that cost the manufacturer millions , or cause the cancellation of product lines in which tens of millions have been invested .
For example , it 's these gents who in their wisdom decided that we 're too stupid to use the " butterfly " design Nokia introduced with the 6800 .
Networks killed the third phone in this line , the E70 , leaving Nokia probably just one iteration away from making a classic .
The reason ?
The fold - out keyboard would confuse us .
In their wisdom networks have done all kind of similar things over the years - disabling Wi -Fi , for example , or blocking ports .
But most of all in their pricing policies for data .
Apple simply ignored all this .
Such was its confidence in its own product , and its own steamroller marketing , that it was able to capitalise on the networks desperation .
But being late to the party also had another advantage .

U.S. soldiers play computer games on a television set at the recreational hall of a U.S. military Camp Marez in Mosul , 390 km ( 240 miles ) north of Baghdad January 30 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Erik de Castro
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Adults who play a lot of action video games may be improving their eyesight , U.S. researchers said on Sunday .
They said people who used a video - game training program saw significant improvements in their ability to notice subtle differences in shades of gray , a finding that may help people who have trouble with night driving .
“ Normally , improving contrast sensitivity means getting glasses or eye surgery -- somehow changing the optics of the eye , ” said Daphne Bavelier of the University of Rochester in New York , whose study appears in the journal Nature Neuroscience .
“ But we ’ve found that action video games train the brain to process the existing visual information more efficiently , and the improvements last for months after game play stopped . ”
For the study , the team divided 22 students into two groups .
One group played the action games “ Call of Duty 2 ” by Activision Blizzard Inc and Epic Games ’ “ Unreal Tournament 2004 . ”
A second played Electronic Arts Inc ’s “ The Sims 2 , ” a game they said does not require as much hand - eye coordination .
The two groups played 50 hours of their assigned games over the course of nine weeks .
At the end of the training , the action game players showed an average of 43 percent improvement in their ability to discern close shades of gray , while the Sims players showed none .
Bavelier found very practiced action gamers became 58 percent better at perceiving fine differences in contrast .
“ When people play action games , they ’re changing the brain ’s pathway responsible for visual processing .
These games push the human visual system to the limits and the brain adapts to it , ” Bavelier said in a statement .
She said the findings show that action video - game training may be a useful complement to eye - correction techniques .
Weeks after Obama appointed a team to help with economy , the board has yet to hold an official public meeting .
Econ board has yet to meet publicly
Six weeks after President Barack Obama appointed a blue - ribbon panel to help him dig America out of its economic crisis , the board has yet to hold an official public meeting .
The White House initially said that the 16 - member Presidential Economic Recovery Advisory Board , headed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , would meet “ every few weeks . ”
Last month , a spokesperson told POLITICO the group would meet monthly .
More recently , the White House said the high - powered board , set up to address what Obama has called the worst economic emergency since the Great Depression , would gather only about four times a year , with the next session due in “ late spring . ”

But comments from board members and Obama himself indicate that some members of the panel are meeting , in smaller gatherings that have not been announced or opened to the public .
And that raises the question of whether an administration that prides itself on openness and transparency is in fact finding it more convenient to conduct public business in private .
Now , the administration finds itself in a Catch - 22 :
It does not want to say that the president ’s economic panel , announced amid much fanfare , is not meeting during the worst economic crisis in generations .
But if it is meeting , where ’s the announcement , the agenda , the minutes ?
In short , where ’s the sunshine ?
“ If the president wants to talk to his advisory committee , it seems to me he ought to do that in the open , ” said Sidney Shapiro , a law professor at Wake Forest University .
“ There ought to be accountability for private people who address the government .
It seems to me it becomes even more important , not less important , when you have a presidential advisory committee . ”
Asked about Obama ’s right to solicit candid suggestions , Shapiro said , “ If he wants private advice , he should pick up the telephone .
He can call anybody he wants .
If he wants to form a presidential advisory committee , they ought to meet in public . ”
The White House said the advisory committee was , in fact , hard at work .
“ Members have been gathering information , conducting research , and analyzing relevant issues in preparation for the next full board meeting , ” spokesperson Jen Psaki said .
“ Individual members are in regular contact with officials at Treasury , the Federal Reserve , and the White House … .
The President has also made calls to individuals . ”
Psaki said the earlier White House statements about the full board meeting every month or so were erroneous .
“ The plan has always been to have four board meetings [ a ] year .
These will be public in accordance with the law and for the purpose of keeping the public and the media aware of what is happening in the business community , ” she said .
Last week , the White House did not respond to POLITICO ’s requests for a list of the subjects the subcommittees are to tackle or for the subgroups ’ membership rosters .
On Monday , after an early version of this story posted on POLITICO , Psaki acknowledged that such discussions have taken place by phone .
“ There are smaller conference calls of subgroups in preparation for the quarterly meetings .
These do not involve the president or federal officials .
These are not open to the media or the public , which not only abides by the , but it is also for the purpose of preparing for the public meetings , ” she said .
Through an aide , one board member told POLITICO of a board meeting at the White House on Feb. 26 .
The White House did not respond to a question about that session .
So far , none of the commission members ’ meetings have been public or officially announced in accordance with the 1972 federal law which governs such groups , the Federal Advisory Committee Act , or FACA .
That law has spawned a series of legal battles over the years , including fights over access to the Grace Commission on government waste set up by President Ronald Reagan , First Lady Hillary Clinton ’s health care task force , and Vice President Dick Cheney ’s task force on energy policy .
Secrecy surrounding those panels sparked public outrage – and serious political blowback — that helped fuel Obama ’s vows for more open government .
While current law is murky , federal regulations do call for subcommittee meetings to be open and announced in advance when those task forces are giving advice or recommendations directly to a federal agency or officer , such as the president .
The use of subcommittees to do the advisory board ’s work in private could put the panel on a collision course with a congressional panel that is advancing legislation that would require such meetings to take place in public with advance notice .
On March 10 , the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted 16 to 1 in favor of a bill which would close what some call a loophole in federal law allowing subcommittees to meet privately even when the advisory panel which set them up is required to meet in public .
A law professor who has brought suits in the past to open advisory committee meetings said the issue of forcing open meetings with the chief executive is a thorny one .
“ I would say if the president wants to meet people off the record , even an advisory committee , it does raise problematic separation - of - powers issues ” for Congress to require the meeting to be open , David Vladeck of Georgetown said .
He said Congress ’s ability to dictate how any president gets advice is limited by the Constitution .
Vladeck said he hopes that the intent of holding subgroup meetings out of the public eye is not to frustrate the public ’s right to access to the broader committee ’s work .
“ At the end of the day , the spirit of FACA would be violated if that were the game plan going in , ” he said .
The meeting earlier this month illustrates how blurred the lines can get guiding when a meeting is one that should be open .
On March 13 , seven members of the economic panel met with President Obama in a closed - door session at the White House just before a photo - op Obama held with Volcker .
The group included Volcker , former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman William Donaldson , Yale investment chief David Swensen , and developer and Hyatt Hotel heir Penny Pritzker .
No private citizens who do n’t sit on the panel attended .
“ Well , listen , I just had a meeting with Paul Volcker and our business advisory board to discuss a wide range of issues , but with some particular focus on the financial markets , ” Obama said .
But Psaki said the session “ was not a PERAB meeting --- it was a small group of business leaders meeting with the president . ”
Tthe White House said the March 13 session did not trigger the requirement for a public meeting and advance notice because it was not actually a subcommittee of the larger board .
In addition , an official said the administration had legal advice that such meetings were permissible as long as they do not pass on official advice from the full board .
“ Even if it was a subgroup meeting , White House Counsel , the Treasury and ( the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel ) have advised that subgroups are allowed to meet with the President as long as they are not providing formal advice on behalf of the entire PERAB , ” the aide said .
One panel member not at that gathering , AFL - CIO Secretary - Treasurer Rich Trumka , told POLITICO that at an organizing session before the formal announcement in February “ nine or ten subject - matter subgroups ” were set up .
“ One is walking through job growth and investments .
Another is talking about financial regulation .
Another is looking at trade policy , ” Trumka said .
The union leader said the process will broaden the advice Obama receives .
“ People are looking at a lot of different sectors they ’re familiar with .
You get to talk directly to the president with your economic ideas without being filtered through any of his cabinet or staff , ” Trumka said .
Asked if the access will be valuable for the AFL - CIO , Trumka said , “ I think it ’s important for the country and for the economy . ”
Obama announced the economic advisory board back in November , during the transition .
It was formally established on February 6 in an executive order signed by Obama at a ceremony in the White House ’s East Room .
“ I created this board to enlist voices to come from beyond the Washington echo chamber , to ensure that no stone is unturned as we work to put people back to work and get our economy moving , ” the president said .
“ We will meet regularly so that I can hear different ideas and sharpen my own and seek counsel that is candid and informed by the wider world . ”
Other members of the panel include General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt , union leader Anna Burger and Silicon Valley venture capitalist John Doerr .
Most board members did not respond to questions about its activities .
One said she was unaware that some of her colleagues met with Obama earlier this month .

I was recently up for a staff writer job .
It was on a basic cable show done outside the Hollywood system ( and on the east coast ) .
The show ’s about an extreme sports topic that ’s way outside my area of expertise and comfort zone .
But they liked my writing and gave me the opportunity to fly out and interview .
I spent months boning up on the subject , watching their programming , familiarizing myself with extreme sports superstars .
I did a writing sample , which the producers loved .
It was a long process that involved a lot of preparation and work on my part .
I told my girlfriend about it .
My friends .
My family .
Everyone seemed legitimately excited for me .
I eventually flew out and interviewed with the head writers .
And aced it .
A week later , I was jazzed to get a message on my voicemail from the producer telling me to call him as soon as possible .
I did .
They were passing on me .
He told me they liked me , but I was n’t familiar enough with their “ product ” ( David Foster Wallace - ian aside – it ’s probably not a good sign creatively when producers refer to their creative output as “ product ” ) .
Oh , and next time I interview for a staff job , I should probably dress a little more formally .
I know these guys do n’t work in Hollywood , but they know dick about a writer ’s attire .
By wearing a sweater instead of my stained , “ I love blowjobs ” T - shirt , I was dressing up .
Even worse than the disappointment from not getting the job and wasting months of my time ( which could have been more productively spent revamping my spec script or advancing my character in FALLOUT 3 ) , was talking to everyone I made the mistake of telling about the opportunity .
After six voicemails from my parents and two from my brother , I finally shut off my cell phone .
When my girlfriend asked if I got the gig and would be moving away , I just told her yes .
I think she ’s starting to figure it out though , because it ’s been a month and I keep buying new groceries .
The Brazilian star will be absent from the Emirates ...
AC Milan may have picked up a point against Reggina this evening , but their draw has come at a greater cost .
Midfield star Kaka had to leave the pitch 77 minutes in due to injury .
Immediately after coming off , he was taken to hospital for routine checks , but coach Carlo Ancelotti has revealed that there is more to come .
" He 's going for an x-ray , " said Carletto .
" We do n't think it 's just a little thing because he had a lot of pain .
It was in his foot , not the muscle . "
In fact AC Milan 's official website later noted that the x-ray indicated a sprain , not a fracture , but the midfielder remains out of action .
Kaka will miss the match between Italy and Brazil in London on Tuesday , and he could be in doubt for the upcoming Milan derby .

OTTAWA — Dissatisfied with the stimulus package that made its way through Congress , and the lack of conservative input contained therein , Republican senators voted unanimously over the weekend to give tax breaks to Canadians .
OTTAWA — Dissatisfied with the stimulus package that made its way through Congress and the lack of conservative input contained therein , Republican senators voted unanimously over the weekend to give tax breaks to Canadians .
“ Since we were unable to convince our colleagues or a majority of Americans that reducing taxes for the wealthy is the best way to stimulate the economy , ” explained Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell ( R - KY ) , “ we decided to take matters into our own hands , by giving tax breaks to wealthy Canadian businessmen . ”
According to McConnell , the tax breaks will create a hiring binge the likes of which the Canucks have never known .
“ Since Canada is a sparsely populated country , ” he said , “ employers will soon run out of qualified workers and begin hiring Americans . ”
Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) agreed .
“ While the Democrats ’ proposals will tailspin our economy into the depths of hell , ” said the former presidential candidate , “ this legislation will bring ten to twelve million American jobs to our neighbors to the North . ”
“ And when those American workers follow the jobs to Canada , ” added McConnell , “ the homes they leave behind will be returned directly to the lenders , circumventing the costly and cumbersome foreclosure process , and putting billions of dollars back into the hands of the American banker . ”
“ My country ’ tis of thee , ” sang McCain , “ but Canada for the economy . ”
The Canadian government thanked the senators for their kind thoughts , but declined the offer , explaining they would be instituting their own stimulus - recovery package : “ We buy everyone in the country a round of beer , ” explained a member of the House of Commons , “ and let them pee in the street . ”
“ It ’s the Canadian Trickle Down Theory , ” said the legislator .
“ But in our version , at least everyone gets a Molson , eh ? ”
Undaunted , the Republicans have regrouped and are proposing tax rebates for all of Iceland .

WHAT JUST HAPPENED ….
Despite all the grief she ’s gotten , I continue to think that the selection of Sarah Palin as John McCain ’s running mate represents the breaking of a consensual cultural barrier far more fundamental than most people realize .
It ’s not just that she was inexperienced ( Spiro Agnew and John Edwards were n’t much more experienced than Palin when they ran for VP ) but that she was — obviously , transparently , completely — uninterested in and uninformed about national policy at nearly every level .
We ’ve simply never seen someone so completely unmoored from the normal requirements of national office before .
She was chosen purely at the level of celebrity , and an awful lot of people seemed to be just fine with that .
Unfortunately , I ’ve never really been able to find the words to describe just how corrosive I think her choice was .
The whole affair just left me gobsmacked .
So instead I ’ll turn the floor briefly over to Andrew Sullivan :
Let ’s be real in a way the national media seems incapable of : this person should never have been placed on a national ticket in a mature democracy … .
The impulsive , unvetted selection of a total unknown , with no knowledge of or interest in the wider world , as a replacement president remains one of the most disturbing events in modern American history .
That the press felt required to maintain a facade of normalcy for two months — and not to declare the whole thing a farce from start to finish — is a sign of their total loss of nerve . …. This deluded and delusional woman still does n’t understand what happened to her ; still has no self - awareness ; and has never been forced to accept her obvious limitations .
She cannot keep even the most trivial story straight ; she repeats untruths with a ferocity and calm that is reserved only to the clinically unhinged ; she has the educational level of a high school drop - out ; and regards ignorance as some kind of achievement .
It is excruciating to watch her — but more excruciating to watch those who feel obliged to defend her .
Andrew ’s obsession with Palin was often hard to take , and I sometimes wished I could reach through the screen and strangle him whenever he started talking about Trig Palin again .
Still , aside from the “ clinically unhinged ” crack , I agree with all of this .
Disturbing hardly begins to describe what we ’ve gone though with Palin over the past two months .
UPDATE : Via email , here ’s an excerpt from Wolf Blitzer ’s interview today with Palin :
BLITZER : Another question .
What are your new ideas on how to take the Republican Party out of this rut that it ’s in right now ?
Give me one or two new ideas that you ’re going to propose to these governors who have gathered here in this hotel .
PALIN : Well , a lot of Republican governors have really good ideas for our nation because we ’re the ones there on the front lines being held accountable every single day in service to the people whom have hired us in our own states and the planks in our platform are strong and they are good for America .
It ’s all about free enterprise and respecting the … BLITZER : Does that mean you want to come up with a new Sarah Palin initiative that you want to release right now .
PALIN : Gah !
Nothing specific right now .
Sitting here in these chairs that I ’m going to be proposing but in working with these governors who again on the front lines are forced to and it ’s our privileged obligation to find solutions to the challenges facing our own states every day being held accountable , not being just one of many just casting votes or voting present every once in a while , we do n’t get away with that .
We have to balance budgets and we ’re dealing with multibillion dollar budgets and tens of thousands of employees in our organizations .
Should I laugh or should I cry ?
I think it depends on whether Palin disappears back into well - earned obscurity over the next few months .

HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS VACCINE FRAUD
By Dr. James Howenstine , MD .
November 3 , 2008
NewsWithViews.com
For several years the pharmaceutical firm has made aggressive efforts to market the Gardasil human papilloma virus vaccine as a prevention for cervical cancer .
The governor of the state of Texas made the administration of this vaccine to young girls mandatory .
What is the truth about this vaccine ?
Natural News reporter Mike Adams has uncovered some interesting facts about this vaccine .
The FDA has been aware since 2003 that Human Papillloma Virus [ 1 ] does not cause cervical cancer .
The Gardasil vaccine is unable to eradicate HPV virus from women who have been exposed to HPV ( nearly all sexually active women ) .
This makes vaccinating all young women in Texas against HPV virus a very questionable decision .
To make matters even worse it has now been learned that vaccinating women with Gardasil may actually increase the risk that those women harboring a benign cervical HPV viral infection have a 44.6 percent increased risk of having their benign HPV infection converted into a precancerous state by the HPV vaccine administration .
Thus women vaccinated with Gardasil not only receive no benefit those who were sexually active before the vaccine administration have become at increased risk for developing cervical cancer .
To summarize some of the facts about HPV and this vaccine :
• HPV vaccine increases the risk of developing a precancerous cervical lesion by 44.6 % in women . previously infected with a HPV viral type found in the vaccine .
• HPV virus does not cause cervical cancer .
• HPV viral infections are self limiting and are not a health threat to healthy females .
• This valuable information about the etiology of HPV viral infections has been suppressed from public knowledge .
• Allowing untruths about Gardasil to be disseminated in public hearings and planting fear have been used to promote sales of this worthless vaccine .
The Evidence for the Gardasil Fraud
HiFi DNA
Tech was involved in manufacturing a portable device for testing for HPV viral infection .
This company , to improve sales , needed to have their product reclassified as Class II instead of Class III because Class III category products are not able to be sold to the public whereas Class II products can be sold to the public because they are deemed safe enough for public release .
For 20 years the FDA had classified the HPV test as a test for cervical cancer .
In 2003 the FDA changed its position advising that HPV virus was not associated with cervical cancer .
On Oct12 , 2007 HiFi DNA
Tech sued the FDA to get their testing device reclassified as Class II based on the knowledge that cervical cancer was not caused by HPV infection .
and therefore did not need to be restricted from public sales .
The fact that the FDA had already acknowledged in a policy statement on March 31 , 2003 that “ most infections by HPV are shortlived and not associated with cervical cancer .
Most women who become infected with HPV are able to eradicate the virus and suffer no apparent long term consequences to their health . ”
It is not the HPV virus itself that causes cervical cancer but rather a persistent state of ill health on the part of the patient that makes her vulnerable to cervical cancer .
Repeated transient HPV infections even when caused by high risk types of HPVs are characteristically not associated with an increased risk of developing squamous intraepithelial lesions , the precursor lesion of cervical cancer .
This was not revealed when the public hearings over the need for mandatory HPV vaccinations was pushed by manufacturer of Gardasil .
The FDA had known for many years that HPV was unrelated to cervical cancer but to have this knowledge disseminated during the hearings would have instantly made the HPV vaccine worthless .
The main push from the drug company has been that we “ must save these young girls from losing their lives to cervical cancers . ”
The FDA knew when these hearings were held that this argument was phony but said nothing .!!!
Does the HPV Vaccine Actually Increase the Risk of Cervical Cancer ?
Gardasil vaccine actually increases the risk for a sexually active woman to develop cervical cancer ( nearly all sexually active women have been exposed to HPV virus ) .
Women who have already been exposed to HPV from sexual activity and have positive serologies for HPV viral types found in the HPV vaccine have a 44.6 % increased risk [ 2 ] for developing high grade precancerous cervical lesions after they have received Gardasil vaccine injections .
This means that young women carrying a harmless form of HPV viral infection often get converted after HPV vaccine , into a more dangerous precancerous cervical condition .
that can lead to cervical cancer .
These patients were made worse by exposure to a vaccine that contained a virus that had already infected them .
Thus this evidence reveals that Gardasil increases disease in 44.6 % of patients who already been exposed to the same serotype found in the vaccine .
This strongly suggests that sexually active women can become more likely to develop cervical cancer after taking Gardasil vaccine .
This information puts the state of Texas in the position where theoretically the Gardasil should be given only to young females who are virgins ( sexually active females have existing HPV infections that may become more dangerous if given the vaccine ) .
Questioning these young women about sexual activity may lead to sexually active girls denying sexual activity in the presence of parents or physician thus leading to HPV viral administration to a female with previous HPV infection who does have an increased risk of developing pre-invasive cervical lesions because of exposure to the vaccine .
Thus females denying sexual activity will have an increased risk of getting pre-cancerous cervical lesions which can lead to cervical cancer .
To make this situation even worse the health officials that will be involved in screening candidates for HPV vaccine are heavily involved in promoting vaccine administration ( They almost certainly have no idea the vaccine is worthless and capable of causing precancerous cervical lesions ) .
Therefore the truth about the danger of cervical cancer resulting from the vaccine given to sexually active girls will not be given to these young women .
This will probably cause an unnecessary increase in cervical cancer .
The FDA Is A Badly Flawed Agency
The FDA is administered by 12 officials .
Three of these 12 persons are automatic appointments given to the pharmaceutical industry .
If there ever was a situation where the fox is in charge of the chicken house this is it .
It is common knowledge among these 9 selected officials that if they play ball with the drug industry they will be moved up to high paying positions with drug companies for their final working years .
Very few appointed officials will have the character , with these temptations placed in front of them , .to make honest decisions .
One can be certain that no one who had a healthy skepticism about the pharmaceutical industry would ever get appointed to the FDA .

It needs to be understood by the general public that the FDA is an effective arm of the pharmaceutical industry and has nothing at all to do with public health .
Anyone who doubts this statement need only look at the record of scams condoned by the FDA :
1 - The original director of the FDA , Dr. Harvey W. Wiley , resigned in disgust when he realized in 1912 that pressure from the food and pharmaceutical industries was preventing him from abolishing nutritionally worthless white flour .
2 - Flouride was added to the water in both Germany under Adolf Hitler and Russia under Josef Stalin to keep the populace “ dumbed down and easy to control . ”
There is scientific evidence that fluoride actually increases cavity formation [ 3 ] so the cover story about the virtue of fluoride decreasing cavity formation is fraud .
Most US cities place fluoride in their water and this does increase the incidence of cancer by 10 % when compared to cities not using fluoride in their water .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has classified fluoride as more toxic than lead but less toxic than arsenic .
U.S. Congressmen placed spring water in their offices when faced with the danger they might be forced to drink fluoride containing water .
3 - Aspartame excites and kills neurons along with causing seizures ..
This toxic substance is now found in most packaged foods and beverages .
Aspartame causes neurologic symptoms that mimic Multiple Sclerosis and brain tumors .
These symptoms disappear when aspartame intake ceases .
FDA approval for this dangerous substance was obtained despite some serious health concerns .
by responsible health oriented experts .
4 - Monosodium glutamate MSG ( Accent ) is an excitogen that increases the appetite leading to repeat food sales and weight gain .
This substance is added to a multitude of foods with no labeling .
MSG causes Chinese Restaurant Syndrome , mimics neurologic diseases ( M.S. , . A , L.S. , Parkinson ’s Disease , headaches , and seizures ) , hypoglycemia , learning disorders , hyperactivity , and Attention Deficit Disorder
5 - Nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium fertilizer has made North American soil the poorest of all the seven continents .
Poor quality foods grown from these depleted soils obviously damage the health and mental capability of the unfortunate citizens living in North America .
This fertilizer was approved over strenuous objections by knowledgeable academic agricultural experts .
Much US soil no longer contains the critical element selenium ( cancer risk increases , infections spread ) .
6 - Genetically modified food has never before been consumed by humans .
World famous geneticist Dr. Mae - Wan
Ho states that “ insertion of foreign genes into the human gene pool has long been known to have many harmful effects including cancer in the recipient organism ”
The results of safety testing on GMO foods have never been released to authorities and the FDA does not require GMO foods to be labeled so the public is unable to avoid eating these dangerous foods ..
7 - Salk polio vaccine was given to 10,000,000 persons even though FDA leaders knew that the vaccine contained Simian Virus 40 and other dangerous viruses which can cause leukemia , lymphoma , HIV and other significant health problems .
Sloppy animal isolation techniques . were the probable cause for this problem .
The whistle blower was admonished for discovering this important contamination because “ it was beyond the scope of her job description . ”
Read Dr. Howenstine 's book , " The Physician 's Guide to Natural Health Products , That Work "
8 - Federally mandated nitrogen , phosphorus and potassium fertilizer has resulted in making North American soil the most depleted soil of the 7 continents tested .
The critical elements selenium and sulfur are now missing from large amounts of U.S. soil .
9 - Codex Alimentaris , now implemented in parts of Europe ( Norway , Germany ) , will probably soon become law in the USA .
This will change valuable nutrients like vitamin C , alpha lipoic acid , and CoQ 10 into drugs requiring prescriptions which will raise the cost of these valuable substances .
This impending lack of less expensive supplements will damage the health of the American people .
Supplement makers may be forced to sell . their companies to take it or leave it type pharmaceutical company offers .
10 - Vaccines cause major health problems ( autism , 4000 deaths in children admitted in the first year of Hepatitis B vaccine {only 10 % of adverse reactions get reported .
etc.} .
Pharmaceutical firms have been exempted from lawsuits by Congress for vaccine damages which are common .
Health problems created by a malfunctioning FDA are wonderful for the pharmaceutical industry because they increase the sale of drugs .

The drug company involved in the sale of Gardasil is caught in a torrent of lawsuits caused by the failure to warn the public that a widely used arthritis drug they had marketed was known to commonly cause deaths from heart attacks .
This company has a sordid history of price fixing , tax avoidance , biopiracy , collusion with the FDA on how to discredit critics , purchasing negative evidence for its drugs and other activities that could be considered criminal in nature .
Their product Gardasil should obviously never be given to any woman .
General Barry McCaffrey , who served as “ drug czar ” under President Bill Clinton from 1996 to 2001 , was asked about marijuana legalization at a February 23 panel discussion of the Council on Foreign Relations .
The panel ’s focus was primarily on US / Mexican relations , particularly during this period of intense prohibition - related violence .
McCaffrey indicated that – now that he has left public life – he could admit that he did not care about adult marijuana use .
McCaffrey told the panel ,
There ’s a 10 - minute answer , there ’s an hour answer , there ’s a three - day answer .
And , fortunately , since I ’m not in public life , I actually do n’t care .
I care about 6th graders through 12th graders .
If you ’re 40 years old , and you ’re living in Oregon , and you have 12 giant pot plants in the back of your log cabin , knock yourself out .
The admission prompted outrage from prominent reformers in Canada who have long seen US policy as a major obstacle to domestic changes .
“ General McCaffrey is a hypocrite , ” says Marc Emery , Leader of the British Columbia Marijuana Party .
“ Under his watch , America arrested millions of peaceful marijuana users , opposed states that enacted medical marijuana reforms and pressured Canada to not decriminalize marijuana .
And now that he ’s not getting a paycheck , he admits he does n’t care ?
It ’s outrageous . ”
Kirk Tousaw , a Vancouver criminal defense lawyer that recently succeeded in having portions of Canada ’s medical marijuana regime stricken as unconstitutional , had mixed feelings .
“ I , of course , feel for the millions of people whose lives have been harmed by cannabis prohibition , ” says Tousaw , “ but I am glad that General McCaffrey understands that adult marijuana use should not be a matter of criminal law .
I just wish that more people , especially those who are in active public life , had the courage to admit that change is urgently needed . ”

In the Likud : Rookie MK Akunis visits the Shomron ( Samaria ) and declares , “ The concept of two states is no longer realistic . ”
The party 's Knesset faction unanimously backs Ruby Rivlin as next Knesset Speaker .
MK Akunis visited the Shomron as a guest of Shomron Regional Council Chairman Gershon Mesika on Sunday , as part of a local initiative to have new and veteran MKs get to know the area .
Akunis is not considered particularly hawkish in his views , and was behind the legal machinations that moved Likud candidate and Jewish Leadership faction leader Moshe Feiglin down from # 20 on the Likud list to # 36 .
Despite this , he expressed views that Land of Israel supporters could appreciate .
“ The concept of two states is no longer realistic , ” he said , “ after it has been proven that wherever Israel retreats , that place becomes a base for terrorism .
We especially saw that in Gaza after the Disengagement . ”
“ In order to promote real peace , ” Akunis continued , “ we have to think of more creative solutions , by which the Palestinians will run their own lives , without detracting from Israel ’s security interests . ”
This is largely an echo of Binyamin Netanyahu ’s opinions .
Akunis served as his press aide in the past , and is closely allied with the Prime Minister - designate .
More Construction
MK Akunis said he supports continued development of the Jewish towns in Judea and Samaria , including construction that will meet the needs of the growing population .
“ First and foremost , ” he said , “ the building of new kindergartens must be renewed . ”
MK Yuli Edelstein of the Likud toured the area last week .
Some 20 MKs have visited the Shomron as Mesika ’s guests in recent weeks , coming away with renewed appreciation – and expressions of support – for the settlement enterprise in Judea and Samaria .
Likud Unanimously Chooses Rivlin
In other Likud news , the party ’ s Knesset faction unanimously approved on Monday the choice of MK Ruby Rivlin as the Likud candidate for Speaker of the Knesset .
The election by the full Knesset body will be held within a week or two , but Rivlin ’s election is virtually assured , as the entire coalition – and his many admirers in the Opposition – will certainly vote for him .
Rivlin served as Speaker in the 16th Knesset , from 2003 until 2006 , and won wide acclaim for his performance .
He voted against the Disengagement , and often criticized Ariel Sharon for the plan .
SYDNEY , Australia ( JTA ) — Australia said it will boycott the Durban II anti-racism conference unless the heavily anti-Israel conference draft document is changed .
Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said in federal parliament March 12 that Australia would join Israel , Canada , the United States and Italy in withdrawing from the United Nations - sponsored conference pending a revision of the text of the draft documents for next month ’s conference in Geneva .
“ If we form the view that the text is going to lead to nothing more than an anti-Jewish , anti-Semitic harangue and an anti-Jewish propaganda exercise , Australia will not be in attendance , ” Smith said .
“ We will give the working group every opportunity to revise the text in a qualitatively improved way to ensure that that does not happen , and we will make our judgment at a time of our choosing when we have given all nation - states concerned the opportunity to add qualitatively to the text to enable it to form the proper basis of debate at the conference , " he said .
Numerous Jewish representatives have lobbied the federal government to boycott the April 20 - 24 conference , which they fear will be a reprise of the U.N. World Conference against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance that took place in 2001 in Durban , South Africa .
Israel and the United States walked out of the conference , which they criticized as an anti-Israel hate fest .

A face you can trust
Princeton psychologists recently showed that certain faces , even when expressionless , strike people as trustworthy or untrustworthy .
Features like the shape of the eyebrow are part of an unconscious language of trust that powerfully affects human interaction .
By By Paul Wallis Feb 12 , 2009 in Crime
If you consider the huge layoffs in recent months , the fact that a lot of people are taking corporate information with them is scary enough .
This information is buying new jobs in a murderous employment market .
It 's also opening up a new crime wave .
A new report called Unsecured Economies presented to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland is n’t doing much for the peace of mind of global economies .
The international study found the 800 companies reported losing an average of $ US4.6 million ( $ 7 million ) worth of intellectual property last year .
Globally , that would generate total losses of $ US1 trillion , and staff were cited as a major cause .
" Forty - two per cent [ of companies ] said laid - off employees were the single biggest threat to their intellectual property and other sensitive data , " says the report , commissioned by computer security firm McAfee .
Much nastier , there ’s a very ready market for stolen data .
There are potential security and criminal threats which go hand in hand with what is potentially a whole new global black market on the rise .
According to McAfee Australia , the security firm is seeing 3000 - 4000 new pieces of malware per day .
Last year , a total of 2 million forms of malware were identified by anti virus companies .
There ’s a very big additional problem with this situation .
The malware designers had to try to steal the data , working with the possibilities of cracking security processes .
That ’s been a problem , but the malware has n’t been too effective overall .
Now , with stolen data , the designers of malware can work directly on existing codes , systems and security .
Sensitive information is worth big money , and there is no way that criminal groups will miss the chance to make millions out of the opportunities created by stolen data .
On the other side of the issue is the fact that the layoffs are guaranteed to create motivated thieves among people who ’ve lost their homes , jobs , and careers .
As an ethical question , theft may be wrong , but so ’s poverty .
There ’s also a big cultural wound here as a result of the thunderous fall of America ’s rotting Mammon .
Previously , data theft was pretty minimal , a steady drip .
Now it ’s a flood tide .
The meltdown 's fundamental insanity has created another social disaster .
The perception for years has been that ethics did n’t mean much if anything to the executive class .
So nobody ’s likely to be too concerned about the amount of damage stolen data will do to the corporations cutting jobs .
The obvious result is that stealing data is fair game , and fair payback for wrecking people ’s lives .
Unfortunately , the corporate world is also the big employer and business generator .
Its profitability is the safe deposit box for a lot of workers ’ nest egg investments .
Stolen information can do a lot of damage to businesses .
It can neutralize the value of intellectual property , destroy business security , and crash companies .
In America 's case , intellectual property and business information is also a major cash crop .
Loss of these things will hit the bottom line of a lot of major American institutions .
That will also hit the US economy , and hit some of the surviving industrial income earners .
Stealing information from the big US computer companies alone , by definition , means billions .
So the stolen data can turn into an own goal , however richly deserving of payback the employers laying off millions of people may be .
That ’s not likely to be much of a concern to the criminal element , however .
The stolen data is valued at a trillion dollars , and that ’s just the identified amount of information known to have been stolen .
Stolen data could be worth more than the drug trade , slavery , people smuggling , and every other form of criminal business combined .
So far , the total failure of the market culture has destroyed global trade , obliterated millions of jobs , annihilated the credit markets , and now , it ’s creating trillion dollar business opportunities for organized crime , all in less than two years .
Anyone like to let off a few thousand nuclear warheads so they can make a few bucks on the advertising ?
Thanks again , Wall Street .
Just when you think the meltdown could n’t get any more destructive , here ’s a little number that should have people moving to other planets if they have to walk .

GOZ BEIDA , Chad
So I ’m bunking with George Clooney in a little room in a guest house here in eastern Chad , near Darfur in Sudan .
We each have a mattress on the floor , the “ shower ” is a rubber hose that does n’t actually produce any water , and George ’s side of the room has a big splotch of something that sure looks like blood .
He ’s using me to learn more about Darfur , and I ’m using him to ease you into a column about genocide .
Manipulation all around  and , luckily , neither of us snores .
( But stay tuned to this series for salacious gossip if he talks in his sleep . )
The slaughter in Darfur has continued for six years largely because world leaders have been complacent and preoccupied .
In the coming weeks , the International Criminal Court is expected to issue an arrest warrant for Sudan ’s president , Omar Hassan al - Bashir , for orchestrating the killings  and that will give the world a new opportunity to end the slaughter .
But to seize that opportunity , world leaders will have to summon some of the same moral courage that Darfuris show all the time .

China has expressed support for Russia ’s proposal to hand the IMF the power to create a new supra-national global currency in response to the call for an alternative to the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency .
Last week the Kremlin called for the “ creation of a supranational reserve currency to be issued by international institutions as part of a reform of the global financial system . ”
The Russian proposal stated that the IMF should take the lead in establishing a “ superreserve currency accepted by the whole of the international community . ”
China today expressed support for the initiative and said it was ready to discuss the proposal at the upcoming G20 meeting in London on April 2 .
Hu Xiaolian , vice governor of the country ’s Central Bank , said that China , which holds about $ 2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves , was prepared to debate the issue as “ the dollar ’s dominance and U.S. economic woes could entail considerable currency fluctuations and affect the world financial situation , ” reports RIA Novosti .
The creation of a new supra-national global reserve currency to supplant the U.S. dollar would likely lead to a complete collapse of the greenback , of which trillions are held in in foreign exchange reserves by foreign countries such as China and Japan .
As we have previously highlighted , the elite have exploited the problem that they created to push for increased regulation of the world economic system in the pursuit of a de-facto global financial dictatorship .
[ efoods ]
The swift and ruthless exploitation of the economic meltdown on behalf of globalists and central banks revolves around their drive to move towards a one world currency system and an unprecedented centralization of global financial power , a fact that financial analysts are finally beginning to realize .
Earlier this month , Ben Bernanke told an elite gathering at the Council on Foreign Relations that a new overarching financial authority should be created and empowered with sweeping new regulatory responsibilities .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , EU heads such as Joaquin Almunia and establishment media outlets like the Wall Street Journal amongst many others have all continually used the economic crisis as an excuse to argue for greater financial power , a “ new world economic order ” in which control is concentrated into fewer hands – with the IMF and the World Bank enjoying the spoils .
UK Business Secretary and top Bilderberg member Peter Mandelson has also pushed for a “ Bretton Woods for this century , ” to help build the “ machinery of global economic governance ” .
Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy all made the same appeal at a conference in Paris on the future of capitalism earlier this year .
Merkel called for the creation of a new global economic body under the UN , similar to the Security Council , to judge government policy .
Sarkozy called for a “ new world , new capitalism ” during his speech , as he commented “ In capitalism of the 21st century , there is room for the state . ”
Meanwhile , Blair called for a new financial order which he said should be constructed upon “ values other than the maximum short - term profit . ”
The globalists ’ call for a centralized global economic order has nothing to do with providing solutions to the crisis but everything to do with providing themselves with more power and control over the world ’s financial system .

El idioma español sigue ganando terreno .
En el más reciente informe del Ministerio de Educación de España se dice que el interés y la demanda por la lengua española en la República Checa continúa aumentado .
Se trata de la única lengua extranjera que presenta un crecimiento anual en número de alumnos en la enseñanza secundaria .
Se trata de la única lengua extranjera que presenta un crecimiento anual en número de alumnos en la enseñanza secundaria .
Q : ¿ Existen en la República Checa buenas condiciones para impartir clases de español , me refiero a si existe una infraestructura amplia , si hay suficientes profesores ?
“ Eso es un problema , por me lo pregunta supongo .
La infraestructura , es decir los estudios universitarios para los futuros profesores no son tan buenos como podrían o deberían ser , para responder al auge que existe ahora , es decir que hay pocos estudios , en la Universidad donde se puedan preparar los futuros profesores .
En Praga , por ejemplo , en la Facultad de Pedagogía , creo que no existe la posibilidad de estudiar el español como preparación para la carrera de un profesor .
Entonces hay pocos profesores con cualificación universitaria que dan clases de español , y eso es un gran problema ” .

There 's an article in Spanish here from Radio Praha on the growth of Spanish - language education in the Czech Republic , with some parts translated by me .
The Spanish language is gaining ground .
The most recent information from the Ministry of Education of Spain says that interest and demand for the Spanish language in the Czech Republic is continuing to grow .
It is the only foreign language that has shown an annual growth in the number of secondary students learning it .
and : Are there good conditions in the Czech Republic for teaching Spanish classes , that is , is there enough infrastructure , are there enough teachers ?
" That 's a problem if you ask me .
Infrastructure , that is university studies for future teachers , are not as good as they should be in order to meet the boom that exists now .
There are few studies in the University where one prepares future teachers .
In Prague for example in the Faculty of Pedagogy , I do n't believe there is the possibility of studying Spanish as preparation for a career as a teacher .
Then there are few teachers with university qualifications giving Spanish classes , and that 's a big problem .
"
The article then gives the following numbers for languages studied in the Czech Republic :
The large numbers for German and Russian ( normally you do n't see Russian students outranking those learning Spanish ) are easy to understand of course .
The Czech Republic is bordered by Germany and Austria : and Russian is a Slavic language as is Czech , making it fairly easy to learn compared to others with a different linguistic background .
Here 's a comparison of the two languages from the Czech Wikipedia ( the beginning of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ) : Russian ( written in the Latin alphabet ) : Czech :

The reductions force some families to apply for welfare for the first time , while others become increasingly dependent on food stamps or risk eviction when they come up short on rent .
“ In many cases , it ’s devastating , ” said C. A. Watts , the director of the district attorney ’s family support division for Clark County .
“ Some of the parents absolutely depend on that money coming in .
It ’s a domino effect .
The custodians need the money to feed and clothe the children .
If the money stops , it puts a burden on the custodial parent , and they have to come up with funds another way .
They ’re not going to let their children starve . ”
The amount of child support varies based on individual family circumstances , but New York State begins with these guidelines : A noncustodial parent generally pays 17 percent of gross income for one child , 25 percent for two children and up to 35 percent for five or more children , as well as a share of child care , medical and education expenses .
“ We see everything , ” said Peter Passidomo , chief of the state ’s 125 support magistrates .
“ High income , low income , across the board .
It ’s just like in an intact family where the income earner has lost the job . ”
Though Family Court in New York is open to the news media , names of the parties are typically not revealed .
Judge Troy , who has been a Family Court judge since 1999 , said that in recent weeks he had seen a former Lehman Brothers executive whose $ 7 million in stock had disappeared , leaving him unable to pay his child support .
And then there was the divorced couple whose combined income had surpassed $ 400,000  until they both lost their jobs and were scrambling to figure out how to pay two private - school tuitions on roughly $ 800 a week in unemployment benefits .
Most , though , are more like the man who went from a decent - paying factory job to working in food service during Mets games in Queens .
Judge
Troy lowered his monthly payment for his three teenagers to $ 50 per month , from $ 686 .
Otherwise , he feared , the father would be unable to meet his obligation and face a more drastic punishment : jail .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Israel is involved in a covert war of sabotage inside Iran to try to delay Tehran ’s alleged attempts to develop a nuclear weapon , a British newspaper said on Tuesday , quoting a former CIA agent and intelligence experts .

REUTERS / Caren Firouz
An intelligence source in the Middle East told Reuters last year Israel planned to target Iranian nuclear scientists with letter bombs and poisoned packages and had set off explosions in Iran .
Analysts offered similar accounts and said such tactics would be credible , but no confirmation has been available .
Some analysts caution that reports of such a “ dirty war ” may form part of a psychological warfare campaign to unsettle Iran .
The intelligence source told Reuters that Israeli agents were working with Western governments and firms doing business with Tehran , whose Islamist leadership is a sworn enemy of Israel but denies accusations its nuclear program has a military purpose .
Israel ’s government , widely assumed to be the only nuclear power in the Middle East , declines all comment on such reports .
“ Israel has launched a covert war against Iran as an alternative to direct military strikes against Tehran ’s nuclear program , ” Britain ’s Daily Telegraph said on Tuesday .
“ It is using hitmen , sabotage , front companies and double agents to disrupt the regime ’s illicit weapons project , the experts say . ”
Quoting intelligence experts and an unnamed former CIA agent , the newspaper said Israel ’s “ decapitation ” strategy had targeted members of Iran ’s atomic program , hoping to set back the country ’s nuclear ambitions without resorting to war .
“ SABOTAGE GOING ON ”
Meir Javendafar , an Iran expert at Meepas , a Middle East analysis group , told Reuters there were also reports Iran was being sold faulty equipment for its nuclear program , and that there were attempts to disrupt the electricity supply to Natanz , a uranium enrichment facility in central Iran .
“ I think there is sabotage going on .
It ’s a logical move and it makes sense in the game that is part of the overall struggle to disrupt Iran ’s nuclear ambitions , ” he said .
As evidence of Israel ’s reported strategy , Iran watchers have pointed to events such as the death of Ardeshire Hassanpour , a nuclear scientist at the Isfahan uranium plant who died at home from apparent gas poisoning in 2007 .
The former CIA agent told the Telegraph : “ Disruption is designed to slow progress on the program , done in such a way they do n’t realize what ’s happening .
The goal is delay , delay , delay until you can come up with some other solution .
“ It ’s a good policy , short of taking them out militarily , which probably carries unacceptable risks . ”
Asked about the newspaper report , Mark Regev , a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , told Reuters : “ It is not our practice to comment publicly about these sorts of allegations , not in this situation , not in any situation . ”
New U.S. President Barack Obama has taken a more diplomatic line with Tehran , quietening former Bush administration talk of a possible military strike against Iranian nuclear assets .
Israeli leaders have been careful not to rule out their military options , though analysts question how far a new Israeli government , still to be formed after last week ’s parliamentary election , will be prepared to act without Washington ’s backing .
Javendafar said there were indications several states were attempting to infiltrate Iran to disrupt nuclear development but also suggested much of the reported clandestine activity was more part of a psychological war than an actual one of sabotage .
“ Numerous intelligence agencies are trying their best to do this .
Not just Israel , but the Americans and many European spy agencies , ” he said .
“ If it ’s true , then it ’s putting pressure on the Iranian program technically .
“ Even if there ’s no truth to it , it ’s part of what is a massive psychological war against Iran ’s nuclear program ...
It ’s ... much more affordable than sabotaging equipment . ”

Die Zahl der Religiösen schwindet , aber bevor die Nichtreligiösen die Mehrheit bildet , wächst die Zahl der " fuzzy " Christen , für die Religion kaum mehr eine Rolle spielt
Mit leichten Schwankungen und regionalen Unterschieden sinkt in Europa der Hang zum Glauben von Generation zu Generation .
Dabei spielen vermutlich aktive Aufklärung und Entzauberung eine geringere Rolle , viel stärker dürfte durchschlagen , dass der religiöse Glaube einfach an Bindungskraft verliert .
Schließlich sind die meisten Menschen keine bekennenden Atheisten oder Religionsgegner , sondern Lauwarme , die sich die Entscheidung offenhalten wollen , aber bereits von der Religion Abschied nehmen .
Der Populationswissenschaftler David Voas vom Institute for Social Change an der University of Manchester ist nach einer Auswertung einer europäischen Studie zum Ergebnis gekommen , dass die Mehrzahl der Europäer einem vagen , unbestimmten Glauben : einer " fuzzy fidelity " , anhängt .
In der Forschung ist umstritten , ob es in Europa ein einheitliches Muster für die Entwicklung der Religiosität gibt oder ob Säkularisierung und Festhalten am Glauben sich regional erheblich unterscheiden .
Nach Voas , der für seine in der Zeitschrift European Sociological Review erschienenen Studie die 2002/2003 in 20 Ländern erhobenen Daten des European Social Survey ( ESS ) ausgewertet hat , finden sich zwar leichte Unterschiede im Hinblick auf die Geschwindigkeit , in der der religiöse Glaube zurückgeht , aber seit einem Jahrhundert sei dieser in allen Ländern ziemlich konstant und vollziehe sich Schritt für Schritt mit jeder neuen Generation .
Deutlich wird der Niedergang des Glaubens , wenn man die Haltung der Menschen durch jeweils 5 Jahre umfassende Altersgruppen , beginnend mit dem Geburtsjahr 1920 , darstellt .
Auch wenn das Ausmaß der Religiosität beim Ausgangspunkt unterschiedlich ist , findet eine parallele Abnahme von Altersgruppe zu Altersgruppe statt .
Auffällig ist , dass es meist eine nach unten gehende Zickzackbewegung ist , also dass nach einem steilen Abfall einer Altersgruppe die Religiosität bei der nächsten wieder relativ ansteigt , um dann weiter abzufallen .
Bei den Menschen , die in stärker religiösen Ländern , vor allem den vom Katholizismus geprägten , leben , ist der Rückgang stärker , in den von vorneherein geringer religiösen schwächer , weil hier die Säkularisierung sowieso schon weiter fortgeschritten war .
In aller Regel sind die jüngeren Menschen weniger religiös als der Durchschnitt , nur Polen und Griechenland weichen hiervon ab .
Dass die Menschen , wie es manchmal heißt , mit zunehmendem
Alter wieder religiöser werden , gehe aus den Daten nicht hervor .
Zudem werde die pro Generation sinkende Religiosität durch Umfragen bestätigt , die in den letzten 30 Jahren in allen Ländern einen erheblichen Rückgang der Kirchenbesuche belegt haben .
Der Niedergang betrifft den konventionellen christlichen Glauben – nicht den muslimischen - , was aber nicht heißt , dass die Atheisten und Ungläubigen entsprechend stark zunehmen .
Die Mehrzahl der Menschen gehe nicht regelmäßig in die Kirche , aber es sind auch keine bewusst nichtreligiösen Menschen .
Man hält an einem diffusen Glauben fest , heiratet vielleicht auch in der Kirche , nimmt an kirchlichen Begräbnissen teil und bekennt sich auch oft zu den christlichen Werten , ohne darauf aber wirklich
Wert zu legen .
Irgendwie will man nicht ganz von Tradition und Zugehörigkeit zu einer Religion lassen , was Voas eben als " fuzzy fidelity " fasst .
Viele glauben noch irgendwie an etwas , der Glaube etwa an ein höheres Wesen oder an ein Nachleben hat aber wenig mehr mit einer religiösen Doktrin zu tun .
Manchen bezeichnen sich noch als Christen , auch wenn sie nur wenige oder keine christlichen Überzeugungen mehr vertreten .
Die Hälfte der Europäer , so Voas , seien lediglich nominelle Christen , d.h. sie bezeichnen sich als Christen , sind aber eigentlich nicht religiös .
Sie wurden getauft , waren als Kinder in der Kirche , wissen nicht , ob Gott existiert , der jedenfalls in ihrem Leben keine Rolle spielt .
Eine andere Gruppe stellen die " ethnischen Nominalisten " dar , die sich nur deswegen als Christen bezeichnen , um sich von Menschen einer anderen Kultur oder Religion zu unterscheiden , ohne selbst wirklich religiös zu sein .
Und eine dritte Gruppe sieht Voas noch , die sich meist als zugehörig zu einem Glauben bezeichnen , weil sie dadurch einen bestimmten sozialen Status erlangen wollen .
Für die große Mehrheit der Bevölkerung ist Religion unwichtig .
Nur in den religiösesten Ländern ( Griechenland , Polen , Irland , Italien und teilweise Portugal ) sagt gerade einmal ein Viertel der Bevölkerung , dass Religion für sie persönlich eher wichtig als unwichtig ist .
Als Trend für die letzten 200 Jahre seit Beginn der Säkularisierung sei zu beobachten , dass die Zahl der Religiösen schneller fällt , als die der Nichtreligiösen zunimmt , die weiter eine Minorität bleiben .
Dafür hat der Anteil derjenigen zunächst zugenommen , die " fuzzy " christlich sind .
Seit einigen Jahrzehnten nimmt aber auch dieser Anteil in den meisten Ländern ab , während die Zahl der Nichtreligiösen allmählich weiter wächst .
Der jeweilige Trend in diesen drei Gruppen kann in den einzelnen Ländern aber unterschiedlich sein .
So sind in Frankreich die Nichtreligiösen auf Kosten der " fuzzy " Christen gewachsen , während die Religiösen nur leicht weniger wurden .
In Dänemark gibt es beispielsweise mehr " fuzzy " Christen als in jedem anderen Land .
In Griechenland oder Italien werden die Religiösen weniger und die " fuzzy " Christen mehr , die Nichtreligiösen werden aber nur sehr langsam mehr .
In Deutschland hält sich der Anteil der " fuzzy " Christen bei über 40 Prozent mit Schwankungen seit Jahrzehnten ziemlich konstant .
Die Religiösen sind seit 1920 von knapp über 40 Prozent auf unter 20 Prozent gesunken , die Nichtreligiösen von 10 Prozent kontinuierlich auf jetzt fast 40 Prozent gewachsen .
Der Trend geht nach Voas dahin , dass dann , wenn in einem Land die Zahl der Nichtreligiösen die der Religiösen übertrifft , der Anteil der " fuzzy " Christen nicht mehr wächst , sondern auch allmählich abnimmt , wie dies in Frankreich , Schweder , Norwegen , Ungarn oder Tschechien bereits der Fall ist .
Letztlich werden dann die Nichtreligiösen die Mehrheit stellen und weiter zunehmen .
Die " fuzzy " Religiösen , auch wenn hier Unentschiedenheit vorherrscht und neue Religiosität erwachen kann , bilden einen Übergang und sind " ein Schritt auf dem Weg von der religiösen zur säkularen Vorherrschaft " .

BBC News , Baghdad
Her husband and three brothers were killed .
Her parents were already dead .
Her house was burnt down .
She was pregnant at the time and lost the baby .
But , in the months that followed , Nadia Hussein had to endure much more .
Now she lives at a refuge for women in the centre of Baghdad .
She spends her days feeding the pigeons and cooking .
It 's a place for her to escape the many dangers widows face in Iraq .
' Nephew beat me '
" After my husband died , I found work as a housekeeper , " she told me .
" A man and his brother tried to make advances on me .
They tried to sexually assault me .
I refused .
Nadia Hussein 's ordeal is an all too familiar story for Iraqi widows " My nephew , who is an alcoholic , also used to beat me and accuse me of bad things . "
Nadia said the people at the refuge were now her only family .
But she still asks for their approval before doing anything or going anywhere .
Her story is not particularly unusual .
Accurate figures are hard to obtain , but even before the invasion in 2003 , there were hundreds of thousands of widows in Iraq .
Many lost husbands in the Iran - Iraq war in the 1980s .
At the height of the violence of recent years , up to 100 women a day were becoming widows .
Almost everywhere you go in Baghdad , you can see them begging at traffic lights and outside mosques - dressed from head to toe in black .
The women are supposed to be given just over $ 1 ( £ 0.70 ) a day from the government .
But a survey by the charity Oxfam has discovered that less than a quarter actually get the money .
' Will of God ' Many face physical and sexual abuse .
Some are told to marry men who already have wives .
My husband always wanted me to be a suicide bomber
Umm Harith Shia tradition also permits " temporary marriages " - which only last for a matter of days or weeks .
A few widows have themselves wanted to die violently - there have been many attacks by female suicide bombers .
Umm Harith was trained to carry one out but she backed away from going through with it .
" When my husband died I felt very isolated , " she said .
" He always wanted me to be a suicide bomber .
" When he was killed , I wanted to blow myself up .
I wanted to kill the people who took away the person who was most precious to me . "
Most of the widows we spoke to in Baghdad , though , do not seem to be interested in revenge .
They accept what has happened to them as the " will of God " .
Indeed those who campaign on their behalf say one of the hardest things is getting the widows to think that they deserve better lives .
" It 's not just about legislation , " said Hana Adwar , a campaigner for women 's rights .
" The problem is the way people behave inside the family .
The question is how to change attitudes and behaviour towards them . "
Nightclub dancers Improvements in security have led to some shady opportunities for those who have lost their husbands and income .
Nightclubs have started to reopen in Baghdad .
We visited one of them .
The scene would previously have been unthinkable .
It 's so difficult for women and girls to walk around freely - because of our traditions and our culture
Haifa Raheem
Men were sitting around drinking alcohol , listening to music and being entertained by women dancing .
Involvement in any of those activities a couple of years ago could have got you killed in Iraq .
I talk to the singer who works there .
He says women are employed just to dance and talk to the customers .
But he tells me there are many other nightclubs in Baghdad where widows will leave with men for the right price .
There are a few places in this city where the women can get help .
At one centre , they are being taught the skills they need to find jobs - like IT and nursing .
Many are illiterate , though , and jobs are hard to come by .
The support available is dwarfed by the scale of the problem .
Just 120 - of the many tens of thousands who lost husbands since 2003 - have been given somewhere to live at a trailer park on the outskirts of Baghdad .
Respect Haifa Raheem is one of them .
Inside her aluminium trailer , there is almost no furniture and just a few mats on the floor .
She lives here with her seven children and her mother .
The family is almost entirely dependent on handouts .
" It 's horribly hot in the summer , " she said .
" Staying here is better than nothing .
" But it 's so difficult for women and girls to walk around freely - because of our traditions and our culture . "
There 's talk of passing new laws , and finding extra money for the hundreds of thousands of widows .
But campaigners say what they need more than anything is more respect in Iraqi society .

At one point or another , most American presidents concern themselves with bringing peace to the Middle East .
Ultimately , all other foreign policy achievements pale in comparison .
It ’s the brass ring of presidential greatness , the elusive key to ensuring kind treatment in the eyes of history .
Such thinking must become particularly acute as presidents reach the twilight of their terms and begin in earnest the inevitable consideration of how they will be remembered .
Bill Clinton made a last - ditch effort late in his second term to become the great peacemaker .
He failed , as had all others before him .
But at least he tried .
For his part , our current outgoing commander in chief , just weeks away from relinquishing his office , has steadfastly refused to get involved even as Gaza disintegrates into violence .
Not that this should come as a surprise .
Bush ’s lack of engagement this late in the game , says the National Security Network , is nothing if not consistent with the rest of his term .
As the group describes in press release issued today :
[ Bush ’s ] episodic involvement has been muddled and without coherent vision : supporting Palestinian elections in 2006 , despite the very clear possibility that Hamas would win , then refusing to honor the results ; asserting that the ‘ road to Jerusalem ran through Baghdad ; ’ belatedly engaging through the Annapolis peace conference , which has proved to be too little too late .
Experts and regional actors with differing views on the road ahead share the belief that the US absence from the scene is counterproductive and harmful to the interests of all concerned .
The outbreak of war in Gaza confirms that after eight years in office the Bush administration will leave behind a region that is further from achieving a lasting peace than when it came to office .
A tough accusation to be sure , but one that enjoys support from an unlikely array of former diplomats and foreign policy specialists across the political spectrum .
Bush ’s own first - term ambassador to Israel , Daniel Kurtzer , acknowledges the administration ’s shortcomings .
“ The sum total is that if you measure Israeli security at the beginning of this administration and at the end of the administration , based on things the president either could have done , should have done or failed to do , the report card is pretty negative , ” he says .
Several other former US ambassadors to Israel , Egypt , Pakistan , Tunisia , Bahrain , and the United Arab Emirates , contributed to a policy paper ( .pdf ) released by the Israeli Policy Forum , which accuses the Bush administration ’s inaction of enabling the violence in Gaza and damaging the security interests of the United States :
During the past eight years , the United States has appeared to have no sense of urgency about ending the Arab - Israeli conflict …
The Bush administration did not pick up where Clinton left off , giving the impression that the United States was indifferent to the worsening conditions ( the second intifada ) on the ground in Israel and the Occupied Territories .
This seeming indifference helped turn public opinion against the United States throughout the Muslim world to the disadvantage of a myriad of U.S. interests .
Bush ’s apparent lack of interest has run the course of most of his days as president , but it was n’t always so .
Early in his first term , he claimed to have it together , to be the bearer of a new vision for the Middle East .
“ But in practice there was nothing visionary , innovative , or well thought - out , ” says Yoram Meital , head of the Center for Middle East Studies and Diplomacy at Ben Gurion University in Negev , Israel .
“ And as a consequence we have been driving full speed ahead on neutral for a very long time . ”
Unless , of course , you consider Iraq to have been Bush ’s roundabout method of changing things up .
Indeed , he once claimed “ the road to Jerusalem runs through Baghdad ” — a formulation that probably did n’t sit well with Arabs already sensitive to any suggestion of a modern Crusade .
And rather than clearing the path to the Holy Land , says Shlomo Brom , a former director of strategic planning for the Israel Defense Forces , the Iraq invasion actually caused damage to Israel by “ strengthening the radical elements in the Middle East . ”
While the Bush administration sits on the sidelines waiting out the clock , there are numerous diplomatic efforts underway to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza .
French President Nicholas Sarkozy , Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair have been shuttling around the region meeting with Arab leaders .
Russian President Dmitri Medvedev is working to organize a peace conference .
Indeed , the mantle of peacemaker does not only appeal to American presidents .
But based on Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ’s statement last week that she has no intention of traveling to the Middle East , there seems to be zero prospect of American involvement in brokering a ceasefire , at least until January 20 .
Then again , history would tell us not to hold our breaths .

Recycled paper can be made from old newspaper , following the instructions below .
Recycling paper uses cellulose ( plant fibers ) over and over again , it uses less electricity , less water , a lot less pollution , and it saves trees from being cut down !
You will need : a food processor or an old blender
an electric iron
an old wire hanger
an old pair of panty hose
newspaper or other paper , torn into 2 - inch squares
white glue
water
an insect screen or strainer ( optional )
food coloring ( optional )
a big sink or tub filled with 4 inches of water
Make sure you have a place to work where you can make a big mess !
Step One :
Make a frame out of the coat hanger .
You 'll need a frame for each piece of paper you make .
Stretch the hanger and bend it into a rectangle / square shape .
Take one leg of the panty hose and stretch it carefully over the hanger frame .
Make sure it is tight and flat .
Step Two :
Put a handful of the torn up paper and some water into the food processor or blender .
Blend the mixture on high until it becomes mushy .
Keep adding paper and water until you have a big gray blob .
You may have to add a little more water to keep things moving smoothly .
Keep the food processor on until all the paper has disappeared .
Then leave it on for 2 minutes .
For some color , add a handful of brown or red onion skin ( not the onion itself , just the papery outer skin ) .
Step Three :
Put 2 tablespoons of white glue in the sink water and add all of the paper pulp you just made .
Mix it really well .
Use your hands .
Step Four :
Scoop the frame to the bottom of the sink , then lift it slowly .
( Count to 20 slowly while you are lifting . )
Let the water drain out for about a minute .
Step Five :
Hang the frames on a clothesline or put them out in the sun .
Wait until they are completely dry with no dampness at all .
You can then gently peel off the paper .
Step Six :
Use the iron , set on the hottest setting , to steam out your paper .
You can keep making paper until the pulp is all strained out of the sink .
Mix up the sink every time you make a new piece .
Try other things like using in insect screen over a wood frame , or a strainer instead of the pantyhose and hanger .
Try adding lots of food coloring , for colored paper , or try adding lint or leaves to the food processor .
Your paper will have an interesting texture .
Making your own paper can be fun , and it's a great way to re-use old paper .
You can recycle all kinds of paper for re-use .
Sometimes paper printed from color - inkjet printers will run , that is , the color will bleed off and become part of your new paper , but that can make for an interesting effect !
Can Prions Be Epigenetic Regulators
In Humans ?
Prions first made their notorious media debut in the mid-1980 ’s when British cattle contracted Mad Cow disease .
As a result , over 150 people in Europe were infected and died from the human form known as Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease — a fatal neurological disorder with similar symptoms as Mad Cow .
Although prions are infectious agents with a bad reputation , research suggests that prions also play a role in epigenetic regulation .
Recently , a Nature Cell Biology study conducted by molecular biologists at the University of Illinois at Chicago , discovered a new prion in yeast that raises further questions about the biological role of prions in gene regulation .
Prions are most simply defined as misfolded infectious proteins .
Prion diseases or , “ Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies ” ( TSEs ) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders that occur in humans and other mammals .
The host prion protein ( PrP ) is the native precursor to the harmful prion conformation .
During prion pathogenesis , the initial native soluble form of the protein is converted to the insoluble amyloid conformation .
These amyloids form aggregates of fibrous proteins which eventually lead to amyloidosis — the cause of ataxic neurodegenerative symptoms .
As with viral and bacterial pathogens , prions are capable of replication .
However , they do so with no involvement of nucleic acids .
Prions instead , convert native forms of their corresponding protein into more prions .
Furthermore , prions come in different strains and even exhibit differential specie host preferences .
Prions are classifiable as epigenetic regulators because they are able to modify gene expression through protein interactions , as opposed to first receiving “ instructions ” provided by nucleic acids .
When a host prion gene is over - expressed , spontaneous formation of prions can occur and this is observed in both yeast and mammals .
A previous study by Susan Liebman , distinguished university professor of biological science , exploited this known prion feature in order to discover new yeast prions .
While in the process of discovering the [ SWI + ] prion , her lab also found other potential prion forming candidates .
In this present study , Liebman ’s team tested these candidates and one of them when over - expressed , gene Cyc8 , produces the prion “ [ OCT + ] . "
In prior research , a yeast prion that was linked to the chromatin remodeling complex ( SWI - SNF ) suggested that prions could regulate gene transcription on a massive scale .
Chromatin is the condensed portion of a chromosome and its formation involves coordination of highly complex protein interactions .
Prions would be advantageous for such a task considering structural changes dictated by prions are temporary , reversible and can be completed very quickly ( since transcription of genes is not a necessary first step ) .
The Cyc8 gene ( along with Tup1 ) forms a transcriptional repressor complex responsible for the regulation of over 7 % of yeast genes .
This protein complex shuts down the expression of numerous genes including some genes that are involved in stress tolerance .
As expected , the prion form of the Cyc8 protein causes profound phenotypic effects .
“ Once Cyc8 is converted to a prion , it loses that function .
This might provide some advantage under stressful conditions .
Since the protein represses more than 300 genes , it ’s possible the prion form can activate the genes on a mass level and converting the protein into a prion would be an easy way to do it , ” explains postdoctoral research associate Basant Patel .
Although [ OCT + ] can be propagated in a laboratory , the question remains as to if [ OCT + ] formation can form in yeast naturally .
“ We know this prion turns on the expression of genes but we do n’t know if the prion forms naturally , ” said Liebman .
“ If it were to form , it would have this effect .
But whether it happens out in the wild all the time , we do n’t know . ”
Presently , Patel and others in Liebman ’s lab are conducting tests in order to determine if this molecular mechanism does take place naturally .
To date , scientists have discovered only seven prions , six of which are only found in fungi , including yeast .
The discovery of prions acting as epigenetic regulators in yeast begs the question ; do humans also have similar prion mechanisms as well ?
If so , perhaps these hypothetical human prions are related to the prions we find in yeast .
This possibility is certainly on the mind of Liebman and her associates .
“ There could be prions in humans that are not causing disease but have important effects on the cell or organism , ” said Liebman .
“ They may even be related to the ones we find in yeast .
The more we learn about and study , the more information we learn from then ; how they arrive , what proteins are needed to maintain them .
As we study other models , we have a better idea . ”

On Tuesday 's O'Reilly Factor , Mike Gallagher -- sold that home yet , Mike ? -- and Lars Larson were on to talk about why right - wingers like Newt Gingrich just can't help talking about Rush Limbaugh and drawing his ire and thus feeding into the evil liberals ' devious plan to draw attention away from the serious issue of the economy .
It was a hoot .
The wankafoolery started really rolling when Gallagher came up with this gem :
Gallagher :
Well , I think Newt does n't like being part of a phony debate that 's been set up by the left as to whether or not Rush Limbaugh is the face of the Republican Party .
Newt has always been great at defining what Republicans are about , what Republicans are for , and putting Democrats on the defensive .
And I think Newt is probably mildly annoyed that a radio host , even one as prominent as Rush , has created so many headlines over all this .
And I think both of these men acknowledge that it's a disingenuous debate .
It 's just something that 's been ginned up by the Left to try to fracture the Republican Party even further , and that 's just not what Newt is about .
Even O'Reilly seemed skeptical about all this , but all were in eventual agreement that the whole thing was a ridiculous plot by liberals and the Obama administration to distract attention from the economy , which O'Reilly assures us is going to backfire , blah blah blah blah blah .
They 're all conveniently forgetting one thing :
Limbaugh is precisely relevant to the matter of the economy because he has made himself a major player -- and certainly its most visible one -- in the fight over President Obama 's legislative package for getting the economy back on its feet .
Does anyone doubt for a minute that Republicans in both the House and the Senate would have been as significantly lockstep , completely uniformly obstructionist , in voting against the stimulus bill had it not been for Limbaugh , with this troops manning the phone lines to deal rapidly and harshly with any hapless Republicans who might even hint toward straying ?
Is there any doubt their leverage helped Blue Dogs water the bill down enough to make it potentially short of what 's needed ?
Trying to pretend Limbaugh is just a sideshow , when in fact he 's been a key player in how the economic fix has proceeded -- and particularly in how it 's been discussed and shaped -- is a good meme for Republicans .
But it also runs aground on the sharp rocks of reality .
Limbaugh has become the most important means of Republicans maintaining their ideological rigidity through hardline party discipline , especially on economic matters .
So when liberals go after Limbaugh as the face of the GOP , that 's because -- by default -- that 's what he is right now .
And it 's not looking like it will change anytime soon , either ; do you see any real potential winners among that crop of Republican politicians right now ?
( I for one am waiting for them to recruit Glenn Beck to run on the Sarah Palin ticket ...)
So when Obama brought Limbaugh up -- " You ca n't just listen to Rush Limbaugh and get things done " -- it was precisely in the context of solving the economic mess .
And he 's right :
If Republicans are just listening to Rush and , like him , reflexively rejecting every proposal he offers , and moreover reflexively working for his failure for cold political calculations , then they 're not going to be part of getting anything done in the next four years , especially not in terms of getting the economy back up and running .
The public does n't want the standard old Conservative solutions to these problems -- which is all the GOP has to offer -- and Republicans are going to have to learn to deal with that fact .
The only remaining question is whether they 're going to be part of the solution , or part of the problem .
With Rush , we already have our answer .

Millions of satistfied people around the world have participated , saying Yes ! to World Peace in their own special way .
Through links with the Noosphere Project at Princeton University , and more recently The Center for Subtle Activism , the Global O has been able to contribute in a unique way to the new sciences of the collective mind .
We ask that you vote for a brighter future with your orgasm .
Use it to pray for Peace .
With you will be millions of people around the world .
I have a particular loathing for arguments that involve the words “ at this stage in the cycle ” .
It implies that public support automatically moves in certain directions depending upon how distant or close an election appears , as opposed to people changing their opinions in response to events .
The big daddy of this sort of argument is the belief that governments always recover as an election approaches , or that oppositions have to be X points ahead at “ this stage in the cycle ” to be Y points ahead come the election .
Now , there is some logic in the argument .
After all , to some extent governments have the ability to time the announcement of policies and tax cuts so unpopular things happen mid term and popular things happen in the run up to elections ( though this does rather depend upon there being ideas in the making and money in the kitty ) .
I expect there is also a causal link in the other direction : governments see they have had a good run in the polls recently and take the opportunity to call an election .
But anyway , theoretical arguments aside , lets look at what has actually happened at past elections .
We ’ll start with 1992 – often a popular point of comparison , for we really did have a government that was trailing by over 25 points in the polls , yet came back to win .
You can see on the graph that the Conservative deficit peaked at 24.5 points , and their average deficit in 1990 was around 12 points … yet they came back to win by 8 points .
However , as we know , it was n’t a gradual clawing back of support , it was a sudden transformation after the replacement of Margaret Thatcher with John Major .
Moving into 1991 the Conservatives were on average roughly level with Labour in the polls .
Normally this might suggest that the government recovered even further in the run up to the 1992 election , but of course , if one looks at the polls they did n’t .
By the eve of the election the polls are still showing the parties roughly even – it was n’t that Major ’s government recovered in that last year , it ’s just that the polls were wrong .
Moving onto 1997 , in this graph I ’ve taken only ICM polls , since they were the only company who immediately learnt the lessons of 1992 and corrected their methodology enough to get things right in 1997 .
Here the government ’s deficit against the Labour opposition peaks at 29 points , and the average deficit across the worst year , 1995 , is almost 20 points .
The Conservatives certainly recover somewhat from that position , eventually losing to Labour by 13 points , but while that is a substantial recovery from 1995 , it ’s a more modest clamber back from the 16 or so point deficits they averaged in 1996 .
Onwards to 2001 and a Labour incumbent .
Labour ’s worst point here is obvious – a brief 8 point deficit at the height of the 2000 fuel strikes .
That is very brief however , and on average even in that , their worst year , they are on average 11 points ahead in the polls .
They end up winning by 9 points .
So there is no recovery here – apart from that brief blip Labour ’s lead gradually falls throughout the Parliament .
( Some of the pollsters are still making post - 1992 adjustments to their methodology in this Parliament , particularly MORI who start filtering by likelihood to vote and Gallup who drop out alltogether to be replaced by YouGov .
If you take just ICM , as I did for 1992 - 1997 , the picture is n’t too different .
Their average Labour lead in 2000 is 8.4 , so there is a neglible government recovery ) .
For the 2001 - 2005 Parliament we really do n’t see much of a recovery at all .
The government ’s lead over the Conservatives plummets as they lose support over the Iraq war .
Their worst position in the polls ( which they hit several times ) is a 5 point deficit .
In 2003 their average position is 3.8 points ahead of the Tories , in 2004 it is 2.4 points ahead .
In reality they win by 2.9 points – so again , there is no significant improvement from their mid-term position .
So looking at past years , there is a big government recovery in 1992 … but it is caused by changing a leader .
In 2005 and 2001 there is no significant recovery at all .
Only in 1997 do we see a government clamber back from its very worst ratings and stage something of a recovery and , as we know , it was n’t nearly enough to win .
What is true is that governments have always recovered from their very worst position – in every case its possible to cherry pick some awful moment of hideous unpopularity from which the government recovered , but that ’s no great surprise ( for starters , in most cases the most extreme outlying poll results were probably rogues anyway ) .
What it does n’t mean is that one can take any mid-term ( or now late term ) position and assume the government must do better .
So , let ’s look at the same graph for the position now , and see what that looks like in comparison .
We ’ve got a rather excitable graph here to begin with , with the big peak of the “ Brown Bounce ” in the middle of 2007 .
Labour ’s worst point is a 28 point deficit in 2008 – they ’d have to go to some effort not to do better than that at the election .
Their average in 2008 and 2009 is a deficit of around 12 points .
If they ended up with roughly the same sort of deficit as that at the next election it would fit the pattern of the last two elections .
Then again , perhaps they could recover as the Tories did in 1997 – or perhaps they could drift down further .
That ’s the point – there is n’t an automatic cycle where governments are guaranteed to recover X points at the Y part of the cycle .
We ’ve seem them recover , we ’ve seen them fail to recover ; if you take one date as your reference point they go up again , if you take another as your reference point they do n’t .
There is no guaranteed rallying of support – if the government wants to recover support it needs to do something to earn it ( or hope the Conservative do something to drive it away ) .
POZNAN , Poland ( Reuters ) - Weather - related disasters and earthquakes are likely to make 2008 the second most costly year for insurers after 2005 , when Hurricane Katrina struck the United States , a leading insurer said on Wednesday .

Losses in 2008 are around $ 160 billion so far , Thomas Loster , chair of Munich Re Foundation , told Reuters on the sidelines of December 1 - 12 climate talks in Poznan , Poland .
He said it was likely to have been surpassed only by 2005 , when Katrina contributed to losses of $ 220 billion .
Cyclone Nargis , which hit Myanmar in May , was the most deadly event of 2008 so far , claiming an estimated 84,500 lives .
The most costly was May ’s earthquake in China .
Munich
Re said in a study with the U.N. Environment Programme that weather - related disasters seemed to be on the rise , in line with forecasts by the U.N. Climate Panel that blames mankind for global warming .
“ Since the 1980s , earthquakes have risen by around 50 percent but weather - related hazards such as major floods have increased by as much as 350 percent and those from wind storms have doubled , ” the report said .
The rise in more extreme weather is leading to greater risks for vulnerable countries and communities while straining global insurance markets , the organizations said in a statement .
Hurricane
Fay set records by hitting Florida four times and dumping almost 30 inches of rain on some areas in 2008 .
U.N. climate talks in Poznan , meant to drive agreement next year on a new climate treaty , have focused on ways to insure developing countries against disasters and help them put in place prevention measures .
A proposal from the Munich Climate Insurance Initiative , a coalition of insurers , non-governmental organizations and climate change experts , outlines a mechanism to manage climate risk that could be part of a new global pact on climate change due to replace or extend the Kyoto Protocol from 2013 .
The proposal says premiums for insuring property and infrastructure in developing countries from extreme events would be between $ 3 billion and $ 5 billion per year .
Adding insurance for medium - scale losses and prevention measures would raise the annual cost to around $ 10 billion .
“ I am surprised countries have not blinked at this yet , ” said Koko Warner from the United Nations University , who presented the proposal to negotiators .
“ It made us nervous but we had to say what the cost would be . ”

Central Office Tour : Where Does That Wire Go? Photos by David Ogburn Washington Apple Pi Journal , reprint information
When you fire up your modem and " dial in " to the Internet , what happens after the phone line disappears into the panel in your wall ?
If you are one of the fortunate who can get DSL service , you might know that DSL requires you to be within a certain number of feet of a " CO , " or " central office , " but what does that mean ?
Does a " central office " look like a YMCA gym , or the local Department of Motor Vehicles , or the bridge of the Star Ship Enterprise ?
Washington Apple Pi member David Ogburn took these digital photos of the inside of a Verizon central office .
While the details may differ somewhat , most telephone central offices throughout North America look much the same .
To see a larger version of any photo , click on the photo .
These are the cables carrying the copper wires from your home into the cable vault below the central office and up to the distribution frame .
The wires are separated into the copper pairs that provide your telephone service and run into the back of the distribution frame .
This is the front of the distribution frame where the copper pairs are connected one - by - one to the Central Office switch .
If you are patient , you might try this , an even larger , higher resolution version of this photo .
This shows an entire row of the distribution frame .
This is one row of the central office switch , a Lucent 5E .
Each cabinet holds a number of cards , each containing a Motorola processor .
This bay contains the multiplexers for Litespan equipment .
Litespan permits your phone service to be provided over fiber optic cable to equipment cabinets near your neighborhood that contain matching multiplexers and a crossconnect box to connect your service to the copper pair that serves your house .
This is multiplexing equipment that provides high - speed data service over fiber optic cable .
This is the multiplexing equipment for an OC 192 circuit that can carry 9.6 GB of data per second .
This equipment costs approximately $ 250,000 .
This is a fiber cross connect point where the data from the multiplexers leaves the central office on fiber trunks .
This is bank of DSL multiplexers .
Each box ( there are three in each of these racks ) provides 48 DSL circuits .
DSL must be provided end - to - end over a copper pair .
Local exchange carriers like Verizon are required to provide collocation space to permit CLECs ( competitive local exchange carrier ) to locate equipment in the central office .
This is a row of collocated CLEC equipment .
CLECs preferring more security for their equipment can lease caged collocation space in the central office .
Chas Freeman has withdrawn his name from consideration as the chairman of the National Intelligence Council .
His withdrawal statement is relayed here by Laura Rozen in all its pugnacious glory .
The guy goes out with guns blazing–a bit too hot , for my taste .
He pins his departure on “ the Israel Lobby , ” which is imprecise .
He was the victim of a mob , not a lobby .
The mob was composed primarily of Jewish neoconservatives–abetted by less than courageous public servants like Senator Chuck Schumer , who has publicly taken credit for the hit .
This was his statement :
“ Charles Freeman was the wrong guy for this position .
His statements against Israel were way over the top and severely out of step with the administration .
I repeatedly urged the White House to reject him , and I am glad they did the right thing . ”
Schumer should know that he has taken a scalp in the name of closed - mindedness , which is not a well - known Jewish tradition .
He has made Washington even less hospitable for those who are n’t afraid to speak their minds , for those who are reflexively contentious , who would defy the conventional wisdom .
Freeman ’s most important point in his statement is this one :
I believe that the inability of the American public to discuss , or the government to consider , any option for US policies in the Middle East opposed by the ruling faction in Israeli politics has allowed that faction to adopt and sustain policies that ultimately threaten the existence of the state of Israel .
It is not permitted for anyone in the United States to say so .
This is not just a tragedy for Israelis and their neighbors in the Middle East ; it is doing widening damage to the national security of the United States .
Barack Obama should take note .
The thugs have taken out Chas Freeman .
They will not rest .
Their real target is you , Mr. President .
One in 10 children in the UK now lives in a mixed - race family , a major study reveals today , raising future hopes of a non-racist Britain .
Mixed - race relationships are now so common that some ethnic groups - starting with African - Caribbean - will virtually disappear , the research states .
Young people are six times more likely to be mixed - race as adults .
Experts believe the findings , which come just days after Prince Harry was rebuked for calling a fellow cadet " Paki " , and Prince Charles admitted to referring to an Asian friend as " Sooty " , mean that future generations " will not see race in the way we see it " .
Lucinda Platt , author of the report and an academic at the Institute of Social and Economic Research at Essex University , describes the shift towards a mixed - race Britain as " dramatic " .
Half of all men in Britain who have Caribbean heritage and are in a relationship already have partners of a different race .
The same is true of one in five black African men , one in 10 Indian men and women and two out of five Chinese women .
One in five children belongs to an ethnic minority - a far higher proportion than among the adult population .
This week , a decade on from the Macpherson report into the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence , Trevor Phillips , chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission , will " celebrate " the study 's findings , but warn that there is still much to be fought for .
A spokeswoman for the commission warned against complacency .
" We need to be alert to tensions within communities that may be exacerbated by economic downturn and to remain vigilant against discrimination and divisiveness - particularly across boundaries of faith . "
Today 's study , commissioned by the EHRC and seen exclusively by the Observer , shows that 9 % of children are of " mixed or multiple heritage " - that is , they live with parents from different ethnic groups , or they are themselves of mixed ethnicity .
Over the past 14 years the number of children of Caribbean heritage with one white parent has risen from 39 % to 49 % .
Among the Indian population it has increased from 3 % to 11 % , for Pakistanis from 1 % to 4 % , and for Chinese from 15 % to 35 % .
Minorities also tend to be younger .
While half of the white British population in Britain is aged over 40 , half of the Bangladeshi community is under 21 .
More than 9,000 books are missing from the British Library , including Renaissance treatises on theology and alchemy , a medieval text on astronomy , first editions of 19th - and 20th - century novels , and a luxury edition of Mein Kampf produced in 1939 to celebrate Hitler 's 50th birthday .
The library believes almost all have not been stolen but rather mislaid among its 650 km of shelves and 150 m items – although some have not been seen in well over half a century .
One item , an essay entitled Of the Lawful and Unlawful Usurie Amongest Christians , by 16th - century German theologian Wolfgang Musculus , is valued by the library at £ 20,000 , and has not been seen for almost two years .
Others are precious only to a specialist market , such as a set of tables of 1930s London cab fares , or the 1925 souvenir history of Portsmouth Football Club .
Although the library has not listed any value for thousands of the books , a quick Guardian tot - up of the market price of nine collectible volumes came to well over £ 3,000 – including £ 1,300 for a first edition of Oscar Wilde 's only novel , The Picture of Dorian Gray , published in 1891 , missing from the library 's shelves since 1961 .
The library records all of these items as " mislaid " rather than gone for ever , still less stolen .
Despite well - publicised recent cases - such as that of Edward Forbes Smiley III , convicted in the US three years ago of stealing more than 100 maps from institutions including the British Library , and Farhad Hakimzadeh , an Iranian collector jailed in January for cutting maps , illustrations and pages from priceless volumes in the British Library and other collections - the library is convinced that almost all the missing texts are still somewhere within its walls .
Jennifer Perkins , the library 's head of records , said that books and other items were usually identified as mislaid when a reader requested them - more than 3.5 m items are delivered to the reading rooms every year - and the book was not on its correct shelf .
Other losses were revealed in rolling audits of the enormous collection .
" There are a number of reasons why collection items may not be at their correct shelf location : they may have been misplaced on the shelves , the shelf mark label may have become detached from the spine and the item is being checked and reshelved , or the catalogue record may not have been altered to reflect a changed shelf mark , " said Perkins .
" The library takes the security of its collections very seriously and has a range of measures designed to protect collection items from inadvertent or deliberate harm . "
Keith Rathmill , of library security firm SA Secure , said he was surprised the list was not longer - one small library which consulted his firm had lost about a fifth of its collection in four years .
" It is a huge collection and no building is secure , " he said .
" There 's theft from all libraries , but the British Library can think itself lucky it is n't in a worse situation - it does n't attract the dregs of society . "
The library 's greatest treasures , priceless documents including Magna Carta and the Lindisfarne Gospels , are kept in a special gallery with rigorous conservation and security controls .
For the rest of the collection , identified by barcodes and shelf numbers but not by microchips or any technology the library fears might prove ephemeral , a rolling audit gives priority to the most valuable and heavily used items , a spokesman said .
Perhaps significantly , many of the losses are recorded just before or after 1998 , the year the library moved from the British Museum to St Pancras .
Most of the losses are 19th and 20th century texts , including first editions of novels by Charles Dickens and John Updike , although many older books have also vanished , including a 1555 edition of 12th - century Jewish scholar Moses ben Maimon 's Letter on Astrology , missing since 1977 , and a 17th - century guide to Rome .

Advertisers use three main strategies to lure folks into buying their products : sexism , boobs and sexism .
Since Cracked already presented a lengthy dissertation on the enchanting properties of boobs ( published in Popular Mechanics , thank you ) , we thought it high time to cover the other side of the equation .

We can't stress enough how important it is to have safe tires .
After a couple bloated Midwesterners speak earnestly about the virtues of the Goodyear Polyglas Tire , we get down to the nitty - gritty .
Cue the perilous music .
Announcer : But a Polyglas tire means more when your wife is driving at night .
Look at her eyes glazed over in terror .
Traffic !
Potholes !
Pedestrians !
As reflecting street signs and traffic lights explode across her retina like a Michael Bay movie , the lady driver retreats into her primitive reptile brain .
She 's unable to do much more than dart her head around and wait for death .
But thank fucking God she 's on Goodyear Polyglas Tires .
Amazingly she makes it to the airport to pick up her husband , the George to her Lenny , and she immediately scoots the hell over into the passenger seat and lets a MAN behind the wheel .

7 Diamonds Are Forever
The " Women are attracted to shiny things " card has been played by advertisers before , but De Beers takes no prisoners .
A man proclaims love for his woman loudly , bravely and in one of the most romantic spots in the world .
This generally irks her , and so he gives her a diamond and she 's okay with him again .
Because passionate heartfelt sentiment does n't hold a candle to cold , hard ice .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement Advertisers exhibit no shame when it comes to interminably reminding men no matter how much love and heart they pour into a relationship , you will never mean anything more to your mate than the sheer mass of pricey trinkets you can cram down her throat .
No one is more blatant about this than the diamond industry .
Constantly they remind you " A Diamond is Forever , " which is true .
That 's why it 's the first thing she demands in your divorce hearing .
It would be nice if a guy could avoid going into severe debt with rare gems by simply looking directly into his loved one 's eyes and saying meaningfully , " I love you . "

Too bad she wo n't be able to hear him ; apparently the only language women understand is the Morse code of twinkling shiny things .

A well - known West Memphis , Arkansas , physician was in critical condition Wednesday night after he was injured in a bombing that occurred as he was getting into his vehicle to leave for work , police said .
Dr. Trent Pierce is well - liked and a pillar of the West Memphis , Arkansas , community , sources say .
Dr. Trent Pierce , 54 , a family practitioner who serves as chairman of the Arkansas Medical Board , lost his left eye in the blast about 8 a.m. at his home , West Memphis Police Chief Robert Paudert told reporters .
Doctors operated on his right eye in hopes of saving it , Paudert said , and also removed shrapnel from Pierce 's abdomen .
Pierce underwent another surgery in the evening in which doctors were removing more shrapnel from his neck , Paudert said .
He was at the intensive care unit Wednesday night at the Regional Medical Center in Memphis , Tennessee , known as the MED .
Investigators are not sure whether the bomb was placed on or near Pierce 's Lexus hybrid SUV , police said , or whether he was a random target .
He apparently was outside the vehicle when the bomb exploded , said Stuart Lowery , assistant special agent in charge for the New Orleans , Louisiana , office of the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .
Watch ATF say the bombing is a criminal act »
The blast , which was heard a mile away , occurred as Pierce was leaving his home at his usual time , Paudert said .
His wife was in the house , heard the explosion and ran out to find Pierce lying in a flower bed six feet from the vehicle , authorities said .
A passerby called 911 .
Dr. Scott Ferguson , a friend and neighbor who is serving as the Pierce family spokesman , told reporters Pierce apparently found a spare tire in front of the vehicle Wednesday , and as he was warming up the car , went to move it so he could leave his driveway .
As he was doing so , the bomb -- under the vehicle -- exploded , Ferguson said , adding he did not know what role the tire played .
Paudert told CNN he had spoken with officials at ATF , which is the lead investigative agency , about the tire , but declined to comment on the issue .
No one else was injured , and there was no damage to the home , Paudert said .
Aerial footage from the scene showed the white SUV with its hood blown up and extensive damage to its front end .
Watch investigators converge on the SUV »
Pierce was stabilized at a local hospital before he was flown across the Mississippi River to the MED , officials said .
Paudert credited staffers at the local hospital with saving his life .
" Every one of the surgeons who has come down has been excellent , keeping us informed and telling us what 's going on , " Ferguson said .
" The news has been better with each report . "
Hot line
The ATF is asking anyone with information on this case to call its hot line at 888 - ATF - BOMB
He said he saw Pierce at the local hospital and initially was not optimistic about his chances , but as of Wednesday evening was " quite optimistic that he is going to survive and do well ... it 's going to be a long process .
It 's not going to happen overnight , but we are very optimistic and thankful . "
A plastic surgeon told family and friends Pierce 's burns " look much worse than they actually are , " he said .
Ferguson said he lives across the street and was in the shower when " I felt and heard the explosion .
I thought a tree had fallen through the front of my house . "
But he said he could not see a tree , and by the time he dressed , his phone was ringing telling him to go to the emergency room .
Watch a family friend say Dr. Pierce was targeted »
Lowery told reporters : " We have no doubt this was a criminal act . "
Ferguson said he had no idea who would have wanted to hurt Pierce or why .
" There are crazy people in the world , and what triggers them , I have no idea , " he said .
" He 's loved by everyone , " said Paudert of Pierce .
" He has a very large practice , particularly of elderly people that depend on him for their health . "
He said Pierce had no known complaints or threats against him .
" There is absolutely no motive as to why someone would want to plant a bomb on his car . "
Initial indications were that foul play was not involved , Paudert said earlier , and police thought the blast might have resulted from a malfunction of some sort .
However , ATF agents were able to find evidence of an explosive device , he said .
Eighteen ATF agents from three states were at the scene , Lowery said .
But the West Memphis police chief promised to remain involved in the investigation , too .
Whoever planted the bomb has " injured someone that 's loved in this community , and my physician , " Paudert said .
" I 'm going to show personal attention to this . "
The board was scheduled to meet Thursday in Little Rock , according to its Web site .
Little Rock , the Arkansas capital , is about 125 miles west of West Memphis .
Paudert said Pierce was scheduled to attend board subcommittee meetings in Little Rock on Wednesday , but police do not know whether that was linked to the bombing .
Ferguson described Pierce as active in the community and said Pierce and his wife have two grown children -- one in law school and one who works at a bank .
West Memphis and Memphis , Tennessee , are separated by the Mississippi River .
West Memphis had about 28,000 residents as of 2006 , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .
Local and federal officials urged anyone with information to contact law enforcement agencies .
The ATF tip line is 888 - ATF - BOMB .

A day after Joaquin Phoenix 's bizarre appearance on David Letterman 's " Late Show , " the director of his final movie , " Two Lovers , " said he 's just as baffled about Phoenix 's turn from Oscar - nominated actor to incomprehensible rapper as everyone else .
" If it is an act , it 's the most committed act I 've ever seen in my life , " James Gray said in an interview with ABC News Radio 's David Blaustein .
" I mean , he built this studio [ in his house ] .
The lengths to which he 's taken it are quite extreme . "
Phoenix 's fatigue with acting was obvious while filming " Two Lovers , " Gray said .
" Toward the end of the shoot , he kept saying ' Oh I 'm so tired , I 'm so tired . '
You hear that kind of thing and you think it 's a joke , " he said .
" I just ignored it . "
So when Gray , who also worked with Phoenix on 2000's " The Yards " and 2007 's " We Own the Night , " found out via the Internet that Phoenix had vowed never to act again , he hunted down the star to confront him .
" I drove up to his house because his phone was disconnected , " Gray said .
" He said , ' I do n't want to act anymore , I 've been doing it for 30 years and if you did something for 30 years , you 'd want to quit too . ' "
Now , Gray wonders if he 's responsible for Phoenix 's decision to quit acting and take up rapping , a project he 's pursuing with Sean " P. Diddy " Combs and Casey Affleck .
" Two Lovers , " which also stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Vinessa Shaw , features an awkward freestyle rap performance by Phoenix -- not unlike his real - life rap debut .
Gray revealed Phoenix was imitating him during that scene .
" That rap thing ... in the movie actually comes from something I played for him , " Gray said .
" I had an obsession with doing that sort of thing as a teenager .
...
It turns out that Joaquin is imitating me in a lot of the movie .
He said , ' I want to do that , I want to steal from that , I want to do the rap that you used to do . '
I said , ' OK . '
" And now I 'm seeing him do this thing , and I feel like I 've ruined Joaquin Phoenix for the world , " Gray added .
" I do n't want to be the guy that destroyed Joaquin Phoenix 's acting career . "
Phoenix Aloof , Out of It on ' Late Show '
Whether or not Phoenix is ruined as an actor , he 's definitely out of sorts as a human being .
In his interview with Letterman Wednesday , Phoenix , wearing a scraggly beard and dark sunglasses , seemed completely absent , staring off into space and answering questions with one - word answers .
Halfway through the interview , after a long pause from his guest , Letterman embraced the opportunity to make a fool of Phoenix .
" So what can you tell me about your days with the Unabomber ? " he asked , eliciting howls of laughter from the audience .
Phoenix did n't respond .
When Letterman ribbed Phoenix for chewing gum during the interview , Phoenix took the gum out of his mouth and stuck it to the " Late Show " host 's desk .
That seemed to signal the end of the interview .
Letterman closed the interview by saying , " Joaquin , I 'm sorry you could n't be here tonight . "
Gray saw Phoenix Wednesday night , after the star taped his appearance on " The Late Show , " but before it aired .
Gray asked how the interview went .
" He said ' Oh it was good , it was really good , " Gray said .
" I watched it this morning ... I do n't know what to say . "
An American woman has told a TV station in Madison , Wisconsin that something called Ubuntu prevented her from joining online classes at her local technical college .
According to WKOW TV , Abbie Schubert recently ordered a Dell laptop , expecting " your classic bread - and - butter computer . "
But when she unboxed the $ 1,100 machine that arrived on her doorstep , she did n't find bread and butter .
She found Ubuntu .
WKOW TV called Ubuntu " an operating system for your computer similar to Windows that runs off the Linux system . "
" It 's been a mess , " Schubert said .
" I regret ordering the computer . "
She had never heard of Ubuntu .
So she called Dell .
Dell said there was still time to replace her Ubuntu .
Then Dell told her not to .
" The person I was talking to said Ubuntu was great , college students loved it , it was compatible with everything I needed , " she explained .
So she kept her Ubuntu , then decided that Ubuntu does n't always work like Windows .
Her Verizon internet would n't load .
She could n't install Microsoft Word .
And she said without Word and the internet , she could n't take online classes at Madison Area Technical College .
So she dropped out of the college 's fall and spring semesters .
Then Dell said it was too late for bread and butter .
" I 'm extremely frustrated , " Schubert said .
" I wanted to get back to school , but I needed a computer to be able to do that . "
Yes , that 's fall and spring semesters .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Ryanair attacked " idiot " and " lunatic " bloggers Wednesday after a customer highlighted what he said were flaws in the budget airline 's Web site .
Jason
Roe said he found the comments by Ryanair staffers offensive and was disappointed by the airline 's response .
Dublin - based Web developer Jason
Roe was booking plane tickets online when he discovered what he thought was a glitch that allowed him to book free Ryanair tickets .
He duly posted details of the " glitch " on his blog as well as a message on Twitter .
Soon people were trying to replicate what he had done with little success , and he later confirmed that he was unable to book the tickets without paying .
But among responses on his Web site were three purporting to be from Ryanair staff .
One read : " You 're an idiot and a liar !!
fact is !
you 've opened one session then another and requested a page meant for a different session , you are so stupid you dont even know how you did it ! "
Another said : " Website is not perfect , Life is not perfect ...
If you would work in your pathetic life on a such big project in a such busy environment with so little resources , you would know that the most important is to have usual user behavior scenarios working rather than spending time on improbable and harmless things . "
Tell us what you think
Roe said he later traced the IP addresses of the postings to the airline 's headquarters in Dublin , something Ryanair later confirmed to CNN .
" Ryanair can confirm that a Ryanair staff member did engage in a blog discussion , " said the airline 's spokesman Stephen McNamara .
" It is Ryanair policy not to waste time and energy in corresponding with idiot bloggers and Ryanair can confirm that it wo n't be happening again .
Lunatic bloggers can have the blog sphere all to themselves as our people are far too busy driving down the cost of air travel . "
Roe told CNN he was disappointed with Ryanair 's response .
" I was hoping the corporate response was n't in line with the staff members , whose comments I found offensive .
This was n't a big issue and was really just a small problem ; they could have said they were working on it and they over - reacted . "
" You can only imagine how many customers they could lose by treating them like this , " he added .
A spokesman for ABTA , which represents tour operators and travel agents , said the comments by Ryanair came as no surprise .
" They treat their customers with contempt .
We know that Ryanair does n't put any store on customer relations , " said Frances Tuke .
" This is the way Ryanair conducts its business .
Their clear goal is to provide cheap flights but we do n't believe this is the way to provide customer satisfaction .
Our members do n't do this -- their customers expect a high level of service . "
How to Get A Job at a Top Ruby Shop
By Peter Cooper
Despite whatever ’s going on in the bigger world , there does n’t seem to be a shortage of jobs in the Ruby and Rails worlds - at least , not in certain cities .
There also does n’t seem to be a shortage of Ruby and Rails developers , but employers are still desperate to find people to fill positions .
A few employers complained to me that the quality just was n’t there and that there were a lot of tire kickers about .
My take is that perhaps people who are eager about Ruby ( and Rails ) and who want a job in the industry are n’t exactly sure what employers are looking for - especially since there seems to be a lot of “ in- community ” hiring going on , where people already know each other .
So I decided to ask a collection of employers what they ’re really looking for beyond what ’s mentioned in the job ads .
Several great responses came back and it seems there are a few key points ..
Open Source Contributions and Being Known
The biggest point that came back in e-mail after e-mail was that being an active and visible member of the community who contributes to open source projects or maintains projects of their own is a really big deal .
Some of the best quotes :
What we really care about is what you can do so open source contributions are bar none the most important thing we consider and analyze when we ’re hiring .
“ Code samples ” are great , but they ’re generally just clever pieces of code to show how awesome you are . [..]
Open source code that people are using is a great qualifier because it shows how well you ’re able to integrate things together into a cohesive piece of software ( or are able to contribute to an existing project with momentum ) , it shows how much you actually care about testing and other important practices , and , even more important , it shows how well you ’ll fit into the culture around here since , well , that ’s just how we roll .
Jeremy McAnally ( @jm ) - ENTP
If we have n’t already heard your name , there ’s a really good chance your application is simply going to be ignored .
If we have n’t seen you at conferences or meetups , hung out with out on IRC , read your blog , or followed one of your github projects , you ’re probably wrong for the job anyway .
Bulleted lists of skills on a resume are just talk .
Open source projects and community participation are real proof of who you are and what you do .
James Golick ( @jamesgolick ) , Giraffesoft.ca
If it ’s a Rails job , contributions made to the Rails core would score more points than anything else .
More than 5 patches and that ’d speak more than 500 words in the resume .
That ’s about only 200 people though !
Next would be evaluating source code of the plugins they ’ve written and looking them up on github / twitter / rails mailing list .
I ’d look for people who are NOT tied to a single methodology , be it tdd , bdd or pair programming and can bend the rules to get things done .

Communications Skills Are Key
Second on the list was communications and soft business skills .
You do n’t need to be an MBA or anything , but being able to understand customers , their requirements , and being able to communicate well within your development team is a must .
You have to find a way to work this in to your resume ( and then your interview ! ) .
Robert Dempsey and Seth Walker summed it up best :
What I really want to know is will the candidate fit in with our culture .
They need to be able to self - manage , work with our team , and work directly with our customers , using the phone , skype , IM , Campfire , etc .
Ability to communicate and fit in with us is # 1 , skills are # 2 .
I check the usual offline and online spots - references , personal blog , LinkedIn , Facebook , GitHub , etc. - to see what they portray online , but I do n’t rely on it .
I prefer to speak with them over the phone or in person if possible .
I then combine my gut reaction to them with the other information and make a decision .
Robert Dempsey ( @rdempsey ) , CEO , Atlantic Dominion Solutions
It ’s more important to us that a potential employee know and understand our clients and their needs over knowing the ins and outs of all the latest Rails technologies .
That said , we look for someone who can integrate into our team quickly , using the tools we use , and can provide value as soon as possible [ oh , and be a vim user ] .
Seth Walker , Radical Designs
Passion , Enthusiasm and Talent
And , of course , being passionate about what you do is a pretty big deal too .
It comes lower in the list just because if you ’re passionate about Ruby and Rails , you ’re probably already doing the # 1 thing , which is to contribute code back to the community ..
Still , there were some interesting things said :
“ Young Guns ” are the key ingredient at Dr Nic ’s firm Mocra .
Recruits are inspired by love of coding : attending local dev groups and RailsCamps , have contributed to open source , and are prepared to tell other guys in the office that they ’re wrong or doing something inefficiently .
Especially their boss .
Dr Nic Williams - Mocra.com
We look for people with passion and talent , who get a rush from building great software with great people . [..]
Having helped create and ship a product is important .
We also look for people who think about what our customers would want , who focus on the success of the product and the business , and do n’t get wrapped up in fighting religious wars over development processes .
Lew Cirne - New Relic
A Nice Wrapup
Austin Putman of Radical Designs came in with a great mail that summed up pretty much everything relayed above :
We ’re a pretty small shop and we ’ve only hired one dev in the last year .
We did n’t hire the guy who tweeted .
Because we ’re focused on servicing grassroots community organizations , we are looking for someone who identifies with that mission — someone who will be a long term asset to the team .
Be prepared to stay a few years — we are n’t looking to get bought by anyone .
We picked someone who gave full , clear explanations of their programming choices while we were pairing .
Pairing is a requirement for us and we paid our top candidates to spend hours with us working on tasks derived from our ongoing projects .
Blogging is awesome - it provides a window into how the candidate thinks and works .
If you have a blog — show code !
If your blog is all about opinions on the cover designs from the Pragmatic Programmers and the latest awkwardnesses in the high school dance that is the Rails community — I think , “ You are n’t that into code ” .
If you have no blog , it could at least mean that you are * too* into code to blog .
We also follow the often - repeated advice and ask for code with tests before inviting candidates for an interview .
This filtered out a number of borderline candidates , saving us time and effort .
Many people are just responding to every ad with the word Rails , especially in the current climate .
This group simply did n’t respond to a request for a sample .
Austin Putman , Radical Designs
Best of luck in your future Ruby and Rails job endeavors - whether you 're the hirer or the hiree !

A computer expert has described his astonishment at seeing the BBC 's 24 - hour news channel interview supposed taxi driver Guy Goma in the mistaken belief it was him .
Guy Kewney - a white , bearded technology expert - was astonished to see himself appear on screen as a black man with an apparent French accent .
He was even more shocked to see himself unable to answer basic questions about the legal battle between the Beatles ' Apple Corps and Apple Computer over the use of an apple symbol .

Mr Kewney , an IT journalist , watched as Mr Goma , whose identity remained a mystery until it was revealed on Monday night by the BBC , gamely attempted to answer questions fired at him by BBC consumer affairs correspondent Karen Bowerman .
Mr Goma , a graduate from the Congo , described his surprise interview ordeal as " very stressful " .
He found himself being ushered into a studio and fitted with a microphone after raising his hand when a producer called out the name Guy Kewney .
On his website , the real Mr Kewney , said that the man " seemed as baffled as I felt " when asked about the consequences of the lawsuit live on BBC News 24 .
It is unclear why Mr Goma identified himself when Mr Kewney 's named was called .
Only when Ms Bowerman announced live on air the name and title of the man who should have been there and asked the first question did the driver realise there had been a mix - up .
A BBC spokeswoman said : " Unfortunately we did make a mistake and the wrong person was interviewed briefly on air before we cut to our reporter .
" We apologise to viewers for any confusion . "
Read the transcript of the interview below ...

Face of horror
KB : Hello , good morning to you .
Mr Goma : Good morning .
KB : Were you surprised by this verdict today .
Mr Goma : I am very surprised to see ... this verdict to come on me because I was not expecting that .
When I came they told me somehting else and I am coming .
So a big surprise anyway .
KB : A big surprise , yeah , yes .
Mr Goma : Exactly .
KB : With regards to the costs involved do you think now more people will be downloading online ?
Mr Goma : Actually
If you can walk everywhere you are going to see a lot of people downloading the internet and the website and everything they want .
But I think eh
It is much better for development and eh to inform people what they want and to get the easy way and so faster if they are looking for .
KB : It does really seem the way the music industry 's progressing now that people want to go onto the website and download music .
Mr Goma : Exactly you can go everywhere on the cyber cafe and you can take , you can go easy .
It is going to be an easy way for everyone to get something to the internet
